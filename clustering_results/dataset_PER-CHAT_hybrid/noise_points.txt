5. exactly . once school ended i hung out with different people due to thankfully cut ties and am now actively included . it  s still taking a lot of getting used to digit . digit years later , but it  s good to feel wanted . honestly it they  re gonna be like that they can go f  ck themselves because that is not how you treat friends . the fact that you  re the  token girl  of the group makes that all the more inappropriate on their part . hope you find a really good close group of friends who fit the gap perfectly

17. one of my all time favorite things to do is my boyfriend and i go get digit digit  soft drinks at mcdonald ' s , then we hit up a thrift store and go window shopping  house planning at lowes ! i think allotting a max of digit  to each person and then going to play a bunch of crane machine games ! every night before bed i sit in the couch and hold my cat and sing to him and give him kisses . i think the idea that you can ' t platonically love and show affection to your friends . i always have , kiss your best friends damnit ! doesn ' t have to be weird . it is in july ! i ' ve never had mint ones , so i suppose fruity ? i digit  irrefutably , unequivocally , without a doubt in my mind believe that alternate dimensions exist and people can sometimes accidentally slip through the doorway and disappear . i would never !

18. well , you didn ' t add a " serious " tag , but i ' ll give you a serious answer anyway . i ' ve done a fair amount of research on this . all adults   the ones with the money   hate school fundraisers . the idea that gives you the absolutely best return is this  you send a note home at the beginning of the year explaining that you know everyone hates school fundraisers , and you are therefore going to dispense with that nonsense and instead request " direct giving " include an envelope . ask parents to donate the amount of money they would otherwise be wasting on wrapping paper , cookie dough , and other crap they only buy to placate their children . you will end up with substantially more money than if you actually sold the wrapping paper or cookie dough . if you ' re dead set on holding a fundraiser , try the " original art " one . find a company that prints original art on random things mousepads , t  shirts , coffee mugs and does school fundraisers . they will provide your school with all the materials . each kid draws a picture and then goes around to family  friends and tries to get them to buy a mousepad  t  shirt  coffee cup featuring their original art . it ' s still a terrible idea , but at least you get something your kid made instead of some awful cookie dough .

20. not me but the hubby . he was about digit at the time . he stayed over at a friend ' s house for the night . the next day he wanted a bottle of coke . instead of getting changed and walking to the shops , he decided , in his great wisdom to instead hop to the shop while still in his sleeping bag . the shopkeepers thankfully knew him so didn ' t say anything . the craziest thing about it was it would have been easier just go get changed and walk ! person  facepalming
