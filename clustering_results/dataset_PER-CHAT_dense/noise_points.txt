6. i found it when i became independent . everyone has their own way of finding their self worth that correlates with their personality , soul , etc . i don  t usually like to think that way , i like to think more like   with all my flaws my ups and downs , it makes me who i am and i love myself for it .  some albums  love yourself  answer , love yourself  tear , and you never walk alone are some albums i highly recommend .

8. work at a hotel on the beach . its a public beach , so i see all sorts of crowds , many not even our guests hanging out right in front of our property . well , as you can imagine , there ' s all types of massively overweight people who have no business trying to be in thongs or bikinis . yet , they ' ve falsely deluded themselves that they are hot stuff . no , they ' re not . also , while nudity is prohibited on our beach , many seem not to care , and do it anyway . in fact , i think there ' s a correlation between how large a person is and their brazenness to attempt to go nude . seeing digit pound plus people in the nude is disgusting and disturbing at the same time . nothing can unsee that .

11. after i saw the digit movie stand by me . and the scene with the leeches , i was deathly afraid of them . even more so because i ' m a guy . still the number one reason i don ' t swim in lakes . chance of a bacteria getting into your brain and killing you ? okay . leech sucking blood from your balls ? traumatize for life .

12. guess what , all that self consciousness and anxiety , is fear . you were finally picking yourself up from depression , doing something different , enjoying yourself . you deserve all of that . don ' t second guess yourself or psych yourself out . i ' ve done that my whole life and it has got me nowhere , until i realized that fear was the root of my problems . fear whispers lies in your ear that you ' re not good enough , or you can ' t do this right , that you ' re not smart enough , and so on . trust me when i tell you , that you are . you are stronger than you think . you picked yourself out of depression and got the ball rolling . so , that just shows you , that you are strong enough to get out of your depression and stay out . " you are far too smart to be the only thing standing in your way " one of my favorite quotes . it helped me through tough times , and i hope it does the same for you

15. no judgement here . i just posted my experience with an adverse med reaction and basically had the same line of thinking you ' re describing . it ' s unsettling has hell knowing your brain can actually think of things that you normally never would . best of luck moving forward !

17. just seems like a feature that has little to no disadvantages . it just seems better to have them than to not . the p  47n does has a different wing design so that may be why .

19. oh so that ' s what this is about . you are afraid trump votes will be in your country looking for free healthcare . no worry , it ' s the liberals that are looking for free care , not the gop . you guys are safe . also i disagree that people who can ' t afford their medication that are going to canada are looking for a better life . would you not agree ? so this is pretty much the same you just don ' t like the idea that you ' re acting the same as the american you hate so much .
