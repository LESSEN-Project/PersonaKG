3. there are many dialects of spanish , so a swearword in one place might be perfectly innocuous in another . example  " panocha " in most places means " brown sugar " , but in n mexico and the us it ' s a vulgar word for ladybits . another example  " pinga " in most places well , most places in the americas is a vulgarity for the penis . except in argentina , where it ' s a slang word for horse . causes the argentines no end of embarrassment . sigh where ' s reinhold aman when we really need him ?

9. i think you should stay with him as long as you love him and he loves you . its best to avoid the whole " i have my shit together and he doesn ' t " or who is " better " style of thinking . life goes on , people change , shit happens and you never know what they future holds , but if you are genuinely happy with someone who is happy with you isn ' t that all that matters ?

14. validation posts aren ' t allowed , but i think you need to hear this . your friend is a terrible and toxic person . it ' s not something you want to hear , but you have to . she is hypocritical , selfish , and rude . she is basically treating you like a punching bag . what i suggest you do is block her and never speak to her again . she sounds like she ' s a toxic and destructive person . i know you like her but it doesn ' t sound like she likes you . if you choose to stay in this friendship you ' ll only end up getting hurt by the person you care so much about . she does not deserve your kindness . i cannot tell you what to do because it isn ' t my place , but if i were in your position that attitude would not pass .
