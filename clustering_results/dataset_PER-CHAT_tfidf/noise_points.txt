3. here ' s the response to your argument . social media is using you . any amount of money you make on it can easily very very easily , in fact be made elsewhere . its true cost is every single ounce of your privacy . so the simple fact of getting off of it without being paid to do so is already enriching you . first by stopping the theft of your privacy and second by increasing the value of your privacy and information . then getting paid anything on top of that is a cherry on top . now you may argue that you don ' t care about your privacy , which is fine . that ' s the same thing an addict would say when confronted with all the negative things that their addiction brings to their life . the undisputable reality is that social media a is designed to be addictive b is built on a model of exploitation and c is completely superfluous , and the purported benefits are dubious and can be just as easily attained through less exploitative avenues .

8. i babysat full time for this one family and two of the kids were spoiled and continuously hit scratched and screamed when they didn ' t get what they wanted . mom was on my side thank god and disciplined them but they were a financially family so she did spoil them unintentionally .

9. little house on the prarie , andy griffith show , the waltons . just regular good ol lessons about life . how that you have to struggle and suffer through things sometimes and not have anyone to ' save ' you . and you learn to be a better person because of it .

10. not a worker , but the lady behind me got upset about the bill she got over  digit and thought that she could refund it by puking it up back on to her plate . she got even more upset when they wouldn ' t accept it , and started to trash everything ! of course , they had to call security to get her out . by far the weirdest , but funniest thing i ' ve ever seen !

11. i hate when people do this . just because you love and trust your dog does not mean everyone else does . the reality is that a loose dog running toward you or your children is frightening .

12. cybernazi . this isn  t a joke or a troll i actually recommend it . only way i know of to listen to it though is on youtube . also i think it  s us only . just search his name and his profile is the first result .

13. it would depend on how intense they are . most men that see an irregularly attractive woman would notice them and have feelings for them . that  s totally normal and there  s nothing wrong with that it  s when they act on those feelings that it  s a problem . no , i wouldn  t tell in that situation , but i would if they were more intense and i saw her everyday . i would tell her that i need to find a way to remove the temptation so i wouldn  t cheat , especially if the feelings are mutual between me and that woman . maybe my so could help me out or we could come up with a solution . i feel like i would be less likely to cheat after telling her about this , but some people  s so would take it the wrong way and get mad . idk if that answers your question .

14. that sort of scenario makes the most sense to me , i think the night king will fall but i think there just won  t be much left to rule in the south

15. One of my favorite things is writing.

16. in real life , yeah . but we ' re also talking about a card with no limit . i don ' t know if one of those really exists .

18. me and death used to be super close . did every thing together . then he tried to make a move on me and i was like " sorry i don ' t swing that way . " we drifted apart and i feel like an incomplete person without my best buddy death

19. we want to hear it so we can fix it or oh god not this again ! there ' s two types of managers and owners . sorry i don ' t have a better answer but that ' s just how it is ! i will say though that hilton holds a very high standard and that stuff will not fly for long . the next inspection they get will likely get those types of issues fixed . just always be kind when reporting issues like that . most times we would certainly want those things to not be issues but our hands are tied budget , staffing , time etc . trust me . our job is easiest and most fun when our guests are happy !

20. of course my argument makes sense so long as you think about it properly . the effective skill of your team lowers when someone is simply feeding , or their focus blinded by anger . getting tilted and becoming unable to play your best handicaps you and your team , effectively lowering the skill of that player .  and you can ' t control soccer or football in that regard because people who throw in those games get permanently banned from the league yeah , and the exact same thing happens in professional dota digit . another similarity between dota digit and football  soccer is that you don ' t get permanently banned from throwing games just by playing casual matches with randoms .
