          "so i don ' t have personal experience with this yet , but i have wanted to change my name for about digit years now . i ' m about to finish college and might be moving away soon , so now seems like a pretty good time to go through with it . anyway , to answer your questions  1a as far as i can tell , most places that require a formal change e . g . your job , bank accounts , ect . are able to easily change people ' s names in their system probably because of people changing their name when they get married so that should be fairly straightforward . some places  like banks  may require proof that the name change is legal , but just show them a copy of the deed poll . please note  i live in the uk  the rules might be different where you live . 1b i ' ve found it really helpful to talk to a friend about changing my name . i told a couple of friends , but we ' ve only spoken about it on skype , never face  to  face , but recently i ' ve been talking to one of my friends about it in real life , not online , and it ' s so affirming , if that makes sense . before , i felt like it was all in my head , but having someone to talk to about it and again i emphasise a face  to  face discussion makes it feel not  weird . she ' s even offered suggestions for me . digit as far as explaining it to people goes , i haven ' t really had to fully explain my reasons to anyone . none of my friends really asked why , or if they did , they were satisfied with the ' i just hate my name and i am able to change it , so why shouldn ' t i ? ' explanation . i plan on having different ' levels ' of explanation , depending on who asks . so the first level would be ' because i want to ' which would be for acquaintances and people i don ' t know very well . then ' growing up , i really didn ' t like my name . it caused me a lot of grief , and i decided to move away from that , ' for the next level , for people i know better , and then for people i know really well and trust , the last level would be the full story , which is quite long and this message is long enough as it is but i ' m happy to share if you ' re interested . digit in the dating world , if you ' ve never met them before , just introduce yourself with your new name . they won ' t know that you were ever called anything else . you can tell them about your name change in time , but there ' s no need to do it right away . digit i mean , there ' s no limit on the number of times you can change your name that i know of anyway but if you change it too often , i think people will stop taking it seriously , or just get mixed up with which name you have at any given time . once you have a good idea of the name you want to use , try introducing yourself with it online . if your username doesn ' t have any actual names in it like mine here then you can introduce yourself with a different name to each person if you want , and just see if one feels right . when you ' re comfortable with that , try using it as a username . i ' d recommend getting people to call you the new name socially before you legally change it , so you can get used to it , and it won ' t be too much of a hassle if you change your mind . lastly , i would like to add that you ' re not a fraud . it feels weird at first and lots of people who change their name feel as if they ' re lying when they use their new name . you ' re not . you ' re used to being called one thing and now you ' re answering to something different , and that takes time to get used to . don ' t let anyone make you feel bad about it .",
          "i think digit middle names is fine  i draw the line at digit . i think your partner ' s concerns about hurting feelings would be a bigger reason to reconsider . personally , namesakes are not my thing , but i get that they hold a lot of significance for other people . i would be cautious about using a living relative as a namesake if other people could get offended .",
          "a little bit of everything  fantasy , short stories , screenplays , romance  but it ' s mostly aimed at a ya audience . although lately i ' ve been questioning whether i should bother . i always struggle with motivation but i have a lot of ideas that i need to get out . did you ever experience anything like that ?"

          "could not agree more ! both yelp and tripadvisor are driving me nuts with this photos and reviews thing . maybe apple can implement a system where it controls and presents its own photos  reviews whereby third parties then fill in for missing data and countries not served ? i suspect these things will come in time , including the ones you mentioned , though apple  s methodically iterative approach sometimes does take more than a while .",
          "ok that  s actually pretty great the , means they  re integrating more and more sources . i hope they will enable linking up of various national transports to make cross border trips much easier too . maybe they feel they  ve already covered the majority of the terrain they needed to ? i  d say there  s also the issue with some transit providers simply not having any api integration . on another note , have you seen anyone take advantage of the maps extensions much yet ? i know uber was there and then they removed themselves and opentable can book tables with yelp having some integration too .",
          "nice list though duplicating some of the requests earlier to the normal maps app . i  m sure if they bring them then they  ll bring it to both this one and the maps app . on another note , i recently submitted most of this feedback to not just the apple feedback site , but also to eddy cue as he  s the svp of maps among many other things . you might wanna do so too so it likely gets better prioritized as imho few from the teams read our postings here .",
          "lol , if you go to the airpods in settings themselves , the a2x models are always 2nd gen , a16x are the old generation . i was myself confused by this too until i checked apple  s website . here in asia , everyone is wearing them and talking to them all the time , not awkward to do likewise at all . did you try talking louder and in continuous voice without too much background noise ? that almost always works for me . if it still doesn  t work , make sure to try to retrain her voice or resetting the id . just by getting into the habit of offloading some of the repetitive tasks to her you  ll def prepare yourself for ios digit and shortcuts automations which i  m sure will become super handy . the user guide in apple books also has some useful tips . don  t give up and keep trying , hope it works out for you as for me it  s been great so far ! smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes",
          "agreed ! how  s the performance on other browsers ? is the api flexible enough to  recreate  apple maps but in the browser or is it restricted to being the backend ? i know with duckduckgo i provided some feedback including poor search results and lack of mouse scrolling , the latter of which they  ve added . also , do you have to pay the annual  digit fee to get access to the api key ? hopefully wwdc will provide more answers .",
          "it really makes customer support queries much faster . i find it way more useful than some of the banking apps i use , because all the text and information is automatically saved . you don  t have to go back and forth with different systems and phone numbers and juggle all the information as it  s all there .",
          "maybe they didn  t get around to it yet ? you can also notice some states are mentioned twice or more so it  s pretty much incomplete and i assume will expand greatly prior to end of digit as stated in the keynote .",
          "what are they saying ? are they staging this for  applelookaround ?",
          "i guess it really depends on the location . some places may be way worse and others way better . best we can hope for is swift rollout of the new maps ."

          "she is violating the child ' s body by having it torn up and sucked out of her . she is using the child ' s life as a sacrifice to her convenience . yes , slavery is always wrong . in a perfect world this wouldn ' t be a problem in the first place . but in the real world i choose the lesser of two evils . taking an innocent life to prevent your own suffering is wrong . please be intellectually honest and stop using the fringe cases as an excuse to justify the common occurrence . they are definitely worth considering , but even if they were justifiable , it doesn ' t mean the others are . i am pretty sure i have heard every reason that pro  choice advocates have for abortion . and so far , they don ' t change what i see as a very simple truth . it is always morally wrong to take an innocent human life . and , though you are free to disagree with my view on morality , i can ' t think of anything worse that one person could do to another . saving innocent life  saving bodily autonomy .",
          "i think that unborn children should also have bodily autonomy . i use the scientific definition of life , which does begin at conception . the resulting embryo has dna independent from it ' s parents . it ' s a unique , human life . i would say that life is the most important right . freedom as opposed to slavery is highly important , but you cannot have freedom if you are not alive . therefore both killing of the innocent and slavery should not be allowed by a moral people . additionally , i would like to say that the parents of a fetus have already made choices leading to the resulting baby . i think you should be responsible for your actions . if you don ' t want a baby , either don ' t have sex , or use contraceptives . then the whole issue can be avoided in the first place .",
          "simple logic of my sense of morality . it is always wrong to take innocent human life . anyone who is not a monster agrees with that statement alone . pro  abortion people will then complicate that simple moral logic , usually by pointing out the evils that may be prevented by terminating the life of the child . but those evils are never greater than the taking of innocent human life .",
          "i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .",
          "true love is the point where you make the decision that you will care for someone  something so much , that no matter the circumstances , you will even go as far as to sacrifice of yourself for that person  thing .",
          "it loses it ' s bodily autonomy when it loses it ' s body . who are you to decide who ' s life is worth living ? i don ' t want women to have to suffer through an unwanted pregnancy . but i have to go with the lesser of two evils . here ' s a hypothetical thought experiment . you enter a room with a man and a baby . then the man pulls out a gun . he tells you that one of two things will happen . either you will go to prison for nine months , or he will shoot the baby in the face . what do you choose ? you could decide that you should not be imprisoned for the sake of someone else . why should it be your responsibility ? but i think it is clear that the morally right thing to do is to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves . even if you have to sacrifice of yourself for that person . i think a truly good person would willingly put their life at risk for an innocent human life .",
          "if i woke up and found out i was sustaining your life because it would be the right thing to do . people have many rights to do wrong things , but it doesn ' t change the fact that it is wrong . having a right does not morally justify every circumstance . and there is a difference between action and inaction . taking an action to end innocent human life is always murder .",
          "regardless , for me it is a very simple moral logic . saving innocent life  saving bodily autonomy . i want to choose lesser of two evils . and that is why i am pro  life .",
          "you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .",
          "rifle training was once taught in school . they even had competitive shooting teams . firearms in america have been part of ordinary life for a long time . it is only recently that mass shootings have become a problem . the number of shootings is increasing , while the number of gun owners is going down . this suggests that guns are not the problem . so , what is the problem ? what changed ? is it a breakdown of family values ? or that we no longer teach civic duty and citizenship ? is society encouraging a sense of hopelessness , futility , and cynicism to the point that we devalue human life ? i don ' t really know what the answer is , but it appears that there is too much fighting for enough people to think about what it might be , in order to make a change ."
