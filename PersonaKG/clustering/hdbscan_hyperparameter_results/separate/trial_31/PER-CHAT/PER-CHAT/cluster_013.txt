20. first off , i like the thinking behind this and it was really well thought out . however i think i  d have to disagree with this . i feel like euphoria is trying to be as original as it can . they make it like no other show that i know of , and i feel like they are creating their own plot . but if this is some version of romeo and juliet , i wouldn  t necessarily be mad about itexcept for the fact that fez would die plz no .
