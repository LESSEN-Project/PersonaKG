7. even as a bucket list , they literally have about at least digit ish months to figure out a situation for their kids or even longer since returning attendees get their tickets in november so in my opinion there is no excuse honestly . i mean i understand if they only have like one day to figure it out  they don ' t want to miss the event that badly but several months ahead ? come on .

8. you ' d be surprised the amount of men that know the general area but constantly meander off during the . pleasuring ? and have to have their hands guided . not that big of a deal , but also not out of the question for women to exaggerate  fake pleasure . mostly true with young  insecure girls who feel too awkward to speak up .

9. i have to ask you why you don ' t look this up yourself ? you have to be on the internet to type and submit your comment so why not just do a quick google search ? one of the biggest problems in this country is that a lot of people do not research anything themselves . they simply wait for someone to present information to them . when they don ' t like the information they hear , even if it is true , they dismiss it and when they hear information they do like they accept it even if it is false . it ' s absolutely ridiculous how easily manipulated people can be .

11. i really fight not to feel lonely in the fandom , but regardless of reaching out to people , joining websites , going to fur meets , chatting online , being in a bigger city , writing , drawing , etc . i still feel pretty lonely . regardless of the fandom being a community , it is still a community of human beings , and just like there are lonely people in the real world , there are going to be lonely people in the fandom .

14. england are very good at starting things , bands , tv shows , arguments , wars etc and brits have a unique way of doing things which seems to work . maybe it  s our personality , humour , mindset who knows but you can  t deny that a lot of good comes out of it .

15. if it  s really bad you should try to find a tutor or a study group to keep you motivated to complete your assignments on time . it  s easier when other people expect something from you rather than just yourself

17. interesting . but i think the ' exposing to everyone ' sounds like kind of a mean threat that would cause more drama . but i wouldn ' t know .

18. his greatest song is let it be . i don  t know how you could think that it would be rocky raccoon . whenever that song comes on , i run across my room and throw my record player out of my window .

19. talking it is not the same thing as complaining . discussion is not the same as whining . when you complain you want sympathy or agreement that you ' ve been hard done by . you should look at the past to avoid making the same mistakes , you should not look at the past and feel bad about the present . rather you should look to the present and see the mistakes still being made that need to be fixed and put your focus there . you can say it shaped their lives it did . but they still wouldn ' t exist otherwise . a shitty life is better than no life .
