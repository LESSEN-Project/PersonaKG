1. they wouldn  t pay you that much if what you  re doing isn  t more valuable than what they  re paying you

2. reddit has some crazy idea that all lobbyists are just running around with briefcases full of bribe money and buying votes . while it is true that some corruption exists , there are tons of legitimate lobbyists out there doing good work . how do you expect all the senators , and representatives and other government officials to learn about issues ? lets say we want more solar power . we can all post on our representative ' s facebook page saying " yay solar " and linking to random websites with statistics that say solar power is great , but that will just get lost in the other pile of every other person ranting about what they want . now lets say that people pool their money and hire someone who has an intimate knowledge of the cost  benefit of solar power and can not only put together a persuasive and concise report , but can answer any questions on the spot that may come up . that person can do more in digit meeting to inform a representative on the issue than digit , digit people ranting online and writing letters could ever hope to do . lobbyists can do great work and i know multiple people who work as lobbyists in multiple fields , many for non  profit companies , and none of them are dropping off briefcases full of cash . if you want to ban every profession that has corrupt individuals in it , lets go ahead and ban all cops , teachers , doctors , accountants , realtors , nannies , waiters , and pretty much every profession , because there isn ' t a single profession out there that is free of corruption . how many people do you think would be cops , doctors , and teachers for free ? and do you really think that would increase the quality of work from that profession ? if lobbyists are really corrupt , do you think that having them not be officially paid is really going to stop them ? how about instead of making a crazy statement like banning a paid profession , we simply enforce the laws we have regarding government officials taking bribes ?

3. if you ' re good at it or have an interest . i found a job where i laugh every day and love what i do . could have made a lot more elsewhere but that is my measure for success .

4. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .

5. if you think that way you  ll never make money .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

6. i just want to work on developing strategies that make money . focusing on development and especially ai and ml . it seems like the closest thing to a well paid " problem solver " , plus the feeling that i could " create " money for myself was something i ' ve never felt before and feel regardless of what happens in life , as long as there are markets , you could be somewhat self sufficient . not sure what role that would be called though , they seem to go under many names or none at all . i just want to prepare myself to " get in " to any position to start .

7. no , not just free stuff . you want to force the wealthy to work for free for you .

8. telemarketer . if they can sell well , it would be pretty simple to have a low level secretary scan the approved calls and type out the critical information . consulting , if they have extensive previous experience in a field , reviewing projects can be quite valuable . public speaking . people will hire him to talk about how he overcame is hardship even though he only overcame it because people are willing to pay to see him talk about overcoming it . kind of a self fulfilling prophecy all for the entertainment of others by capitalizing on his disability . basically a modern day freak show with better pay , to put it in less politically correct terms i am sure there are other jobs that can be handled depending on exactly his level of disability . does he have any slight motion in extremities ? has he learned any systems for people with his disability like eye tracking or other controls like head or breathing based or speech based computer controls ?

9. well that just sounds lazy to me . is that the only reason people want illegals is so we don  t have to do the jobs nobody wants to do ? what job could be so terrible that somebody wouldn  t take it ?
   (ID: 89a759866debf6704efa0f603c1b9c4476abd731)

10. tax cuts should be used as a reward for the ' job creators ' who do their fucking job . i don ' t see any around these days .
