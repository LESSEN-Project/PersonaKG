Total from this dataset: 8

1. i cut my own hair . but if rather have a woman do it . total stereotype here , but i think they do a better job .
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

2. maybe it ' s just me but i don ' t think i ' ve ever really been around people who really care that much about how others get their rocks off , and i ' ve lived in three different countries all over the world . sure , people might crack a joke or tease someone for it , but i don ' t think anyone really cares any more than they would if they found out about any other fetish . it ' s simply a non  issue . that ' s why the parades  culture thing feels so bizarre to me . it ' s as if they are deliberately attracting attention and criticism by shouting about something that the general public couldn ' t care less about .

3. why do you feel like you have to defend that activity ? you do understand that for most people , this looks strange , right ?

4. i ' m talking about people who aren ' t being harmful to anyone at pride . the man pictured above is just trying to participate in pride like a normal human being . whatever his job is shouldn ' t matterunless it was meant to cause harm , which it isn ' t . he just wants to have fun and celebrate pride month with his fellow gays . by commenting this it seems like you want to keep this gay man from being happy , and that is homophobic . good day .

5. tending to attract attention    doing it for attention . i  m saying you are wrong because you are unilaterally defining motives for a large group of individuals without actually providing evidence other than  well i can  t think of another reason  . you are the one who made the claim that all flamboyance is for attention , you need to defend it . also , your definition of flamboyance doesn  t even serve your point . nowhere there does it talk about loudly talking about their sexual encounters . my reason for pushing he idea that is that , because you seem to be ignoring the fact that straight people literally do just as much as  flamboyant  gay guys . if your issue with it isn  t that they are gay , you need to have an issue with anyone talking about their sex lives loudly which again , straight people do not just people who are flamboyant . my point is , if people  s private conversations bother you , no matter how loud they are , don  t listen to it . whether they  re gay or straight , or male or female . it  s not a personal problem for all straight people , it  s an issue you personally seem to have . it  s also not really a double standard because loudly yelling about your sex life , regardless of sexual orientation , in a workplace is frowned upon . like i  ve said , you don  t seem to have an issue with the fact that , whether you care to admit it or not , straight people do the same thing as well , so yea , right now it does sound like your issue is with gay people .

6. why ? because all men must be manly ? again , it  s because you don  t like it that it is a problem . not a problem for the guy wearing the make up because he likes it . also , i don  t count restaurant staff as role models for my children . i am their role model , and i will explain to them time and time again that people can express who they are , even if we don  t find it  normal  or  cool  .
   (ID: c28c39847d1ec88851aadf063f6e8baf4594b35c)

7. when a guy let  s a girl dress him up and put make up on him to impress a girl . if it  s who you are , ok more power to you . but if you let someone change who you are just to impress them , wack .
   (ID: b3497f72ed4462f0414951db6d9ee7aa4004b515)

8. i see that , but it  s still the fact of if someone doesn  t want to see it , why would you do it there ? just like there are toilets , there are also breast pumps or you could just do it at home . i would completely be alright if it were at home with friends over , but when it is random strangers , just be used you have a child doesn  t mean you get to expose yourself for your convenience
