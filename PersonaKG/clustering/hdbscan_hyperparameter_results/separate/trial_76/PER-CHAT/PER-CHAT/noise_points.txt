3. as someone else said , you need to go with it . two ways to do it  have a comeback . you said you ' re not good at it , but keep trying to think of some even after the fact . if they ' re falling into patterns with what they ' re saying , you should be able to use one of those . build off one of their digs and take what they said one step further . part of this might all be part of being low man on the totem pole , but you want to show you have some edge so you ' re not always that guy . good luck op .

15. i feel like that might have to do with the quality  nachos arent a gourmet food , but i feel like if you were to try making them at home the meat would certainly be better than most anywhere that serves nachos stadiums , arenas if you still enjoy soggy , meatless nachos after accounting for ingredients . then thats cool , healthier too

17. not american either , and sure , sanders would have been a better option than any other candidate . as far as unemployment , i will admit i have not seen data about it however , i seriously doubt it ' s been lowered significantly without useless spending from the government . i personally don ' t see a problem with oppressing people who have done bad things before or believe in white supremacy . not sure what is the other type of oppression you mean . why do you believe people should own firearms ? do you seriously not believe there is danger associated with that ? what is this islam problem you are talking about exactly ? if it ' s extremism , it ' s really not exclusive to crazy people with islamic beliefs . this problem is due to mentally unstable people misinterpreting their religion and brainwashing uneducated people . have you ever had a real conversation with a muslim ? what is your honest opinion about how sweden should be handling muslim immigrants ? last thing , do you not see any problem with blatant lying to the press and population ?

19. acts digit  digit  digit  digit the next day , as they were on their journey and coming near the city , peter went up on the housetop to pray , about the sixth hour . digit and he became hungry and desired something to eat  but while they were preparing it , he fell into a trance digit and saw the heaven opened , and something descending , like a great sheet , let down by four corners upon the earth . digit in it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air . digit and there came a voice to him ,  rise , peter  kill and eat .  digit but peter said ,  no , lord  for i have never eaten anything that is common or unclean .  digit and the voice came to him again a second time ,  what god has cleansed , you must not call common .  digit this happened three times , and the thing was taken up at once to heaven . matthew digit  digit  digit , digit  digit  digit and he called the people to him and said to them ,  hear and understand  digit not what goes into the mouth defiles a man , but what comes out of the mouth , this defiles a man .  digit and he said ,  are you also still without understanding ? digit do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach , and so passes on ? digit but what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart , and this defiles a man . digit for out of the heart come evil thoughts , murder , adultery , fornication , theft , false witness , slander . digit these are what defile a man  but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man .
