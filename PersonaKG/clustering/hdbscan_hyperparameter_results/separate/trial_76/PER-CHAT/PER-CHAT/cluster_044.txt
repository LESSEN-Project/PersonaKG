1. you get to be a ghost for a while , then its lights out . but i only believe this because i find it comforting to believe there ' s something non  permanent after death .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

2. it ' s the end of the world as we know it .
   (ID: d8b92be4e0b1e639cde4ac3fc3f079b296813fc5)

3. what is the otherworldly feeling like , if you describe it better for us ?
   (ID: e871625874733300de2a83384cee8c72546d3ec6)

4. it ' s you and whatever you can ' t see in a state where nothing can be seen
   (ID: 2db14c004e6ef125f85aa3678978a5718eebd11a)

5. i get stuck in a place with no dimensions , it  s just darkness around me . i can see things , but can  t tell how far away they are because i have no frame of reference for their size . it  s really hard to explain . it  s almost like floating , but i have a feeling of being heavy , almost weighed down by something . i guess the best way to explain it would be emptiness , with an occasional object in the distance ?

6. possibility that this is best time humanity is living in and after this we are all going down .
   (ID: a168763c82b90dc18ccbbd57533eec2e49d17dc7)

7. because we live here , this universe . still so much unknown .
   (ID: d42f47f147cdc8e97117f0e4963e2c1309d1dcd8)

8. surely there ' s comfort in knowing there ' s absolutely nothing you can do about the eventual heat death of the universe . it ' s out of your control so just let it be . you don ' t know that this universe doesn ' t collapse down to a single point and birth anew with another big bang . either way i ' ll be long dead so it matters not
   (ID: e982e025c0604997a6e2072eb87b9bb01bed38ae)

9. heaven is everything you ever wanted , a feeling of contentment . hell is all your worst nightmares and fears replaying over and over again for eternity . essentially brazil with more lava and less palm trees .
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

10. remember how it was before you were born ? me neither . and that ' s the way it will be when we are gone . same exact state . there are many questions we will never know the answer to but it ' s best to concentrate on what we know and what we have  enjoy your life and be good to your fellow humans .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

11. digit weeks ago i got cross faded and became unresponsive . i entered what we dubbed  the abyss  and it was the scariest place  feeling i have ever experienced . it was basically like the place in get out or like being in a dark closet where you can hear everything but cant move or speak .
   (ID: c374848a7cde05ee9d6d14f7ab991b3b11f71a87)

12. after personally experiencing dmt , i am very convinced that there is an afterlife . when you are at this place , you have memories of before you were a human . try to take back those memories with you is like forgetting a dream .
   (ID: 4a5a9ac8eab027b38804427b3c8c5e19c8991de3)

13. i would like to think that certain future events could be dreamt about occasionally . but that ' s a different story . i think that this time it is more likely subconscious thing . there is stuff bothering me . either that or i was visited by an evil entity at least i go to heaven ? lol .
   (ID: 7a3a98777bf2cebb6bd14409075a19b82035e535)

14. those " alternate life  dimension  reality " dreams always just feel like the " regular life " , but . enhanced . let ' s say everything smells and sounds more accurate , more intense . no unusual sounds or smells whatsoever . on another note , i can ' t recall what specifically happened in them , but i do remember they ' re some sort of " alternate dimensions " , where i made different choices or some things directly concerning me went a different way . e . g i ' m a drug dealer in some slums . when i wake up from them , i don ' t feel my body at all  i don ' t feel anything , i just see . i slowly open my eyes , and i ' m unable to recognize where i am , feeling like i ' ve been moved somewhere else , while it ' s just my regular , real  life bedroom . it takes me a good couple of minutes to realize i ' m conscious and awake in reality . what intrigues me the most about this is that maybe death is just a transition to another reality . i don ' t know . sorry for the poor grammar . it ' s pretty difficult to put this in words .
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

15. i think death is a state which alters our consciousness to the same form of life in an other parallel universe . so that we can live better and evolve . inspired from time is a flat circle !
