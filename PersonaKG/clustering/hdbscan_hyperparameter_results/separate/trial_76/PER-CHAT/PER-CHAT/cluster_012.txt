1. wouldn  t the accounts receivable of banks be completely thrown off though ? the banks would simply be wrecked financially and the federal reserve requirement eventually . someone would make money off of the hedging the risk but i would think that ultimately banks would lose millions if not billions in accounts receivable . hell if it actually happened i don  t think the us would have serious consequences . i think it could happen if everyone started to default on there loans alone .

2. yeah i ' m with you . it ' s hard to imagine that ' s what bernie ' d do with it . i guess if i can trust him to be president i can trust him to do the right thing with a few thousand bucks or whatever though .

3. i work in product development and while i haven ' t had any moral dilemmas nearly as big as these , there are often issues to consider . what if i can design a better widget , but our factory can ' t produce it so we would have to outsource it ? consumer gets a better product , profit margin might even be higher , but we decrease internal production and hurt other employees . it is kind of funny how the phrasing of this could cause reddit to hate or love it . stifling innovation seems to clearly be a bad thing , but there is tons of hate when people hear about companies that close their factories and produce goods elsewhere . if your new product is different enough , it is possible that the current factory can ' t be modified to produce it without basically gutting the whole place . even then your workforce has no experience producing the new item , so if you want good quality right away , outsourcing the manufacturing of the new design is the only viable solution .

4. disagree  i think if there is profit to be made then digging in old landfills , dredging the ocean or mining asteroids in space  these elements will be recycled and re  purposed .

5. no i honestly think it ' s a good idea ! how am i so off base on this ? yes power banks exist , yes solar chargers exist but if you dont have any other options in the moment this could be a super convenient thing to be able to go and buy . jesus by all the downvotes and sassy comments i ' m getting your think i ' m advocating the clubbing of baby seals or something

6. you know what would happen you said to all of the billionaires " hey big bank account boys i ' m going to need to you to hand over everything you have so that overall you ' re only able to be worth digit million dollars " they would say " alright let me just get that to you right after i move all of my assets to another country that ' s not going to steal my money and possessions that i earned , oh wait a minute now that i have my assets and myself out of the country you cant tax me and you ' re now losing millions in tax revenue "

7. as much as this would be great , it  s still a lot of money . as if we already don  t get robbed every paycheck anyways yknow ? granted there are things our taxes go to that , aren  t really beneficial . but it  d be a rough time i think . what about you ?
