3. nah man , even if you put the scenes in chronological order it still has no plot . i  ve tried to appreciate the movie , but nothing happens . compared to other tarantino movies , even ones light on story like kill bill , it doesn  t hold up .

5. the title would probably be called , " slice of light . " the plot o my movie would probably just be the story of my life , focusing on minor issues with my life like failing a test . i would probably be narrating over different parts of the story , similar to tfs ' story of trunks . it would probably have some parts very brief , the parts that i dont remember very well , and the vivid memories would be very detailed and exaggerated . an example of this would be when my parents told me that we were bnb going to move . it would end with the present  me on winter break with my family , in the eighth grade .
