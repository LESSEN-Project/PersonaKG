3. i have to agree with regenboog as you progress through your transition you will feel more comfortable with yourself and your femininity will come through nauturally . clothes are a different matter , if you are pre hrt , its really about how confident you are .

4. tough to say for sure . could be bi , or just genuinely curious . also sounds like you ' ve got some underlying fluidity to your gender identity or expression that warrants some exploration . you ' re asking questions only you can really answer purple  heart

5. i agree with this . it is impossible to tell someone how they should feel about themselves . but for whatever it ' s worth let me say i imagine you make most men horny . i hope you get what you need from the labiaplasty .

6. that sounds like it could be a feminization kink . if these fantasies are just about the bedroom then it sounds like you just have a kink . but for some people they find out they want to live full time as a woman through fetish crossdressing . i guess what i ' m saying is  it ' s totally possible you have a feminization fetish but it ' s also possible you could have other factors that lean you more towards being trans . being trans is more about the day to day life and how you and the world around you perceives you .

7. it sounds pretty conflicted to me , it felt wrong to discuss your feminine side but equally you hated some masculine traits . right now that doesnt make you either or and thats okay if you can put your hatred for your male traits in context to feeling more feminine then potentially it might be some dysphoria , then again you might hate big feet because you can never buy the right shoes . i think you have some more self exploring to do , to see whether you are really comfortable with the idea of being feminine  female , when you do you will notice any big red giant flags saying " wrong " or maybe like me you will not .

8. all of these people here saying you should give it a try or that you ' re being a dick are wrong . if you aren ' t comfortable with it , that isn ' t bad , it doesn ' t make you a shit person . straight up , being a furry is weird . it really is . it ' s someone dressing up as an animal in weird cartoon like suits , most often for a sexual purpose . people dressing up in animal costumes for sex is not normal , and is likely certainly a mental issue . i mean no offense to your gf , but really . don ' t do anything you aren ' t comfortable with . don ' t indulge in this bc if you do it ' ll make you crazy . literally . i mean like it ' ll cause you to go crazy  in case the meaning was unclear also , i think you may need to seriously think about breaking up with her . i know that ' s not a desirable outcome , and that you love her , but i think that truly is something that is digit  a deal breaker in a relationship . unless you can think of some way you both can be satisfied perhaps open the relationship ? i know that ' s mostly never desirable for a lot of ppl but idk it could help if you just wanna stay with her . i have a problem in my relationship issue in the same vein , not specifically about being a furry but still a fetish thing which has some parts i ' m not entirely comfortable with . i am trying to find a way to deal with that myself . it is incredibly hard even in a partial , lesser way . i ' m sorry , i can ' t imagine how you feel .

9. hey guys , great place you ' ve got here . something struck me , and i decided i need to go ahead and grow out what i can and see where it goes . most times i ' ve had some degree of facial hair , but anything of beard caliber seemed a far off dream . then i figured , " why not " any tips ? also , and this may be an odd question . based on what you guys see here , could you link me to a picture of a beard that looks similar to how you ' d anticipate mine coming in ? just figuring since you ' ve guys seen many beards start off here , you can kind of read where it may go to a degree . edit  my plan is to let it grow at least one month , sept . 1st .

10. i think you ' re good as you are . never listen to these negative people , just ignore them . your hair looks pretty nurtured  normal , and your breasts might be smaller but that is completely okay , there is nothing wrong with you ma ' am !

11. while i wait to see an endo about finasteride , im just letting mine grow its a bit thin on top but digit  digit  minoxdil seeme to be helping , get some hair thickening shampoo too . i use fixing gel  putty to style it which is simply brushed back , it keeps it all in place and stops it from look untidy . i would not cut your hair to be honest .
