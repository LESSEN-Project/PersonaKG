1. beyond how much money you need , there are some other things to think about . furniture  don  t try to move furniture across the country . look for a furnished place to rent  first , or better yet , stay with family at 1st . you  re barely going to be there anyways . clothes  take your favorite outfits , and enough to get through about a month without washing clothes . you aren  t going to have time . your favorites just because i already know that while you won  t wear them again , you aren  t ready to get rid of them just yet . stuff  ditch it , unless it  s something you want to save forever . money  not enough information in your post . are you looking to get your own place when you get there , or can you crash at family  friends house for a few months ? you  re going to make more money than you have time to spend once you get started . you  ll be able to get a really nice place in just a few months , but you won  t be there much .

2. every job will do , as long as you adjust your living standards . i don ' t want to argue that living coast are way to high in the last few years . and that mini jobbers don ' t get paid enough , is also true . but thats how things are at the moment , so you have to adjust . at most places your job you doing besides beeing in school won ' t pay you an own apartment . the higher the coasts of living are in a city , the more you have to find things to cut out . get a roommate , maybe even more . just buy cheap foods that are on discount and stock them . use a bike if possible instead of public transport quit your gym and start bodyweight training shorten your shower times buy everything possible used . sadly a lot of students have to work a lot , while also balancing school life , without a fair payment . so you will just need to be really lucky with your job or you have to really cut back in your living standarts for a few years . maybe even share a room and give up your privacy . i don ' t wanna get into finding somebody helping you out with money , you probably wouldn ' t have asked if this possibility exists . hopefully we students use this unfairness as motivation to make it possible for the next generation to have a healthy work school balance and getting a fair payment .

3. please note  i am sorry if i sound ridiculous or well off the mark . i ' m from nrth qld , and have no real sense of what the city of adelaide is like . i am happy to not live near the heart of the city , so long as my labouring  standard job type partner can work close enough to the home , there is a nice school in the area , and there would be a doctor or hospital close enough if one of us or my kids needed emergency care . also being from the north , our threat is cyclones so i would be clueless and terrified in a fire . so i would not be the best to live in the middle of a fire threat zone etc . thanks for being patient and i do google earth the area a lot . i like the look of the suburbs in the area i circled but i ' m not sure if they are actually suburbs or if they are small communities considered " way out .

4. if the foundations of your house crumbled , would you just say  fuck it  and remain there ? if you live a while away from the jobs , borrow the money to buy a secondhand bicycle and ride it to the nearest town , and to see your friends . the littlest steps are often the biggest . you  ll get there , i know it  s difficult , but you can get it .

5. life is also a game of chance . everyone can do okay but not everyone is going to enjoy life and as far as i can see it most people simply deal with what they have , it often doesn ' t get better because there isn ' t equal opportunity , people just learn to deal with their lot in life , taking things slower than those with money etc . also your parents choices are not your choices so that is bad comment yea life requires struggle but how exactly is dumping struggling people onto the street so they can ' t even look presentable enough to go for jobs in the first place going to help ? you need money to make money , even if it ' s just getting a cashier job or something , you need to be in a place where employers would actually want you .

6. there are many alternatives to driving , and to say you can ' t afford not to drive is ridiculous unless you live outside of the city or the commute is immensely far .   x200b  biking is a great alternative , you will have to leave home a bit earlier but you can avoid the traffic so in some casesdepending on where you live it can save you quite a bit of time . obviously you need to take conditions into account but there are many snow rated bikes and clothing that people take advantage of .   x200b  public transportation is in every city and whether it be a bus or train there is a way to get from one end of the city to the next . i know it ' s easier said than done but if you can wake up a bit earlier it can save you the headache of totaling your vehicle .   x200b  again , depending on where you live there are many transportation apps like uber that are fairly reasonable and even if you just need them to get you over a certain bridge or past a certain point and you can walk the rest of the way is great .   x200b
