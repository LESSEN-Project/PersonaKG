4. oh , we ' re talking about cops ? once in high school , this convenience store owner called the police because my friend and i were smoking weed behind his store out of the way , out by a tree , not even on his pavement . cops show up , we toss the joint , and they want to get us in trouble but can ' t really do much without evidence of actual weed . so they start looking for the joint and my stoned friend bends over to help and one of the cops literally pushes him away . never forgot that for some reason . it was such a hard shove and the friend was really just trying to find the joint to help these cops get him in trouble , lol .

16. no , i never told anybody . it ' s hard to explain , but i just can ' t get it out of me . i was afraid for so long that i would be judged , or that people would " feel bad for me " . i know what happened was horrible , but i ' m in a good place now . i don ' t want unlock that part of my memory for someone else to see , if that makes sense .
   (ID: 011a531fc3f706d76441a0f95cc8091fd4453dd8)

17. not sure if this counts but i was out walking my dog in the when i come across one of my classmates tied to a tree , unconscious and severely dehydrated , apparently some other class mates mugged him , beat the hell out of him and dragged him into the woods , naturally i untied him and explained what i knew to the police and i know very little after that , the two thugs and the victim did not come back to school and the teachers did explained the circumstances , i was never called as a witness , my guess is they plead guilty to whatever charges or because they were minors got a slap on the wrist with a new identity , apparently the victim did recover physically but lord knows what going through that really does to you .
