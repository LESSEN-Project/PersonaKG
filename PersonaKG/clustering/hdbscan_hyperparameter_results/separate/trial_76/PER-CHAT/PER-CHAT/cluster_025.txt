1. never remembering names , just because it sucks to ask someone what their name is repeatedly

2. i was working a food line by myself , and we got a rush of like 9ish small groups , and in the middle of me running around trying to make everything , a woman came up to the counter complaining that i didn ' t cut the crusts off of her son ' s sandwich . if that had been instructed , i would have done so , but i wasn ' t informed that she wanted that , and i was busy as all hell . the dark part of me wanted to hurl a knife at her and yell " do it yourself bitch " but i just asked to wait a few minutes , and i would give her a free sandwich , without the crusts . thankfully she shut up after that , but fuck , i wanted to yell at her .

3. nta just because they ' re customers doesn ' t mean they have a right to treat you like that . if there were some foul language then yes , yta but from the sound of it you were justified , in my opinion .

4. when people tell me not to worry about my flatulence problem . it ' s like they honestly don ' t realise that it ' s not actually a problem , i ' m deliberately doing them so that if i manage to shit myself i can just got home from work and take a few days off for emotional reasons .

5. the company i work for pays us to go volunteer a few times a year with a food bank we work closely with and donate to and what not . the fuckin nerve of some people that come in there is unreal . you have the super nice and just down on their luck people that are super appreciative for anything you give them , and for helping load it into their cars and what not , then you get the giant pricks who make you put digit bags into their brand new car , then when you get there they open up the bags and start taking out vegetables and whatever else they dont want and demand you bring them back inside and give them extra cake or sweets , or whatever they choose then flip out when you tell them that ' s not really how it works .

6. okay so this comment is a little different than the answer your looking for but it kind of fits . i worked at a resturaunt as a server and had a manager who was really mean all the time and had such an attitude problem . she would piss off the guests in my section often and let them leave pissed off to write a bad review , on numerous occasions . she would shoulder check me and make fun of me in front of people and yell at me on the floor for something that wasn ' t done by me , wasn ' t even in my section and had literally nothing to do with me . and she has left me in tears often because of how badly she treated me . she also made a lot of really horrible calls like choosing to not tell me about guests special requests and letting them get mad at me for not being prepped on how they prefer things . they ' re rich assholes and prefer their experiences where they don ' t have to communicate the way they want things . which is completely opposite of how we treat the normal guests . but i wouldn ' t know that unless she taught me that . so she ' s made me look like an idiot on a couple of occasions . one night it was really busy and the sushi chef was behind so i had to wait a really long time for a roll for an appetizer . this table was very high maintenanced and picky so they were pissed . i asked the manager to move it along and talk to the table and she ignored me . finally i talk to the sushi chef he usually prefers no contact and i find out that the lines i put in on the computer to distinguish between apps and entrees just didn ' t show up . so i draw them on the paper and ask him for the roll asap . the manager should have been doing this because i needed to get to my tables and run my food . then i tell the manager about the problem with the specific computer and how it has been giving me trouble again . it happened at random since the very beginning of me working there . she gave me a horrible response about how there ' s nothing she can do about it . it my head lady , i still have the number of the posi support team in my phone from my old management job and i know that you can fix it . again , in my head . so i ' m upset because she had no regard for the happiness of my table . had no regard for the problem with the computer that was causing a lot of issues . and had no regard for helping me out which is her job . but again , she ' s a bully . so im in a hurry i ask the sushi chef for the entree roll and he hands it to me and i drop it at the table and apologize over and over again . in my head i ' m like i ' m just ganna split this sushi roll off the bill and tell them at the end i paid for it . i wasn ' t even going to ask the manager i was just ganna pay for it myself . so then i realize he hands me the wrong sushi roll and when the entree sushis come up its wrong because he gave me an entree one for app . so the sushi chef is fighting with me tooth to nail and i ' m telling him what i need and he ' s just saying no . and in my head i ' m like how can you fight against this . this is for the customer we need to fix the mistake and talk about it later for the happiness of the guests . i tell the manager i need her help again and she starts yelling and screaming in my face about how i should know the difference . so i said out loud " the sushi chef didn ' t know the difference either . it ' s busy . i need my roll for the table there should be no arguing about it " . so i basically undermined her at that point . then she pulls me to the side to say that i have no right to fight with her , i was acting like a child and tried to threaten me with the owner . whom was sitting right in front of the sushi station and didn ' t even offer a helping hand to get the problem solved efficiently . then i ' m so fed up i start literally crying . saying i don ' t care was the owner says at this point i need the help when there ' s an issue and instead all i do is get yelled at . then she says we ' ll talk about it later . we never did . i worked there for a year and had a lot of shifts and was really good with the guests and always had compliments . about a week later i came down with the flu really bad and kept showing up to work anyway . i was literally throwing up in the bathroom on between tables for days there . i called out once because no one would cover me and i needed to get better . i even gave them ample amount of time to motivate someone else to come in . then i went to work for a couple days again . and i was getting worse . finally it was so bad one day that i had no voice was throwing up with diarrhea , had snot continously dripping from my nose and could get my swollen eyes to stop tearing . so i called out . and the next day this bitch had me fired . they fired me . i loved that place . i loved the people i worked with . i loved the kitchen crew and the guests . i have never been so sad about leaving a job . i have also never been on bad terms with a job before either . but her awful professionalism to handle situations in a correct manner for the guests directly resulted in me losing my job .

7. for me ? when someone asks me a question . about me . even if it ' s just a crack , i hate opening myself up .

9. we had a player in my city who came from a different , larger city for work . back then the lgs was new and so were the players so he ' d shark trades and crush fnms and other events easily . anyways eventually i learnt how to play properly and became a better player than him , so he stopped coming the actual bad experience however was when i was to his old store back in the larger city  he knew the owner personally and that was where he went to sell off his robbed cards and stuff  he ' d given the town a reputation as a place where everyone can barely play and he gets to sweep the trades and tournaments without trying . me being one of the few people to stick with the game after he ' d ruined it so thoroughly , i guess he ' d really made up some stuff about me out of spite so i get in and as soon as i ' m asked where i ' m from it starts getting whispered around  the standout experience was me asking how much they wanted for their foil tamiyo ,  i wanted it as an anniversary gift for my girlfriend but depending on whether they used f2f or scg pricing it would ' ve been better to get her the expedition hallowed fountain  and the clerk just told me " more than ten bucks still want it ? " and walked away without ringing me in i didn ' t spend any money there , but i drove back up for an edh tournament and got second , and then again and got first . now they ' re nicer to me but having to earn respect from strangers after being the butt of rumours soured me on the community , i go to a different place

10. anywhere except where op works . i didn ' t even get a reprimand . the guy didn ' t ask to see any sort of supervisor . sounds like i was being rude , i know , but in my line of work , you can give as well as you get . its sort of the best version of customer service ever .

11. i was working overtime . for the sake of the story , i  ll simplify what i was doing . there  s fast work and slow work . overtime tends to be reserved for fast work . you can tell the bosses what their overtime dollars bought . my manager brings me some very slow work . i tell her it  s going to take a long time . she says it should be the next thing i do . it  s the only thing i get done in digit hours . it literally required me standing behind her cubicle making copies for hours . we were within digit feet of each other . monday morning , she asks to see me . apparently her boss chewed her out so now she  s doing the same to me . i could have been a much smarter asshole but instead i just said i won  t bother to work overtime anymore if this is how it  s going to be . no answer from her . i got over it but now i remember to keep emails , texts , notes , whatever .

12. probably all the weird things i say and do
   (ID: a6171234e1a4ec65a39ad55aa0aa058eb98dff83)

13. people that get mad in traffic . like i seriously laugh everytime when someone is going apeshit .
   (ID: 14bd1366b004b74cfd8c9cb269849740d12cff80)

14. my mom once went to a popeye ' s where the service was really slow and there was bulletproof glass separating the cashier from the customers . the service was so slow that a guy who was waiting in line was able to watch a few episodes of daredevil in the amount of time it took him to get his food . my brother wanted to leave , but my mom had already paid for our chicken and she didn ' t want to trust the dumb kid behind the counter with her credit card again . the moral of the story is that you shouldn ' t go to popeye ' s restaurants in the ghetto .

15. just quit . they don ' t own you , you can do whatever you want with your life . i can understand you may have a tough time with her personality , so just simply send an email or write a note and attach it to your timecard or whatever , and simply say you are giving your two weeks notice as you have been given an opportunity to do something new and exciting in your life . thank  you and good  bye !
