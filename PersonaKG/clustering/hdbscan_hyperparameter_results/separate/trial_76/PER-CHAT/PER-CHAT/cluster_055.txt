1. and you ' re the type of person who thinks so highly of themselves they can ' t even understand a simple joke . get your head out of your ass .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

2. someone doesn ' t play the game for the same reason you do , therefore they are objectively wrong , nice argument there .
   (ID: 2a4bb889e40b61bb1755181c2b46750d3a082604)

3. yes i  m fully aware , but through consistent elaboration then maybe i could help at least one person learn the truth and show them the difference . as long as just one person learns from me , then my efforts are all worth it

4. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

5. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .

6. no mans sky always were a good game . you suckers just say it is  was bad because the creator overhyped it and lied about some features . blame the creator . not . the . creation . thats not just about nms , its about every fucking thing  your wife died giving birth to your child ? blame yourself for making her pregnant or dont blame anyone thats just one example . and also the game became really good after those updates . fuck you . haters gonna hate .  digit

7. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

8. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .

9. you have got to be kidding . how in the hell do you classify this as racism ?
   (ID: 7928bd3c3e727c94ff476240a27ed7199d92d666)

10. lol , ok ok . i ' ll stop . dude , for you own sanity . realise that this is a shitpost . my account is a shitpost account . you are arguing with me on a heavily down voted thread that almost no one will ever see . look in the mirror , remind yourself that you are a human being that doesn ' t need to get upset about idiots on the internet that are clearly doing stuff to get a rise out others . cause dude . it ' s not ever gonna stop . get used to it .
   (ID: 39ba9a65a55c27b50eef7c5cecbc66cc866c4a4c)

   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

12. if they understand everything else i said , then they understand the last part too , they ' re just in denial .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

13. no one is getting what i ' m saying tbh lol . people are just saying things without even reading descriptions on the game .
   (ID: 7c96bac704435347f721cc9a3056b8d7be16cc06)

14. but the left has a ' my way or the highway ' mentality do you not even realize how biased you just were ?
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

15. why don ' t you do something about the rampant amount of censorship on the platform where mods can censor you , insult you and ban you for no reason with no recourse all the while manipulating what news millions of people do and don ' t see
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

16. word , ight . i may not be black , but i sure as shit ain  t no nigger . see , freedom of speech mo  fo . i may not like what you say but i will defend your right to say it . nigger .
   (ID: 89fd53ef642d85d9a24d63f88469480646354104)

17. funny how you haven ' t actually been able to make a logical counter argument . you ' re just saying " you ' re wrong " without the logical backing that i have . then the " boo hoo whatever dude ! you ' re , uh , just like , uh , a flat earther dude " really , i am ? i ' m literally just like a flat earther ? that is your brilliant counter argument ? that saying it is wrong to promote a lie is exactly as bad as lying ? that is what you ' re telling me ? do you . do you realize how incredibly stupid you just made yourself look ? you just made yourself look like a clown .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

18. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

19. i dont see how my attitude is hateful . ive never said that i hate all incels or thought of them less than anyone else . ive only said that they sometimes have radical ideas . how could you possibly know what i want ?
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

20. i think at this point your just upset that a little american boy has a different opinion then you and your trying to make me look like a dumb homophobic nazi
