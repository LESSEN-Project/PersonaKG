1. mann vs machine is free on boot camp and community servers , there the games are for fun , mann up mode costs  digit for a ticket to pick from maps and difficulty , the higher the difficulty , the better the loot for mann up mode class choice determines the outcome due to the max cap being digit players , do not start a wave until all digit players are online classes  a good class makes up a good team , picking the right class can be hard , the team mainly consists of a medic , engineer , heavy , soldier , demoman , and either a scout or a pyro pyro should be used for waves with tanks or to replace the scout on any final wave scout is good on any wave to mainly collect money and slow down robots weapons  medic  any , kritzkrieg , ubersaw engineer  rescue ranger , wrangler , stock or jag heavy  natasha or stock , sandvich , fists of steel or gloves of running urgently soldier  stock , buff banner , any except equalizer demoman digit  stock  iron bomber , scottish resistance , any demoman digit demoknight  wee booties , splendid screen  tide turner , eyelander scout  stock , mad milk , fan o war pyro  phlogistonator , stock , power jack , homewrecker , third degree for giants with pockets upgrades  engineer  dispenser range , max metal , building hp , firing speed , wrench attack speed medic  max out everything on medigun heavy  ammo capacity x1 , destroy projectiles x1 scout  everything on milk after these are done focus body upgrades and some canteens canteens  engineer  building repaiupgrade scout  medic  uber heavy , soldier , demo , pyro  crits if you want to do a tour i suggest tale of two cities practice on boot camp look up more tutorials for more help tips  pyro should focus tank , engineer don ' t over extend , medic use shield whenever somebody is under pressure , uber instantly revives , canteens share with heal target if bought canteen expert , heavy should tank damage , before each wave demo should be crit charged by medic and lay stickies down , don ' t waste canteens often , don ' t be afraid to pop a canteen , don ' t use a bad weapon just to show it off ex . unusual pistol skin for scout , scout gets health if he collects money and overheal , use fan o war on pressuring bots , block super scouts with heavy , engineer , soldier or demo medic revive teammates unless it is really risky medic shield does damage medic shield charges while healing or reviving , uber doesn ' t charge by reviving heavy , throw sandvich at dying medic priority or any teammates some maps don ' t have tanks , mainly mannhatten , which is similar to an attack defense mode and can have up to digit bombs engineer step away from sentry when sentry buster and when it ' s about to blow up teleport the sentry with rescue ranger don ' t kick people unless you know they are terrible at mvm or they are complaining that everyone else sucks demoknight is not suggested but it can be useful if nobody is focusing on the bomb do it yourself as pyro you can reset the bomb by air blasting the carrier into a death pit as engineer try not to keep your buildings close together , put the dispenser towards the front lines for your team , dont buy disposable sentries or digit way teleport until everything else is max , dont use gunslinger don ' t use flares much as pyro you cannot airblast giants as pyro as soldier use buff banner for tanks and giants you can use the buff banner near an engineer and the sentry will get mini crits don ' t listen to what other people tell you to do if you know what your doing is working , otherwise try to improve as scout try to get money even if it seems risky , you will get healed giving you an easier chance to survive don ' t abandon the team to get upgrades , do it when you die or the engineer bought digit way teleporter don ' t do it yourself protect your engineer and medic when you know there ' s spies as pyro you can airblast the sentry busters if your medic and your running from scouts and other low health bots you can activate shield to kill them easily robot spies only hold primaries while disguised and try to get behind you watch out for snipers be aware of the current bomb carrier route on that wave and of all the spawn points of bots if there ' s an engineer bot destroy him first , for he does not build dispensers , take out the engineer teleporter if you are not in sentry sight line , if you are destroy the sentry first if engi is dead medic shield destroys any incoming projectiles , demoman bots can shoot bombs over the shield though hope this advice helps

2. well , i have studied but am not proficient with japanese candlestick patterns , chart patterns , i am starting with tape reading , i am trying to learn market cycles , applying the news , correlation between forex  stocks , i would like to learn options and the mathematics behind it . ah , i know what you mean . so , i actually don ' t really know all of that other stuff either . i know the basics , not the terminology . once you understand what the candles actually " mean " then the names and specific " patterns " mean very little . i feel just a basic knowledge of the candles will suffice  but i know concepts nothing i can actual trade with on my own . i really work hard and i put forth the effort  work . i am doing this full time and have some savings to weather the storm while i learn to trade on my own . i would start by finding a basic strategy and then working to improve it . i would say half the battle is just getting " into the zone " or as close to it as possible . there ' s a great book ironically named trading in the zone , by mark douglas . if you ' ve been working this for a bit it would probably be a perfect read ! a lot of the topics went over my head the very first time i read it , after re  reading it though it was completely different to me !  i am willing to switch to one software like e  signal which will do both . i would love some help ! i also want to continue onto python  algo trading afterwards . that ' s the direction i took , i really enjoy it ! i ' m currently trying to focus on scalping , having a go at bitcoin ! this is my progress for the past few months . feel free to dig through the twitter if you want to verify those trades , digit  of them i try to post on twitter to avoid appearing fake lol . cause that was the other thing i was going to say . i would say digit  of " classes " out there are useless . the most important things i ' ve learned are probably things i ' ve picked up from the more legitimate books out there and just digging around online , doing my own research . fooled by randomness is another great book , also algorithms to live by . more concerned with algos i ' m also trying to get a discord going that focuses on productive discussion , not just useless news and fluff . if you want a link just lemme know ! i love to help answer questions , i love all ideas , you never know where good ones can come from ! if you asked me where to start , i would say start with a digit ma , see if you can trade off just using that . then find out where and " why " some trades are good and bad , just build up from there

3. got it . in that case i believe ml could help and agree with the post from woodsja2 . i ' ve taken the andrew ng course they mention , and came away with a pretty good understanding of the different techniques . that said , to do this right probably requires prior experience . good luck , should be a fun problem to work on !

4. fast . ai will be a good place to start . deeplearning . ai by andrew ng is also an option . both use a bit different approach . andrew ng starts from basics . fast . ai goes top to bottomi think .

5. it will look a bit daunting at first , start from the start of the tutorials , it will have you make a simple thing first . this is good as it teaches you the basics of what you need . whenever it feels like it is starting to swamp you a bit , stop , do something else for a couple of hours , do something physical . let your brain rest and then come back to it . it will be tempting to just try and power through it all right now , but you will struggle to even remember the first step if you do that . most importantly keep the scope of your project narrow . finish the first idea , see how it works , and get another perspective on it . ask someone that won ' t baby you to review it , and listen to what they have to say . then come back and see if you can improve the thing . small iterations with a review between them help you grow and learn .

6. look up ygopro  devpro online and download it . it is a virtual version of the game , and i believe the percy client has an ai mode that you can test decks against . then i would lurk around the sub a little to see what people are playing , pick something that piques your interest , and start from there . warning  cardboard crack is an expensive and addicting habit , and devpro has cost me a fair bit of sleep after discovering it

7. youtube is going to be your best bet . as someone else mentioned , just pick a topic and go . if you ' re wondering how brakes work or how you replace them , or you want to know the difference between engine configurations , etc , you should be able to find a video explaining it .

8. you should read the ones in this video  it ' s a similar video to this one .

9. the most common entry points are  gaunt  s ghosts  follows a company of imperial army soldiers led by comissar gaunt . good for a perspective of the regular soldier in this grimdark setting eisenhorn trilogy  follows inquisitor eisenhorn and is a good source to understand how the imperium works space wolf omnibus  follows the process of recruitment  training  creation of a space marine . the main character knows almost nothing of the galaxy , so he and the reader learn together horus heresy where i started  it actually is warhammer 30k , with it  s story being about the imperium civil war and the rise of chaos across the galaxy . self contained and explains why things are so bad in 40k . the only problem is that it  s a huge series with over digit books though not all are necessary reading . yet i absolutely encourage you to read  em all
