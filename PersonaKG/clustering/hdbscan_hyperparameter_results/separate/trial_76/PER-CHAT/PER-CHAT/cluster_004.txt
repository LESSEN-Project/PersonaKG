1. i neither said he has progressed or regressed . what i was trying to say is oli is the best answer to the question at hand because he is one of the more polarizing and well  known vocalists in the genre and people tend to feel strongly one way or the other .

2. the issue was that he jungled non  stop regardless of . well , anything whilst also coming up with a terrible gpm . of course jungling and farming is a high priority for am but you want to be pushing waves more than hitting neutrals .
