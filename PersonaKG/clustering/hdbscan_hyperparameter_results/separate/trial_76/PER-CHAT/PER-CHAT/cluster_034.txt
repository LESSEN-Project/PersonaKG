1. probably because they can . some countries you dont get the right of freedom of religion , so in the us people can express themselves with it .

2. insular people have always done this to protect their own worldview . races , religions , ethnicities , classes , etc . they  ve all been scapegoated and hated for no solid reason because one group feels threatened . i dislike religion because of the use of dogma to legitimize cruelty , but worst of all is hypocrisy . conservatives want to claim to be about individual liberty , unless they feel so inclined to limit any particular group on a whim . christians want to claim to be a bastion of love and patience , but only for a small subset of people who personally serve their agendas . it  s not a difference in opinion that separates you from most of them , it  s iq points !

3. i feel the exact same way about people of color that constantly shit on white people and make blanket statements about them . you don ' t like it when people do that to you , so why would you do that somebody else ?
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

4. because we leave the freedoms to the individual . some people are retarded and make poor decisions ie not paying attention in school , have kids at digit years old , or joining gangs instead of filling their time with more productive means

5. people are raised in a certain way and if everyone around you thinks that way throughout your time living there it  s really hard to be critical of that way of thinking because you  d be going against everything everyone you know believes , in short , peer pressure on a larger scale
   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

6. . let people do what they want to do unless they are not really harming others . i do not think most of the christians spread hate against the other people . what do you gain if you deny god ?
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

7. i draw the line up to where someone tells another person to harm another . example   go out and cause x harm  or  go harass x  and the logical call to actions like saying there  s a fire in a movie theater when there really isn  t . other than that it  s fair game no matter how hateful the words are .
