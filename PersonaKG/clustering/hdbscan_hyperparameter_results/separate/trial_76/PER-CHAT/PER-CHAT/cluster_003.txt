1. then you went to a bad range . i would love to tell you that does not happen but my experience has been it is more common than not . i hope your co worker took the time teach you basic safety and operations , and that you enjoyed your self .

2. do a quick visual check to make sure , but i dont think its too big of a problem . check proper fluid level  color , check pad and rotor wear , and look for any leaks in the lines if you are worried .

3. yeah it was very quick but this one was pretty painful . but once you start you have to keep going so just persisted with the pain . they told me they were putting the power up but that was it . nothing to say that there was a chance of burning or damage like i experienced . my brother was telling me to try and push for damages but i would be happy with just my money back . i don ' t know if i ' m looking at this the wrong way regarding the damage that has been done .
