1. as i said , i have never used a proper " gaming " mouse in my life . i was talking about the logitech m90 , a literal  digit mouse that has the best sensor i ' ve personally ever used . which is not saying much , since i ' ve only ever used mice that are less than  digit

5. oh i had no idea , that gives me more of a reason to get it . unfortunately it  s not available on the uk site , and as someone who lives in europe i feel more comfortable ordering from there than the us . do you know if it  s gonna be available on the uk site anytime soon ?

6. i ' m not willing to attempt running my game on an emulator but i can see why people do , other than to cheat . if you want some of those people running on emu to stop optimize your game to not hammer our phones battery . i have charged my xperia z5 digit times today playing this .

7. no it ' s not . i ' ve got it on my note digit . i don ' t mean the newer one . i mean monster hunting dynamic hunting . sure , it ' s nowhere near as good as a ' proper ' mh game . but for little digit min hunts here and there its great . shame about the shitty black boarders though but you might not get them on an older phone .
