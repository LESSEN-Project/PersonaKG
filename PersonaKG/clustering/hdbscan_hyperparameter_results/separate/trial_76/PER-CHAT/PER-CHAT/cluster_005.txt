1. i ' m gonna be serious for a minute though , i lean towards against high driving . i know a few seasoned tokers who can handle it , but most people can ' t really drive high very well . there are exceptions though , and i would include myself in that . it ' s important to note though , that knowing your limits plays a part .

2. oh boy lol . i don ' t fly anymore , but no i wouldn ' t ever fly under the influence of anything , even cough medicine . it would be very irresponsible for people to fly while stoned or under the influence of any substance . the reasoning is pretty obvious . you misunderstood my statement about employees . of course they should be working sober . what they do in their personal time is really none of my business although i mostly employ writers who work from home so i don ' t really care as long as their work is to my liking . my point was , if they are going to use a mind altering substance after work , i ' d rather they just smoke weed instead of drink . weed doesn ' t cause hangovers during work hours . i ' m not advocating people get stoned or drunk during working hours . you are just buying into the narrative , that ' s my point . you have these stereotypes about pot smokers that just aren ' t true , but you are still perpetuating them with zero basis in fact . there are plenty of motivated and successful people who smoke pot during their personal time .

3. who the hell started the idea that making cigarettes more expensive would get people to quit ? that ' s not how addiction works .

4. ability of judgment is not binary absent or present . your decision making procedure takes things into account using different weights for different factors when you are drunk than it normally does when you are sober . that can make you misjudge some situations and make undesirable decisions . i think you are just politically against people who use their drunkness to excuse their misbehaviour . yes they suck . but they may be telling the truth as well as lying and using it as an excuse , you never know .

5. i am inclined to agree with most of what you said , and i ' ll look at the studies , but i suppose it ' s partially what i was trying to say , no drugs are safe , legal or illegal , if done wrong . i tend to indiscriminately tell people not to do the illegal ones though , since they can destroy your life , in fact it can have nothing to do with the drug and everything to do with the social situations illegal drugs tend to put people in . though i ' m sure you know that much too .

6. yeah i agree with you . life is about balance . besides smoking and heavy drugs i do all those things . it ' s just objectively a bad idea .

7. wait , you mean to tell me a drug created by big pharma is bad for you ? now i  m no doctor or scholar but it doesn  t take a  study  to prove that the shit they tested on us in the military and the shit they force feed everyone is terrible for you .

8. why don ' t we just dump amphetamines in the water supply ? isn ' t this pretty clearly a slippery  slope fallacy ? is there a real counter  argument to the ' better living through chemistry ' idea when we ' re talking about decisions individuals and their doctors make ?

9. depends on where your mind is at the time . how was your day ? are you happy ? sad ? angry ? how much acid ? what kind of trip are you looking to have ? have you ever dropped acid before ? are you an experienced cosmonaut ? there ' s nothing wrong with dropping acid alone at digit pm . as long as you are doing the drug and the drug isn ' t doing you

10. i mean even the most ardent marijuana supporters must concede it makes people less active and lazy . what are you talking about ? sure , some pot smokers are lazy , but are they lazy because they smoke pot or do they smoke pot because they ' re lazy ? there ' s a lot of really lazy unmotivated people that don ' t use any drugs at all . how would you explain that ? maybe we could just blame video games or something else in that case ? some people are just lazy . you do know people of all professions smoke pot , right ? i ' ve smoked pot since i was digit . got a pilot ' s license , college degree , and have run my own business for the past digit years . just about all of my friends smoke weed and they have all been employed for decades doing just fine . they have spouses , are great parents , own nice homes , etc . you know what makes people less active and lazy ? being hung over . i ' d much rather my employees smoke weed at the end of the day to wind down and get to work the next morning well rested . you ' ve bought into the narrative that has been preached to you since birth . this , coming from a dare graduate lol .
