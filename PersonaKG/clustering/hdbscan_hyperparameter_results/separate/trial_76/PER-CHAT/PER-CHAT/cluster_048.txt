1. that ' s where i need to be . in a space in my head where i can ignore it or walk away from it . i ' m hung up on being angry that he gets to treat people however he wants without consequence . i honestly don ' t know how you didn ' t react with your father behaving like that ! i ' d have been terrified ! it ' s nice of you to still help him with his medical treatment even though he certainly doesn ' t sound grateful . i can see that having boundaries is important . i guess i need to know what mine are and stick to them at all times . i don ' t know if having cptsd is what makes my emotions take over when he does these things . something to talk to my psych about i suppose ! thank you so much reginaagnon , your kind words help more than you know ! red  heart

2. i read , " however , she does seem to assume i don  t know what i am doing at all "  if my daughter was digit with a baby i would assume the same . being a parent is a major responsibility , i currently have digit . i ' m in college as well , and i ' m almost twice your age . college is literally the only thing i have the energy for outside of motherhood , i can ' t imagine what you would want to go out and do that your mother is like , " no , no , no " to .   x200b  as far as getting your mom to give you more freedom , she ' s probably afraid you ' re going to go out and get pregnant again  it ' s a very valid fear . she questions your judgement , your ability to be responsible . what she has to go on is you getting pregnant at digit . your first decision as an adult was to become a parent , it sounds like she ' s afraid you will continue to make decisions that have her questioning whether or not you are capable to live an adult life where you can make rational decisions for yourself .

3. most people have some form of guilt built up especially if it ' s a recent occurrence . if you raised the concerns and genuinely wanted to unfold the truth and try to fix things i can ' t see a reason he would continue the affair .   x200b  if you ' re that concerned once you ' re together , get him in a quiet space where you both have timesomething like a car and ask if you can take a look at his phone . straight up , no gimmicks , just say " may i go through your phone to make sure we ' re both on the same page . you should be able to tell right away if he has something to hide .   x200b  however , be careful because this could stir something up that wasn ' t there in the first place . this brings us back to the main point , that being straight forward is always better than snooping . no questions asked if i was dating a girl and she snooped through any of my personal effects the relationship would be done .

4. you know , i  ve been at that point in my life where i wondered why i had so many failed relationships . but then i realized all of them had one thing in common . me . there  s a reason why we pick the partners we do . go to counseling because you want to be the best you that you can be , not because she made the call . go for you . i hope you do it .

   (ID: 726c36ce13fa631676ed5053f62b0f5f7b61eb5e)

6. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him

7. do you enjoy getting fingered or licked ? woman can do that , are you gay ? now that is a little atypical but assuming he likes to fuck you , he ' s not gay .
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

8. i ' m sorry . i was selfish , complacent and foolish . i hope your new man realizes how wonderful you are and treats you like you like i was supposed to . thank you for helping me become a better person .

9. she ' s only snored while i was conscious at least every few months before , last few weeks have been rough . i just sleep on the couch if it becomes a big issue . that sounds rough i guess , but i actually sleep at least as well if not better on the couch than in bed . i made sure to talk to her about it and make sure she knew there were no hard feelings and it was just a practical matter . i never start out there , and make a point to spend time talking to her and the bump before she goes to sleep every night , we just agreed i can bail if i need to .

10. life  s shit tbh but ig its better than being dead cuz than u won  t be able to feel anything . do u need help op ?
   (ID: 88279b92dca36b3b3c236d960135a2afe2e68b33)

11. no you handled it well . i would of done the exact same thing . think of it this way  if he did kill his self and you didn ' t inform anyone , you would feel a lot worse . you ' ve done the right thing . you ' ve broken up with him and told several people so now it ' s their job to look out for him . not yours . you are free .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

12. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .

13. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

14. honestly yeah i think you ' re kind of an asshole . men are always much more likely to leave their significant others due to illness  here we go , another example of it . like the girl you ' re meant to love could have something terribly wrong with her and you ' re out here just thinking about yourself and any future  key word future  kids ? come on dude . if you do break up with her because of this , i want you to look her dead in the eye and say " i can ' t deal with you being sick , and that ' s why i ' m leaving you "

15. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .

16. plan b can mess with your period . i would suggest taking a few pregnancy tests , and if they all of most come back positive go see a doctor and have them check . theyll be able to check her hormone levels over a few days and give you a better idea .

17. its selfish to pity or hate yourself , for people you maybe didn  t even met yet , you gotta be grateful for what you have since lots of people all over the world lacks it
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

18. if you like her go for it , forget what other people think and spend time with her . if you ' re interested show it ! respond to the winks with a smile , funny face , another wink or whatever you feel like , respond to her messages etc . if you dive into the situation you ' ll be able to find out what ' s going on . also don ' t get friends involved , even if she has . it ' s generally a disaster waiting to happen .

19. he will find his own way . my sister still has a relationship with them but i am nc with my parents . it  s weird sometimes . but that  s what works for her and this is what works for me , and that  s ok . just give him hugs , and be there for him , because we have to choose our family very carefully  we were given such crappy ones ! sounds like you both are on the same page . and don  t ever give your ssn to anyone who asks . god , so many horror stories of nparents stealing their children  s identities and ruining their lives ! aack ! protect yourself !

20. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers
