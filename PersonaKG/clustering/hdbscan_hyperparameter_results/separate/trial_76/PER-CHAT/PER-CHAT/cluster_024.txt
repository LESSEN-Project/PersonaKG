2. my area put up a stink about this because they put in an old time clock that barely works . we all manage to get clocked in before 5am but it ' s tough some days when it ' s malfunctioning . the supervisor has been nice enough to forgive a tardy so long that you were in line at digit  digit .

3. prompt any upset customers to " let management know how they feel about the long lines " by doing a receipt survey . nps gets affected now dm ask sm whats going on . sm is forced to be engaged with the actions or lack of actions from all team members . we had a similar situation with a sfl not achieving expectations . our sm was blind to this . so we all would paige the sfl by name he would tell cashiers not to paige him by name . they still would call him but he wouldn ' t respond . once the survey ' s started coming in stuff changed real fast . i would say all in all about digit weeks of the bad nps score before stuff changed .
