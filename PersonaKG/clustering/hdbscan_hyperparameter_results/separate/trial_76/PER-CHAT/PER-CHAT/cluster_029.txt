1. obviously , this argument doesn ' t hold and it  s simply a case of people being irked that non  whites are finally being represented in a larger way . i surely hope you aren ' t assuming that just because somebody is unhappy with one specific historically  incorrect aspect that they do not care about the others . just because somebody isn ' t actively advocating against every historical inaccuracy at any given point doesn ' t mean they ' re using it as a front to deny non  white involvement  most people do acknowledge the participation of smaller groups in the war , but simply find the representation to be statistically inaccurate . i would ask these individuals what they consider of other historical inaccuracies in the game before framing them with what is implied to be a racist undertone .

2. morality ? politics ? if a woman decides she wants an abortion then she should get an abortion . it ' s none of our business . who cares about the colors of fetuses ? let ' s say you ' re a busdriver and there are digit black people and digit white people on the bus . why would you feel the need to kick digit black people off or lure digit more white people in ? who cares except for maybe people with ocd ? things are what they are .

3. amping up teh st00pid , eh ? fine . wtf are you talking about with " opposites " some sort of straw man , i must surmise .  looks who ' s racist now . oh please . " no , you ' re the real racist " glenn beck ? is that you ?  so , where ' s the asian history month ? where ' s the gay history month ? where ' s the deaf history month ? women ' s history month , hispanic heritage month , american indian heritage month , and asian pacific american heritage  these are all stupid ideas . there ' s only one history . there is only one history in fact but the whole point of of such things is not the actual history but the presentation of history . the only history that people ever heard about was nearly devoid of blacks save for demeaning stereotypes . bhm was intended to bring an awareness of the missing history . actually , gay pride exists for precisely the same reason . prior to very recently , the only public images and perceptions of gays were nothing but gross caricatures .  i ' m aware that the blacks have had a hard time of it . i don ' t think that ' s relevant to this discussion . what ' s relevant is your apparent ignorance of the meta  history . the very fact that you are decrying bhm clearly shows your ignorance of that very thing .  where does it end ? when people no longer feel the need to complain about black history month , gay pride , et cetera , there will be no need for black history month and gay pride celebrations , et cetera .

4. lgbt doesn ' t have my best interests considered . any group has potential to become a hivemind , so i ' d like to avoid that as well . asexuals seem like they should go their own way , but many feel they belong with the other minorities .

5. my opinion on the subject tends to piss people off to begin with  i hate it that any single group has been indoctrinated by judeo  christian hegemony and then adopts it as if it  s their own bias . african , afro  caribbean , and african americans are the unfortunate prime example , but it also extends to native and aboriginal peoples across the world . the british , spanish , dutch and french came in , installed  buggery  and  sodomy  laws which criminalized homosexuality . the european dominion of the overseas territories brought with it puritanical religion which became deeply entrenched and persisted  in most cases still persists to this day . i wouldn  t blame these communities for a second , most of them had third genders and  or never had a prohibition on homosexuality until white people told them to . and the rest is history .

6. i oppose gay marriage and i don ' t give the narrowest fuck about gay people . so you don ' t care , until they do something that i completely does not involve you or anyone else ?
