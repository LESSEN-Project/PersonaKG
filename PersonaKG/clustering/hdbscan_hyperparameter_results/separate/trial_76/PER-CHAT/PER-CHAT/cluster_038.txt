SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 8

1. because when i get asked if i read or like books , i always saw i do . because deep down i know i should read and it  s embarrassing to not know a book title or author . that  s why people get mad . dude , if you know you have a grammar problem and you dislike reading either accept your non existent interest to learn or start reading . it  s not hard . i hate when people say they love reading but can  t name a single novel or book .

2. look and acknowledge when this bs happens to you and you will understand how annoying it is

3. i think it ' s because half the time you keep talking to the wrong end . pick the side that ' s not blowing hot air , and you ' ll have a good conversation . if you do pick the wrong side , run , for it will soon be smelly .

5. i hate how they all say  leave a like it really helps me out  like i get it , i do , but it  s really annoying .

6. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?

7. so you ' re clearly letting it bother you and they notice that right ? people like that feed off of your response . you have to learn how to not let it bother you .

8. it makes me uncomfortable too . i ' ve come to respond with " thanks , it ' s been hard work . conversation usually ends there .
