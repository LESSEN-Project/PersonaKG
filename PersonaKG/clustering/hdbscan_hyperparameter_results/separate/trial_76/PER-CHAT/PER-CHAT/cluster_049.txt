2. aussie here , so what i ' m about to say may not apply in the us , but going around to talk to sparkies face to face is worth digit resumes you send out . do the leg work .

3. sf would give you some good experience especially if you don  t have any . it  s my experience that they usually recruit people with experience .

5. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?

6. indeed first of all you learn all the fittings and names of the tools and secondly you have tradesmen coming in and out . i personally know of a few times guys at the counter were offered jobs

7. interesting to see the mix of opinion on the 30k london salary . for what it  s worth , i think this seems bang on what i would expect . for those saying it  s very high  my first job was in a london call center and it paid 18k back in digit . i was an unskilled uni dropout with a poor work ethic . you can get to 30k by default just by adding a some skills and experience . for those saying it  s very low  this job is looking for someone with digit year  s experience . so the target candidate is going to be in their early twenties and most likely has no family or other responsibilities . they  ll manage on 30k just fine .
