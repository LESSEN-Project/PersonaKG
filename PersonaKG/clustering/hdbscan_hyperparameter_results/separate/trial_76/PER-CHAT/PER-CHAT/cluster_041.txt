2. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting

5. it ' s not ok , and yet men being violent to women because they do things like ask to be spoken to respectfully or decline to have sexual intercourse with a man is so common that pretty much every woman can tell you about a time it happened to her , it ' s often dismissed with " boys will be boys " or " she was asking for it . violence isn ' t ok , but when women are violent to men , it ' s usually to protect themselves and when men are violent to women it ' s so often because men have been taught that they aren ' t supposed to control themselves . like i said , every time i ' ve seen a girl kick a guy in the nuts , the guy was being a shit . meanwhile , every time i ' ve seen a guy physically assault a girl , it was because the guy was a violent asshole who didn ' t like being told " no " so , until we come to a time when every single man has a story about being kicked in the nuts by a girl for no reason while very few women are every assaulted , it ' s a meaningless equivalency . guys being kicked in the nuts for no good reason simply isn ' t the epidemic that girls getting assault for no good reason is . if you ' re getting kicked in the nuts that often , you should consider that either you ' re behavior is awful or your friends are , and make changes accordingly .

6. dude , if you have an attractive so , let her show that shit off . you should take it as a compliment when other people want to fuck your girlfriend . if you really can ' t handle her style , then maybe she ' s not for you .
