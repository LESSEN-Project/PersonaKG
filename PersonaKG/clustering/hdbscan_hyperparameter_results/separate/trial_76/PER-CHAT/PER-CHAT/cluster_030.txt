3. it really makes customer support queries much faster . i find it way more useful than some of the banking apps i use , because all the text and information is automatically saved . you don  t have to go back and forth with different systems and phone numbers and juggle all the information as it  s all there .

4. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?

6. duuuuuuuude . now seriously  this is impressive for a first release . sure , they ' ve been working on it for some time , but it already has features that are still missing from opera and people are complaining about  digit versions after the abandonment of presto . everything is looking good , it even works on , although a bit sluggish on the machine i ' ll be using for some more months . i noticed it has some gestures , but it seems they are neither documented nor customizable for now  e . g . down  right closes the current tab .
