1. it would not be a bee , it has the advantage of only having to learn how to float like a butterfly , and conversely nor would i fight a sword wielding butterfly . i reckon i could take a beluga whales so long as it comes into my neighborhood .

2. i  d guess humans wouldn  t exist , since the rise of mammals would probably not happen . mammals would still be little , focused on survival on a land dominated by dinossaurs or some kind of dino  birds evolution . i doubt dinossaurs would remain so large , with food scarcity hitting them at some point .

3. chinas navy is absolute dogshit and they know it , if they were to go to war with nato their naval imports would stop because of naval blockades , which would cripple their economy . also , china simply cannot produce enough food to feed digit , digit billion , which means another famine would start if their naval imports were to get cut off . as you already said , china has wayyy too much to lose and honestly not much to gain from a world war .

4. it seems rather unlikely that a full  scale war will happen . no one knows for sure of course , but north korea ' s ultimate goal is state survival beyond anything else . the us will respond to any attack with the destruction of the regime , which is something they don ' t want to deal with . the concern is that if the us strikes thousands will die , and we will be left with a major refugee crisis .

5. it depends on the quality of us and international intelligence . it ' s clear that we aren ' t sure exactly where all their military sites are , making it more difficult . either way international powers could defeat the army i imagine relatively quickly , as despite large numbers of military personnel in the nk army they lack basic supplies  equipment . they could of course do a lot of damage to south korea with their artillery , and possibly conventional forces the latter is unclear .

6. there probably won ' t be a ww3 in the old world , but the us has been slowly going back to isolationism , stocking up on weapons and is basically preparing to go against the whole world in my opinion . on the other hand , russia and the eu have been improving relations and are more or less dependent on each other the eu  economy quite literally depends on gazprom . also , russia has also been getting quite friendly with a lot of middle eastern and central asian countries , so it is possible that a large war breaks out , seeing as how the lines are pretty much drawn .
