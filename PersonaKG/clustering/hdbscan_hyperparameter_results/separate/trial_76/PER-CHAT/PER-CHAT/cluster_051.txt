1. welcome to life brother they want you to have digit years experience but your digit . just apply and always include a cover letter about what makes you a good candidate . why were your other jobs so short ? that could be why your not getting many call backs . maybe take the digit month job off your resume .

2. you seem to have your head on straight , you want to create something of your own , really embrace your parents ' legacy . if you really feel like its the right move and you ' re excited about it than no one can stop you . however , be prepared for long nights of your own , be prepared that if you do meet a woman and you do have kids that you might put them in the same situation you are in . now thats also an exaggeration , you could completely re invent the company to where you dont even have to lift a finger and youre home with your family all the time . but that will take a very long time . its all your personal preference man , dont completely rule out a college experience and a chance to take on a different path because you might hate working digit  digit in a factory with loud machines all day . whatever you choose to do , just make sure you ' re happy and keep your options open

3. apprenticeships ! you can work and get a degree at the same time . you do it with a company , you get a reduced salary , but it means you don ' t have to pay anything , and you get experience in the workplace . you do come out of it with a degree in whatever field your apprenticeship was in

4. hey all , so i ' m currently a 1st year physics student in one of the better uk unis and am starting to fear for my future . the thing is i only have enough money to sustain myself for the duration of the course , that means that i will only have the opportunity to do one internship because of how the uk system works , no masters studies , no digit year industry placements . so after digit years i will have a bsc in physics and will be looking for a job . i ' ve tried reading up online what a physics graduate can do , however most of the conversations are geared towards masters and phd ' s and for undergrads they usually talk about majors  minors in the us , which isn ' t a thing here , i only have physics to my name . now , i don ' t care that much if my job has little or nothing to do with my course , as long as it doesn ' t feel like my education was a complete waste of time . though it seems to me like i can ' t get into nucleaoptics  medical  meteorological physics , because they have enough masters and phd applicants . i like programming , but i won ' t be qualified enough to compete against compsci  engineering graduates , even if i take extra modules in them .   x200b  so besides teaching which i really don ' t want to do , am i completely screwed ? i only have one chance at an internship , what sector should i aim for that has no problems accepting physics bsc ' s with a little bit of experience ?

5. don  t worry about those digit b  s . i  m going to be a senior and as of right now my gpa is at digit . digit , i  ve not taken a single ap class and have made a couple bs as my final averages . you know whether or not you can achieve as in a class and if you did your best and still made bs , it shouldn  t matter because you tried your best

6. i ' m in shock ! i took the mcat last year and got a digit . i just got my score back and got a digit ! i never thought i ' d do this well ! i can ' t believe it ! for everyone who is reading this and hasn ' t taken your test yet , you ' ll walk out of the test feeling like crap , but trust your full lengths ! digit was the best fl score i got a week out , and it was the 3rd time i had taken fl digit , so i really wasn ' t sure how i ' d do i took them all months apart and didn ' t remember a thing . know that your hard work will pay off !

7. what are you studying ? if it ' s not something you can take to the marketplace and secure a job right away because of your education you may be wasting your time and money . also , if you are going deep in debt for your education beware .

8. well if it were me i would definitely keep my solid plan a and atleast have the good job that you majored in . but at the same time don ' t just let your true love for writing die . i ' m not positive how to go about it but i feel like you could get your first book published and see how it does ?

9. do it ! who knows , maybe you ' ll fall into another career path you love even more ! i took off several years after college before taking the pre  reqs . i learned a ton , had some great experiences and some not  so  great experiences , and am pretty happy with my decision i guess we ' ll see how my cycle goes . i actually think you ' re very mature  you ' ve figured out what might be best for you !

10. i  ve said it before but treat college like a digit houweek job and you  ll do well academically . you  re about to get a ton of time and that can make you think you can do it later . make a schedule . do digit hours a day of studying , writing , and assignments and you  ll do fine .

11. i am the first in my family to go to college . i did ok but should have done much better . my dad worked to pay off my school through a small business he started . he paid until junior year when he got cancer . at that point i got loans . i came out of school with about  19k in debt . not bad but not zero . that seems like a small amount of debt but i hustled for digit years throwing everything extra i had at it . then i got married . i hated that i brought that burden on my wife . you never know what may be coming . will your car break down ? will you get  keep a job ? will you have tremendous medical needs ? you can get hit by a bus like anyone else . my advice is this . go to community college and get an associates degree as cheaply as possible . then go to college for your bachelors degree in a field you like may not love and that has some demand . if you do that you  ll never worry about a job . good luck

12. ok , honestly same i ' m one year ahead of you , but in the uk , we can ' t just pick up a class . i figured out i wanted to do theatre when i was digit . i hadn ' t studied it for two years , and i couldn ' t pick it up . so i ' m doing whatever i can outside of school . but now i ' ve been hit with the issue of " how the hell do i pay attention to anything in school " you ' ve gotta look at the bigger picture . universities want to see that you ' re a rounded person if you choose to do that , so you ' ve gotta have something else to show for yourself . most importantly , what your dad said about some actors not making it ? no , most actors don ' t make it . it ' s ridiculously competitive , and you ' ll have to work multiple jobs just to keep on top of rent and stuff . or , you can work hard in school , get a solid fall back chemistry for me and then know that you can work a good job alongside auditions . then you can spend longer auditioning and stand a better chance of actually making a living on acting . if that doesn ' t help , then find something in the other classes that interests you . sure , maybe chemistry isn ' t your thing , but that one topic on equilibrium you love . or you hate shakespeare , but you find the casket problem in the merchant of venice fascinating . great ! find little things that excite you and cling to them for dear life . finally , if none of that works , just buckle down and get it done . accept that you will fuck up your life if you don ' t finish highschool so you just have to . talk to your teachers , reward yourself for revision , don ' t be too hard on yourself , but just get it done . it sucks but you don ' t have a choice . feel free to send me a dm , you ' re a theatre kid my age  we ' d probably get along lmao

13. i was just like you at one point . i had no idea what i was going to do . take any job that sounds legit . no craigslist ads or anything and be upfront . everyone in the world wants to work in hollywood . i don ' t live in l . a . , and i never wanted to . there are jobs all over the country that you ' ve never heard of that go almost unnoticed because everyone ' s solely focused in hollywood . it ' s a really long story , but it was a lot of fun and good fortune getting here . p . m . me for a very long story . by the way , i was scared too . i just didn ' t want to live my life letting fear hold me back . if you try , something will come of it .

14. digit months ago heck , even digit months ago is a long time to remember content from test . i absolutely think it ' s representative . the odds of you remembering more than digit random question are very slim . when i retook the tests , i think i remembered digit question total not per exam . i just retook fl digit the last time i took it was in late march  1st week of april , and i seriously didn ' t remember anything from the test . 3rd party exams tend to be deflated , so i wouldn ' t worry about those too much . if anything , they ' ll help you hone in on areas you need work on . you ' re doing great !

15. it really depends on where you live . some places require behind the wheel experience prior to getting a license , and the amount varies . do you live in a city with public transportation ? do you have friends or access to uber to get around ? what about a bicycle ? i would recommend trying to calmly talk to your parents about these things . maybe let them know that you do not want to move out the day you turn digit , but you will need certain freedoms to agree to stay . please don ' t speak angrily or sound like a threat . just explain what you want and listen to their side . maybe you can get a compromise .

16. just apply , you don ' t need any experience . you apply , they call you in , you take a test , if you pass they do an interview .

17. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

18. i say go for it ! change is good , and for your situation and everything you described moving is definitely going to be good for you . you don  t want to keep thinking about doing it for years and regret not going sooner .

19. it wouldn  t be a bad idea to have an older student tutor you . does your school have a peer tutoring program ? lots of people struggle with math and geometry takes a lot of understanding about different shapes as well as a lot of equations . it could be as simple as you simply don  t understand how it  s being explained to you and you need a new perspective . if you  re not willing to get a tutor you  re going to have to put in double time on studying . write and rewrite problems and how to solve them until you understand how you get the answer correct . you can do it ! it just might not be easy

20. is english not your first language ? you don ' t need a degree , any degree helps . but you can show up to some smaller towns and look up lesson plans online and just start teaching . build your clientele , develop a reputation , and grow your business
