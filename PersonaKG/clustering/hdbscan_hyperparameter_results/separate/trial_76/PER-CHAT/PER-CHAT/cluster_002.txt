2. i ' m a small child again , like digit or digit , i ' m just doing my shit playing in the back yard , then out of fucking nowhere three dinosaurs are resurrected . but not just any dinos , the three from fucking power rangers dino thunder . they start eating shit and obviously since i ' m a small child in this dream i ' m powerless to stop them , and children can ' t run very fast what the fuck am i going to do if one decides to eat me . and obviously power rangers aren ' t real so none of them every show up . so here i am trying to find some place to hide from these rampaging dinos when suddenly one spots me usually the pteranodon and the last fucking thing i see before i wake up is that fucker staring at me like a hungry bird .
