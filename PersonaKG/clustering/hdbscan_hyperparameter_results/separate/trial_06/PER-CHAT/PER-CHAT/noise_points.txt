1. drunkengolfer put in black and white ! public courses in my area really don ' t have course marshalls so you can pretty much do what you want . i don ' t listen to music but if others want to and i cant hear it blurting out everywhere its no problem . its a public course so the public need to respect each other !

2. a class on reading the fine print in all dealings in life with contracts bills etc . i could have saved a good hunk of change had i rrad the fine print . like with spectrum currently the fine print says you are a new customer if you have not had services with them for digit days so if at the end of your one year agreement you can stand to go without home internet and use the library and your phone interwebs you can get a new customer deal and save lots of money

5. i take it that the crew are a comedy group ? is " crew funny " highlights of their " skits " or just some bonus behind the scenes of their creative process ? in any case , eating donuts purchased for someone else isn ' t funny or quirky , it just makes you look like a self  absorbed asshole especially in the jerk  like way amanda phrased it . p . s . i ' m also the last person to complain , but that is the wrong there in your sentence will .

17. well go in there with the approach that you are not digit  satisfied and want to return everything . the worst case scenario is  we can  t refund live animals but you are within the return policy for the accessories  cage etc .  if they say that , you let it go in the store after they refund you . make sure to bring it in a box . also , record it
