5. not being preachy but maybe look at potential partners other aspects mental  spiritual , lifestyle choices etc . and see if those are healthy  attractive . people can change but if you are dating someone in a rut , it will be ten times harder for them to better themselves once dating and that ' s the real ugly side of relationships . if you think you are shallow about appearances then you might be using it as an excuse to not address other flags from that person . unfortunately it is so easy to rate people based on image so it ' s just a constant effort to remind yourself .

13. it worked for me after smoking for around digit years . i haven ' t had one since fall , and i don ' t want one either . some advice . be prepared for some very vivid dreams , but they seem to subside after a while . make sure you drink plenty of water with the pill and eat something with it if you can . it can give you horrible stomach cramps if you don ' t . keep taking it even after you quit , for at least a couple of months , although you can typically taper off to one pill a day after the initial digit months . if you still feel a slight craving after the initial digit months , ask your doctor for another prescription . it gets so much easier after a couple of months . i just had a digit hour drive with an open pack of cigs sitting next to me , and i didn ' t even think about lighting up . good luck ! it ' s sooooo much better after you quit .

15. i don ' t mean balance as in the character meta , but in the community sense . more people are on equal footing . and yeah i agree the prices are ridiculous but unfortunately i don ' t think it ' ll change to much . i wish they would do a system like injustice where you could buy most characters for the farmable currency , but some would be event based

20. former hotel manager here . this for sure ! managers are held under such high scrutiny in this industry and can be seen as relatively disposable . a positive review for a manager that had to give a service recovery could go a long way for them . also , as a gold member , the hhonors desk is your best friend . they will often go to bat for you should you have issues in the future .
