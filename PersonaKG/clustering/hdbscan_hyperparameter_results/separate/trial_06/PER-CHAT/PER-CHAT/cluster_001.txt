1. that sounds nice . no i haven  t but i may . i tend to get into my head a lot , and lemme tell ya . my brain fucken hates me . my head is an asshole to me and convinced me that everything i do is pointless and meaningless . no one gives a shit . etc . idk i feel like if i do volunteer the same will come of it . the main reason i like seeing movies with friends so much is because i can kinda forget myself ? if that makes sense . idk . i will probably look into it but i  m not expecting a ton

5. in a word  no . writing is tiring for me and the number of stories would push the thread well into tl  dr territory . i ' ll keep writing these and posting when i can and if you don ' t like it you can just not read them .
