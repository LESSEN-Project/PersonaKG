2. i see things a bit differently . no doubt your dad would appreciate a higher end and therefore more expensive turntable , but as an unexpected gift from his child , either of your options are priceless . go to the top of your budget and if your dad particularly likes audio technica , go with the best you can afford . i don  t know what other equipment you already have , but make sure that you have a pre  amp or integrated amp with a  phono  input or else keep enough money on one side for a suitable phono stage . good luck .

14. argue all you want hahahaha . that ' s the answer . they sign up thinking they ' ll " serve their country " , get used to hurt other humans instead , then get unhinged because of it . a great package of stupid from the veto  go , too cowardly to refuse to hurt others during , and weak minded afterwards .

15. i have only done it a few times and i try to be discreet and watch it while filming . the last time was last year and i posted it to the fan group on fb and youtube . i try to enjoy a live show when i am there but sometimes you get a good seat with a great view and your favorite song comes on and everyone in the venue sings along and you are glad you taped it . i don ' t get those people who film the entire show , especially in portrait orientation .

17. i believe that for british people complaining and grumbling about life is an important part of social bonding . it ' s a common thing that when two british people meet they will grumble about something before having any kind of in  depth social interaction . almost anything will do , the bad weather , their house , the high fuel tax , the weather etc . all british people will understand this and understand that it isn ' t really a proper complaint about society . it ' s a shared comradeship in a bitter life that favours nobody in the end . it ' s a social lubrication . a shared misery that finds common ground and a place from which to build a friendship . australians just don ' t seem to get this . brit  ' fuck me , it ' s hot here today ' australian  ' what are you complaining about ? it ' s fucking beautiful . what ' s the weather like in the uk right now ? ' brit  ' uh , yeah . i guess you are right ' australian  ' whinging pom , eh ? ' brit  ' yeah , the weather is great here . you are right ' british people use shared misery and grumbling , whether real or perceived , in order to form social bonds . this doesn ' t really exist in the same way in australia . british people are rather socially retarded on the whole so shutting off their one shared mechanism for social interaction is a great hindrance .

19. it ' s the equivalent of canned laughter  the reader is being prompted to laugh . i ' ll laugh if i think something is funny . in fact , if i read something funny but the writer includes a " lol " , i will stifle my laugh . principles .
