13. oh so you were one of those " fit fats " i read about on the internet only . you dont think your cardio suffered or your joints , knees in particular wouldnt have been stressed less , or whatever sport you were playing you could have played better if you lost digit  pounds ? you are delusional to think it didnt stress your body at all no matter how young and " active " you were .

   (ID: 20b71c431f98b1f88ec1b3e7ada79d31df65a8c2)

16. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .

17. it  s funny to me that there  s this obvious disparity in quality of plastic surgeons . we think of doctors as infallible gods of science and trust them with our lives . but then you see some of these obvious tit jobs and you have to stop and think , do they deserve our unquestioning trust ?
