2. i haven ' t seen this week ' s walking dead yet , but in that particular example from what i ' ve seen , it ' s treated as something that ' s in people ' s minds . that ' s realistic and entirely valid . it ' s when they start actually showing afterlives and such that bothers me . lost went too far for me . there have been a few others but none are coming to mind .
