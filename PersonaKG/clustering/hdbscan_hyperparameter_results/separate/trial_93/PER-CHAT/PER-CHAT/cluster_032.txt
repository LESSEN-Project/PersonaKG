3. for me when i was younger , it was easy to be convinced listening to someone trying to get you into their pyramid scheme business and hard to get out of their cult  like circle  jerk meetings after realizing you ' re not getting a real job .

12. but my point wasn ' t that . this is literally not a part of islam . yes a woman has to dress modestly but dressing like that is for horny men that cannot control themselves . personally i respect all women decided covering their hair but this . sorry but this is not islam . this is straight up misogyny . you can dress modest without turning into a fuckin ninja . and you ' d be surprised how many " muslim " women take advantage of dressing like that . i can link a lot of articles from turkey where a woman dressed like that committed a crime
