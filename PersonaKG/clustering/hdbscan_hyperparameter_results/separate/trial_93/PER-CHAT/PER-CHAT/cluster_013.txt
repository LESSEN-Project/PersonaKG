9. well the moc only helps you with getting trade prices for gunrunning vehicles and the bunker unupgraded doesn ' t make you any money if you buy supplies , you just break even , not even considering staff cost , so your best bet is to make around 2million and buy the equipment and staff upgrades and then you will make 135k each time you buy suppliesthe staff will cost more tho , but that shouldn ' t be a big problem
