1. it can be super frustrating , because it makes us feel like we ' re not good enough . media always tells us that getting guys off is easy . so if we go at it for a while , and i finish and he doesn ' t , i feel like a failure  not sexy enough .

3. thank you for the reply . with their tone , i feel like many of the responses were as if my question was , " can i attempt to sleep with you while you are shopping . it ' s closer to , " what i feel compelled to strike up a conversation with you while you are shopping "

6. bahaha that sucks dude . i empathize with a team becoming more frustrated as the losses stack up . but i still feel the worst for the maid who had to walk into what probably looked like an alien murder scene .

17. first off , i like the thinking behind this and it was really well thought out . however i think i  d have to disagree with this . i feel like euphoria is trying to be as original as it can . they make it like no other show that i know of , and i feel like they are creating their own plot . but if this is some version of romeo and juliet , i wouldn  t necessarily be mad about itexcept for the fact that fez would die plz no .

19. i feel for ya dude . i can ' t even begin to understand how hard it must be for you . is your home affected as well ?
   (ID: 3f3a13bda2e98055fc23d20ace4e5f76118b56c5)

20. i make this reference often and feel like nobody knows what i ' m talking about
