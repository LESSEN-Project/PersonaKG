1. it  s not offensive , never said it was . and again , i  m not against sending a message , it  s how that message is sent . my concern is that they will overdo the strong independent female personality , just for the sake of it , robbing the characters depth and transforming them into a trope . it would be as boring and lifeless as a generic male power fantasy .

19. i had just got into college and knew the absolute difficulty of paying . i knew the process and knew how excited those little tots would be . also it  s just so damn drawn out . mad respect to bj novak for directing it .

20. no , but the stereotype is filled and this movie seems to be leaning very heavily in girl power bo peep not a soft woman any more . they didn  t do that with jesse , they just introduced a great character that was female . this is forceful feminism and it  s achieving the opposite affect . that  s what he  s saying . now stop being defensive .
