1. my eyes are bleeding . even if all these emojis are a part of the joke which just makes no sense in this case , it ' s still really painful to see

2. the vaping itself , actually . all i care about is a device that works . if it works , i ' m happy as a clam . nobody bothers me about vaping . in fact , i get more condescension amongst vapers than smokers . everyone else seems either really interested or just minds their own business .

3. it  s actually insane to me how ppl call tat waiter a creep and suggest op should report him to the restaurant . with the given info the waiter really might have just tried to be as friendly as possible  maybe just really likes kids  has grandchildren himself . he even gave her a desert for free , jesus . just to be stigmatized for being a pedophile , potentially being fired ? op , yta .

4. or maybe you ' re just an exception oboe player ? i guess i was just told it ' s really hard to get the correct sounds . since the mouth piece is so small and all that jazz .

6. thanks ! thankfully i have no problem rolling the arabic " r " . it just sounds really funny when some westerners can ' t pronounce it properly haha

8. if you found them because you were also using the app , then you can ' t really be mad , but you should definitely talk , discuss being open , or just break up . if someone else found them and showed you , just break up .

9. lsd made me realize that i was overthinking most everything , and that most problems like that are just made up in your head . it really changes your mindset . would highly recommend taking lsd  mushrooms at least once .

10. that thread proved what i had always suspected . every guy has that anxiety about getting close to a girl , because all too frequently we remove their clothes and find them in an advanced state of decay . the worst part is when they were super cool with you all day , and you really wanna give them head , so you just grit through it even though you wanna puke until you die . i once had to shave off my beloves beard because i couldn ' t get my ex ' s stench out of it . never again .

12. i can only assume you  re a trumper . i understand , must be hard facing the realisation that your kind really are just that stupid
   (ID: 0d99e55d248b22b36494cf228f301ceed6d7b141)

13. nudes shouldn ' t really be required . when you ' re in a relationship , just the thought of em ' makes you happy . counting the days till you get to see em ' again .

14. not really , it ' s not all that uncommon in the lesbian community if you ' re in a relationship . which she is , just definitely not with me . we each have a wife at home .

16. tardiness . i slept through my alarm constantly . they wanted me to go to a specialist but i was really just doing a shit ton of cocaine and staying up all night . i have regrets . it was at my university so the benefits were un  matched .

17. that ' s not really her goal though , is it ? if westeros was being run by a benevolent ruler , she would still be invading the continent to reclaim the iron throne . she just happens to have lucked out that someone worse than her is currently in power .
