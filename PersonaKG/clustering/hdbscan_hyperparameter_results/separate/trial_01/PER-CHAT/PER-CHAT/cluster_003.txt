5. i used to be an extreme example of this . i ' d assume intercourse meant he loved me and ultimately wanted to marry and have kids with me . thank god for guy friends setting me straight . main reason to disclose and have some sort of talk is to filter out girls who think the way i used to . they may not be stalker psychos but were simply raised with a certain set of beliefs and have peers who share them .

8. i was thinking something similar . it was difficult to see the way a lot of the americans think . it was also hard to not respond to any of them . what would be the point . my words won ' t change the way they think .

10. it is . i think it should stay that way , though . it should cost either less stamina or be nearly instant instead of its current state .

12. your friend convinces your other friends it is a horse . they convince their friends it is a horse . this continues until all cows become horses . you become ostracized because you won ' t believe what they do . i think this is a valid analogy of how religions actually began . and i simply see it happening with atheists billboards , bus sides , site and paper ads , even a proliferation of conversations like these growing exponentially online . i think that it is possible that atheism is becoming a belief system because of those who fanatically sorry , but it is true attack theists because the theists will not come over to their way of thinking and believing .
   (ID: b70c0c020fa60fd16329a7c04f4d71a7514815c1)

13. and that codependent person you speak of becomes that person who complains and riots and protests everything because they think they are entitled to everything and should always get their way . i bet you ' re pro participation award as well . hate to break it to you not everyone ' s a winner

   (ID: f3c4ada6e1f0e3aecc57046ac6c587792642566d)
