18. i think you just solved where infinite shrinkage goes , its  limbo  , where you can be in one place and not be able to move but you can .

19. imo , it is a fallacy to think that drawing attention to kony means that one thinks he is the worst out there . even if he is the worst , no rational person would think that he is the only one . drawing attention to one of these lunatics just helps to put a face on the problem as a whole . also , cutting the heads off the hydra is part of what eventually killed it . one just has to remember that there is more to be done .
