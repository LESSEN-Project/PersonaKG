1. it breaks my heart so bad . the torture it had to go through , the amount of stress , the horrid human to do this . reminds me of how my cat got run over and we think someone sped up to run it over , people are horrible to cats but they  re lovely creatures of treated right and with respect .

4. curious as to how many people saying they can ' t live on minimum wage mean , " can ' t live on minimum wage in the city of my choice with no roommates , high  speed internet , a car , a flatscreen tv , cable , a nice smartphone , vacations to fun places , and a few pets . "

6. youtube is going to be your best bet . as someone else mentioned , just pick a topic and go . if you ' re wondering how brakes work or how you replace them , or you want to know the difference between engine configurations , etc , you should be able to find a video explaining it .

7. let me be careful here , i don ' t support trump . one argument i agree with from trump supporters is that news is sensationalized . sometimes you ' ll find an story that is not sensationalized , but in general we live in a click bait world where shocking headlines  revenue . illegality is thrown into headlines more than it should . it grabs your attention . then you read and find out that the thing that was illegal in the headline is actually something that " might be illegal , if we find evidence , and if it ' s not illegal it should be " maybe some of the allegations are true . maybe they all are . i haven ' t reviewed them all , so i cant speak to that . i can only speak to the sorry state of modern ' journalism .

11. ok . i ' m genuinely curious . what possible course of action could you have done differently , to " save me " from the " burning world " as you put it . that required me beliveing in you ? what possible new resource do you gain from my belief in your " prediction " that will stop the world from burning ? or at least save me from this fiery premonition of doom ? p . s . i don ' t think listened and end is a good rhyme , and it maybe would have helped your case more if you rhymed all your " song ' s " verse .

12. i never knew that . i thought the deworming was more of preventing it , but obviously what you just said makes a lot more sense . til .

13. the only way you ' ll really know is if you ask them . it could be because of doing work months food , it could be a green house , it could be a secret lab .

14. are you refering to the guy ? because i ' m not . i ' m speaking about the younger lads around him . " virginity loss age " really depends on where one lives though . here , the average is digit . you ' re not deemed a fucking loser if you haven ' t at digit .

15. thank you so much for sharing . honestly the fb groups made me wonder if i wasn  t worried enough about keratoconus . it made me question if i wasnt taking keratoconus serious . post referring to  how much do you miss your life before keratoconus  were really there to bring people down no lift them up thankfully with comments like yours il realize like im not the only who see keratoconus as something that sucks but i also making sure it doesn  t control my everyday life .

16. i have no idea about what happened to you . i can only comment on my own experiences . the staff i worked with only medicated patients at a physician request . they are the only ones that could legally prescribe . all medication drawn and administered is documented , heavily . so no one in my organization could " knock you out " simply because they thought you were a burden . it doesn ' t work that way . as for restraints , if you become a danger to yourself , staff or any other patient then for safety reasons you will be restrained . depending on the state or province the form of restraint will vary . some units will use handcuffs , others just simple velcro straps . any properly regulated hospital will ensure that restraints or even isolation units for that matter are used for positive outcome . never as a punishment . i ' m not going to say it doesn ' t happen because i know it does but for the most part in my experience things were always by the book . i can only speculate about your experience . if you did try to leave the facility and you were a level one psych patient then meds would likely be given even after restraints were placed . the number one thing is to keep you safe . if that means sedation then that ' s what ' s going to happen . maybe to get your vitals back or to help you sleep .

17. anywhere except where op works . i didn ' t even get a reprimand . the guy didn ' t ask to see any sort of supervisor . sounds like i was being rude , i know , but in my line of work , you can give as well as you get . its sort of the best version of customer service ever .

18. ! its the splash of brown on the cup , except its drawn to look like male genitalia !  for those who don ' t want to click it cuz they are at work

19. i ' ll look for some of these myself . gakkou gurashi looked pretty promising and i still have k  on ! as a back  up , but i ' ll look for some more .

20. so basically the only reason is so that people don ' t do the same to you later ? not that they have any individual value or right to a seat , just they are some sort of " karma points " for you .
