6. nta . you have explained you it makes you uncomfortable and she is not backing down from it , that makes me suspicious , especially the sharing of a hotel room . you are well within your bounds to not be okay with a situation like this , but not to forbid her from going which you apparently aren  t . she should be more aware of your feelings

7. more like for security . the reason someone would carry a gun is very similar to why someone locks their doors . if it  s that hard to understand , maybe you will after your involved in an incident that threatens you or your loved ones . most malicious attacks  robberies are going to tip the scale towards the criminal meaning they are not looking to present you with a fair fight . so for that reason , it  s wise to be prepared yourself .

8. it ' s not like there ' s anything else going on in florida .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

9. dude ' s an idiot . " i ' m out to prove that i can eat shit for cheap , so i ' m going to buy the most expensive vegetables to prove my point . it ' s like saying you can ' t afford a bmw so you might as well take the bus .

13. i would still like to see him get more targets , but that  s hard to get with the receivers he is going up against
   (ID: fe5860fea6be29c69501e1a97b1240375d594aa9)

14. seems like he has a lot of baggage going on . he ' s sexuality interested in other people and is likely cheating , or going to cheat outside of the rules . if you have rules like you do , you shouldn ' t be together . it ' s gonna get ugly if you stay .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

" and " what ' s this about the student doing something illegal ? "
   (ID: 9d1e879011bb23fa9a0cff4c99a536feb2705b86)
