1. of all the things i dislike about the sequel trilogy , the way it deals with the new republic is the worst . maybe it ' s because i grew up reading the eu , but as soon as i read the opening crawl of tfa i thought " resistance ? that ' s just stupid " and the republic ' s destruction is literally a set  up for finn to ask " where ' s   poochie   rey "

2. i would just go around finding causes that i wanted to see funded  succeed . that way all of the money went to the cause and not mostly to paperwork .

3. same here . i worry way too much and over  analyze . usually everything ends up fine but i just can ' t stop worrying

4. i usually just poor ketchup all over a manikin and stand in the door way with a large knife when they come by

5. it ' s not just that . this used to be a major spoiler , but since the recent update had a comic depicting it , i guess it ' s safe to just talk about it . during the process of creating a cephalon out of an individual , the orokin had a way of " leaving out " certain emotions or traits . usually this missing piece imbalances the cephalon ' s personality , resulting in the flaws we see now .

6. sloth . i have shit to do , but there ' s just no way i can motivate myself to do anything .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

7. it ' s not just bras , basically every topic that you adress too much would bring ads of that theme , i hate this too much bc none of these ads are interesting or help me in any way , i would prefer see ads of random themes that can catch my interest and motivate me to do that than ads about i ' m already thinking

8. i may have found a way for you to fix this ! mine seems to have just pulled off with nothing stopping it at all . maybe it is a feature ?

9. ikr , all of these youtubers talking about tryhards are in a way tryhards themselves or just too weak to fight them
   (ID: a443986595c715cd541cd3925619cb6f1e8ada83)

10. as i said , noone forces you to pre  order anything so i see no point of hating on it . pre  ordering is just as way to support the developers while still working on the game .

11. the bluetooth is just a way to cover up that we are actually talking to ourselves

12. hello . set me straight , please . i made that demotivational on religifake , hosted it on imgur ,  uploaded it to reddit . is that against house rules ? not arguing , just a n00b trying to find his way . tia .
   (ID: 807daa9c9df114ba43db968bbc903d1a597f67e7)

13. is that actually what ends up happening , or is that just the idea ? i still haven ' t watched those movies , haven ' t figured out a legal way to do so cheaply so i can ' t speak at all to what goes on in iw .

14. but the left has a ' my way or the highway ' mentality do you not even realize how biased you just were ?
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

15. wow that is probably the winner . that  s rough my man . i also try to be wary of the stuff that  s hyped up . if investment tips are trickling all the way down to little old me it  s probably either too late to get a profit or just a complete dud .
   (ID: faebbe18abd4d1c69e3bb9106178f797255444c5)

16. because of nerves or are you just trying to break a bad habit ? either way congrats .

17. so i had this fieldtrip and we were in this bus . on the way home from the fieldtrip in the bus this girl i sat next to fell asleep on my shoulders . i barely knew her and she had a boyfriend . of course my friends noticed and laughed at me . i didn ' t wake her up because i thought it ' d be awkward so instead , i just pretended to sleep too .

18. black panther . i ' m not saying it ' s bad , it was just way over  hyped .
   (ID: 78a7be65b9d2e7cebf18280c07d4f44e6f2b3417)

19. from what you said at the start have you ever thought of you having autism ? i ' m not saying in any way offensive it ' s just if you do then you could maybe get help for it or understand why you do what you do .
   (ID: 8b409a812bfe5e21e6e8924b5c822fc50d0d2c9a)

20. oh , man , i just realized that this makes canopy breaches way more terrifying since you ' re suffocating two of your friends .
