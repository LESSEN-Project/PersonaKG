4. the ice pack  fan works if you can ' t do that , then you can stand in the open freezer when you get too hot . if you can , strip down as much as you can . if all else fails , just accept the bugs in , that ' s what i had to do a few times .

5. if you had read more of the comments and gained a little context , the user is able to post . it is just that their posts continuously get removed for one reason or another . there is a rather large difference between being banned and having your post removed .

6. after reading your question again , i realized i didn  t quite answer what you were asking . for larger areas , i was thinking of putting a 2x2 framework in place , and then countersinking some smaller head screws to hold it up and keep it from bowing . probably not in every plank but maybe in every second or third , just so it  s not as much of a hassle if i have to remove them .

7. no , but the stereotype is filled and this movie seems to be leaning very heavily in girl power bo peep not a soft woman any more . they didn  t do that with jesse , they just introduced a great character that was female . this is forceful feminism and it  s achieving the opposite affect . that  s what he  s saying . now stop being defensive .

10. no , of course not . but my ex left me for someone else so this has already happened . i ' d never dream of cheating on my partner or doing anything to hurt them , but apparently it ' s fine to do it to me . just makes me wonder why i bother having morals when i just get shit on anyway .
   (ID: b42bcbaed0ea1f011b4d8c42d4ad9df732ecc5d5)
