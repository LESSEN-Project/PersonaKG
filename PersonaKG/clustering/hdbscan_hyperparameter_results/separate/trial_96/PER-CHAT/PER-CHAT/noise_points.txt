5. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .

6. " riley " i ' m sorry your day turned to shit . the crappy thing about fear is that it isn ' t always rational and when caught off guard it is difficult to act rationally anyway . i had a similar experience a few years ago which helped me decide i was buying a car so i didn ' t have to wait at bus stops and i have the guy half of my land line number and the other half of my cell . to this day i wonder why i didn ' t just say no . or maybe i did and he insisted . i cast it as a lesson learned for the future . sadly he got on the same bus as me and i got got off and doubled back to another route .

9. not really , but if you don  t like your life change it . take a step and talk to someone my dude doesn  t hurt i was a shy dude but still had a lot of friends . i wouldn  t think of your teenage years wasted because you e spent time with yourself either you probably know more about yourself than a lot of others . stay strong home dog and go talk to someone about how you feel .

15. well not really its the size of an ak bullet so its not like getting a . digit to the chest that would turn organs to soup . kinda all depends where it hits you and if you have armor and what kind its rated for . i have a friend in the corp and he was shot in the back with a ak and didn ' t know it till someone pointed out he had a hole in his sapi carrier body armor so its all relevant to the rifle and where you ' re shot .

16. oh man what a prison scenerio , you got punked in front of everyone , now everyone will punk you . you gotta beat his ass down 5x harder than he hit you to get back with a little extra . even if you get beat up at least you dont look like a coward . or  its just highschool and no one will remember in a few days . he was obviously trying to impress someone so it has nothing to do with you personally so you can be the bigger man and walk away , dont give him the satisfaction of retaliating . if it occurs again i would ask him why he did that . if he has a reason , try to deescalate the situation and find common ground . if hes just a dick and doesnt stop , resort to the first plan .

17. we have a certain sense of accomplishment to make up for it . think about it  we ' re mundane folk who figured out how to alter reality on our own . no bloodline , god or otherworldly being helped us .

19. well you ' re just going to have to get over your fear of her having a relationship with someone else . cause it will happen . same thing will happen for you too . it ' s not the end of the world . how many girlfriend ' s have you had ? i ' m assuming more than just her because you used the phrase " most recent girlfriend . " most relationships don ' t last , no matter if they ' re romantic ones or not , and i don ' t think they ' re supposed to . you were with this girl for digit days , that ' s nothing . you ' ll find someone else , or you ' ll spend the rest of your life debilitated by your fear of something that you have no control over . i ' m willing to bet that won ' t happen . keep your chin up man .

20. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?
