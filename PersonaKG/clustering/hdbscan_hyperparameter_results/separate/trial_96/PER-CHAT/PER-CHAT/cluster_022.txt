1. when you see a no soliciting sign , that is the easiest sale of the day , the reason they put those signs there , they know that they are suckers and will buy anything . remember pma equals opm , it means positive mental attitude equals other people ' s money .

4. i googled peekers advantage csgo on google , that video and that beginners guide were the only things that really suggeted peekers advantage . in a few other pages some casual people were discussing whether it was a thing . the only argument was latency and interp . there was nothing else . that youtuber whose video you shared only has 70k subscribers . he is not even famous or something . you clearly dont know csgo . there are waaay more famous and way better people . if you knew what you were talking about you would have given a more reliable source . there are numerous youtubers with hundreds of thousands of subscribers as well as many csgo pros . none of them i have watched ever mentioned peekers advantage . i havent even heard once in all those streams i have watched . i didnt even know the term before playing r6s , as a person who followed many of those youtubers and pros . sorry buddy . peekers advantage is a cancer of r6b . we dont have it in csgo . its only theoretical and practically inexistent with all those low latencies and high framerates . judging by the ratings of the comments in our conversation , this r6s community must be so pathetic . csgo is notoriously ct  sided , which means if you hold your angles properly , the defender wins most of the times . dont talk about things you have no idea about .

7. i ' m gonna be serious for a minute though , i lean towards against high driving . i know a few seasoned tokers who can handle it , but most people can ' t really drive high very well . there are exceptions though , and i would include myself in that . it ' s important to note though , that knowing your limits plays a part .
