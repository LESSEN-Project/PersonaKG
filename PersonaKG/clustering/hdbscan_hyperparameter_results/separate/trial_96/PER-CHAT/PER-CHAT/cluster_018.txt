3. we  re going to have to be used to barters being the primary method of obtaining gear . right now i think the way there headed is great and i don  t mind removing money purchases for barters . makes the game more then kill and see the killed enemy  s shit . although they could tweak those trades a bit

   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

10. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

14. i honestly don ' t think he needs any rework , if you are looking for a counter , hold still during the duration of his drone . it ' s that simple . if you get rushed and have to move then that was probably the point of the activation of the done .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

15. losing partial  full control of myself is a scary concept that i don  t think is just limited to me . you do you tho
