14. dude right ? most bees don ' t want anything to do with you along with a lot of other creepy crawlies you find and they won ' t bother you if you don ' t fuck with them . trap it in a cup and put it outside , that ' s probably where it wants to be anyways .

15. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

   (ID: 97c35f21c6a14bb50b6faae9a7b18cd5968c350c)

17. i don ' t normally do this but i imagine it ' s because my stop is nearing and i don ' t want to move in , only to have to move out again shortly . it may also be for the legroom .
   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

18. i don  t believe he would want me to feel guilty at all , but it doesn  t stop me feeling it .
   (ID: c391065478603a686531cbdd50568136a5e14508)

20. our city is trying to figure out what to do about this right now . they don  t want people to drive drunk and don  t want to punish them for making the right choice , but they often need the street in the morning for a market .
