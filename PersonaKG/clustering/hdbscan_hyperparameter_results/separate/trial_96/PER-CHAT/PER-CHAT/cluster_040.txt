18. is an extremely thorough examination of free will . a short summary of the link above would be   we have the intuitions that   the sensation of the primitive of actions , is incompatible with their physical determinism  a decision can only have a single " true " source  what is by the past cannot be determined by the present  if no single psychological factor you can see is perfectly responsible , then there must be an additional something that is perfectly responsible  when you reflect upon any single factor of your decision , you see that you could override it , and this " you " is the extra additional something that is perfectly responsible but these intuitions are mistaken , and make our intuitive idea of free will incoherent . however , the feeling of free will corresponds to a real thing , and there is a meaningful distinction between a man having free will say , choosing to eat chicken or pork for dinner and a man lacking free will say , choosing to eat chicken or pork for dinner while in presence of religious fanatics that would kill him if he dared to eat chicken .
