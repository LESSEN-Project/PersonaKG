   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

3. thanks . this actually makes sense to me . we actually leave ours out all the time and it just confused me why if we never wrap the chord up it gets messy

5. i believe it gives you a little bit more time as you still have enough time to walk under them before your timer is up and you can log out , and they would have to pathfind to you which takes longer than someone standing beside you . although i guess you could just barrage them and run while logging , i dunno .

10. this happened to me the first time i took the test . the only thing that helped me was to find something else to occupy your mind . whether it ' s a tv show you binge i rewatched the office , a new workout i started walking  stretching  and spinning more , or something else , just find something where you can kind of let your brain turn off for a bit . do that at least once a day . once i started that , i mostly stopped perseverating on something i couldn ' t change .

   (ID: 917dfa16e92ce1db67ec3f88bc07b87b70a36c95)

14. they  re wrong and so are you , because there literally is not a correct answer . sorry if what i said stung , but i hear it all the time from fans who obsess over it instead of just enjoying the show .
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

15. is the stoning for adultery pertaining to both genders ? because every time that i do read or hear about it , it ' s always the punishment for women . what if the man commits adultery ? not trying to toss gender  equality into an already cans  of  worm belief . just genuinely curious .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

16. sometimes when i type " just a sec " i mistyped and write " just a sex " awkward answers when there ' s time that passes until i realize what i said .

17. they are not quite playmates since they are pretty much ignoring each other . i am just happy i can have them in the same room and can spend more time with each of them . condescending karens are everywhere lol
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

18. my gf and i tend to devolve common phrases and words over time to more just nonsense noises . we can have almost whole conversations with bizarre words and noises . we often ponder that to anyone on the outside it might seem we were both handicapped in some way
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

20. it will be ok and just imagine the relief when it ' s all over and in the past ! your doctor will not scold you for holding off on appointments , she will be happy you came in ! even if you have the worst case scenario , you will be in the right place , plus most cervical cancers are treatable when caught in time .
