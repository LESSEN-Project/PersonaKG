13. i have not even the slightest clue what is going on in this video . he is playing a custom game where the projectiles digit shot you , he goes into the cinematic view then blink dodges a projectile and hits his own . it ' s just impressive because of how hard it is to do anything in that view , including basic walking .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

14. if it was this next month , i ' d likely just cry . our kid is due in digit weeks . i ' m happy not being her .

   (ID: bbb6fee39268cdbbb90618968b5dbe6dee839233)

18. that must be the ap  digit then ? i would love one of those . i have considered having frets put into mine as fretless just doesn ' t suit my interests anymore , but the integrity of the original design is also of importance to me . happy canada day to you too !
