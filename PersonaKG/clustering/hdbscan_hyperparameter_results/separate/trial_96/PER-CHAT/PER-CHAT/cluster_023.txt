10. i think you just clearly stated the concept of a ' starter home ' that you and your spouse are doing right now . as your family and income grows , you may find that house too small and if you are able to buy a larger home , you may do so .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

11. this question just made me think of the movie sleepwalkers .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

12. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

13. that ' s just statistics at work . if you have ever even glanced at the numbers to see how many planets are around how many stars around how many galaxies then the idea of any single phenomenon occurring once and only once becomes so unlikely it ' s borderline insane not to think there is life out there .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

14. it ' s not really shepard anymore , the shepard ai has much bigger priorities than talking to an old crew now . everyone would think he just died during the crucible firing .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

15. i didn ' t think this question would be interesting , just a doubt i had , i ' m glad someone finds it interesting .
   (ID: 833bc208589bf538daebb1a7e14d70fa8a3b7808)

16. i think so but just my opinion .
   (ID: 3e906e06d59fb5c2993270f0b4efed5b9ab122f7)

17. sure you have , just more in the sense of them having to be asleep  what do you think wet dreams are ?
   (ID: bd723644638296cdfc92c932fca8a0e0d4cc9f7f)

18. and then they  d likely sanitise it or not serve the food . what do you think happens in a regular restaurant when that happens ? they just leave the blood and hope for the best ?
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

19. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

20. i think a lot of us can agree " daddy " is creepy as hell , but the idea of spanking is just as creepy for me .
