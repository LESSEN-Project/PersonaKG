14. i was on overwatch , and i entered a game as any would . pissed off , toxic , and willing to throw a match at any costs . mostly because when i lose a game , i get a little too harsh on myself because i have high functioning autism . so when i lose a game , my reactions to teammates is like tyler1 on steroids . anyways , the queue ended came across a team that was running bastion , torb , sym pre rework , roadhog , and sombra . i thought we had lost the game , so i just went on team chat , and as usual , picked my main , genji . as soon as i joined , these people were so pissed off at each other , this two stack was fighting over what seemed to be their irl relationship , i assume this because they were talking about divorce and other personal stuff , and the three stack were a bunch of trolls . i tried to diffuse everyone so they can try their best without any negative thoughts clouding their mind . the couple wouldn ' t listen till they stopped screaming at each other , and the three trolls were , well , trolls . mid round , the trolls were picking on me specifically , calling me retarded , a failed abortion , and an autist . i muted them and quietly cried for the rest of the game , not really trying , because why try if people are gonna not only make my gameplay experience crap , but make me feel like crap . the enemy team ended up winning the first round . but through all of that , i unmuted my mic and suddenly , my team got serious . my team still analyzed their composition , and we won the second round . the trolls , who were throwing , are now playing seriously , and i started to make friends with one of the trolls as we talked in competitive . and the couple are now giggling and playing around , but still playing seriously . i never thought it would happen , but by just winning a round , we were able to diffuse a toxic team , and create a positive atmosphere in competitive . in the next round we ran dive and won the round in roughly digit and a half minutes . the team was ecstatic , we are digit min in , and the enemy team takes the 4th round , but surprisingly , my team isn ' t angry . then they got serious , we quicky coordinated a plan with each other and formed a dive comp with a bastion instead of genji . and we rolled them hard . then we played the same comp and won defense . we all were upsetting and popping off , and everyone was happy , the complete opposite of what happened in the beginning of the game . and with that game , i got a great friendship with one of the trolls that lasted now over a year , and will continue to grow , not because of blizzard ' s community as a whole , but the gaming community working together past their outside problems to work on a single objective , and that was to win . and by god , did we win . both in game , and out of the game
