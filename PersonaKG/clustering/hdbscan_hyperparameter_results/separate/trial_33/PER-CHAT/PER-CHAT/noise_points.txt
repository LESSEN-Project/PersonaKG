6. i was still kinda am a theatre nerd in high school . i was in all the plays and musicals . my senior year we did how to succeed in business without really trying . i played the role of mr . gatch . gatch is basically harvey weinstein . my friends and others seemed to love how i portrayed mr . gatch so they kept calling me gatch off  stage and after production . the name stuck . i added attack at the end cause i thought it sounded fun . its funny how out of all the roles i ' ve played , gatch , the pervy co worker is the one that stuck . it ' s got to the point where people think of me instead of the character when they hear gatch .

9. i guess my solution is that when a couple feels like they ' re ready for a child , they apply to the government and they get one . they could also have their own kids , and if they felt like they had a kid but couldn ' t take care of it , they give it away to the government as well .

15. the movies suck and yet people keep paying to make them and see them . sandler is clearly winning at life . who would turn down a paid vacation , you can bring your friends , you make a quick movie , and nobody cares about the ratings or end result ?

16. i ' m actually still just on the side of liking it , but it ' s getting tougher . gaping plot holes , uninteresting storylines , painful characters , terrible dialogue , such poor consistency of any in  universe tech that i have to call most of the sci  fi elements one big continuity error . and that ' s not limited to the newer films . just started watching the original trilogy after tlj , and think i have to accept they ' re just sci  fi films for kids . i think they have some really great core concepts to work with , but then the actual stories that are told in the setting get ruined by the issues above .

17. i don  t think people understand this . it  s important to know life is gonna change nothing will ever he permanent , idc what you say it will never be , so people need to learn how to push through tough times . mourning for a few days is good but you have to start grasping yourself after that as if not you will never learn to accept what happened and move on to a extent where it doesn  t affect your day to day living , i can say what a joke i was at digit i was so fucked up that i just coped with my friend being in coma with getting more fucked up . but idk how i would feel if she never woke up or etc , . , . i probably would not be talking to you rn if she hadn  t as i would never did a digit and just killed myself

19. i used to date a guy that would do this to me all the time , as petty as it sounds i would purposely not make plans to hang out and when he  d ask to hangout i  d say that i already made plans with a guy bff . only took a little while for him to start paying attention again . also a push up bra helps
