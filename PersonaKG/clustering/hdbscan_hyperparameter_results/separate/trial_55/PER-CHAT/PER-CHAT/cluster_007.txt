16. a shitload of computers and electronic could get fried if the field die than reverse suddenly . if the field reverse fast it an annoyance but not end of the world as we know it . if it a slow drop followed by a reverse and a slow rise solar wind might strip the atmosphere if that happen we are pretty much fuck ! not to mention a rise in solar radiation making it way to the surface so a rise in incidence of skin cancer could be a direct consequence in a scenario where we survive . what are humanity odds of surviving a period of very low magnetic field . not good maybe if it eventually rise that will leave some survivor . you won ' t be able to buy the next fallout game but it won ' t matter because you be living the next fallout game anyway ! loll

19. great show , excited to see where this goes in a month when we get by all the obvious games starcraft , cs , ext . do have one suggestion that might already be true but has to do with twitch . could you produce this show inside the " game " category and not the " gaming talk shows " category . since this talk show is digit  just about a the single game and not a of variety game talk show . if you do it inside the " game " i would guess you would get more people checking out the live stream . twitch might have rules against this but its my idea .
