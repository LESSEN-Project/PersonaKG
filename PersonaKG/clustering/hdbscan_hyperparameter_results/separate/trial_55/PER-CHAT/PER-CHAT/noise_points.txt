1. the judeo  christian god is an absolute of everything we consider desirable , to the extent that it is unattainable and conflicting , all powerful , all knowing , and all loving sound good on paper , but conflict with the presence of evil polytheistic religions tend to have gods that celebrate human characteristics and imperfections . unfortunately , gods that celebrate human characteristics like partying , drinking , war , and sex aren ' t good for " controlling people " everything good is attributed to one god , everything bad attributed to our humanity .

2. what about friends ? there will always be single people of all ages though . perhaps the majority of people you know are in relationships or are dating , so it seems like " everyone ' s found someone " ? one of my friends is single , in her late digit ' s and she has such an active life . she holidays frequently , has friends all over the world and is just socially active in general . not sure what her dating life is like right now but i know she ' s had a few spouses . she seems happy . she also has a dog .

3. how are you expected to play knowing that you got traded ? i don  t think it has to do with deliberately underperforming and more to do with just being generally out of it .

5. in all seriousness , like the most heartwrenching thing i could find at the moment . usually its anime cause they take some investing . in the worst part i watched how to train your dragon many times cause that one scene broke me , especially after such a heartwarming moment . for anime i recommend clannad then clannad  afterstory , that shit will break you .

9. i understand . i feel ya . depression is certainly not a dealbreaker for me , since i have it . it  s just that i  m constantly trying to better myself and get outside my mental filing cabinet of toxic thoughts . i try to be optimistic towards new beginnings with men , but the ones i meet are just bathing in their own sadness . even though i  m depressed , i know i  m lucky . i don  t think you should feel guilty for being sad , what do they say  you have to go through it to get past it ? something like that .

10. my problem with quidditch is that as a sport it makes no sense , because catching the snitch is worth too many points . nothing the other players do is likely to matter . as a plot device in a book so that the main character can be special , it works fine , as an actual sport , it ' s retarded . it would probably be fun to watch the first couple times just for the novelty factor of a sport people play while flying , but after that i ' m guessing it would get old .

13. and that  s your achievement today . you  ve made a healthier choice than millions of people around the world , people who would drink themselves to sleep . that  s something to be very proud of . even on my bad days , if i  ve brushed my teeth , i consider it not so bad . you  re achieving so much just be being able to speak to me , some random stranger from the internet . i know it feels like a stretch , but as i said , the littlest steps are often the biggest . getting started is the hardest part , but you  re already on that path by reaching out for help .
