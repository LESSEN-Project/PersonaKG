5. as much as i empathize for your situation , i think you should consider the symbolism of the tattoo to your girlfriend . that tattoo symbolizes a huge part of her life , many memories , the birth of her kids etc . to her , it may come across as if you want to erase that part of her history from memory . i know it would be horrible seeing her ex ' s name every time you see her , but if she won ' t get a cover up tattoo for it , then maybe try to change your view on the tattoo its self . it ' s not her ex , it is a stage in her life that has contributed to the person she is today . tl  dr the tattoo is representing a part of her life . you can ' t change it , so change what you can . your perspective on it .
