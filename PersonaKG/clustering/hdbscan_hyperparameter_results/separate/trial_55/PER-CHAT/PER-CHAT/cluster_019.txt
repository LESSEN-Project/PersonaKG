10. it ' s awkward because after the breakup , it is always weird to celebrate your own birthday by yourself , especially if that person was toxic or abusive . i just haven ' t celebrated my birthday in years because i feel like i ' m celebrating their birthday instead of mine . in the moment it was awkward too . when it ' s your birthday you get special treatment from friends and family . when it ' s someone else ' s as well , it sort of makes you feel like you ' re not unique or special in any way .

11. i grew up a pastors daughter and would still consider myself pretty religious with a strong faith . when i trip i feel the opposite of what you explained feeling . i find nature and people so amazing and perfect when i ' m tripping , that it pretty much reaffirms my faith . i feel like only god could create something so beautiful . this gives me a great sense of comfort when i ' m tripping because i feel so confident that whatever happens when i die , be that i go to heaven or just die or whatever , i will be taken care of by a loving god .

17. first off , i like the thinking behind this and it was really well thought out . however i think i  d have to disagree with this . i feel like euphoria is trying to be as original as it can . they make it like no other show that i know of , and i feel like they are creating their own plot . but if this is some version of romeo and juliet , i wouldn  t necessarily be mad about itexcept for the fact that fez would die plz no .
