8. you people will never stop trump . how can you people expect to stop trump if you people refuse to argue against his policies ? all i see is a bunch of people complaining about how " mean " trump is . the washington post lost their access to trump events because the majority of the articles they put out on trump have nothing to do with his policies and instead they just focus on trying to get the reader to become irrationally emotional so they can guide them into hating trump . maga

12. now that i  m done spamming ora on all your stupid jojo trashing , your memes are absolute shit and beyond cringy no one would find them funny and there  s not even any real criticism , you  re worse than people who hate anime just because they hear other people who hate it

   (ID: e9d73d2eb8490cec3e668bda1db9e716a061d73d)

   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)
