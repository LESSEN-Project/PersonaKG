1. wth ? you are given that much power , and all you can think of is how to cause trouble ? what the hell is wrong with you ? use it for something that helps people , dammit . save some people . deliver medicine somewhere . bring a long lost relative to his dying grandfather . something , anything , that doesn ' t prove you are an immature prick .

6. do you have any proof for who is bot ? you people keep saying that reddit is full of russian trolla and bots , yet you dont shoe any proof whatsoever . i think the collusion story has really left a mark on some people to the point of that they see russians and collusion everywhere

   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

9. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .

11. or it ' s a bullshit made up story , hoping that they will be one of the first to receive it . reminds me if some guy who demanded to receive his kickstarter shit faster than other people because of some condition . think it was shiftware .
   (ID: b25bdf3935142c93d642393810cba283ec3b801f)

12. when i discovered that there are a lot , and i mean a lot , of people out there that think the government can , and should , fix all their problems . craziness .
   (ID: 7f3ed7262bf05d9d101b2b917869b90e43710a7a)

13. or people that think he ' s full of it .
   (ID: 33483b17911ec063ef4562ae3263fe478eba6a2c)

14. if you hold people to impossible standards , you ' re going to be disappointed . what if the perfect man for you isn ' t exactly " hollywood handsome ? " you ' re excluding a lot of people because you ' re too picky . also , you might not be as great as you think . if you ' re so great and you ' re still single , there might be a reason . maybe your personality .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

15. that ' s where breath comes from . what else would people think ?
   (ID: 5218a6fd3b7d990775fbaa39249c20beea16f741)

   (ID: 40a3b3e3ead468881f7392ff22e867f06207755d)

17. people often hide names in screenshots , i think it is  was against the rules to include them .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

18. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

19. i think it ' s more of a celebration than a " get people back into the game " sort of deal .
   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

20. being happy and being usefull for other people . for me if you think you shouldn ' t be happy you are living wrong and if you think it ' s fine being a useless piece of shit you are living wrong as well .
