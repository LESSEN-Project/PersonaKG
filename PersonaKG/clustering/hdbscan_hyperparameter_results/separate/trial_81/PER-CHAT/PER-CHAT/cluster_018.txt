13. it will be ok and just imagine the relief when it ' s all over and in the past ! your doctor will not scold you for holding off on appointments , she will be happy you came in ! even if you have the worst case scenario , you will be in the right place , plus most cervical cancers are treatable when caught in time .

   (ID: d1e6050d6d7638f6662249831925c3a9185f210b)

15. i believe it gives you a little bit more time as you still have enough time to walk under them before your timer is up and you can log out , and they would have to pathfind to you which takes longer than someone standing beside you . although i guess you could just barrage them and run while logging , i dunno .

16. is the stoning for adultery pertaining to both genders ? because every time that i do read or hear about it , it ' s always the punishment for women . what if the man commits adultery ? not trying to toss gender  equality into an already cans  of  worm belief . just genuinely curious .

   (ID: 7dfa169bdfe2df7e214baa35fc2f2b73cbb10c46)
