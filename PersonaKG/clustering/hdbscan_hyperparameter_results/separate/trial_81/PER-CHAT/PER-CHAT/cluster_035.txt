12. i have not even the slightest clue what is going on in this video . he is playing a custom game where the projectiles digit shot you , he goes into the cinematic view then blink dodges a projectile and hits his own . it ' s just impressive because of how hard it is to do anything in that view , including basic walking .

   (ID: 9284af9896fed617d56596c55fb3ff4e8a4c8dde)

18. ok it very possibly could be runes . what should be my line  up then with my current digit  team ? it is toa normal . i couldn ' t play during the last free rune removal day , so there is some rune swapping i had planned but couldn ' t do . i never miss days but that one particular day i just couldn ' t play . so angry .

19. perhaps it  s simply because your opinion is wrong ? i fail to see how i  violated  rule  digit nor do i see how a the other user  s comment is  low quality  nor b how your comments somehow designate the bastion of quality . but that  s just me  back to regular programming
