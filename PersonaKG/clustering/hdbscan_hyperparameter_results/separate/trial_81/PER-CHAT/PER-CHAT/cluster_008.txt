1. it seems rather unlikely that a full  scale war will happen . no one knows for sure of course , but north korea ' s ultimate goal is state survival beyond anything else . the us will respond to any attack with the destruction of the regime , which is something they don ' t want to deal with . the concern is that if the us strikes thousands will die , and we will be left with a major refugee crisis .

2. i want us to be different from animals . as naive as that may sound . i don  t want us to operate on who  s the luckiest , who  s the meanest , who  s the most aggressive . i want us to operate on our empathy for one another . that ability should set us apart from animals . humans should not be actively fighting for their right to be animalistic . you should want to be as human as possible and look out for your fellow man . when present with this question , my question is the opposite . why do you feel that healthcare isn  t a human right ?

11. dude right ? most bees don ' t want anything to do with you along with a lot of other creepy crawlies you find and they won ' t bother you if you don ' t fuck with them . trap it in a cup and put it outside , that ' s probably where it wants to be anyways .
