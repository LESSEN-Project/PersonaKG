19. real are worse than atleti at the moment . even on paper , atleti seems stronger . real just has many players who peaked a couple seasons back like kroos , modric , marcelo , ramos and carvajal , and have become very inconsistent now . add to that permanently inconsistent players like isco , vazquez , etc . and compare them to atleti ' s squad .
