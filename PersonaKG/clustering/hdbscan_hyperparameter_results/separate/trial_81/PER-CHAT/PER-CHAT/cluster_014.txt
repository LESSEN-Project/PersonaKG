1. i think this goes a little unappreciated and xbows only could be really enjoyable i think .
   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)

2. yeah . i feel as much , though my friends think i passed up a fairly likely opportunity .

3. whilst browsing hentai porn as a horny teenager i was popping in and out of various categories looking for something fapworthy when i spotted ' loli ' without yahoo or altavista ' ing the term . ' pre google ' i clicked it and instantly felt sick , turned my computer off and worried for almost a week that someone was going to find it on my computer and think i was a pedophile . iirc i reinstalled windows thinking it would hide it . heh bad times .

4. sometimes when i can ' t think of anything to do and i ' m watching my little sister , i convince her to binge phineas and ferb with me so i ' m not listening to one of the dumb shows that she normally watches . it ' s pretty fun

5. whoa . x post to snowwhites . i think that ' s the name of the subreddit . they ' d appreciate you there too
   (ID: dfcca9c384a4fff7bbeb3cd1fb2f40aacb47fd7e)

6. depends on what they think i ' m gonna eat .
   (ID: de5db66359e6314e9bac24fd9a10ec1d49584c4f)

7. yes , travel would be impossible unless you were rich . why do you think no one would maintain them ?
   (ID: fbed02b3d7caf00e8d1533f452f8951cf390df73)

8. what ? i think you and the rest of your team have been smoking too many blunts .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

9. from what i heard i think tony says  some of us  , and cap says  not us  , but i can  t figure out who is saying  move on
   (ID: 11e562551d8ce916c649db9948355e07c68fed96)

10. well is it only when you think about kissing her that you think about being a guy ?
   (ID: 55510b17a4f0d7b5820e6f21287525ef6cd60994)

11. btw  i think your hair looks pretty great in the photo  especially if was not styled . i promise you that it does not look as bad as you probably think it does . i think it suits you and is a more natural look .
   (ID: b4052c69cfd7bf0df0101b2dcc97fc007ad28841)

12. if you ' re getting angry , i would think that is a sign that you do not respect your partner ' s opinions and their desires .
   (ID: 66ee9442886cf2e0fff8240a72749b2d87a5282b)

13. the ones least dependent on current technology . that said , still probably stuff from the 60s and 70s . in the 80s , those were considered " classic songs " and they still are today . how many classic songs do you think of when you think of the 90s ?
   (ID: ae2dbc0f768c4bbf71f7452c59522c05c2ccc74e)

14. it is . i think it should stay that way , though . it should cost either less stamina or be nearly instant instead of its current state .
   (ID: 6043d89c15dee029743b4ae46c3043e760e0fedb)

15. i can only think of wiring it from some really rich person  s account
   (ID: 215e84ecea95592e4d8f3f8e0619a61b503078c3)

16. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

17. leaving cupboards and drawers open is a man thing . we ' re too busy to close them , i think .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

18. it  s funny to me that there  s this obvious disparity in quality of plastic surgeons . we think of doctors as infallible gods of science and trust them with our lives . but then you see some of these obvious tit jobs and you have to stop and think , do they deserve our unquestioning trust ?
   (ID: cb8cb80756996949fe8fa5c308bb091367a0c6ff)

19. yeah it  s the one episode i watched . the one with all the karma stories and at the end the fire chief i think finds out he can do the same as that guy .
   (ID: 97a098bef8517b2080cad8aa73f738b95e795b18)

20. yeah but at least you were loved . not ever being love by someone on the other hand i think is worse .
