   (ID: ce7a661d87e9157748595ef19b5ea913ea96198f)

4. to be fair , i doubt most of us would be here if we didn ' t trust him , but i don ' t think any of us can make up your mind for you . read about him , watch videos of him and decide for yourself if he deserves your trust .

5. i don ' t think they believed i would go anywhere in life . i was never told exactly why but she lost interest and wasn ' t " attracted " to me anymore . not for looks but perhaps out of boredom or fear that there could be someone better .

6. thank you ! i didn ' t even think of vintage . even if i don ' t buy one , it would be a great way to learn about some of them . the vintage omega constellations are unbelievably beautiful imo .

7. i don  t think you can find yourself that way . it takes deep thought .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

8. i  m loving the very secret service , i think that  s the name . it  s on netflix edit  it don  t fit much of what you  re looking for , sorry . but it  s a spy show that  s pretty funny .
   (ID: 9f86d46891466ef865ef872c8dc59da3089a36eb)

9. you think i won ' t do it ? you think i don ' t have enough freedom over here ? what ' s your country ? i ' m liberating it .
   (ID: ce7a661d87e9157748595ef19b5ea913ea96198f)

10. yeah , everyone knows you don ' t wear a donald trump inside . come to think of it , i wouldn ' t wear that big asshat anywhere .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

11. don ' t you think that ' s a little assholish
   (ID: 1cedb012c7702cdd6cf28839fd31ce2bb1eea04c)

12. i have a question to you . you said yo are a father , are you talking about nofap with your childs ? my dad is such an angry person so i don ' t think i will be able to tell him about nofap .
   (ID: c41e4affc406bbc71e6c12aabf095d759b6dbec2)

13. i think london would be too urbanised if that makes sense ? american cities , at least the massive ones work on a grid structure , making them a bit easier . london is , comparatively , a fucking mess , not to mention huge . so unless they dropped a nuke incredibly close , it would be a nightmare to build a game world . maybe with the power of future consoles but i don ' t think it would be that feasible
   (ID: 6ab97df6bacac740d323c579b509de1838c5d332)

14. what is affirmative action ? i don  t think that exists in my home country .
   (ID: 841a375b464a5650f1c027d1c7ae73415228c6ab)

15. i don  t think so , as long as you can open it for them at their little check stand area .
   (ID: 3857340322f3015e4a24e7f6aa252884060f24ce)

16. obviously you don ' t care if you ' re insulted . i ask this question for others . what do you think smells worse , that couch or the under boob sweat ?
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

17. isn ' t this type of controversy and reaction to a manager ' s decision exactly the type of this that shows how the team is valued ? klinsmann seems to understand that he will be fired if they don ' t advance , to the point that i think he will be upset if he isn ' t fired for not advancing . of course , i could be clouded because ld being left off makes sense to me .
   (ID: e8a9698601228aac42dab1d9134099b1a5a87a50)

18. the lyrics are literally " this one ' s a contradiction because of how happy it sounds , but the lyrics are so down " i don ' t think it counts , it ' s too obvious . some other twenty one pilots songs would probably fit better .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

19. i don ' t think it ' s possible . i have always heard of plasma as ionized gas . maybe it ' s possible , but i don ' t think so .
   (ID: 2c5816cbbee60e3c348eb04900ea7453604cff82)

20. i used meditation about a year ago to help cope with stress and my night terrors , i stopped over the summer , and now that classes have started up again , my night terrors have come with them . i don ' t think meditation is bullshit , but i can understand why you would .
