11. i ' ve seen lots of cover  ups , but this video is new to me ! i do intend on getting a sleeve someday when i have the money to do so . some of these people incorporate the scar as part of the art , but i would rather just totally obscure that there ' s even tattoos there . i have keloids on my leg though , which are harder to cover . still thinking about what to do with those

12. i think you really don ' t get it . we don ' t want a significant other , we do not want to find " someone to spend our lives with " your post and your opinion shows how little you actually know .

19. maybe banks wouldn ' t want to store your money , forcing you to leave it all in cash under your bed so that someone can come set fire to your house and you lose it all and still have your criminal record ? nah , who am i kidding , banks don ' t care who you are if you ' ve got that kinda dough .

20. are we gonna get sane or not ? the wait is killing me . having said that , we need digit  digit more signings to be competitive and for squad depth . our squad as a whole is very poor in depth . we lost robbery , james , hummels , rafinha over the summer and have added just lucas and pavard so far . plus our backline is still not very convincing if you ask me , and roca would be ideal to shield the defence . i wish we had gotten idrissa gueye who is pl proven but it is too late now .
