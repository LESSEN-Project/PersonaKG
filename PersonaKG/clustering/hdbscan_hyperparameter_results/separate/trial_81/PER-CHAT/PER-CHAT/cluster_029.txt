20. see now you are just trying to bait me into political arguments . i ' m not biting . i will not be commenting on comparisons to school shooters , real  world terrorism , etc . it is insensitive and unfair downplay the severity of these actions so much that you can compare them to a tv series . these are real lives being effected not just characters on a show .
