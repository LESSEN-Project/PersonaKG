3. damn , i guess i ' d never thought about that side of things . do you think that the subreddits that took their place are poor imitations , or maybe that the old community forums just relocated ? disclaimer  i wasn ' t never involved in any community forums before reddit so it ' s a genuine question

   (ID: 1fb7025aaa0b620e024c8abbaecd72d34f8418b0)

   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

14. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

15. i think you just solved where infinite shrinkage goes , its  limbo  , where you can be in one place and not be able to move but you can .

   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

19. i think you just clearly stated the concept of a ' starter home ' that you and your spouse are doing right now . as your family and income grows , you may find that house too small and if you are able to buy a larger home , you may do so .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

20. how well someone speaks in a beauty pageant is irrelevant to my point , i wasn ' t trying to point out everything about each topic . plus it is just an idea , i think you are taking it a little too serious .
