2. yeah , i ' ve thought about this a good bit . the only thing i can figure is that for women ' s bodies , i have neither attraction nor familiarity . for straight people , the people they are unattracted to can hardly be very gross , because that ' s what they themselves are . then the people who are not what they are themselves can hardly be very gross , because that is who they are attracted to . not all gay people are disgusted by the opposite sex ' s anatomy , but we never had them in locker rooms with us , nor do we have any instinctual desire to be physically intimate with them . i almost want to say it ' s similar to that " eewww " that you have  are taught as a little kid when you see any two people kissing . not everyone has that , but a lot do . in my mind , being disgusted by the bodies of the opposite sex then is not necessarily entailed by being gay , it ' s just what kinda ends up happening because nothing ever drives is to get over that childish disgust .

9. there is a breech of trust when incest happens . family members are some of the only people in life who you should feel completely sure don ' t want to be around you just so they can fuck you . if you take that away , ultimately you will miss the feeling of being around people you know don ' t find you sexually compatible , but still like you anyway .

10. walking home after a few powerful cones i ' m a lightweight i could feel the energy of a person across the street in my chest , it was strong enough to physically mess with my balance . got home , tried to sleep it off and was convinced zombies were outside eating people . never been that high since like digit years ago .
   (ID: 864d1fa2ae2c7d60534e62e5a4b00fcb39a2c565)

11. going to italy . my wife and i have wanted to go for awhile . we plan to go for our 15th wedding anniversary in a few years , but if i found out i don ' t have a few years , i ' d say fuck it and go now .

12. i . t . as long as someone uses the internet , you can really know someone if you know how to dig hard enough , which you can use for social engineering , for good or for bad . plus i ' m in reddit everyday subscribed to watchpeopledie . paranoid that everything around me could kill me at any time without a hint of a warning .

13. but can the picture just be from the best time screen ? and taken crappily because i don ' t have a capture board for my 3ds ? also , i ' m lazy and only really speedrun the time attack modes so the game will be the stopwatch .
   (ID: e53542ff680164cdf45964372fb47cf6a7d48484)

14. watching you walk away hasn  t made me bitter or cynical about love , but rather has shown me that if i wanted so badly to be with the wrong person , how amazing it  ll be when the right one comes along .

15. yeah pisses me off , but bro , lookin other guys here and their problems , i think we must be druged with happiness its our only problem ! they will probably fix with bios in the future , but i wont rush it . autumn maybe , digit , digit bios out . i cant risk to fck the system .

16. if you like being outside , hiking is a pretty great way to get your mind off things but the best thing to do is to always keep yourself busy doing something !

17. if you honestly expect me to sit here and believe then you got another thing coming . what you just told me was some straight up mgtow shit . now building yourself is a good thing . it ' s always good to live your life and learn new experiences , but flaunting it in order to get women won ' t attract the right women . i don ' t have to look like guys on the media to get a girl . guess what ? i ' m not and i can accept that . i don ' t want to be that guy . girls have the right to choose who they want and so do we . i rather live my life how i want to , than live a lie to make a girl happy . stop going around and telling bullshit lies just because you ' ve been rejected .

18. the older gens are " hated " by the younger fans due to lavk of nostalgia , i personally do not like gen i because i didn ' t start with it . it might be similar with most people
   (ID: 2e2a44cdfc726423ec202a2fe420543af441d1ad)

19. i see what you are saying . i don ' t think people should treat people badly at all . i always am in the middle of a lot of hate . some of my friends hate some other of my friends and it just gets really complicated . i don ' t think you are a bad person at all . i think you are one of the funniest , kind , most sincere pesron i have ever met ! just do what you find happy the most and you will succeed in life .

20. yes , i would do it in an instant . sorry to be depressing , but i ' ve already tried committing suicide for this reason . i was and am tired of waiting for whatever is beyond this life . as a person who lives kindly , i feel i have already learned what i was supposed to . i see that " reality " is intentionally vague  every answer poses even more questions . to search unendingly for answers in this life would drive someone to insanity as they roller coaster between enlightenment and confusion . tl  dr i already want to learn what is next by dying .
