1. my opinion on the subject tends to piss people off to begin with  i hate it that any single group has been indoctrinated by judeo  christian hegemony and then adopts it as if it  s their own bias . african , afro  caribbean , and african americans are the unfortunate prime example , but it also extends to native and aboriginal peoples across the world . the british , spanish , dutch and french came in , installed  buggery  and  sodomy  laws which criminalized homosexuality . the european dominion of the overseas territories brought with it puritanical religion which became deeply entrenched and persisted  in most cases still persists to this day . i wouldn  t blame these communities for a second , most of them had third genders and  or never had a prohibition on homosexuality until white people told them to . and the rest is history .
