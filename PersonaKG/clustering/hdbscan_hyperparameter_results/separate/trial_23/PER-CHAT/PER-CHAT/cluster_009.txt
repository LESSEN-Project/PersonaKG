16. oh totally , lust at first sight is common . in fact , it ' s probably what leads to the ' love at first sight ' myth . when you have that kind of animal attraction to someone , it can help keep a relationship strong .

19. i had philophobia . i don ' t know if i still have it . it ' s basically the fear of love . i have it because of my parents . i had to watch them constantly argue . their sick relationship and the fact that they hardly ever showed any signs they loved me , caused some brain damage to me and now i usually can ' t listen when somebody is talking about love , especially very traditional love . i hate family as a unit and i hope i will never have children . also i find newborn babies disgusting because they are kinda a " a fruit of love " .

20. ps i love you . the best critical review i read about it was  " go see p . s . i love you , or you could hit yourself on the head with a meat mallet " that describes the movie perfectly .
