4. actually , it  s completely reasonable . let me break it down for your you . communication is not what you say , but how you say it . so when i say ,  want to watch a movie ?  it means something else . at least it did back in the day . so take your condescending virgin ass and masturbate to your anime girls or whatever the fuck you do now .

5. ' toilet ' is a lower middle  class thing to say . ' non u ' . if you ' re middle class , its a lavatory . if you ' re posh  its a ' loo ' . if you ' re lower class its a bog or a lav . its complicated . betjeman did a great poem sending up some horrible nouveau riche woman who said things like ' serviette ' instead of the more ' proper ' ' napkin ' . edit  not larkin  betjeman . as if anybody cares ! its that sort of thing .
