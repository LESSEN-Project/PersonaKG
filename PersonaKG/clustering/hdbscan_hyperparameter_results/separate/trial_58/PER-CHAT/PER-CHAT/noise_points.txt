5. yes ! having it go right to the back and then swallowing immediately is definitely the best method because you don ' t have to really taste it that much . however , funny story , once it was shooting straight to the back of my throat and a drop hit me straight in my gag reflex . i nearly vomitted up a mouthful of man butter .

8. gorgoroth  jeez , what is there to say about these guys ? unholy satanic demon  worshippers gorgoroth have been on replay for quite a while now for me . i really enjoy gaahl  era gorgoroth because his vocals are the most identifiable and unique of all the vocalists that the band has had . if you ' re looking for old  school digit ' s norwegian black metal , look no farther than their album antichrist . if you are more into better production and a more modern take on the style , i recommend ad majorem sathanas gloriam . eluveitie  so i discovered this band through the wonders of the internet . they play a particularly interesting style of folk metal because it ' s more folk than melodic death metal . i find with most other folk metal , it is more slanted to the melodeath e . g . ensiferum , finntroll , etc . i don ' t know much of their history or library , but i highly recommend the album helvetios .

11. i have only done it a few times and i try to be discreet and watch it while filming . the last time was last year and i posted it to the fan group on fb and youtube . i try to enjoy a live show when i am there but sometimes you get a good seat with a great view and your favorite song comes on and everyone in the venue sings along and you are glad you taped it . i don ' t get those people who film the entire show , especially in portrait orientation .

14. you  re right . the mother was upset that she was feeding it to her kid everyday , and the kid was gaining weight and was in poor health . you fed your kid chocolate everyday . what the hell did you think would happen

17. azumanga daioh  if you ignore all the obviously ridiculous bits , like all the sexual innuendo and physical abuse , then what is left over is actually a surprisingly accurate portrayal of what school is like there .
