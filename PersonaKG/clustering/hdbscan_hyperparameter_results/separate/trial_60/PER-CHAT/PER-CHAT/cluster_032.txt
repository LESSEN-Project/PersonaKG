3. i feel like it wouldn  t be so good honestly . i know i shouldn  t judge a book by its cover but the movie  s plot seems too bizarre to me .

4. i watched this when i was digit shortly after i saw forrest gump and i was struck by how similar the films were . each tells the story of a unique individual ' s life throughout history and the women he loves . however where zemeckis is overly sappy and a bit to hookey , fincher makes a much more subdued version with a whole lot more nuance . both pitt and blanchett give stellar performances and i wish we talked about their performances more . additionally , this is a lot more visual than zemeckis ' s film with blanchett ' s gazebo dance scene being a real highlight of fincher ' s visual style . all in all i like this a lot more than forrest gump and i think people deserve to give it another chance .

5. it has significantly more edm than the first two albums but i still like it better than infamous . i ' m not sure this band will ever get back to the levels of geeving , maybe if they get a better screamer because angelo sounds pretty bad , but i can hope right ?
