1. people are seldom rational about their sexuality . the flip side is that being in a relationship is so socialized into people from an early age that they fail to recognize that it  s an active decision that you need to make with another person and then participate in , the latter involving a continuous renewal of  wanting it  . you can look at others and feel sexually charged ! that  s human , but failing to recognize the decision you  ve made to be in a relationship is an active process is something that a lot of people end up screwing up . it  s not to make it sound like a chore ! certainly too there are other configurations of and agreements to relationships , but the primary recognition , as far as i  m concerned , is that you have to be an adult and responsible for making a choice to be in it . otherwise , why bother ?

2. i used to be an extreme example of this . i ' d assume intercourse meant he loved me and ultimately wanted to marry and have kids with me . thank god for guy friends setting me straight . main reason to disclose and have some sort of talk is to filter out girls who think the way i used to . they may not be stalker psychos but were simply raised with a certain set of beliefs and have peers who share them .

3. that ' s a complicated issue , to be sure . from my perspective it seems as though you ' ve identified your fondness for sm as something to get rid of , like a virus or something . maybe you should think of it more as a hobby you no longer have time for , although that seems a bit simplistic . in any case , it boils down to your ability to prioritize your desires . is having regular or even occasional sm experiences more important than the long term , stable relationship with someone you really love ? believe me , you wouldn ' t be alone as someone in a long term relationship  marriage whose partner doesn ' t share the same enthusiasm for such kinks . but that is such a small part of a successful , healthy , long term relationship that you have to ask yourself which is more important . have confidence in yourself and your partner that you can work with your partner to find mutually fulfilling sexual experiences !

4. as a guy , i don ' t know . i would never be in a romantic relationship because i like to do what i want , not what somebod else wants .

5. i feel like you don ' t understand anything about the human mind . you are objectively wrong , yes i am now talking facts not opinion just to be clear . when someone is in a relationship their brain becomes attached in certain ways after experiencing things so for an example , you cuddle with your girlfriend and you two both enjoy that , then your brain will start to crave that to fell good , but if your girlfriend stops cuddling with you , you and or your brain might feel like now it needs more out of the relationship to feel good because it ' s missing that important piece , cuddling . now after a long while your brain will instinctively tell you and make sure you know and are aware that you need to cuddle to feel good , so now instinctively your brain will want you to find someone else to cuddle with , but but you still love and adore your girlfriend but she isn ' t giving you everything out of the relationship so you need someone else to fill the gaps , it ' s usually not something someone can just control . people don ' t just cheat cuz they think it ' s fun , unless if they are clinically insane or extremely sadistic . usually another factor in cheating is that your brain doesn ' t want to ask for it from your partner because you may think you might not ever get it from them . cheating is still fucked up and wrong but you need to understand all of that before saying anything
