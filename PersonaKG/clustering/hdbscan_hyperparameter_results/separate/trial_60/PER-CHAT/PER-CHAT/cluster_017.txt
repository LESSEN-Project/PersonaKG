1. tbh you have a very good class for pvp right now . i just leveled my stamblade up to digit this past weekend and jumped into cyrodil on him . lots of success . i have played a mageblade and i have cp cap so i have a slight advantage over you , but with the gear setup there are plenty of good combinations and the right skills slotted you shouldn ' t struggle too much . just avoid jumping the 531s all buffed up , pick off the 100s and 200s cp guys riding their mounts or oblivious on siege . once you get a good rotation picking on the little guys , then move to the big boys . if you are running 2hand always keep rally up ! it will save you !

2. if your on console try not to focus on building the onyl way you will beat pc players is by outgunning them . just focus on improving your aim , that ' s your best bet . i know there was some console fortnite player in season digit that was clapping everybody because he would just get close to them and never miss a one pump i wish i could remember his youtube

5. i just recently began an unarmed playthrough on a kajiit . the unarmed damage is insane if you do things right , and it ' s lots of fun to use the wrestling move finishers . the youtube channel fudgemuppet has loads of ideas for new and interesting builds . i strongly suggest checking them out to find one that suits you .

6. if you send me pc vods i can still analyze them and give you coaching tips or just discuss strategy via discord , but i cant join games on pc . good luck finding a coach though !
