1. my mom once went to a popeye ' s where the service was really slow and there was bulletproof glass separating the cashier from the customers . the service was so slow that a guy who was waiting in line was able to watch a few episodes of daredevil in the amount of time it took him to get his food . my brother wanted to leave , but my mom had already paid for our chicken and she didn ' t want to trust the dumb kid behind the counter with her credit card again . the moral of the story is that you shouldn ' t go to popeye ' s restaurants in the ghetto .

3. i was working a food line by myself , and we got a rush of like 9ish small groups , and in the middle of me running around trying to make everything , a woman came up to the counter complaining that i didn ' t cut the crusts off of her son ' s sandwich . if that had been instructed , i would have done so , but i wasn ' t informed that she wanted that , and i was busy as all hell . the dark part of me wanted to hurl a knife at her and yell " do it yourself bitch " but i just asked to wait a few minutes , and i would give her a free sandwich , without the crusts . thankfully she shut up after that , but fuck , i wanted to yell at her .

4. a friend of mine was being a dick on a constant daily basis after a recent event happened . like he would criticize every thing i did like how i played a game or ate food or even laughed . it bothered him so much he had to say something harsh every damn minute . but his comments pissed me off so much after a few months that one day i snapped and screamed in front of all our friends " diego you became a fucking asshole ever since your dad died " and there my moment was .

5. the company i work for pays us to go volunteer a few times a year with a food bank we work closely with and donate to and what not . the fuckin nerve of some people that come in there is unreal . you have the super nice and just down on their luck people that are super appreciative for anything you give them , and for helping load it into their cars and what not , then you get the giant pricks who make you put digit bags into their brand new car , then when you get there they open up the bags and start taking out vegetables and whatever else they dont want and demand you bring them back inside and give them extra cake or sweets , or whatever they choose then flip out when you tell them that ' s not really how it works .

6. when i was a manager of an office supply store , the one thing that would truly send me over the edge is the entitlement of customers . they know that all you need to do is create enough of a scene and we will be forced to give you whatever you want . true story , an older lady came in with a printed coupon off the internet . nothing too weird about that as manufacturers do offer customers to print their coupons off from home . this particular coupon was from a very unusual source , something like unknown tech site . it said she could purchase a  digit . digit office chair for  digit . digit . that alone is sketchy but then i noticed it expire digit years prior to her visit ! i politely notify her that her coupon is expired and she went ape shit ! " what do you mean it ' s expired ! i am a customer and i am always right ! give me your manager " " i am the manager ma ' am and i truly apologize for this inconvenience . unfortunately it is against our policy to accept expired coupons especially from weird third party sites " " bullshit ! do you have this chair in stock " " yes ma ' am " " then give me the damn chair for  digit or i ' ll report you to your district manager " it was here i noticed she has done this many times before . i called my supervisor and he said just give it to her for the price . a little of me died that day .

7. two spots down in line at safeway was a woman with three kids . i heard " no , we can ' t afford that . " maybe digit times . she had no more than  digit worth in her cart . i told the cashier to take the  digit i was giving her and use it to pay for her stuff and give her the change .

8. i usually have to wait in the human line because either the kids or the husband has already eaten some of whatever we are buying and if we go to self serve i ' ll have to call over the staff member anyway to amend the " incorrect item weight " error .
