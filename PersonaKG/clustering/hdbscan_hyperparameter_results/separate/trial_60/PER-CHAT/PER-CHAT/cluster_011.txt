1. even the new tim comes as a gift . and no one claimed that this is more than a slight refresh . nobody has the reason to complain , especially when the new parts are going at the old prices .

2. yeah exactly . i personally don ' t really like the new design myself , but if people do , perhaps there ' s something there that i may have missed out on . perhaps some cool new feature i missed out on that makes it better than what ' s already here . i mean , if it ' s not broken , why fix it ?

3. i think they should make it epic and legendary , keep it the same in all the other ways

4. ok so let me answer all of your questions and give a retort . yea i stayed up all night to watch it drop . yea i played all the missions with my friends . yea i did get burned out quick because i played the game . those missions where a fucking cake walk and the work that you call her for is just errand boy shit that doesn ' t pay well . we have absolutely no verity in this update . look at it , it ' s the exact same as after hours but you get a not free casino . you have digit easy as hell missions that can be completed in less than digit hours given you have people that aren ' t retarded doing it with you . and a penthouse that is just another way to spend your money that isn ' t practical . the casino is probably rigged . we don ' t have texas hold ' em , witch is in any casino within my area midwest digit more fucking bullshit cars that are no better than the last updates batch . and a plethora of other ways to milk you out of your money . this update is bullshit and everybody knows it . oh and for the " passive mode fix " that shit should ' ve been in the game since day one . rockstar had every chance to fix that shit when they did gunrunning , smugglers run , and after hours . yes i do like all the fixes that they have done , those are nice . the only thing i want is an enjoyable experience that is filled with fun for all players alike that won ' t burn out after digit fucking hours .

5. i think people should play for the enjoyment and not just to win another uhc  like if you want to play dirty there ' s a cutclean game in digit minutes .  it should be for the audience .

6. agreed . i think this is good idea but i would go one step further and still have a qualification process . maybe instead of having to win digit games you only need to win digit and players already in the " real " wl cannot compete once qualified . love the idea of lesser rewards . kinda like the ncaa tournament vs the nit .

7. a mass full retail refund does not bode well for the franchise future . i was shocked at how out of touch fallouts makers were to what the people who loved the games wanted . it ' s almost as bad as blizzard was with diablo here recently and ea with everything they do .
   (ID: 570664fde0bec86b7f35fdcea9073ef88e78798d)

8. i feel like this would only benefit people who are late on their subscription renewal . could you imagine a new player or a person who hasn ' t or can ' t purchase a ps  subscription jump directly into gtao to find that they need real life money to enjoy digit  of what the game has to offer , or spend that whole time grinding untill the promotion is over .
