1. don  t worry about those digit b  s . i  m going to be a senior and as of right now my gpa is at digit . digit , i  ve not taken a single ap class and have made a couple bs as my final averages . you know whether or not you can achieve as in a class and if you did your best and still made bs , it shouldn  t matter because you tried your best

3. digit tip , be the " i ' m down " guy . overtime , a few minutes after quitting time , travel . those little extras make you stand out and they will give the overtime , most importantly keep you working . i know you were asking in terms of outside of work but this is the advice i give apprentices that always ask how they can get head or how they can make more money , but it all comes down to the same thing , if you keep working you keep getting paid .

4. it is an important decision , but you don  t need to put as much pressure on yourself as you may think . not all of the decisions you make at this point in your life are going to be exactly right , and that  s okay . if you don  t like the school you initially choose , you can transfer . if you need to get some of your credits from a community college to save money , no one will think less of you . just work hard and do your best to do what feels right to you . it won  t all be perfect , but things will work out .

5. try to get the ceo introuble , you earn respect amoung your peers in that way . working hours is just a suggestion , if you need to sleep just come in later or next day .

6. do it ! who knows , maybe you ' ll fall into another career path you love even more ! i took off several years after college before taking the pre  reqs . i learned a ton , had some great experiences and some not  so  great experiences , and am pretty happy with my decision i guess we ' ll see how my cycle goes . i actually think you ' re very mature  you ' ve figured out what might be best for you !

7. i  ve said it before but treat college like a digit houweek job and you  ll do well academically . you  re about to get a ton of time and that can make you think you can do it later . make a schedule . do digit hours a day of studying , writing , and assignments and you  ll do fine .

8. i say go for it ! change is good , and for your situation and everything you described moving is definitely going to be good for you . you don  t want to keep thinking about doing it for years and regret not going sooner .

9. i ' m in digit grad right now and i ' ve done a lot to get into scsb but that doesn ' t mean im going straight into a digit year . instead im going to a community college for my first digit years to get all my prerequisites done . after im done with the digit year program i can transfer to almost any college i want , as long as my grads are about average . this is a very smart thing to do i recommend it because i well all ready have digit years of cheap college under my belt meaning i well only need too more years at ussb before i graduate college !

10. i am the first in my family to go to college . i did ok but should have done much better . my dad worked to pay off my school through a small business he started . he paid until junior year when he got cancer . at that point i got loans . i came out of school with about  19k in debt . not bad but not zero . that seems like a small amount of debt but i hustled for digit years throwing everything extra i had at it . then i got married . i hated that i brought that burden on my wife . you never know what may be coming . will your car break down ? will you get  keep a job ? will you have tremendous medical needs ? you can get hit by a bus like anyone else . my advice is this . go to community college and get an associates degree as cheaply as possible . then go to college for your bachelors degree in a field you like may not love and that has some demand . if you do that you  ll never worry about a job . good luck

11. i think you just clearly stated the concept of a ' starter home ' that you and your spouse are doing right now . as your family and income grows , you may find that house too small and if you are able to buy a larger home , you may do so .

12. aasimars make great paladins and clerics . the bonuses they give work great for the class , so the la is worth it . dopplegangers have a la  digit , but to a rogue or a bard the racial bonuses are crazy good . half  ogre ' s  digit to str is great for barbarians . skulks offer a lot for a rogue . it really just comes down to what kind of character you are trying to play . if making a powerful characters is your goal , then any la past  digit is probably not good to use if at all . but if you want to play around and have a cool unique character , they can offer a lot .

13. get practical . can be a lot of emotions at first , if you havent done the process before . see yourself as a product and try to focus on value as worker you provide , present this value  skill to potential employers . jobs comes and goes . most scary thing is for those working decades and then beeing forced to change job or careers with very limited experience doing same thing over and over . the more jobs you change too the better you become in transit to new situations . your next job will not be your last job . be exited for what is coming even the unknown . good luck . as for hands on advice , just get references that future employers can contact to hear that you are competent and hard working . thats it .

14. i ' m aware of the risks of budget builds , but i ' ve got a   digit affinity deck that ' s pretty fun to play , even if not the most competitive . it started out as a  digit build given the dirt cheapness of the basics of the deck , and it ' s gotten about digit bucks of upgrades , and that ' s still a really fun deck to play .

15. the reason for my hefty amount into saving is because i wanna start building some equity at my young age and steady pay , but would you say it  s better to put more money into retirement or assets ?

16. ok , honestly same i ' m one year ahead of you , but in the uk , we can ' t just pick up a class . i figured out i wanted to do theatre when i was digit . i hadn ' t studied it for two years , and i couldn ' t pick it up . so i ' m doing whatever i can outside of school . but now i ' ve been hit with the issue of " how the hell do i pay attention to anything in school " you ' ve gotta look at the bigger picture . universities want to see that you ' re a rounded person if you choose to do that , so you ' ve gotta have something else to show for yourself . most importantly , what your dad said about some actors not making it ? no , most actors don ' t make it . it ' s ridiculously competitive , and you ' ll have to work multiple jobs just to keep on top of rent and stuff . or , you can work hard in school , get a solid fall back chemistry for me and then know that you can work a good job alongside auditions . then you can spend longer auditioning and stand a better chance of actually making a living on acting . if that doesn ' t help , then find something in the other classes that interests you . sure , maybe chemistry isn ' t your thing , but that one topic on equilibrium you love . or you hate shakespeare , but you find the casket problem in the merchant of venice fascinating . great ! find little things that excite you and cling to them for dear life . finally , if none of that works , just buckle down and get it done . accept that you will fuck up your life if you don ' t finish highschool so you just have to . talk to your teachers , reward yourself for revision , don ' t be too hard on yourself , but just get it done . it sucks but you don ' t have a choice . feel free to send me a dm , you ' re a theatre kid my age  we ' d probably get along lmao

17. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

18. it ' s ultimately your choice to do what you wanna do . i ' m just a digit yr dude , typing on his phone . that said , if you do decide to follow through with your choice  i think it ' d only be fair for you to know , that you can ' t reverse it and that you certainly can ' t pursue your dreams to find love , friends or an enjoyable lifestyle , after you make that choice . if you do decide to keep striving at success , i ' d recommend you avoid your parents for a while , at least until you find a friend or two . finding friends is fairly easy , if you ' re in the right mindset . people enjoy hobbies some like sports , some like video games , some like a tv show  tv shows , some like movies , and just about everyone enjoys a genre or two of music , but most can ' t talk about it for too long . hobbies and interests are something you can start talking about , to basically anyone , at all . if you wanna make an attempt at a respectable life  i ' d recommend you find something that makes you a bit happy . watch something entertaining tv show , movie , sport , clip online etc . btw if you ' d like to see some crazy shit online , i ' ve been here for a while , i can show you some bizarre people and some really fucked up music genres , that you probably don ' t know about to strike up a conversation if you ' re having troubles  find a long break , in a conversation or a situation where you ' ll be standing  sitting next to someone for a while . you can strike up a conversation with someone if you ' ll be standing or sitting next to him  her for a while , anyway . most people prefer small talk over awkward silence . if that doesn ' t work for you  you can start philosophising about whatever you ' d like to  i . e . meaning of life , evolution of man , what makes the general poplation tick , what the general consensus on morality is and if we ' ll ever find any form of objective morality and my personal favorite if to some small extent  we all mildly enjoy seeing another in pain . i ' ve put a lot of thought into that philosophy , but don ' t wanna go into that now . anyways , back on topic  you can share your ideas with someone best by asking a question , regarding your philosophy . when this person answers , you can pop in with your own ideas as well . . . . . last note  you won ' t have the chance to be a good friend , to make other friends , or to be a good son if you don ' t respect yourself . if you want friends , just remember that they want a friend , too . if you want a proud father , just keep in mind that he wants a proud son why do you think he brought you into this world . you aren ' t this special turd among the special snowflakes . you are as good and as annoying as anyone else . the only difference among people who are annoying is the reason of annoyance . tl  dr ? if you wanna off yourself  nobody can stop you , unless if you turn yourself in and get institutionalized . however , nobody can really stop you from being yourself and making friends , either . i ' ve given you some small tips on how to talk to people side note  it will most likely be a tad awkward the first couple times , if you ' re a bit new to this . i know the feeling . whether you put this comment to use or not is up to you .
