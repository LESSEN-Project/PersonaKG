3. in a word  no . writing is tiring for me and the number of stories would push the thread well into tl  dr territory . i ' ll keep writing these and posting when i can and if you don ' t like it you can just not read them .

9. the difference is , we aren ' t actually a threat to them . they ' re a threat to women like me , seeing as they constantly worship propped like elliot rodger and talk about how great he was . it ' s better that they take their frustrations out on themselves than another human being .

12. this happens to me with my long distance friend . i ' ve been friends with her for years but whenever she doesn ' t reply for a day or more i assume i said something wrong and she hates me . i ' m always wrong . i know it ' s a shitty way to think but thats how my mind works . i think part of it is because i ' ve been betrayed by many people i thought were my friends before

15. yeah , there comes a point when you stop giving a shit . other people ' s opinions be damned , i ' m not spending the half hour window i have in the morning between prying my sorry ass out of bed and going to work on doing my makeup and stuffing myself into uncomfortable clothes that are going to itch so bad that it distracts me from doing my job . i ' d rather spend that time drinking coffee and coming to terms with being awake so early . makes me a nicer person . as long as i don ' t look dirty or unkempt , i see no reason that my appearance should have anything to do with people ' s perceptions of my capabilities . they want to make that mistake , it ' s their own stupid loss . i ' m here to get shit done , not be a fucking ornament . besides , maybe i can be the message to someone else that your appearance isn ' t the center of your worth .

17. apparently i am the one who needs to grow a backbone , when everyone here can ' t cope with someone not giving them what they want . honestly , some people .

19. i own a meat company , we sell steak chicken seafood and pork , we set up big circus tents in the parking lot of the malls , when i don ' t have enough business coming in , i go drum some up . but why does it matter what i am talking to people about , or what i am selling ? all that should matter is , is it illegal , or is it not ? i have all of my required health permits from the state of tx . but this health permit obviously is not good enough for every single incorporated city who has a city council , who can make up any kind of ordinance that they feel it ' s like making that day .
