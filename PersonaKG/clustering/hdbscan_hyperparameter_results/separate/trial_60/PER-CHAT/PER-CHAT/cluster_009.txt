1. they should either remove the tac or rework it . i would rather they rework it though , my idea is make it more for shooting further away just like the heavy shotgun .  another way it could work is for bonuses for getting those meaty body shots . hitting every shot on the body should do some good damage .   x200b  pump for headshots , tac for bodyshots . also it should replace the need for an smg  secondary weapon . it needs to be a viable option or it needs to be removed .

2. yeah . it sucks that we have a particular feature to make something worse . what the hell is winnie aperture anyway ? and nitro is the most reliable shotgun we have right now .

3. cont .  we never actually covered this , but this is probably the weakest criticism someone could have from my perspective . soaking was an absolute shit system . like beyond garbage . unless you for some reason enjoyed having to roll digit  digit different checks per character per round of combat .   the new system absolutely trashes the old system in terms of ease of play and tightening up combat to be about what happens and not about resolving die rolls .   all superficial damage in v5 is halved except for magical attacks . so you basically successfully soak half of all superficial damage you take . then they made fortitude into a baller ass ability instead of cool but not stellar at low level and op as balls at high . it has an even build all the way from digit  digit . basically the whole game was improved immensely by this change , it ripples through to other systems in a way that is flat out better game design . damage , combat , and powers are all better for the removal of this cumbersome ass mechanic . the dice rolls aren ' t really the issue , i actually love the implementation of less dice rolls and already homeruled that into my games . fortitude is good , but the problem is what they did with stamina where it adds to your health instead of allowing you to soak more , only armor and fortitude allow you to soak . yes , you halve all superficial damage you take , but you ' re still gonna be taking a lot of damage without soaking . i feel like this shifts balance a lot in favor of offense and makes survivability a lot harder . it ' s better to straight up not take damage than have more health . one of the minor issues i have is that agg damage is no longer a thing , which i feel will mostly become an issue once the other splats enter the picture .  willpower being it  s own stat to buy was always janky and it  s better game design to encourage stats that mean more than one thing at a time . i don ' t agree with this at all , willpower was always one of the easiest stats to buy up via freebies at the beginning , i never encountered any issues with willpower being its own thing . i ' ve always complained about other systems basing willpower off of attributes and stats , it should be its own thing . your willpower shouldn ' t be based off of wisdom like in d  d , because sometimes you wanna play a character who ' s willful , but don ' t wanna dump points into attributes . that actually does limit chargen and character ideas , especially since now you have to choose whether you wanna be charismatic  manipulative and intelligence  perceptive or willful . that single choice severely damages the willpower of most social and mental builds if they want good stats in the other two . also the stat itself feels like it was added in solely for willpower , and then justified retroactively . this also brings up another point , they completely nixed freebies , which made it much harder to customize your character from the get  go . that was a huge issue i had when i first started making a character . i did like predator types and have since ported them over , but the lack of freebies felt like they simplified things too much and you couldn ' t decide , as a relevant example ' well i ' m gonna be a bit more willful than i otherwise would be ' . or , going back to merits and backgrounds , you can ' t buy up extra backgrounds anymore to really cement your character ' s past , and you can ' t increase abilities either to emphasize being a really skilled individual .  here you go , there are your rebuttals , maybe come up with some worthwhile criticisms that don  t hinge on  i don  t like change  , also anytime you want to actually demonstrate the game system specifically preventing you from playing your version of personal horror , go ahead and do it , you half ass cite the rules that encourage personal horror as somehow preventing you from having your version , something that you have failed to demonstrate and that boils down to  its not subtle enough for me  which isn  t really an argument either . i imagine you can find a way to make it work in your own way , you just don  t want to which is fine but it  s not a failing of the game system just because you can make something work with duct tape and superglue , doesn ' t mean it ' s meant to work well that way . it ' s like trying to play as demigods in a d  d game , you can fucking homebrew that shit , but that doesn ' t mean the base game is designed for it .  let  s not forget your entire conception of why the game was bad hinged on the beast taking control of your actions occasionally through frenzy and compulsions , things that existed in the previous editions and they are no more inhibiting than they were before , you just don  t like the hunger dice mechanic so somehow that makes you forget you  ve always been a slave to your beast influencing your darkest desires . god forbid the game fix the  better you are more likely you are to critically fail  mechanic in a better way than v20 did . oh botches fucking sucked , i homeruled those out of my games ages ago . nobody ' s saying they didn ' t , but that does remind me i mentioned that i don ' t care for the new dice rules either , but that ' s entirely my opinion . i felt like the changes were unneeded . and the issue isn ' t the beast taking over , it ' s the fact that it feels far more random now as well as constantly haunting as opposed to say , a slow dramatic build  up .

4. nothing changed ? what are you talking about ? the defensive meta is gone after all the changes . it ' s not as reliable as before to stay on defense . for honor is in a digit times better place than it was when this year began and there was no way to do damage unless you picked a dlc character and everything was shadowed by timesnap and it felt clunky . sure , they need to optimize conq ' s bashes and some more character , but even if they leave it where it is , it ' s still a fuck ton better than year digit and a little bit into year digit .

5. probably current patch apart from very minor changes . they rightfully so don ' t want to change the meta a lot right before such a big tourny .
