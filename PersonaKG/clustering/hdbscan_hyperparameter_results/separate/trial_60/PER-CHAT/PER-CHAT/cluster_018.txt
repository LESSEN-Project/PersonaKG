1. just caught a little cnbc piece on qcom that said they were asking for a stay and will appeal to the 9th circuit court . looks like huawei is strengthened by this ruling too if they ' re allowed to buy qcom chips . also that the apple settlement will not be affected by the ruling . what i don ' t understand is that qcom makes the best chips , leading in 5g , that takes a lot of investment and time . why aren ' t they allowed to charge for it ?

2. " i just don  t understand how it could possibly disappoint you so deeply when you haven  t yet experienced the game in its entirety " trailers are meant to sell a product . what we have seen is disappointing . what we have seen is so disappointing , we do not wish to experience the rest of it . " i guess what i  m trying to articulate is essentially an old saying i  m sure you  re familiar with that basically goes  can  t knock it  til you try it .  " we have tried it , a lot , many times . its fucking pokemon . they arent selling us something new , this is like taking an oreo cookie , removing the cream that everyone likes , just selling the disk , and charging more for it . " which is the approach i myself have chosen to take having started my pokemon journey as a young digit year old boy myself when i was gifted by my parents a copy of  pokemon red  and just moments prior to that , a green  gameboy color  that i still have and play to this very day from a guy who lives way up north that goes by the name of santa clause " well i guess someone had to rip the bandage off eventually . im sorry man , but santa isnt real . " it was on that day and from that point onward i continued to travel from region to region , league to league meeting tons of new friends and pokemon along the way ! i will never forget what pokemon has done for me " then why are you endorsing a game that will not allow you to keep using those pokemon that you love ? i mean hell , they want to throw your pokemon in a jail cell , and make you pay them to keep them alive . " i could care less about a few silly graphics or poor animations " honestly , so could everyone else . if dexit didnt happen , people would have let it slide , but if criticism is being dealt , people are going hand over fist to get it all out there .

3. although apple has obviously found a way to legally enforce its will on the buying public , this is unfair . can you imagine the uproar , if say gm made it illegal to change the tires on a camaro , without their consent ? if i pay for the machine , i should have the right to modify it as i wish . this is another reason i will never buy apple .

4. the problem is a closed source company trying to make a buck on something that should be free , aka open source . i could understand if it was something like fedora where they charge for support , but not paying to host what they otherwise get for free . that is a model that we have seen fail time and time again . ms never learns from theirs or others mistakes .

5. people should stop feeling so entitled because they have been " loyal " if such thing can be sayed , to a company , in the end is a buy  sell you only have the right over the thing you buy , not the creative decissions , or strategic ones . i agree with you .

6. i used to play offline so i could enjoy the game with no ads , now it  s like playing while online . forcing me to pay just so i can enjoy the game , i don  t like devs or games that do shit like that .

7. come to think of it recently all i ever hear is peoples bitching about the gpl . is there a legal reason that prevent linus and the linux foundation to ditch it for the kernel ? if they can and the license is so bad why have they not do so . to be honest am neutral in that debate .
