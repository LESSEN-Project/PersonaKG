1. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .

2. while i like the grand notion of basically forcing certain breeders to become virtually extinct , this may fare better for the other side . many people don ' t want kids and still can ' t get sterilised because they don ' t have kids . kind of a paradox . a really dumb one . some who end up with kids end up resenting them . i believe if those who truly want this treatment can get it , a large portion of bad parents would be eliminated before the deed is done .

3. right , because one gender has medication for a thing and the other doesn ' t , but it ' s all sciences fault , our people aren ' t smart enough to figure it out . sure we can fly in space but equal reproductive control ? pssshh . you can see how that isnt a chip on my shoulder , right ? like everyone thinks everything has to be personal , but . maybe it doesnt . maybe i just look at it and see one gender being pressured to use bc but the other doesn ' t even have the option . and i think it sucks ! i think it would be way easier if we could choose who got to use bc . maybe it doesn ' t work well for someone so the other does it . but it ' s not like that . it ' s a condom or female bc , or you are screwed . and the fact that we didn ' t even start until relatively recently , is more evidence to the fact . things won ' t be solved overnight . hell i ' m happy i can vote and live by myself without a caretaker man . but it is a process . saying it isn ' t a gender issue is ignorant , because it kind of is . either you just aren ' t listening , or you just don ' t care .

4. ok , i get the point of this and i  m sure it would help clear this up with some people but , if you force a man to get pregnant and carry the baby wouldn  t it be going against their consent thus making you the rapist in this scenario ? i  m not trying to put down somebody  s experiences with this but that sounds really morally wrong . not that any of the other stuff happening isn  t . i  m not trying to say something against this i  m just arguing morals .

5. i can  t say i  m the same as other pro lifers ofc , but i  m all for contraceptives and better sex ed . and the problem is that sure it  s in your body but it  s still life inside you and it telling you that it  s murder . and if you don  t want to deal with the consequences of your actions , do everything you can to prevent pregnancy  abortion . if it still failsabstinence works too then give them up for adoption

6. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

7. i want us to be different from animals . as naive as that may sound . i don  t want us to operate on who  s the luckiest , who  s the meanest , who  s the most aggressive . i want us to operate on our empathy for one another . that ability should set us apart from animals . humans should not be actively fighting for their right to be animalistic . you should want to be as human as possible and look out for your fellow man . when present with this question , my question is the opposite . why do you feel that healthcare isn  t a human right ?

8. do people actually think like this ? you can ' t control the sex of your kids . well actually i think nowadays you can , idk how expensive it is what difference does it make if you have boys or girls anyway . if everyone had boys , there ' d be no one to reproduce in the next generation .

9. fuck that . women who don  t let men have an opinion on abortions but expect child support are something else . it wasn  t the immaculate conception ladies , his sperm made the baby too . i don  t know how to make this situation work for both men and women . however , simply ignoring the fathers opinion is completely unfair .

10. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .
