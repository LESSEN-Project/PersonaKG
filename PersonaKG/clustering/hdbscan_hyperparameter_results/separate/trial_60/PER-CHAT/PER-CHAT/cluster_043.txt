1. first off bud , i  ve played since alpha . secondly i didn  t say anything was over powered , you do know how to read don  t you ? they asked what we thought was the best character offensively , it  s an opinionated post , the  competitive  aspect of the subreddit has nothing to do with options or thoughts . your assumptions and negative responses are the exact reason this game is dying .

2. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

3. actually i only wanted to talk about you and not to you because i know you act like a child and knew the level of stupidity would reach all time high like this " conversation . but believe what you want , i don ' t care . i ' m done wasting my time here .

4. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .

5. what the fuck ? you  re an idiot . no i  m not gunna argue with you because you are clearly stubborn as fuck . i have better things to do thanks . you must not make it to end game much if you think rpgs are ok how they are lol .

6. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?

7. a preferred pronoun is a misnomer . replace pronoun with name to see what i ' m getting at . your name , whatever it is , isn ' t your preferred name . it ' s just your name . if i call you something else , that ' s incorrect . a person may use different pronouns and names over time . this is still not about preference but accuracy . you use the word obviously but there is nothing obvious about sex or gender . appearance varies culture to culture , person to person . you have no standing to simplify the matter to this degree . but let ' s say you ' re right . you ' re obviously male and we should use male pronouns to talk about you . a trans person doesn ' t necessarily enjoy your privilege of the obvious gender . so that trans person tells you what pronouns to use . how nice ! so why wouldn ' t you use them ? you are not required to use a certain pronoun . nobody can stop you from being an asshole . you have free will .

8. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

9. i  m arguing because you say stupid things and can  t accept the fact that your post is not fun , smart , or helpful . you argue like a child and need to learn that not everything you say matters . you don  t want to argue , don  t respond . your the one who posted a garbage post with moron comments . you get off reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

10. so something that actually happened , is not a fact ? no wonder so many turn their back on god , they believe their opinions override facts . nearly everything in the bible has happened , with documented proof for most of it available today , but it is people who think their opinions override facts that choose to not believe the facts . therefore there is no answer that will suit some people until they drop their ignorance and selfish opinions . the stuff that has not happened , has not happened yet . so just because one thing has not happened means everything else didn ' t happen either ?

11. i believe that the origins of the universe cannot be explained and because of this i think there might be a god . science seems to be doing a pretty decent job at doing this , though . but generally , you ' re welcome to suppose all you like in the absence of evidence as long as you don ' t confuse ' think there might ' with ' know there is ' .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

12. okay , we get it . you want to change the subject now that you ' ve been called out .
   (ID: 8bc3c38873da8df8d450deb17fd3c4a602037c65)

13. our rule of logic is that literally everything in the universe came from a source . you keep saying this . what " rule of logic " are you talking about ? what is the rule ? how does it apply to your claim ? can you explain it to me , and how you determined it means " everything came from a source ?
   (ID: 00b878c3a1ec656c05e2872b35fdccfcfda3baac)

14. i disagree . truth is neither immaterial nor material . it ' s an abstract concept derived by our human brains from logic to help describe the world around us . it has no objective meaning , therefore it doesn ' t matter if anything material exists or not .
   (ID: b7ca8beb99c98a46de3704213b38cdcc44dbb728)

15. i ' m not an atheist either but the more i learn about space , the more i can ' t believe that our earth was created the way the bible says . because w t f there are over digit billion galaxies in space that we know of . the bible has all these answers about how god created everything and our one planet and who even wrote those ? are they oc or were they added by one of the million people who have translated  rewritten a bible ? but has nothing to say about the massive expanse full of billions of other galaxies that stretches further than any one person could travel in their lifetime ? i wonder if i ' ll ever figure it out .

16. thanks for proving my point . what point did i prove ?  can argue that there is good and bad practical result from the study of physics results from the study of physics atom bombs is not the same things as physics speed of light in a vacuum or weight of an elementary particle itself .  not only in the physical realm but the spiritual realm . what is a " spiritual realm " , what evidence do you have that such a " realm " exists ? where is this realm ? how do we access it ? how do we measure it ? how do we test it ? how do you determine what is and isn ' t part of the " spiritual realm ? you will have to show that such a thing exists before i can debate with you about it .  see how we don ' t agree on the basic premises of the debate ? it ' s not a disagreement , it ' s a misunderstanding , on your part .  oooh , edgy . i don ' t coddle delusions . you can piss of with your snark and get off your high horse if you want to actually talk about this stuff .  but . i can argue that religion is an evolved mechanism for time binding moral and ethical meta  narratives that has aided people in learning how to interact with each other and behave in social groups . that is not mutually exclusive from my definition .  in that way it has alleviated suffering for millions of people over thousands of years . again , not mutually exclusive from my point of view .  who is right ? i have evidence for my claims . you do not . there is no evidence for any such " supernatural realm " on which a lot of what you claim is based on , and so , i am right .  that you even refuse to see that more than one idea can be true at the same time means you have no idea what you are talking about . i never said that " more than one idea can ' t be true at the same time " , but it ' s not something i would disagree with . the earth can ' t be flat and an oblate spheroid at the same time . the sun can ' t orbit the earth , and the earth orbit the sun at the same time . fusing hydrogen atoms together can ' t produce helium and beryllium . it looks like you do not know what you are talking about when it comes to physics . i can point you to some reading material if you ' d like to learn more , but i ' m not going to give you a physics lesson here on reddit .  the real answer , for people who think instead of just blurt out declarative statements based solely on their own opinion assumed to be objective truth you condescending tone isn ' t welcome . if you ' re going to talk to me like that , you can fuck off and scream your nonsense in to the void , or go over to  flatearth where they welcome conspiracy theories .  is that the debate cannot have a winner because   the two parties do not agree on terms , like what " good " means . you . never tried to establish what " good " was . nothing in your comment talks about goodness . you talk about some spiritual realm , and then make some bogus statements about physics , which leads me to believe you are not arguing in good faith and just want to push your narrative . i ' m perfectly fine if the debate does not have a " winner . we aren ' t on stage in front of an audience , and i would venture to guess very few people will even read these comments . that your goal is to " win " and not to understand , again tells me you are arguing in bad faith , with no intention of learning anything .  we have almost no detailed records of events from digit  of the time period debated . detailed records are not the only evidence from which we can derive facts .  essentially this debate is a farce for hanging your confirmation bias on pot , meet kettle . the same applies to you , bud .

17. are you just downvoting people not conforming to your sensitivities ! we are the people you asked for " help . i was right
   (ID: cd0b72d117bf74908c3edaaf3947b089a9dafc0c)

18. i already told you i don ' t have time to explain the process of analyzing what people say . you can figure it out , it ' s not that difficult it just takes time . condemning one group of terrorists does not overshadow support for another .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

19. hahaha no , i ' m sorry ! i think i know what ' s happening . i didn ' t object to you using the term pseudoscience , but to you defining as science with shaky bases . it ' s just flat out not science of any kind , only posing as such . that ' s the distinction i was trying to make you understand . i think i might have been a bit clearer , but i ' m on the phone , so i was perhaps too curt . sorry again .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

20. . and you should , rightly , let reddit speak for an entire group of people , right ? you , as an american , aren ' t too bright .
