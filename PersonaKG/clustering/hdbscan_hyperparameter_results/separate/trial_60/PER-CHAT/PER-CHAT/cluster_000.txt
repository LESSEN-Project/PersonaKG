1. no , the short  term outlook is that capitalism is doing fine and working as designed . sure , class antagonisms are becoming more pronounced and contradictions are heightening but the capitalists are doing fine . there may be an upcoming " market correction " or recession , but recessions are fine and sometimes good for capitalists . workers lose a lot during recessions , e . g . they ' ll accept worse working conditions , worse contracts , etc but the same is not necessarily true for capitalists . recessions serve as an excellent disciplinary device of the labor market and just because you ' re struggling , doesn ' t mean the capitalists are struggling as well . with respect to the socio  political institutions , sure there is some intermittent turbulence but they remain relatively stable , e . g . the democratic party of the u . s . is collaborating with the other major political party and serving as a bulwark against the more radical  progressive wing of their own party . capitalism is amazing at constantly reinventing itself , swallowing old contradictions and creating new ones their wake .

2. well it  s insane to think it won  t happen in our life time . everyone is too comfortable the way life is and think nothing bad is going to happen and that there  s not going to be a world war in our life times because it would be stupid to do it . the rotation of highest country in power changes every digit  digit years . the us time will be up soon . doesn  t have to be nuclear bombs to take us out , all it takes in a large scale emp which is the only thing that the us don  t have defenses for . it  s not going to be another digit , digit , digit years of chicken . i can guarantee that .

3. chinas navy is absolute dogshit and they know it , if they were to go to war with nato their naval imports would stop because of naval blockades , which would cripple their economy . also , china simply cannot produce enough food to feed digit , digit billion , which means another famine would start if their naval imports were to get cut off . as you already said , china has wayyy too much to lose and honestly not much to gain from a world war .

4. it seems rather unlikely that a full  scale war will happen . no one knows for sure of course , but north korea ' s ultimate goal is state survival beyond anything else . the us will respond to any attack with the destruction of the regime , which is something they don ' t want to deal with . the concern is that if the us strikes thousands will die , and we will be left with a major refugee crisis .

5. there probably won ' t be a ww3 in the old world , but the us has been slowly going back to isolationism , stocking up on weapons and is basically preparing to go against the whole world in my opinion . on the other hand , russia and the eu have been improving relations and are more or less dependent on each other the eu  economy quite literally depends on gazprom . also , russia has also been getting quite friendly with a lot of middle eastern and central asian countries , so it is possible that a large war breaks out , seeing as how the lines are pretty much drawn .
