1. tbh there are a lot of 2d games that are better than hzd , such as super mario bros digit and digit . i ' m not saying this game doesn ' t have its niche fanbase that will replay it people such as yourself , i ' m saying it wont be the sort of timeless game that continues getting new players into it years and years after release . it will instead fade into obscurity . the reason it wont age well is , as i mentioned , the fact that it ' s a copied and pasted open world format in an already overrsaturated genre . and it ' s boring .

2. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

3. probably one of my favorite game . the combat and movement are fluid , and the maps are very well designed . if you want to play stealthily , the maps offer many different ways to achieve your goal . if you want to don ' t want to play stealthily , you get a large array of weapons and powers . just watch stealthgamerbr on youtube to see what i ' m talking about . great replayability , and the dlc that comes with this bundle is excellent as well  they ' re not just short missions , but lengthy sets of missions which introduce you to new characters and powers . the only drawbacks i can think of are that some people may not like the artstyle , and that people complain about some powers being op . also , if you ' re a completionist , finding all gold in every stage is a pain . for  digit , it ' s a must buy imo

5. it ' s just crazy rng . if it was a mode where it was bo2 round wise and you got all your health back after each game then it ' d be a lot more reasonable to beat . but asking players to fight digit  digit fighters that can pop off out of nowhere since they ' re a npc and can just decide when to tech every grab and aa any jump in is just ass . it doesn ' t help that you have to watch your character do his little dance every time you ko someone . you have to do digit fights and that ' s a solid digit minutes of just sitting there waiting for loading . hell , i ' d accept the game mode as is if they just made check points for hard and extreme . have it be a random drop like the current buffs and things but make it cost double the cost of a full restore or something like that and it can only be used once . i ' m thinking of this digit ways . one is where say you get to round digit  digit and you buy the check point . if you get to round digit and lose you just go back to round digit where you bought it , like you ' re setting down a marker . or when you buy one it just lets to do the fight again if you lose but you can ' t stack retries .

6. i was excited for fo4 because i have tried to get into fo3 many times before and always failed to enjoy it . i was hoping that fo4 would fix the problems but i was disappointed . other people may be able to overlook the issues i found with the game and enjoy it for its other merits , but i found the same flaws in digit as in digit  the most significant point  clunky combat . i can ' t really describe what " clunky " feels like exactly but the movement and the shooting feel " slow " and unresponsive , and they don ' t feel like they really have an impact . i found these same issues when playing skyrim and this seems to be a trademark of the elder scrolls and fallout series . the movements don ' t seem to really connect to your enemy , if that makes sense . perhaps it ' s an issue with animations ? a polar opposite to this would be games made with the source engine where all your actions feel more " precise . " again , i can ' t really describe what i mean as it ' s a subjective feeling . the ui , in addition to the combat , felt extremely clunky . everything from equipping items to switching weapons to navigating the menu to using vats felt like a chore . it seems like i could never navigate the menus consistently . i also wish they could have implemented a good minimap instead of the linear compass thing not sure what it ' s called . having to access the pip boy again , navigating menus to look at the minimap which turned out to not be helpful at all was a nuisance . optimization . i may be wrong here but i feel like i should be running the game better than i am . i have an i5 digit and an r9 digit . i have everything set to high or ultra except for god rays , which i set to medium . i set aa and af to low . i occasionally dip into the digit  digit range . i realize my graphics card isn ' t top of the line but i get better performance on games which are more or equally as visually demanding . i never dip below digit fps in games such as fc4 , gtav , and dying light , and i have the graphics also set to high  ultra with low aa and af .

7. i feel like i need to say something here so i will . all three games are phenomenal . when i think of a souls game i think of challenging gameplay . dark souls digit was my first game and i loved the shit out of that game , still do and plan on getting the remastered when it comes out . tried demon souls but it would constantly break on me so i just quit . played through dark souls digit and due to the changes in combat was given the chance to better myself and git gud again . it had a beautiful world that made you question wtf was going on . it had a plot that was there only if you took the time to look . these things to me are what make a souls game a souls game . i just started playing three recently and i  d guess i  m about digit  digit of the way through the game from what i know about it . its fucking awesome starting out already knowing how the combat works . but because of this , i can  t git gud at it because i was already good at it when i started . i beat gundyr first try . dark souls digit took away what i wanted from a souls game , to be able to proudly say that i got good enough at the game to beat the everloving shit out of it . don  t get me wrong i  m absolutely having a blast playing it , and i definitely wouldn  t call it a bad game . digit and digit feel like adventures , while digit , much like its predecessor demon souls , feels like i  m just playing a game to get to the end , kinda like chores almost . finally , how in the actual fuck are you gonna say digit isn  t a souls game ? have you fucking played it ? have you beaten it ? it  s just as much a souls game as demon souls and bloodborne . in fact dark souls digit is more a demon souls remake than a dark souls digit sequel , they just threw in the same item descriptions and a couple characters from digit . if you think dark souls digit is the purest form of souls which it is than digit , being totally open with a vast array of ways to start is more like dark souls digit than digit is . there it is , my thoughts on the matter . downvotes welcome here smiling  face  with  sunglasses

8. idk , i  m able to relate to nearly every message and character in the book . halliday  s created the most immersive  video game  in the universe and yet it  s so much more than that . people get lost in it .  the missing millions .  all just because he wanted people to like what he liked . and that somebody like wade who had quite literally nothing but passion and skill for the same things was able to beat his game . i think cline wrote every character perfectly , being able to understand their plights , i mean even sorrentos character was compelling , somebody you really wanted to hate . the references were insane . i didn  t even grow up with the old school games but the attention to detail was incredible . in an era where aaa titles don  t even come with enough content for digit month , cline was able to imagine up a place where everything was under digit platform , the whole world shared halliday  s creation , gunter or not . free learning , unlimited content , whatever your hobby was , it was in the oasis . i  ve never wanted something to be as real as i do the oasis . but the themes hit home too . the problems with being overly connected , letting the real world pass you by . the want and need to not let corporations rule the world . i just think it  s amazing start to finish . i understand liking something and later feeling differently but man , this book , i don  t think i  ll ever get tired of .
