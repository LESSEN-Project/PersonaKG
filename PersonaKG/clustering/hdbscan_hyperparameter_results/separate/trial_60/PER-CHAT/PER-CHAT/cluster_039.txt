1. move out . do you know how many people have problems like this because they live together first ? he has no incentive to marry you . you ' re probably sleeping together and living exactly like you ' re married . so either you need to take all those privileges and perks away to motivate him or let go of being sensitive . not trying to be harsh . but you got yourself in a pickle here . honestly ask yourself if you ' re in his shoes , why should you go through the risk and trouble of getting married when you can have what you want ? why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free ? old saying

2. i don ' t really feel like he holds me back , but my life isn ' t the way i want it to be living with him . i ' m gonna say the same shit everyone else says , i do love him and i enjoy being with him . but lately it doesn ' t feel the same . he ' s a good person but i feel like i don ' t really like him anymore . maybe it ' s my mindset but i feel like we don ' t have fun or enjoy each other ' s company . but if i leave i know i ' ll miss him and be sad . i ' m not going to go jump on another guys dick .

3. you sound like you are young with zero confidence . who gives a shit if he flips out . leaving him means you don  t have to deal with it . you really need to ask yourself why you love someone who treats you this way . if you really loved him , why are you posting for ways to make someone leave you ? it sounds like you don  t love him . you  re scared of him . you need to speak with a professional because a person who loves themselves don  t do things like this .

4. hum , talk to him and tell him how you feel , your fears , what you want and what you expect of the future with him , that you live him if you do . and ask him if he ' s willing to be there and take the compromise with you to make it work . depending on the answer just do what it ' s best for you and the baby . it ' s better to leave on time than stay and get more hurt . good luck !

5. you seem to have normalized his shitty behavior at this point . there is no reason why you should be working full time  still taking on the domestic role . if you weren ' t working , sure . but that ' s just so fucking ridiculous and selfish , " tradition " be damned . it sucks you have kids with this guy imo . i think you should leave him .

6. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart

7. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .

8. seems like he has a lot of baggage going on . he ' s sexuality interested in other people and is likely cheating , or going to cheat outside of the rules . if you have rules like you do , you shouldn ' t be together . it ' s gonna get ugly if you stay .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

9. this sounds like you need to talk to your so , you need to make it clear to him the way you feel and how you want to live your live .

10. hon , you need to think about yourself here . i know that can be hard , especially if you ' re a giver by nature , but it ' s true . if you don ' t feel safe , comfortable , and respected in your relationship , you won ' t be truly happy . and that may not seem like the end of the world now , but it will in time . eventually , bitterness and resentment can start to grow and you ' ll find yourself hating the person you once loved . if you don ' t think you can be happy dealing with his bipolar disorder , it ' s ok to move on . it ' s better that both of you find partners you can truly be fulfilled and happy with , even if it means going through some pain first .
