1. i see . i feel people want others to exercise to conform to their standards using health and physique as a dumb excuse rather then caring about someone being happy . ofcourse it is different when someone is obese but you get the message . also , many sports are boring and gyms are full of toxic shits anyway .

2. i call you a reddit groupie because all you do is make up information or try to discredit me and yet you have no basis for your claims yourself . any scientist will tell you that the best way to solve a hypothesis is to do the experiment yourself . i apologize for not having a phd in organic biology , making it so i can ' t publish an article and receive scientific notoriety . i have done the experiment myself in a perpetual grow , so my experiment was built up over time with grow charts  nutrient schedules being compared to lab results to find which nutrients best work for me as far as thc ratios . personally , running into carcinogen rates was a complete accident , but i varied my study around that eventually as well . let me guess something about you . you grew digit years ago under fluros inside a trash can and you consider the time away from growing as time spent growing . i have been holding the same argument and you say i am all over the board ? you realize that nh person shut up after he figured out i was right ? stop asking me to post an article and just post one yourself . i will post up my lab results if you find me an article . just because i have less posts and just digit days of being active on reddit does not mean you are a better grower than me . a reddit groupie is someone who reads things on reddit and acts like that was from their personal experience and thus acts like they have that much experience . i am sorry dirtyhands , but those pictures of everybody ' s plants does not give you their exact nutrient schedule , distancing from lights , environmental controls , and other variables . thus you can not claim that looking at a picture has helped your grow experience in any way shape or form . another thing , if you are going to use a level of vocabulary that is higher than your own , you may want to use a thesaurus or dictionary . substantiate is spelled s  u  b  s  t  a  n  t  i  a  t  e not s  u  b  s  t  a  n  c  i  a  t  e . fyi the catholic church used to say that there was no such thing as bacteria . they said that there was no science behind it . the catholic church also said science and god said the sun revolved around the earth . we now know that to be false and that they made false claims . in this instance you would be like the catholic church . " more posts " and not a " reddit noob " and i would be like galileo in this instance trying to prove someone else ' s theory rightnot my own just like galileo and contradicting what someone of " a higher power " dirtyhand thinks is common sense , but that " common sense " is coming from someone with less ability to comprehend information than a digit year old .

3. why don ' t we just dump amphetamines in the water supply ? isn ' t this pretty clearly a slippery  slope fallacy ? is there a real counter  argument to the ' better living through chemistry ' idea when we ' re talking about decisions individuals and their doctors make ?

4. just hear me out ! taking time to really think about what you ' re eating is connected to whether or not you ' re living a happy life . that ' s why i think it ' s really important . so , there are animals that are carnivores , right ? you know , like lions , cats , and vultures . you won ' t find meat from carnivores like that at a restaurant . why is that ? because its too smelly to eat ! it ' s disgusting ! listen up , guys ! cats are too disgusting to eat . are we on the same page so far ? on the other hand , have you heard of a fish called " sweetfish " ? sweetfish don ' t eat bugs . they only eat algae . they ' re vegetarian . usually fish guts are too bitter to eat , but sweetfish guts are delicious . it ' s because they ' re not carnivores . so with that logic in mind , all the meat we consider delicious is from herbivorous animals ! cows , pigs , and chickens ! the better their food , the better they taste ! which leads us to this conclusion . humans would taste gross because they eat meat ! well ? how do you like the conclusion i came up with ?

5. yes , that ' s why i said responsibly . red meat isn ' t going to kill you or shorten your lifespan if you do it in moderation .

6. that ' s not what i was getting at . i am trying to say that why do you think you have the right to lecture a person on their health ? do you actually care if they develop some kind disease ? you just think they would look nicer with less weight and you can simply say that instead of mentioning health . do you go around telling people to stop smoking because it ' s bad for their health ? as if they don ' t know that ? do you actually care ? i honestly don ' t care if someone smokes alot if they are not my family . just like i honestly do not care and won ' t comment on someone else weight and health issues .

7. i mean even the most ardent marijuana supporters must concede it makes people less active and lazy . what are you talking about ? sure , some pot smokers are lazy , but are they lazy because they smoke pot or do they smoke pot because they ' re lazy ? there ' s a lot of really lazy unmotivated people that don ' t use any drugs at all . how would you explain that ? maybe we could just blame video games or something else in that case ? some people are just lazy . you do know people of all professions smoke pot , right ? i ' ve smoked pot since i was digit . got a pilot ' s license , college degree , and have run my own business for the past digit years . just about all of my friends smoke weed and they have all been employed for decades doing just fine . they have spouses , are great parents , own nice homes , etc . you know what makes people less active and lazy ? being hung over . i ' d much rather my employees smoke weed at the end of the day to wind down and get to work the next morning well rested . you ' ve bought into the narrative that has been preached to you since birth . this , coming from a dare graduate lol .

8. now i ' m not gonna downvote just because i completely disagree with you , just could tell you in a couple years there could be some other group of idiots who don ' t even eat vegetables because would also be killing and say everyone should only drink water . whatever your ethics are , good for you , but don ' t try and force them into people .

9. i ' m sorry if i was confusing in my reply . i ' m not trying to discourage anyone . i actually consume soy products daily . i was trying to convey that if you are concerned with phytoestrogens you should check with your pcp . i would also tell a meat eater the same if they are concerned with a certain aspect of thier diet .

10. ding ding ding . youre right . thats what i was trying to say . the gov thinks the nic addiction is more minor than a heroin addiction , so they ' ll keep nic legal and tax it to make money , because thats what governments do . however , they think heroin is more dangerous and would prefer to keep it illegal rather than tax it . seems like we ' re on the same page here .

11. that doesn ' t prove your point . if i fit it into my macros and am still physically active there ' s nothing wrong with it . it ' s not like i ' m loading up a potato chip sandwich every day and shoving it in my gullet while i watch tv . on the infrequent occasion that i decide to make a sandwich , i ' m gonna put some potato chips on that mofo . you ' re acting as if any human that decides to consume an item that ' s not healthy is suddenly the fattest of the fat and the highest of the stoners . that ' s just ignorant .

12. oh boy lol . i don ' t fly anymore , but no i wouldn ' t ever fly under the influence of anything , even cough medicine . it would be very irresponsible for people to fly while stoned or under the influence of any substance . the reasoning is pretty obvious . you misunderstood my statement about employees . of course they should be working sober . what they do in their personal time is really none of my business although i mostly employ writers who work from home so i don ' t really care as long as their work is to my liking . my point was , if they are going to use a mind altering substance after work , i ' d rather they just smoke weed instead of drink . weed doesn ' t cause hangovers during work hours . i ' m not advocating people get stoned or drunk during working hours . you are just buying into the narrative , that ' s my point . you have these stereotypes about pot smokers that just aren ' t true , but you are still perpetuating them with zero basis in fact . there are plenty of motivated and successful people who smoke pot during their personal time .

13. you ' re ridiculous and making your whole movement look bad . do you want to know why vegans are seen as a joke to so many people ? because of the ones like you that are outspoken but can ' t form a proper thought .
   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

14. ok and that ' s fair , but from now on don ' t go telling people that we get our " big brains " from meat

15. i am inclined to agree with most of what you said , and i ' ll look at the studies , but i suppose it ' s partially what i was trying to say , no drugs are safe , legal or illegal , if done wrong . i tend to indiscriminately tell people not to do the illegal ones though , since they can destroy your life , in fact it can have nothing to do with the drug and everything to do with the social situations illegal drugs tend to put people in . though i ' m sure you know that much too .
