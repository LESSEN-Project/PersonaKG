SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:

Total from this dataset: 5

1. how do i tell a guy who thinks things are going well that i just want to be friends without hurting their feelings or making them hate me ? " hey , x , i ' m only interested in being friends " that ' s all you have to do . if a dude doesn ' t respect that and back off , or if they start resenting you , they were never your friend to begin with and you ' re better off without them . " leading them on " implies you ' re doing that intentionally to get something out of it . obviously that ' s not the case , so you really aren ' t doing anything wrong here . you ' re not obligated to give people a chance romantically , and if you aren ' t into them , it ' s arguably worse to tell them you ' re interested in them romantically when you aren ' t . if you aren ' t compatible and you know you ' re not interested , don ' t go down that path . however they react is on them , and if they get shitty with you for saying that you ' d rather be friends , they were a shit friend because they never actually intended to be your friend .   x200b

2. if you ' re getting good vibes when you do see him , he probably likes you . trust your gut .

3. simply ask ,  hey , do you wanna go out ?  guys don  t wanna make assumptions about your intentions and look bad , especially in a society where a guy can be criminalized for being interested in a woman . a shy guy will absolutely not take that risk , so if you  re interested , you should let him know .

4. the short answer is , get in and be the doer , not the done to . if he ' s wishy washy , unless you ' re in super deep , consider the fact that you are the age you are and the people you spend time with rub off on and affect you with you wish them to or not . pull back , give him some space and give yourself some space to evaluate what you want from a relationship . it sounds to me like you want a lack of games and a proper commitment of " we are together and we love one another , so let ' s make this work " it doesn ' t sound like that ' s the case .

5. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .
