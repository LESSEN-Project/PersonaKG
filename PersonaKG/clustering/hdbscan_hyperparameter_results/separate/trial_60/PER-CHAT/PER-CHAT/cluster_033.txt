SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 5

1. ultra necrozma malamar is probably more consistent than this . you have way too much going on . i also don ' t see why you run ditto since you don ' t run metang . also you need digit ultra balls

2. chi brew is better for single target  with serenity , and eventually when you get digit  set and a higher ilvl and class trinket let ' s say average digit  you ' ll want to run chi explosion  ascension for multi and single , as it just gets easier to manage with very little difference in dps . i might be wrong about the last bit as its been a while since i ' ve gone and played ww , mostly brm at the moment . the most important thing to remember is that this is a game , and   you have to play it my way or not at all   personal preference takes precedence over min  maxing unless you prefer to min  max and like doing as well as you possibly can .

4. abq even aqb would be great if you ' re someone like jalter or scathach with high hits on b . course if you ' re gonna crit with the arts it ' d be best to go qba . can see all the values

5. sorry i didn ' t mean rarely activated . i meant it ' s rare to have digit or more negative effects on at once . especially with vero cleansing . but yeah i do see the benefit to her 2nd skill . but i ' m also interested in getting my dragons team to auto . i don ' t think changing the lead will result in an auto ready team . is there a monster i have that would really help me out . su perhaps ? or maybe throwing verad into the line  up .
