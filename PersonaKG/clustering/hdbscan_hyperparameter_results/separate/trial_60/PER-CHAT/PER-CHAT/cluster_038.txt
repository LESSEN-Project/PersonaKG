1. you wont she ' ll most likely tell you she just wants to be friends and then if she was ever worth it at all will follow through with that .

2. you found a girl you enjoys soviet jokes ? i wish . such a dumb thing but i enjoy it anyway , man you just broke my heart . best thing you can do is just talk to her . by the sounds of it you may never see her again so what  s there to loose ey ? it would be ideal if you could just set a date that one day you two can meet up but that  s hard i know . at the same time life is full of those relationships that you are so unawarely fond of until they disappear . the worst part is sometimes you can  t save them . however those are the ones you cherish the most . don  t look at it on times missed out . you had a great time and should see it as that . it  s all about perspective . it  s only depressing because you see it that way . don  t forget to look at yourself from further away . i am a little depressed as are we all but i just imagine a camera zooming out from my view and into a third person view of me right now . then it just pans out as far as you can picture . it helps to just realise how small all these things you are worried about are . look at the whole picture instead of fixating on a single fault .

3. well that ' s a click bait question that should actually go to datingadvice i do believe that you matured , but you haven ' t matured enough if you lost your footing over a single picture . once again go back to the steps and keep on doing what worked . keep on learning and becoming a better man . she will not see you the way you see her . even if she accepts you , you are clearly obsessive and you will involuntary try to push her away from her new friends who you feel threatened about . that ' s just how stalker mentality works . so leave her be . if you are ment to be , you both will be free in couple years and you will meet up .

4. the relationships i ' ve valued most came from the women i didn ' t initially think were the most beautiful . life has nothing to do with looks . if you don ' t have a real relationship until you ' re digit , consider yourself lucky  it ' s all a waste of time . bullshit this , bullshit that . most dudes just want a hole to stick their cock in and are willing to lie to you every word they say to get that . some women have figured that out gonewild exists for a reason . don ' t feel dependent on a relationship for happiness or validation . that ' s only going to be a let down . once you feel happy with yourself , love will come naturally . ask anyone over digit thats been through a few divorces  you have to love yourself to love another . anything else is lying to yourself to pretend to feel happy .

5. nta . as a lesbian and as a human being with good communication in a good relationship , i see no issue with what you did . your other doesnt trust you and is very insecure . i ' d talk to her and if it didnt resolve , i ' d get a new girlfriend that trusts me enough to not cheat .

6. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

7. nta . you would be the ahole if you keep leading her in . just be honest with her . it will suck for a little bit , but she ' ll get over it

8. admitting there is a problem is hard . fixing it even harder . your kids are likely in school full time . perhaps there is a way that you can find an after school program instead of a daycare . or , a dayhome . an hour or two in the afternoons probably won ' t affect your children negatively as a they are more connected to you by this age and can identify right from wrong and tell you , and b an after school program is guided by professional people and c less costly than full time care . i am a mom to a half day kindergartener digit and a digit mornings a week preschooler digit . i would need to find evening or weekend work to save myself from childcare costs being enormous , so i choose to wait until they are schooled full time . do you have any flexibility with your job ? perhaps you could drop off and pick up and return to work if necessary when she returns home . i ' m getting off track . i can ' t think of anything you ' re doing that isn ' t gentle , kind or thoughtful and coming from a place of love . i know my husband works long hours for our benefit and i appreciate the hell out of him for it . you are a good person and it sounds like she does need help in the form of a doctor or counselling for ppd . just keep coming from a place of love when you tell her you miss your partner in crime and that you want her to be happy , and all that growing old together stuff . i would beg and plead with my husband to come to counselling with me if i thought he needed it , but if that ' s likely to make her angry i just don ' t know . maybe if you guys are close with her family you can discreetly discuss with a trusted family member that you are worried . maybe they are worried too .

9. fuck no don ' t let her be one of your bridesmaid ' s i ' d tell rebecca exactly how you feel and why you ' re not letting her be one of your bridesmaid ' s and leave it at that this is your day , don ' t let anyone ruin it for you in any way

10. " when you find someone you really like as a person , tell them that you hope it grows into a closer relationship . if they don ' t feel that way . all is not lost , platonic female friends are a good ally when you ' re in the dating scene . " i actually don ' t have very nice experience with this thing . once i confessed to a girl that i want a close relationship with her . she said she didn ' t want it . i then decided to continue platonic friendship with her . i was now looking after other girls . one of whom was showing some interests in me through her body language . i was now interacting with this new girl on regular basis . she was sending positive indicators to me . my platonic friend asked me about my interests in that girl . i told her that yes i ' m interested in this new girl . i was also thinking about getting some female perspective  thought my platonic friend would be good wing  girl . i confessed my feelings to new girl . she accepted . i was a happy dude . but my winggirl started telling me that my new girlfriend is not the ideal girl  that in her words " she sleeps around " . i said that i ' ll be careful . i was on a trip to family for a week . when i came back , my new gf was ignoring me . i felt something is wrong . i just didn ' t know what . i then went straight to her  asked her what is wrong ? she didn ' t answer me . i asked again . this time she said that she didn ' t know i was sleeping with my winggirl . i asked her about who is telling her such things . she said the name of my wing  girl . i was shocked to hear that . i don ' t know why she did it . if she didn ' t want a relationship with me , why was she ruining my relationships with others . i know i shouldn ' t use this blanket thing to stereotype everyone . but now i feel its far better to get rejected  move  on than choosing to remain friends .

11. fighting once in a while is normal . when you spend that much time with someone else , disagreements happen . fighting that much over things that she should know are a joke ? it sounds to me like this chick feeds on drama and wants to drag you into it . like another poster said , it sounds like emotional manipulation . no human being is responsible for the emotional well being of another . it is absolutely not your " job " to calm her down , it ' s hers . it does sort of sound like you don ' t have a lot of experience with love  relationships , so it can be hard to judge what is  is not normal  healthy  acceptable . but from what you have described , this is none of the above . you should not remain in a relationship that makes you feel uncomfortable and unable to make jokes and be yourself without reprocussion , just because she will be hurt . my advice is to move on .

12. well you ' re just going to have to get over your fear of her having a relationship with someone else . cause it will happen . same thing will happen for you too . it ' s not the end of the world . how many girlfriend ' s have you had ? i ' m assuming more than just her because you used the phrase " most recent girlfriend . " most relationships don ' t last , no matter if they ' re romantic ones or not , and i don ' t think they ' re supposed to . you were with this girl for digit days , that ' s nothing . you ' ll find someone else , or you ' ll spend the rest of your life debilitated by your fear of something that you have no control over . i ' m willing to bet that won ' t happen . keep your chin up man .

13. hey brother . you are not the only one who has experienced shitty women . i  m prior service army , medically retired . i used to be a cavalry scout . when i came home from my third deployment , i thought everything was great . for a few months even . until a mutual friend suggested that i check my wife . i wasn  t convinced , but i checked her email one time and was horrified by what i found . she had been with at least two people , had unprotected sex i know this because several of the emails was her asking both of them for money so she could pay for an abortion , and was continuing to cheat even when i was back home . we don  t always like to admit it man law or something , but when you are betrayed by someone with whom you have bonded with , it really freaking hurts . and there is nothing wrong with that , it just means you are a decent person . you  re doing the right thing by getting it off your chest . don  t feel ashamed , that is not your cross to bear . follow the advice of some previous commenters and make your place your own . have a few good buddies over or go out and get to know yourself again . you have been given an opportunity to free yourself from a toxic relationship and to learn from the past . hold your head high , and know , that just like in the military , there are countless men and women to the left and right of you , who are going through the same thing , and will happily help you too your feet again when the burden brings down .

14. why are you assuming you are being friendzoned ? i mean you seem to be just friends at this stage . she hasn ' t rejected you , so you are not really " friendzoned . it ' s a bit hard to know if she likes you or not from what you have described . just be yourself and don ' t go in with the expectation of wanting her to like you because you are nice to her . dont assume anything , ever ! good luck !

15. once i fully realized i was an alcoholic and couldn  t control myself like i had been desperately trying to do , i was like  fuck it , what can i do to make this downward spiral faster !  . eventually , i had a moment of being willing to try something different , even though i didn  t know how or what to do . six years ago , i went to a crappy rehab , where we couldn  t even have coffee and i didn  t always want to be there , but , i  ve stayed sober every day since . i  m totally not extraordinary in any way , i just decided to give doing something different a chance and be open to not  knowing  what was gonna happen . i hope you find some comfort , regardless of your next move or circumstances .

16. knock that bish off the pedestal . really , if you keep her there you  ll never be able to appreciate anyone else . including yourself ! ex is an ex for a reason .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

17. you only live once . i say ignore these folks and do what makes you happy . time is precious . if you  re unhappy , try a  trial separation  after explaining to your wife why you need it . date the other girl then weight the pros and cons of each option . at least you  ve aired what your wife is doing that makes you unhappy and are giving her a chance as well .
   (ID: 757e143549620faa46043c6954071c7a8dd6b484)

18. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

19. i hope you  re doing okay . i am now in your shoes , and it sucks . one of my best friends killed himself digit days ago . when all of our friends are together it isn  t so bad , but when i  m alone all i can do is look at pictures of him and think about it .
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

20. if you like her go for it , forget what other people think and spend time with her . if you ' re interested show it ! respond to the winks with a smile , funny face , another wink or whatever you feel like , respond to her messages etc . if you dive into the situation you ' ll be able to find out what ' s going on . also don ' t get friends involved , even if she has . it ' s generally a disaster waiting to happen .
