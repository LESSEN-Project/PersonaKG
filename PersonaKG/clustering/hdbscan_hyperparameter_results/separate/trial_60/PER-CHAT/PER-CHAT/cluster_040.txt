SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 17

1. you did the right thing for you . your ex sounds immature and there is a good chance he has cheated plenty himself and that ' s why he is so nonchalant about it . his friend is the one who did something wrong . it isn ' t on you to keep his secrets . if you were in that situation you would want to be told , i ' m sure . let him buy you a ticket home . call your people and let them know you are coming back . this just saved you from a miserable life with a selfish jerk .

2. were you overreacting ? i feel like you didn  t react enough . if this shit was the other way around would he be cool with it ? the answer is hell no . so should you be alright with this ? hell nah . whatever feelings or reactions you have here , i say they are warranted and very much valid . i  m sorry this happened . at least you know what signs to pick up on next time some douche tries this bullshit .

3. no you handled it well . i would of done the exact same thing . think of it this way  if he did kill his self and you didn ' t inform anyone , you would feel a lot worse . you ' ve done the right thing . you ' ve broken up with him and told several people so now it ' s their job to look out for him . not yours . you are free .

4. you  re so strong for making the decision you did though , just remember that . you  re worth so much more than the way he was treating you and you knew that  i hope you realise how amazing that is . so many people haven  t got as far as you have face  blowing  a  kiss

5. i would recommend advice for this , but i ' ll try to help as well anyway i think you ' re just friends by convenience . you ' re on the same team , you live near each other and give each other lifts , but beyond that , he has better friends and you don ' t . i ' ve been in that situation , there ' s not much you can do except to to find other , better friends , and accept that that ' s where your relationship is at . if you ' re scared to do things around him , find other friends and don ' t value his opinion of you so highly , that way if he does judge you , who cares ? as a rule , if a friend makes you feel uncomfortable in some way when you ' re around them , get out , find a better person to spend your time with   x200b    x200b

6. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .

7. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .

8. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .

9. feels like a one side of the story . i could see how you weren ' t one that missed an opportunity to point out in the last digit . digit years to tell john he ' s a loser as often as he said you ' re a drone . i can ' t imagine someone would constantly harass you like that without anything coming back . but if he ' s truly the only " bad guy " in your stories , which i kinda doubt , then your reaction would be more justifiable . however , it was still incredibly childish and a dick move . just talk about the issue you have with him like an adult ffs . you guys are 27yo  is it so hard to talk about how you don ' t think it ' s productive to constantly harass each other ? what ' s the point ? and if he continues to be a child about then talk to your friends about it in a way  " look , i respect and want to support john in what he ' s doing and wish him all the success in the world  however he can ' t stop harassing me for what i am doing and is very insultive about my way of life  i don ' t see any other option than not interact with him anymore because he can ' t be an adult about the situation  then see what they have to say  might suggest . do that than rather making a fool out of yourself and completely escalate the situation in a childish way in front of your whole social circle .

10. nta  i mean it is a dick move to break up over text that way especially while someone  s deployed . however , i don  t think that matters given that he was an abuser and a deployment would give you a chance to leave him without him reacting violently , not letting you , etc . his reaction of threatening to hunt you down says everything about him , what  s he going to do ? beat you ? kill you ? you don  t need such a horrible man in your life . maybe it  d have been more respectful to do it over video or phone i guess but that also just would have opened you to more abusive traumatizing behavior from him , probably would have been worse to hear it in those ways rather than text anyway . i  m sorry for what you  ve gone thru and the decisions you  ve had to make here . as for your friend , does she know how he  s treated you ?

11. am i missing something here ? you love your boyfriend but hard hanging out alone in your room with a drunk guy who tried to kiss you . you stop him and clarify that this is a no go and you love your bf . perfect . but then you have him spoon with you all night as a comfort to you ? that makes no sense . but whatever . if it is eating you up inside and you really truly did not do anything , you should tell him . i mean why not  particularly since there is no longer contact with the mf .

12. if you want my advice on what you should do now , in your present situation . keeping in mind that it is just that , my advice . i ' d say you should first make peace with yourself and the situation . accept that you can move on and live a healthy , happy , productive life full of love and positive relationships if you never speak to him again . this is vital . it ' s the single most important thing you can do right now . search your soul . be strong , and realize that strength . then , tell him you ' re sorry for trying to force his hand , but you realize that you can ' t continue this way . then walk away . it sort of speaks to that old addage " if you love something , set it free " if he wants to be with you , truly wants to , he ' ll figure it out . this will accomplish digit things for you . a you ' re absolving yourself of his blame for ruining the other girl ' s life and you ' re removing a card he can play later . let me explain that a little better . say you don ' t take my advice which , again , is your choice and you keep up the ultimatum . in digit days , he chooses you and the two of you continue your relationship . no relationship is perfect . everyone fights . everyone has bad days . everyone feels annoyed  irritated by their partner . and everyone wonders if they made the right choice . this is what you ' ve given him  a great big if . one he can idealize in his head . " oh , itssodifficult is being such a bitch right now ! othergirl wasn ' t ever this bitchy  crazy  irrational  werewolfy ! i bet if i ' d stayed with her , i ' d be so much happier now " that ' s a seed you have helped plant , and every time there ' s an arguement or disagreement , it grows , as does his resentment . and if he stays in touch with or reestablishes contact with othergirl , she is the one who consoles him . she becomes the one he can talk to , and their bond strengthens . this isn ' t a great way to go about establishing a healthy relationship , set aside the fact that manipulation never ends well . b if he does decide you ' re the one he wants , making that choice is now his . and he now has to do something to get your attention  win you back , which is , i believe , under the heading of " needing to prove " something to you , yes ? so it ' s a two birds one stone type deal , whereas now all he has to do to win you over is say " yep , i dumped her " c you ' ll renew this relationship on equal footing . that ' s important if you actually have hopes of this relationship lasting . sorry for the wall of text .

13. hey , i know there ' s a thousand other comments on here , but just wanted to say real quick that you didn ' t do anything wrong . dude sounds like a hassle to say the least , and anyone who is willing to flip on you and humiliate you online is not someone you should be wasting your time with . that ' s some immature , disrespectful , petty shit . it seems like you feel guilty to an extent , which i understand , but don ' t linger on the guilt . once it passes you ' ll realize you did yourself a favor by setting some standards of what you will and won ' t put up with . lots of people choose to stay unhappy in their relationships and that is an unhealthy way to live .

14. i can only tell you i would have preferred for it to be done privately . maybe send him a text , invite him over and let him know that you have some pretty rough news that you would prefer to talk about face to face . then just make sure he is sitting down and explain what has happened . there ' s no real need to rush it , there ' s also no right or wrong way . there is the facts and your feelings and you have to navigate both . i don ' t know this guy from a bar of soap but general rule of thumb is that guys are pretty simple . give him time to process what you say . he will probably have questions . work through them together . at the end of the day this has happened and if you feel the right thing to do is tell him then you ' ll make it work and he can choose to either take it well and be supportive or take it badly and run through a glass door in a panic . i hope it goes well .

15. most people have some form of guilt built up especially if it ' s a recent occurrence . if you raised the concerns and genuinely wanted to unfold the truth and try to fix things i can ' t see a reason he would continue the affair .   x200b  if you ' re that concerned once you ' re together , get him in a quiet space where you both have timesomething like a car and ask if you can take a look at his phone . straight up , no gimmicks , just say " may i go through your phone to make sure we ' re both on the same page . you should be able to tell right away if he has something to hide .   x200b  however , be careful because this could stir something up that wasn ' t there in the first place . this brings us back to the main point , that being straight forward is always better than snooping . no questions asked if i was dating a girl and she snooped through any of my personal effects the relationship would be done .

16. first , i don ' t think you ' re stupid . so many people send and receive naked pictures every single day , myself included . i send them with the knowledge that the person i send them to may very well use them or keep them for whatever reason . from your post it doesn ' t seem like you did anything heinous that he might try to use them against you . i think the most you have to be concerned about at this point is him using your pictures to pleasure himself to . he might always keep them . while i delete any risque photos of other guys when i start talking to  dating someone new , i know guys that i ' ve sent pictures  videos to in the past have kept mine . maybe i ' m just weird and lucky that no one has used them against me , but i kind of find it flattering when a guy admits to me he ' s kept my pictures  videos for years . the only time i feel bad about it is when i know they have a girlfriend . i think that ' s just disrespectful . it sounds like he didn ' t respect you , so he very well might keep them . just know that you are not stupid . you presented him with the option to do the right thing and he didn ' t . that doesn ' t diminish your character , it diminishes his .

17. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path
