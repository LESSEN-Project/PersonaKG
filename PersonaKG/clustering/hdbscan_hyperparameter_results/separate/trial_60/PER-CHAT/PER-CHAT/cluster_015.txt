1. you get to be a ghost for a while , then its lights out . but i only believe this because i find it comforting to believe there ' s something non  permanent after death .

2. fellow religion subscriber here . i have the same thought . my best guess is suicide leads to hell because life is worth living no matter how hard it is . some divine wisdom thing . hope you keep on pulling through , we  ve got this !

3. after personally experiencing dmt , i am very convinced that there is an afterlife . when you are at this place , you have memories of before you were a human . try to take back those memories with you is like forgetting a dream .

4. i think death is a state which alters our consciousness to the same form of life in an other parallel universe . so that we can live better and evolve . inspired from time is a flat circle !
