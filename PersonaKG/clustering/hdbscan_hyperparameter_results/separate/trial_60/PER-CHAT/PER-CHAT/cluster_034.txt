1. everyone is going to have a different opinion on here . and that  s great . here is some more confusion for you to think about  as a guy , we are always told hitting on women at the gym is a horrible idea . he gave you signs once , but not the second time where is the consistency . even  alpha  male  hunters  enjoy it when an  alpha  female gets flirty first . cautious approach  maybe just ignore him entirely the next time and see if he initiates something . that would be a pretty good indicator he wants to keep things going . the  alpha  approach  screw it ! ask him ! the worst he can say is no , then you can stop wasting your time . no shortage of dudes out there . plus , then you can you can give him the  just friends  smile if you see him at the gym , and walk by letting him watch what he  s missing out on .

2. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .

3. i always arrive super early to stuff because i  m anxious about being late , so i got to starbucks like digit minutes early . this is obviously just a casual coffee date , i met the guy online , wanted to get to know him irl . i order a drink and sit down to wait on my laptop . the guy arrives digit minutes early and comes to greet me and asks if i want a drink . i say no because i already have one . he suddenly gets really upset he can  t buy me a drink . keeps asking me to let him buy one , or even weirder , kept offering to give me money for the one i already paid for ? i just keep saying no , it  s alright , i  m a grown woman lol . so he gets a drink and kinda sulks for the rest of the date , like keeps giving one word answers , doesn  t ask me anything . as soon as i finished my drink he asked to buy me one and i said i actually needed to leave . it was just bizarre .

4. he is trying to pimp you out . i suggest you tell him that his friend can ' t come over anymore . you need to put your foot down because if you don ' t , your going to be sleeping with all of his buddies and whomever else .

5. if you just kind of brushed him off at first or just nervously laughed you ' re kind of screwed . he thinks he ' s " wearing you down " at this point . just tell him no and do not explain why . just say no . if he doesn ' t get the message , it may be time to talk to your supervisor about it .

6. so you haven ' t actually told the guy you ' re not interested ? seems this guy doesnt get the hint and can ' t mind read , but he seems harmless from what you described . just some guy who was interested and you are not . just tell the dude you don ' t want anything to do with him . he ain ' t psychic . and your account is a couple days old , what ' s your alt account that you used to post on letsnotmeet ?
