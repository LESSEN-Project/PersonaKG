10. people tend to confuse tilt  shift effect with miniature effect . we ' re talking the latter here . i ' ll try to explain it shortly  when you are photographing a large  scale landscape see the unmodified picture in the reply to the first post , everything tends to be in focus you have large , often infinite depth of field . as you get closer and your subjects  smaller , depth of field becomes smaller i . e . less of the scene is in focus . if the same scene is composed with toys , i . e . if the balloons were , say , coin  sized , the photo would look like the processed one , but for optical reasons . if you were to achieve the same thing , but in an optical way , you would need a very , very large camera sensor comparable in size to the balloon and a very , very long in focal length lens which would be proportional to you shooting the scene with the toys . in  camera software or the one that ' s used on a computer can somewhat succesfuly fake this effect , which is often the case .

11. i like how you have nothing to do in your life except type insanely long answers to a random persons question . does it honestly matter to you what i think and believe in ?

13. how is that whataboutism ? because they just said " well what about alcohol ? " . that ' s exactly what whataboutism is . you don ' t talk about the issue at hand , you try to compare it to something else and not what was originally being discussed .

14. the obviously bullshit one you dedicated the last half of your paragraph to . " obviously bullshit " should ' ve tipped you off .  if trump picks the most qualified available and they happen to be white , so what really ? you don ' t think there ' s a single person of color in the entire country more qualified than any of those digit  digit people ? not one ?  btw obama also had mostly white people huh . you mean there was one digit years ago ? interesting . i mean if you ' re going to blatantly ignore discrimination , yeah , i can understand your ideas .

15. who the hell else is it that you ' re asking ? it ' s unnecessary .

16. i gotchu bro . you may be asking yourself , oh no what do i talk about ? when approaching a girl . no worries ! as another user mentioned , get on board day is a great opportunity to meet a girl that has a similar interest as you . you dont have to tell a joke or have some jaw dropping awesome first line , you can literally just ask  how long have you been into topic ?   what is your favorite thing about topic  keep in mind that not everyone will click and if it doesnt , dont tell yourself that youre bad with girls . i promise you that there are guys you could try to be friends with and it wouldnt go so well either . why ? because not everyone is going to click , i promise you that i wouldnt click or be friends with almost digit  of the guys in my classes if we tried to be friends . it  s just because people are different . so don  t get down , go out there , be confident , be yourself , and if you fail , get back up , dust yourself off , and try again ! you got this ! p . s . none of the bad interactions will matter in digit years when you  re as happy as can be with your s  o good luck bro

17. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .
