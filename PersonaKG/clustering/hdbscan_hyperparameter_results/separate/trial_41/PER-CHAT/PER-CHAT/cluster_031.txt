1. the sky . whatever the weather , i think it would be nice to see what they think of it .
   (ID: 42817db6a2880fe4df5d65636e25385c67c89bb1)

2. ok you think that then . no issue here .
   (ID: 02cf76dae1fda8da1d2e5bbbaeb0da5a77cb6e3e)

3. but you  re insane to think that hitting your hand with a hammer the first , tenth , or even a hundred times will not hurt . it  s mental illness making you think there has to be a secret number of how many times you can hit your hand until it doesn  t hurt anymore

   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

5. you can ' t stop the march , so why think about it ?
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

6. maybe . it depends on the response of the members . what do you think ?
   (ID: ac53f9ce173965984299f3686335a39bc2a5810f)

7. why do you think that , is what i am asking .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

8. at first i was thinking why would you put him in that situation , that can ' t be safe . after watching his reaction i ' m think what a judgemental prick i am . that was awesome to watch .
   (ID: b6567f005c34603036e6119544386ff4f12ec3a9)

9. i can ' t think of anything better , frankly .
   (ID: f4e4929bb0bef09e7eb72aaccf20c2d9454729c7)

10. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

11. disagree  i think if there is profit to be made then digging in old landfills , dredging the ocean or mining asteroids in space  these elements will be recycled and re  purposed .
   (ID: 30506e41c4121e1e7573a25d4985de191de679c9)

   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

14. hmm now that i think about that i would be kinda hard to find him . but there ' s no harm in trying
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

15. hmm , i ' m not gonna lie . as a guy who loves the minions , i think this is the dream scenario for me
   (ID: 4e289af5e18133c4578deba659b7e1d2784a925d)

16. the rest of the poem is what i would call poetic . i think the piece functions with a degree of uncertainty without the last line . i think it takes away from the awesome that is this poem . after a few more readings , i might suggest dropping the punctuation but that is sort of whatever .
   (ID: 109fa004cbb85f6a703624f8b4393d7d7d685509)

   (ID: 168d1161144e63a83a23f04ae4e64bd4b25684c0)

18. i think that people shouldn  t have to lie about their beliefs . i think their religious beliefs shouldn  t be mentioned at all
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

19. kill all the dumb fucks that think a zombie apocalypse will ever happen . you ' re welcome .
   (ID: a911ed792d3b26b115aedaee6218a4a944c38521)

20. i think the strongest card you have is beelze , if you wanted to build a twilight deck around him you could pick up some lightsworn cards in conjunction with plague spreader zombie . maybe google " twilight deck " for some ideas .
