1. bars are places to pick up , to make friends i would say go to another forum . perhaps church or some association . as a man i would think you either is looking to be hitted on or waiting for your friends if i see lonely womman browsing around .

2. sure , it wouldn ' t really matter if they were adopted or not . i ' m trying to say that in terms of decision making , somebody with children adopted or otherwise might be more inclined to look at long  term effects  consequences , as they have an investment  asset in the future . though yes , you ' re absolutely right about a politician being able to be extorted more easily if he has a family . i think maybe you misunderstood what i meant by " investment . "

3. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .

4. thank you . i think i needed someone to say that to break the feedback loop of doubt that i sometimes get stuck in .

5. think . i have never heard anyone say " another thing coming . how would that make any sense ?

6. well if you really do think so and you ' re sure it ' s not right for you , i ' d say call them and be honest . i ' m sure they ' d be understanding .

7. i think you meant to say ,  would you be harder than dark souls if this were a game ?  . yes , yes i would be .
   (ID: e09cddf2452184c83537d2d4e8a36f0ba7c3fae9)

8. i ' d say no . but i think a lot of it is personal bias or what one would prefer to watch .

9. i was here to say sushi , now i have to think of something else . its definitely not going to be brussel sprouts . i still hate those

10. anti  intellectualism is great to see on what is meant to be a university community . big words , small words , what ' s the difference ? i ' m not posturing . i use the terms that i think best express my ideas . i didn ' t present a counter  argument because isanybodylisten didn ' t present any points that could be refuted in a meaningful way . it was very much , " i see you as being    " . i could say that i ' m not those things , but those are equally weak statements . in what class could you get away with making an assertion without justification ? none . if you ' re comfortable with drawing all of your conclusions about someone from the way they conduct themselves on reddit , maybe you ' re pretentious .

11. as a girl , i ' d say all my " firsts " , i think i should have waited for the right guy

12. how do you say you ' re pretty well sized and in the next sentence say how it has been problematic for you but my lizard brain still manages to ignore that and think  " damn , having a huge dong sounds great . " it ' s so ingrained .
   (ID: d7b75c00237dc445cdc3ebc380fbcb79a40b1a5f)

13. apparently it ' s a right to carry a gun in church , but gathering to say you think this is wrong is a privelage .
   (ID: f76420437c1e4fb2e8ba8a9e9b0e116c7fc513ab)

14. i think as comments flow , you ' ll realise this may not be so much of an unpopular opinion . nevertheless i must say you articulate yourself well . a  from this stranger .

15. personally i would say that altair and edward would be the last ones standing . kenway , being a pirate would be prone to fighting dirty and altair was trained from the moment he could walk , if my memory serves pun totally fucking intended , would , and should absolutely kick ass . personally i think that altair takes the cake but it would be a pretty close call .

16. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .

17. i ' m pretty sure it ' s before , because in lore it says that doomfist was defeated by winston and put in prison . saying that the fight scene ends with doomfist and winston about to clash i think it ' s pretty safe to say it ' s before prison . i might be wrong though , because the doomfist mentioned in the original cinematic could be a different one .

18. there ' s a whole wikipedia page on the controversies of using that word . shame because it ' s a great word and i think it deserves a resurgence , so i say use it .
   (ID: 0fbaeef283f7b2090f763028c227ed73724f3e6c)

19. i wouldn  t say your original post came off as humble . i didn  t think it was arrogant though . all i have to say is , if the women that you  re talking to desire you more when you  re being a jerk , they must have no self  esteem .
   (ID: 256407c5e6c8d9342d8aabf5c9c392fc179ba9f3)

20. you might think we ' re done . but no matter what you say , we will complete this dungeon . if rocks fall and yolnaak dies , so be it .
