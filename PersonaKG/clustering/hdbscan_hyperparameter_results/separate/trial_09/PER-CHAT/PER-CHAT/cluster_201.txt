3. you don ' t have to feel guilty about it during the day either . if you don ' t enjoy being around people you ' re probably just an introvert , and that isn ' t something to feel guilty about . it ' s just an aspect of your personality , the same way loving being with people is part of an extrovert ' s personality .

11. may i ask what system you play and what rep you are ? because there is no way in hell you ' re playing high level duels and landing a mix of lights and heavies consistently as kensei . its most likely mid tier at best . people don ' t parry in high tier . they just block . and kensei is left useless at that point .

13. don  t assume anything . ask for clarification . in my workplace , people sometimes assume they understand a vague assignment and we wind up doing unnecessary or unwanted work because someone was too shy to ask an executive some follow up questions . please , just politely and confidently ask .

14. so basically the only reason is so that people don ' t do the same to you later ? not that they have any individual value or right to a seat , just they are some sort of " karma points " for you .
