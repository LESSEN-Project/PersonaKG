1. i have lived in canada my whole life . never had to say a pledge of allegiance . as someone who has never done it , i don ' t think it ' s weird . the usa is a great country and typically they ' re very patriotic . you ' re swearing to the ideals of the country , not the leader itself  that would be messed .

2. i think i get what your trying to say , but then i don  t

3. instead of tucking me in to bed as a kid with the whole " don ' t let the bed bugs bite " deal , my mom would kiss me goodnight and say " you can do or be anything you put your mind to " and i think hearing that every night developed my confidence and strength for the rest of my life so far

4. don  t go into a relationship with the mindset that you will change the other person , aka don  t fall in love with the person you think they can be . if someone says that they rather be friends with you than date you and you say yes to being friends , you can  t think that they will eventually fall in love with you or that you will be able to win them over . this one might seem obvious to you but i think we have all seen this happen .

5. i forgive myself , give me an imaginary hug , take a long shower and start it all over . a thing to remember  when you say something mean about yourself , think " would i say that to a loved friend  family if they were in that situation " no , you probably wouldn ' t . so don ' t say it to yourself . be nice instead , be your best friend .

6. huh . i never romanced tali but i figured he would say it at some point , maybe you missed it ? i don ' t think shepard ever says it first though , i remember him answering " i love you too " to most of them , but not the other way around . i guess it ' s usually the love interests who confess their undying love and stuff , shep tends to show more with actions than words .

7. i wouldn ' t say i have a big ass . it ' s not flat either , i think it ' s nice and i always check myself out in the mirror , but i would only say it ' s a little above average . i don ' t think ass size has anything to do with it though .

8. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .
