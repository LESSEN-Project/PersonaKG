1. they sort of fade in time , you can get creams that are meant to help . but totally vanish ? don ' t think so .

2. i don  t think she saw it the same . we would feed safe leftover food to our dogs all the time , it wasn  t an insult to the food . it  s because we view our dogs as family , they could eat the same food as us again , as long as it is safe for dogs . lots of food isn  t .

3. don ' t waste even a single weekend with doing nothing unless you ' re ill or in physical pain . don ' t end up only focusing on work , appreciate the time with your family and friends and do some workout regularly . some people tend to become lazy and eat a lot of fastfood . and always have one thing in mind  what would my future me think about my past decisions ? do something before it ' s too late .

4. " perception is reality " . if everyone sees you in " one way " then that ' s what you are to them . what this translates to is if people around you think you don ' t care about your job  responsibilities , even if you actually do , you wont be given the opportunity to take on more responsibility or looked at for promotions . very true words that took a long time to understand and eventually agree with .

5. if transmitting the data in real time is too expensive , why not have a redundant system that jettisons a black box when impact is imminent . i don  t think it would that difficult to implement in this day and age . might be easier to find than when it  s possibly under two miles of water .

6. i don ' t think the worst of people , and honestly i don ' t think poorly of the neighbor in this scenario as a person . i will still be faced with this day  to  day reality  i labor tirelessly , and he reads . is your answer , then , that in a communist society i would be comfortable with this scenario because of a general faith that my neighbor either has or will be as productive at some time in the course of their life ? won ' t i be able to ask him about that ? compare hours worked , lives touched , needs met , future plans ? and what happens if the result of those conversations is that we both acknowledge that i ' m a more productive member of society than him ? what mechanism keeps me from resenting him ?

7. really don  t think about that aspect much . you have a job to do , so that  mission focus  stays . i remember freaking out the first time mortals fell near our fob , i panicked and ran for a bunker . a few months later i wouldn  t even bother grabbing my helmet and kept walking to lunch chow .

8. as much as this would be great , it  s still a lot of money . as if we already don  t get robbed every paycheck anyways yknow ? granted there are things our taxes go to that , aren  t really beneficial . but it  d be a rough time i think . what about you ?
   (ID: b5511d022d9aa43868b3f1a7ca2e4368d861570c)

9. a clear  cut answer to that would be great . i don ' t think one exists . the correct information has been out a long time .

10. i guess the question should be are they saying " nice work " on objectively average work as a compulsion to be nice , or are they saying " nice work " to everyone any time their work is objectively above average ? that ' s the difference . i give a lot of compliments , but i never give one i don ' t sincerely mean . you ' re welcome to your opinion , but i think you ' re wrong .
