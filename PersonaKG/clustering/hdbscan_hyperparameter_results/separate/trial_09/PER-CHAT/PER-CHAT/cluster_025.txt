1. strange one alright . i think the general idea behind it is that gender is no longer a biological thing but rather a state of mind . fuck it though , all i really know is that is has zero effect on me and we are best off just letting people be whoever they want lol

2. i dont know as far as saying that cops would just let clean cut white kids go . drive through the ghetto of anywhere in my case chicago you clearly plainly see black people walking down the sidewalk smoking blunts standing on the corner of the street asking random people if they want to buy weed hanging out at gas stations asking random people if they want weed driving around with skunky smelling smoke billowing out of the windows . i think black peoples problem isnt completely racial profiling tho i do think it has alot to do with it but the fact that they arent nearly as sneaky when they break the law

3. . let people do what they want to do unless they are not really harming others . i do not think most of the christians spread hate against the other people . what do you gain if you deny god ?

4. being treated nicely isn ' t what everyones after , some people prefer someone who ' ll challange them . whether it be intellectually or spiritually or whatever . lots of people are also still searching for what they want . someone might think they want excitment rather than someone who ' s more chilled and later find out they were wrong . there is also the possibility they just don ' t want you and thats it . idk its not an exact science . last possibility assuming you haven ' t made a definitive move on her is they think you ' d make a move if you wanted to and have given up on their end . if you think this is it , just try having a chat with them and say your piece . it ' ll happen or it won ' t but its better to have a answer i hope you enjoyed my ted talk

5. to the people that had it all ur life without knowing the proper way to do it lol . how do you determine if u are sleeping or not . i think this sub has a lot of people trying very hard to have lucid dreams . i really want to know other people ' s way of checking not a best proven way just the way natural lucid dreamers do it .

6. those stories are almost always bullshit from people who want to scare you or score drugs or keep other other people as miserable as they are . there  s a happy life that  s just waiting for you that just takes a little bit of effort and if you  re standing between that and death and you  d rather choose death because one requires a little trust and putting work into yourself than you  re a coward . i wouldn  t be wasting my thanksgiving trying to convince you it  s possible if i didn  t think you could do it . you just have to take that first step .

7. honestly , i think most of us hate the pc culture that is spreading as well . we just dont want to get into an argument , so we go along with everything . i definitely agree that people need to stop getting their panties in a wad about stupid shit and begin focusing on the real issues . however , it will probably never happen .

8. at first i was like , what ? this doesn  t make any sense . then the part about you potentially leaving the country came up and i understand better . i think i  m almost any other instance , it would be weird to ask to be exclusive without some amount of commitment . the two ideas go hand  in  hand . in your case , i think it would be ok to say ,  hey ! while we are seeing each other , let  s not see other people . but in case i end up leaving , i don  t want to get too serious .  just make sure to be clear about what you want and expect out of your relationship .

9. i mean , sometimes i just really don  t want to talk to anyone , even if i  m on the internet doing other stuff . talking to people can be exhausting and not everyone can handle being in constant communication with multiple people . i  m ignoring my best friend as i type this because i just want to be left alone right now , but it doesn  t mean i hate him . if i were to send that brief  hi  i  d be committed to a solid hour of giving another person my undivided attention when i barely have the emotional reserves to scroll mindlessly through memes . some of us are introverts . some of us are depressed , or busy , or have people in our lives with issues that we need to prioritise over a friendly conversation . honestly i think the way we  re constantly a press of a button away from everyone in our lives has given people unrealistic expectations about how much attention is reasonable .

10. in aa they also say " take what u want  leave the rest " meaning u can eliminate the dependence on a higher power part . just go for the fellowship  bond with the others about how alcohol impacts your life . nowhere else will u meet others who have had similar drinking experiences who mistakenly think there the only ones who have pribs w alcohol . a lot of people stumble on the higher power thing . just go .

11. depends on context . are you talking about a girl playing hard to get ? in that case i think it is percieved self worth . they view themselves as something that should be fought for and people should have to struggle and bend over backwards to get . it ' s a proof thing . prove you want it bad enough and can earn it . however no means no . always assume no means no . if someone does what i mentioned it ' s a fucked up mind game that has horrible consequences . one girl says no and means convince me . next girl says no and fucking means no but no the guy just tried harder . its unhealthy .

12. given the current political climate , you really think that ' we can all agree on the kind of people we want in positions of authority ' ?
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

13. i feel the same , even typed a response then realized i couldn ' t post it cause i didn ' t want to think or talk abt it . i ' m glad people say such nice things to you . compliments just make a day so much brighter , don ' t they ?

14. can someone please explain to me why kagura is in that high spot ? actually i ' m a kagura main , but i just want to know what people think about her . feel glad to know your thoughts
   (ID: e4e6a770eda3d8a5505365978baee4568affe531)

15. this made me nauseous , not that i think it could happen but they fact that people actually want this to happen
