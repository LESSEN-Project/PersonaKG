3. unfortunately that ' s just the way things are in the country i live in . i would not be surprised if that manager had to suck someone else off to get to where he is today

4. do you draw your tags or buy them over the counter ? we have tag draws and only you can use your tag . but i have heard of sharing tags in states where you can buy a handful of tags or a punch card . the differences in hunting laws state by state are pretty neat . i was just talking to a guy the other day i forget where he lives but it is illegal to hunt with radios there , and where i live i can ' t imagine going into the woods without one .

5. just curious , is there some sort of " vesting " in the canadian system , to prevent folks from moving to canada and getting benefits from others paying into the system ? for instance do you have to live there for a period before receiving benefits ? it may be something you need to consider .

6. star wars and make the moon be the death star so that everyone would live in constant , unnecessary , fear of something that was made up just to keep humanity in line . haha that would be so different than today . wait
