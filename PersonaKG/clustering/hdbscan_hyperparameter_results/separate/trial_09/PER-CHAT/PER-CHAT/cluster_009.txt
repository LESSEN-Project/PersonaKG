1. out of sheer curiosity i saw you ' re a braves fan where in georgia do you live ? i just had a house built in woodstock . we had a ton of issues and a couple of them they had panicked about not getting finished before closing and would have to push back the date thus paying interest longer . luckily , they got them done in time . i would also definitely get in touch with the managers and rip them apart too . this is unacceptable behavior . i had to find somebody at corporate through linkedin because of a couple of issues i had it was a huge pain in the ass .
