1. the company i work for pays us to go volunteer a few times a year with a food bank we work closely with and donate to and what not . the fuckin nerve of some people that come in there is unreal . you have the super nice and just down on their luck people that are super appreciative for anything you give them , and for helping load it into their cars and what not , then you get the giant pricks who make you put digit bags into their brand new car , then when you get there they open up the bags and start taking out vegetables and whatever else they dont want and demand you bring them back inside and give them extra cake or sweets , or whatever they choose then flip out when you tell them that ' s not really how it works .

2. right now it is super easy to earn money compared to the last couple of generations . when people my age complain about how little they earn it just baffles me , your earning  digit an hour , twice the amount of minimum wage digit years ago . there are so many scholarships and open positions for jobs that making a lot of money is quite easy . the only reason i think that people complain is that they want millions of dollars without doing any work .

3. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .

4. i think people should play for the enjoyment and not just to win another uhc  like if you want to play dirty there ' s a cutclean game in digit minutes .  it should be for the audience .

6. yeah , the first week of season digit the planes were just fine to everyone , i didn ' t see a single post about how op it is until the freaking sword was realest . now the sword is gone people want to attack the planes now ? excuse me , what the fuck . i just think people doesn ' t want anything added in season digit if this is the case . whats the point of playing fortnite if you can ' t have fun and keep bitching on how everything added is ' op ' . in conclusion , plz stop this , bring back the sword , and subscribe to pewdiepie .
