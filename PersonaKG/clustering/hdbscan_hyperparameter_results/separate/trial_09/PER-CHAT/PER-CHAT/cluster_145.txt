6. it takes over literally every aspect of your life . everything . it gets to a point where you literally have to put yourself before anything else . it can seem narcissistic to people who don  t know what you  re going through , but when it comes between wanting to blow your brains out and everything else , it  s an easy choice . hopefully

7. most people here do not understand what  s happening . yes , it is true the government does know everything about you in terms of how many hours you worked and how much money you made , so technically they have the information there . they don  t have one thing however  your write  offs . they don  t know how much money you spend in total for gas traveling to and from your work , medication or other stuff like that . and so when you file your taxes , you include everything the irs has and the one thing they don  t  write  offs . the government may compensate you for some of your expenses .

9. people use the word " everyone " in sentences as if they know every single person in the world . " everyone thinks they are the hero of their story . absolute truths don ' t exist . there are gray areas as well .

10. enjoy the life i ' m living even though it ' s far from being perfect . the reason i ' m saying that is that a reddit has quite a reputation of of people not happy and quite depressed when you ask people about reddit . i know it ' s not the case and i don ' t generalize but that ' s the general thinking about reddit .

11. i ' m a vegetarian if i don ' t tell that to everyone around me , they will feed me something which i don ' t eat . so the reason behind vegan brag about the veganism is this . especially in india . people here are both , non  vegsome days vegsome days in week so it ' s mandatory to know the people around vegs people to stop ordering non  veg for veg . my point is clear .

12. i don  t have evidence , there hasn  t been a study that i know of . but what  s happening now isn  t working so it  s gotta change . as someone else suggested in the comments making the people private to media and public would be a better way then my original suggestion
