6. those people do serve a purpose though . they help researchers determine what works and what doesn ' t . that is real research . they study dying people to see what can keep them from dying . that research is useful because it can then be applied to people who are dying of similar causes , but long before those causes should be occurring . this guy suffered for months so that they could watch him slowly die of something that will likely not have any real impact on medicine .
