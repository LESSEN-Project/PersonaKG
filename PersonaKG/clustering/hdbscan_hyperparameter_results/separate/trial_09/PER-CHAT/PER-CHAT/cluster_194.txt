3. it ' s been implied that the infertility problems are due to pollution and bad farming practices . during the visit by the mexican delegates i remember either fred or serena talking about the improved pollution problem . also in flashbacks to the red center we see aunt lydia talking about pollution lowering the birthrate and she also pins some blame on women who can give birth but refuse by taking birth control or aborting . edit to add  i ' ve read the book too and know it was much more nuanced than that . my comment is based off what information they ' ve given us in the show so far .

8. if you  ve verified that then cps could be an option . it  s always possible that it  s starved for air . somewhere there  s an imbalance of spark , fuel , and air causing the no start issue . once you know the engine is getting all of them then you can go through and check sensors .

10. i ' ve looked through your post history before and i know you get a lot of shit about spoofing but honestly whatever . if you were cheating at a competitive multiplayer game where other players were being put at a consistent disadvantage , then sure there would be reason to be upset . but what you do in pogo doesn ' t affect anyone else . it ' s mostly a solo player game and if you ' d rather sit at your desk than walk around and play , more power to you . i know i ' m grateful when spoofers hop in my raids congrats on the shiny deck , that ' s awesome . i ' m extremely jealous but also a nerd so i love seeing these pictures . if you ' re open to adding new friends , let me know and i ' ll pm you my code . cheers !

   (ID: 840f5d9bddf24e024b9a70f13cdde62d41604e77)

13. honestly , i ' ve thought about this too much , i would start work at the food  dessert place as a waitress they frequently visit and get to know all the familiar customers and if i hear a comment about someone doing something disastrous . i ' ll get the said person to refer them to the said shop and i ' ll poison them . it ' s doesn ' t ever link back to knowing the person personally or anything either .
