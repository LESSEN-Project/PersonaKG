   (ID: 85ae0ed5db316dbe8f48f61c8bb40a68799195fc)

2. what am i suppose to say ? what ' s done is done , no need to keep feeling guilty and letting it eat me up for months messing with my mind and shit . just letting go now and not letting it bother me sounds way better then letting stuff fuck me up like most people do .

3. to be honest some people that are antivaxxers are not looking at recorded data its like . they start looking at the cover of the book then basing their thoughts on the cover only without looking inside it , they base all their " knowlege " , " evidence " and " research " on the cover itself . you cant call research without searching and cant have evidence if you dont even understand most of it plus they do it on facebook , facebook mostly have no solid evidence that what they are saying is true , they just press a link and say " wow this is so true because it came from a random person i saw on the internet " . as in why do they do this , im not trying to be rude but why do they do this . if i facepalm myself equivalent to their stupidity i might aswell get sucked in the black hole . not trying to be rude just my pure thoughts and honesty

4. i mean sometimes if there ' s a car on fire on the road or there ' s been an accident then if someone uploads it to like their social media saying avoid the let ' s say m25 there ' s been an accident ? i mean going in and filming dead bodies and injured people isn ' t the greatest move but what if your just taking a video of something while passing by ?

5. like at times he ' s unnecessarily judgemental about people . about views he doesn ' t agree with and i call him out for that saying that he should be more inclusive and less judgemental . then he ' ll get all defensive about how i ' m disrespectful without even registering my views and what i actually meant to say . he just wants me to agree with everything he says and not have any views that oppose his .

6. id use google translate to speak mandarin so that a larger amount of people could hear me first and say " hey insert random name here stop doing that " and walk away with a smug look of success knowing that someone with that name just got pranked .

7. by that logic , we shouldn  t allow driving at all because it increases the risks of harm to people and people  s pets . it is already being worked on self driving cars to minimise the potential of crashes . here is a article about that  dough i do understand what you are trying to say , i would still just do rules like that because still , it puts the animals in danger . earlier you said that weed lessens the aggression , but sooner or later other drugs will be legalized where they do make people more aggressive . that is the problem . by just having rules like that it would atleast prevent a few drug users to buy pets , which is better then nothing wouldn ' t you say ? sure it maybe just prevents digit drug users from buying pets , but thats better then nothing in my opinion .

8. no , reddit can be productive . people using it productively is a rarity . just look at the subscriber numbers for funny or aww compared to those of let ' s say , i dunno , studytips .

9. it does , and its a pain in the ass , but after awhile you just learn to deal with it i guess . people tell me a lot that they could never deal with that , but you just have to , its not like you can say no thanks or something . those people seem kind of ridiculous . i dont get them

10. ok , i get the point of this and i  m sure it would help clear this up with some people but , if you force a man to get pregnant and carry the baby wouldn  t it be going against their consent thus making you the rapist in this scenario ? i  m not trying to put down somebody  s experiences with this but that sounds really morally wrong . not that any of the other stuff happening isn  t . i  m not trying to say something against this i  m just arguing morals .

11. people who get really serious and say some hurtful shit and then switch and say  i  m just messing with ya lol  this is a trait more commonly found in males than it is with females , and usually stems from lack of peer involvement than it does with family life , although family life could be accounted for in this scenario .

12. most of the crazy ones are pretty easy to spot . just watch what they say and how they treat people .

13. i have several friends in that exact boat , and i ' m functionally in a similar one right now . i tell my mom that people my age understand the concept of orientation well enough that saying you ' re gay does not necessarily entail that you have gay sex . like they might at first assume otherwise , but it ' s pretty easy for the average non  christian my age to grasp the basic concept of a celibate gay christian . but she and others seem to just look at it as , " if you say you ' re gay , that definitely means you are actively seeking out butt sex "
   (ID: 80ae19b9093d92fad153af508f37fcd7cd9340ec)

14. people saying i love you sincerely . i can ' t even say it to my parents because i find it so cringey . not even during movies that are super romantic and does it in a smart way . just no .
