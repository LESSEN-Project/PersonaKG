3. mhm when i go out to eat i generally do it because i have many things to do and i can ' t get home to eat , so i definitely hate long lines , though i understand what you mean and there ' s a similar feeling i have , when i ' m waiting for someone i had to meet or when a conference or a course or whatever is starting later than expected and i can just take out the book i brought just in case and read or just space out .

12. a few years ago , i was sitting in class doing my homework . the kid in front me , who at the time was my friend , turnt around and said " i think we should just nuke iran . this pissed me off , because im persian and i would prefer if my aunt wasn ' t turned into nuclear fallout . he then went on to say that the second amendment shouldn ' t apply to muslims  middle eastern people . a quick google search showed him that most of the post digit  digit terrorists were native born white people with more in common with him than me

17. i started in kindergarten . i was persuasive
   (ID: 3dfcdf92c717ed4c117768210afcbbaf9a2ca8a9)

18. yeah , this is sorta what my mom believes , and what i believed i guess , but not so much the " greater reward " thing . it ' s true they use language like that , but a lot of christians who would basically believe this tend to get pretty fuzzy with whether some people will be any happier than others , usually saying no they won ' t , everyone will be equally happy if they are saved and spending eternity in the presence of god . my mom believes god could heal me , and that i should never stop seeking to be healed , but she could believe that a person might never be healed of same sex attraction , just like she believes for any ailment . you pray to be healed even until you die , and if it never happens , that doesn ' t mean you weren ' t sick . i figure though that being gay and in loving relationships looks pretty nice and healthy . but also , some straight people believe they could choose to be gay , that they just aren ' t . some people i suppose i might guess they ' re bi , but who knows ? say they have experienced same sex attraction , and then rejected it to pursue an opposite sex relationship . i think there ' s pretty clear evidence that people who experience same sex attraction can ' t really stop it , but i think it might be possible for some people to grow a certain kind of attraction . i say that mostly out of personal experience . i was never in conversion therapy , but i did try my best to like girls , and in my mind , as good of a christian as i was , that meant training myself to get off to porn of girls . not successful , but now vaginas are pretty ok to me , so it didn ' t do nothing . i feel like my attraction to girls sometimes gets as high as digit  what it is to guys . which is more than before .

19. maybe it would , i ' m sure bungie could find a way of putting the odds slightly in our favour without destroying the fun . like , if you choose not to kill the fallen in the buildup , you don ' t have that much of a harder time than if you did , but they offer a slight advantage ?

20. i also got a message from what i think is the same guy . the dude is probably on this sub , looking for people to harass . what a sad human being .
