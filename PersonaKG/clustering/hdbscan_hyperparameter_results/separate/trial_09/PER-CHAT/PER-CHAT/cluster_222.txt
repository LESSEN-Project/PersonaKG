SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:

Total from this dataset: 7

1. these people should be taking some goddamn responsibility instead of trying to get outraged at the broadcaster for their lazy parenting . this right here is probably the one quote to rule them all . parents seem to shirk their responsibilities endlessly nowadays . it is not the job of the mass media or school teachers to bring up children . if a person is so uncultured that they have no damn idea what watership down contains , perhaps they should get morally outraged at the fact that they are clearly a fucking moron first . i do hope that channel digit just responds with " lol , no " and is done with it .

2. people either love you for you or you just dont need them . enjoy your hobbies and express your passion for it . you arent alone and i ' m here right with you at digit watching and living anime

3. you ' re not wrong . the hike to get there isn ' t all that easy though takes just under digit hours and covers about 600m in altitude . it was pretty dangerous at times due to the rain , yet you see people walking up there in flipflops . are they the real  life equivalent of someone driving around in winter without snow tyres on their car and putting themselves and others in danger ?

4. people lying to you about how great they are and how deep and full of significance and meaning their life is . nobody cares about how your grandmother grew tomatoes instilling your love of fresh produce , or how your mother ' s use of seasonings opened up your senses , or your soccer coach touching you filled you with a love of sausage . i just could not remember if i needed digit tbs or digit of flower for a basic roux . please put the recipe at the top and your poorly written life story at the bottom so i can choose to not read with out being annoyed by having to scroll through it .

5. apologies if my comment came across as uncivil and misunderstood . i wasn ' t insulting the op in the slightest  in both of our cultures what i said is deemed friendly banter and it is a difficult situation as the internet is globalised so certain cultures reading this would take what i said to be offensive however the person this was directed at would digit  understand where my intent lay . i do however understand that there may be people reading this who could find it offensive even if it wasn ' t directed at them so i can see why it was removed . i just wanted to clarify that there was zero malice in my statement . thanks .

6. people complain about how capcom makes this game too casual friendly and that it ' s just too easy . here they are making it so you can dp after the opponents cock is down your throat and it doesn ' t even trade but digit  just hits them even though you were slow as balls . now that you can ' t be punished for being slow but are actually rewarded for it , making this game that much easier and now everyone is happy about it . what ' s gonna be next ? digit button supers ? an option to pause online because you have to finish painting your nails ? pathetic .

7. is the mail pre sorted for you or do you have to sort it ? our complex has digit mailboxes all in a row and our mail man just throws it all in and we have to sort it ourselves . almost daily i get other people  s mail . is this common ?
