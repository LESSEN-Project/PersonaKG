   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

2. so correction you get digit a month . this month ' s was " devil " " the editor " " pieces " and " hansel and gretal get baked " and at least one is always something you can ' t get anywhere else . i assume just a unique cover art or something . there ' s a digit month option but looks like you have to pay the digit months then and there . i just don ' t know where to start when it comes to a collection

3. no no , we convinced her of that . it would be more forgivable if she was just ignorant of it , i get it , we don ' t all have access to equal education . i ' d totally get it if she came up with that on her own , but this stemmed from a rather serious science debate on why we can ' t drink sea water . she wanted to know if it was because that water is blue . which of course isn ' t wrong , but we were digit years old so everyone was an asshole and took it too far messing with her .

4. i said it bfore but a recentish one for me  grindr date . arrived to guys apartment , expected to be a digit  on  digit deal . i like group situations sometimes but usually it ' s known before arrival if it ' s going to more than digit person , but whatevs got there and guy was jumpy af i don ' t know what he drug was on but it was the least relaxing  chill greeting ever i received . i continued though cos horny i walked in and there was another chap naked and on all fours , on a leash , drinking from a dog bowl water ? vodka ? who know and he just sat on his back paws and looked at me . didn ' t respond to me saying oh hi how are youu ? just stared at me with an expression of anger ? confusion ? supreme horniness ? place smelled terrible and i got a v creepy vibe . said to grindr guy ' actually man i have to head out sorry ' and brushed right past him out the door , left them to their angry lookin non  verbal pet play

5. i have never owned an ob2 vehicle until i bought my digit colorado a few months ago so im new to the new things . and i have never had leaves and random shit come out the vents on any of my trucks or cars , so what ' s the advantage of a crap catcher ? literally seconds after you roll the window down you recontaminate the vehicle with ambient unfiltered air , or open a door . i can ' t grasp the advantage of an intake for the ventilation system capable of sucking up road debris other than to sell you another filter or damage other components ? if i ' m miles off track here let me know i just don ' t see the advantage from a consumer or engineering prospective .

6. smoke . it ' s the weirdest habit and stupidly tough to quit . i know i just sound like a boring moaning guy but i always tell kids to never start it . don ' t even try it . after digit years of being a smoker it took a lot of effort to cut it out .
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

7. look man , don ' t let the downvotes discourage you . just be you and know that you made some dude laugh at digit  digit am .
