1. it is identity theft . it will seriously mess with your living arrangements . be prepared for some fallout , it  s all your roommates fault assuming it is what it sounds like . i couldn  t live with a roommate after that , the trust would be gone for me .

2. i live in bulgaria and the govenment here doesnt care about shit other than money . for example they keep raising the taxes and the bills for electricity . and if you come here you can see that becouse they dont even bother fixing a single road or anything like that outside the capital . this country used to be great until capitalism took over it and fucked it in the ass .

5. well , have you ever considered that your past experience and current lifestyle is what ' s shaping your outlook right now ? i won ' t claim to be an expert but perhaps the lack of " desperate " struggling has raised your level of contentment beyond what even you would consider " normal " perhaps ? my mother came from a 3rd world country we live in the west and my dad is british and i always felt like a piece of trash whenever i visited my relatives and the little nitpicks creep into my mind . but i noticed that despite their struggles , they seem infinitely happier and more comfortable with themselves than i can honestly admit .

6. i see no use in unions . why should i be forced to give up part of my pay to be in an organization i have no interest in . they promote themselves kind of like politicians . i live in a right to work state also and have never had issues which i couldn ' t handle myself . if you are valuable to your employer then you will be taken care of , if you are lazy then i could see a union being of use to you .
