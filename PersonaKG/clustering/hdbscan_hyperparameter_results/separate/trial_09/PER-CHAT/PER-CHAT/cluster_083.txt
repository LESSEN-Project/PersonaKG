1. you know when you ' re trying to open a garage door or something and you have to spam the shit out of your button ? i ' d love to see the same option that uncharted digit has , in the settings of that game you can change it so that you can just hold down the button rather than spam it . honestly sometimes my thumb just cant move that fast so i have to hold the controller in an awkward way just so i can spam the button with my middle finger , the whole ordeal doesn ' t add anything to my enjoyment of the game , it just annoys me .
