1. i just jiggle my belly and say " what do you think "
   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

2. the question was " what is the first thing you think of " . i didn ' t say that i was stating facts , it is just the first thing that comes to mind . i have never actually been there so i can ' t say anything for sure . that is just what i think of .

4. well guys do tell me i ' m hot , but they say that about so many guys that i think it ' s just something they habitually say and it really doesn ' t mean much . it ' s also such a 1980s saying that i ' m surprised anyone still uses it lol ! i suspect they ' re just settling since they couldn ' t get any of the hot guys .

6. i ' m sure this is true , even though i think a lot . my gf will sometimes ask what i ' m thinking about and i honestly say " nothing " or " just abstract shit without any meaning " but she always has words to describe her thoughts .

7. lol what are you going to say ? just straight up ask  what are your views on feminism ?  you think a guy that wants to have sex with you is going to say  oh i hate women  ?
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

8. just be spontaneous and say something that comes up in you about the environment . one sentence i wouldn ' t recommend using in a library though , is something along the lines of  " i came here to read books but i ' d much rather read your mind " cause that probably makes her think you ' re a creep but if it doesn ' t , marry her . she ' s smart .
