Total from this dataset: 6

1. i don ' t really have anything to say , but you ' ve put a smile on your face for having personal responsibility . i can ' t sympathize with the ' previously religious ' part , but for the rest , you ' re not alone . being responsible for your own actions sucks sometimes .

2. lol . shp ? if not , yta . it ' s irrational and dramatic to say " i ' ve suddenly decided to stop eating this and if you do , you ' ll die " you do you , but don ' t force your opinions and they ' re opinions , there ' s no evidence to suggest eating fast food chicken will definitely give you cancer or guilt trip your loved ones .

3. i ' ve had this issue . those long pauses don ' t work unless someone stops me and say " can you let me finish " . it ' s a bad habit

5. don  t even try to use that as an excuse lol . there  s this thing called a labia and i can tell you it  s more comfortable say leg spread because of that . but that would be  slutty  wouldn  t it ? i  ve seen so many men sit crossed legged as well , so it not really that much of a problem is it

6. actually happened to me . my coworker offered me a xanax out of the blue in front of one other coworker . i told him i wouldn  t take it in front of the cameras then the other worker said we should go in the back where there were no cameras . so we go in the back room , things happen then we come out and don  t say anything . next morning i get a text from my general manager asking me to come to her office once i got to work . she tells me she  s  heard of drug use in the office  . thankfully i was able to pass it off as ibuprofen and our gm was insane and got fired two weeks later . really worked out in my favor but man that was scary and i easily could have been fired in my field .
