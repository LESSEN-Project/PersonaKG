2. what is responsible for the existence of our universe . i  m not talking about the big bang , rather i want an answer beyond that . i also wouldn  t accept anything involving a god of some kind . sadly i think this question is deemed to never be answered .

5. this is a very difficult subject . has she ever been molested ? i was molested by my father , starting at the age of digit . because of this , i ' m fairly certain your attraction would be a deal breaker for me . however , you are clearly an honorable man , and i want to thank you . i can only imagine how difficult this must be for you . i think your best bet would be to start the therapy if that ' s the road you want to take , and have her join you . i think hearing a professional ' s opinion , and understanding what you are dealing with will help her and the inevitable confusion that i ' m sure will come .

6. yes bones is great , and so is chekov . i think kirk , spock , and uhura could have been chosen better . overall , the kelvin timeline is not at all what i want from star trek . too much action , and not very interesting or thought provoking . but , it is keeping trek alive , so there is still hope for better quality . my favorite of the digit is beyond , followed by digit , then into darkness .
