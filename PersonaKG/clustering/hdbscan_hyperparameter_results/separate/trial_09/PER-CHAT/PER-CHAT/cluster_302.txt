3. i kinda like the idea of being a guy ' s first because they ' ll remember me forever . but sex with someone who ' s inexperienced can be a bit awkward . it ' s a turn on when a guy knows what he ' s doing . you ' re still young though , and you still have plenty of time to learn . i ' m sure lots of girls are fine with virgins .

6. i never feel like i was born in wrong time period . i feel like this was  is the best time to be born . coming decades are gonna be the turning point in human civilization , wither we are destined to become rulers of the universe or vanish without a trace . everything will depend on the decisions we make , as a species and some luck . we get front seat to witness it all . what better time to be alive ? who cares if no one liked your fb post . winking  face
