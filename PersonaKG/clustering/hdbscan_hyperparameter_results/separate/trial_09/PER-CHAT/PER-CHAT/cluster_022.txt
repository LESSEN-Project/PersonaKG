1. " its kinda like inviting food critics to your restaurant before the actual goddamn clients " is it just me or does that seem like a completely reasonable thing to do , make people who actually have knowledge about it test it first before all the normal clients come in ? i don ' t see the problem , if they did invite people completely random , the chance would be there that you couldn ' t play the game and couldn ' t watch a proper streamer play . because of the way they did it now we who don ' t have a beta key can watch the popular streamers , otherwise we couldn ' t .

2. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .

4. hey , i ' m just here being nice i don ' t like it when anyone is compared to an evil character like that . anyone . i tried to reason , see where this idea is coming from , but apparently all i am is giving " classic trump voter response " . i never voted trump . i should have , though . instead of targeting the person , how about you target the idea ? if you want a political conversation i ' ll partake . this post is about game of thrones and politics . i ' m not here to bash people like you just did . i ' m here to compare got characters to real life people , as op asked . i don ' t bash people . i challenge their idea ' s , and i would appreciate if you did the same .   x200b  stay blessed

5. if you don  t enjoy it and find no meaning from it at all from reading the book twice , then why are you attempting to force yourself to enjoy it through people who did ? if you didn  t like it then that should be the end of it , no ?

6. but then you would just get people complaining about " waaa why don ' t you tell us how you are fixing the tracker , what are you doing about rural areas , what did you have for lunch " like we do now . that simple tweet would not appease anyone .
