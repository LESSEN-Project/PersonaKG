2. the human mind is extremely suggestable and memories are pretty easy to make up . go ask one of your friends about that time you went to the gas station to grab a drink and they where out and the cashier was a dick about it . then ask them what color the cashier was . odds are they will give you details about something that did not happen . now picture you are a tiny person with a steady stream of incoming information you can ' t fully process come and your understanding of the difference between real and imaginary is still pretty fuzzy . kids can make up some wild stuff that they believe this way .
