1. we did acid with two other people , one of them had a fucked up bad trip and was eventually going to hurt himself or us he already tried to shoot us with a gun he hallucinated . before i called digit , the two other people including my former bff left . the other guy could have killed me and no one would know . it was then i realized that he didn ' t actually care about me and was toxic .

2. chillin at home cuz i definitely dislike all these celebrations which are actually pr  actions of the government . i know , everyone is supposed to show their respect to the people who probably saved the world , but russian authorities did everything to make me hate this day .

3. even if she did help you what she ' s doing is completely unreasonable , yes you had an episode a couple of years ago but she just seems to be obsessed with it and you should show your friend what people are saying about this and hopefully they ' ll get it . if not then i dunno know .

4. spouting hate in this thread too ? of course you are . and it  s because you know when your pitiful life eventually ends you won  t have a tenth of the people at your funeral as this young lady did . she  s honored and respected by her community . you on the other hand are an insignificant shit stain .

5. shit . that ' s a terrible thing to happen to you so young . if it helps , you ' re getting internet bro hugs from me . you should know that you ' re an absolute hero for talking her out of it . even if she ended up doing it later , you still gave it your all to save her . most people go through their lives without ever saving someone else ' s . most adults wouldn ' t know how to do what you did . you are a legend .

6. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself

7. i ' m a go ahead and disagree with you on that one as many people have already said the kid is digit and should already know how to treat other people property regardless and the kid did offer to pay the whole digit so op let him of easily .
