2. wonder woman has been kind of an oddity in the recent dc film universe . as good as it was it was still far from perfect . the third act is one of the worst in any superhero films . aquaman made a shit ton of money , you ' re right ! but as for quality of film ? it ' s still not as good as even the lesser succesful marvel films . and still none of them have been nominated for best picture . say what you will , but the level of quality in the dc films is almost undeniable lower than the marvel films . it pains me to say that too , because when it comes to the comics i actually lean more towards dc . but they have next to no idea what they ' re doing when it comes to films these days .

9. my complaint is that for a match made activity , there ' s not a huge amount of prompting . most of it was pretty straightforward but it would have been nice for calus to kinda say things that clue everyone in to what they need to do . other than that , it ' s good fun .
