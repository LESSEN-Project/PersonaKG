2. there  s always that one nasty kid in elementary school . i was digit and i learnt what sex was from him , santa wasn  t real , where babies come from . pretty sad really , he used to motion sex positions with his fingers in front of the whole class and i don  t fully understand what he meant until like digit !

4. take a look at this spreadsheet . it shows the completion of my living dex so far . if you can get me two pokemon from gen digit that i don ' t already have that would be great ! note  if there is writing in the " caught " column like " white " , or " reddit trade " that means that i have them already , and have to transfer them to my version of y still .

5. everything is bullshit if you don ' t have an answer to it . personally you pick it if you can get bursted down a bit quickly , and there ' s probably digit key heroes that are pretty tanky and do quite some damage . other than that the attack range is so much better , you ' re illusions get it too and you can take t3 and barracks in like digit seconds

6. this was already posted . someone mentioned that there is a possibility of an extra digit   digit  off down the road , similar to last year . yet , many of the items may be sold out by then . so grab what you like if you feel it may not be available . also those normandys are great , the ones on clearance don ' t have the same soles as the updated ones unfortunately .

7. yeah , i don ' t care of tseries vs pewdiepie either . i enjoyed his content in digit  digit , but i was like digit in digit . i agree that rewind is trash , but i also hate the memes about it . also , i stopped using youtube for almost half an year , i do not like it . i only watch simple history , geography now , armchair historian , half as interesting , seeker , allan pan , crash course , it ' s okay to be smart and others , but all of them rarely . i use reddit but i am losing a bit interest . anyways , returning to the subject , i agree with you

8. i played from digit  digit . i recently came back a a joke but one of my friend decided to join me . we made a world and it is actually fun for me . we ended up getting digit other friends on the world and now we have a survival world that i  m proud of and i actually enjoy this game , especially the aquatic update and all the new stuff . i hope the developers continue making this great and don  t become over  confident and ruin it like bo4 . i love this game again and i hope that never changes .

9. if you already have a full canadian licence you can exchange it for a full british , no need to get a provisional and then take a test although if you ' re feeling uncertain about driving here perhaps some lessons with an instructor wouldn ' t be such a bad thing . i ' m in a car club since i can ' t afford to own my own car , so i don ' t drive every day more like digit times a month or so . for me , driving in london is fine except i don ' t like driving through central london , rush hour or big roundabouts although i still manage them okay . i took my first test in pinner which is easy compared to other test centres and failed due to one silly mistake . took my second test in wanstead which is notorious for being difficult and passed .

10. how long is a wedding ceremony usually ? like digit minutes ? after that , get your phone right back out for the cocktail hour , like the sign says . simple enough . i don ' t see why it would be such an issue for you agree to those terms . it ' s their day , not yours .
   (ID: 88c35221745da41b29ff5b9f921026de5ccbb6c0)

11. yes it is very true . usually mods and yourself only see the comment karma , mine had been negative for going on digit years now because of this . the majority see something they don ' t like and immediately downvote , yet keep scrolling without up vote on anything they agree with .

12. unlike you , i can healthily control my bladder , and i don ' t have to go every digit  digit hours . once you get on a schedule , it ' s easy to stay on it . when i ' m not home , my dog can pee if she wants to or has to . but she doesn ' t . it ' s easy for her to hold it for digit hours because she always does it like that .
