1. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?

2. you  re so strong for making the decision you did though , just remember that . you  re worth so much more than the way he was treating you and you knew that  i hope you realise how amazing that is . so many people haven  t got as far as you have face  blowing  a  kiss

3. i enjoyed the 90s way too much . i just downloaded music from the radio to my tape deck . i had e  mail , but the only people i would mail with were the people i met on vacation . i had a mobile phone , but it wasn ' t that important . i would get a text or a call in the weekends from friends asking to hang out . you could still do stupid stuff without being worried you ' d get yourself filmed . we did a lot of drugs . it was such a great decade !

4. no , i have not read the book . it does sound interesting , but my question , however , is about the general populace . those who may not necessarily been implicated in anything specific , but still nonetheless turned a blind eye to what was going on around them . what was the psychology of their thinking  was it fear of retribution from the nazis , peer pressure , etc . that ' s the general nature of my question , the people at large who just , with only a limited few exceptions , did mostly or absolutely nothing to help or speak out for their neighbor . thank you , though .

5. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .
