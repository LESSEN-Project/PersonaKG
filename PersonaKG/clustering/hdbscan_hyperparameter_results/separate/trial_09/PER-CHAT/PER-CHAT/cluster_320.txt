3. a mass full retail refund does not bode well for the franchise future . i was shocked at how out of touch fallouts makers were to what the people who loved the games wanted . it ' s almost as bad as blizzard was with diablo here recently and ea with everything they do .

4. i ' m not sure we should endorse this . i can see the technology being used by authorities who actively seek to prosecute homosexual people , or by countries that allow asylum claims on the basis of sexual orientation .

8. the same thing applies to others , even with different situations . people will treat you differently based on who is and isn  t around . if you find someone who seems interested in you who does not change under attention , then you should go for it so long as you are interested .

9. why does this only work when you ' re alone ? i do this when other people are around . my colleagues only intervene if the conversation turns into an argument
