SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:

Total from this dataset: 9

1. they why has the whole logo changed at the top of box changed ? marvel bobble heads do not change like this . for example , you have the punisher funko pop . there are a few different versions . the marvel logo remains the same , but they just put the different version in in brackets by the name . ie ' the punisher thunderbolts '

3. stumbling through the club , the lights strobing so i can ' t see where my feet are planted and it feels like my body is being chopped up into different sections , and this songhttps    just blaring . finally unable to keep my balance , i accidentally pitch forward , i fall down . and someone turns up the music .

7. you shouldn ' t you shouldn ' t hit anyone , but it ' s worse when you ' re obviously a lot stronger than them and it ' s not a fair fight . just like you shouldn ' t hit children as an adult .

8. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets
