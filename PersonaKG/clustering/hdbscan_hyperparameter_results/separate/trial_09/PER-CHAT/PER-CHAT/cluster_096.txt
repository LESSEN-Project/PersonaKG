1. look up " romantic bpd relationships . not saying this is what she has , and not trying to shame anyone with this diagnosis . i just think this may give you some insight and useful strategies you seem like a lovely , thoughtful person

2. well i have a few tips that might help first off it seems like you play fill but i ' d find a role your more comfortable with and stick to that ' ll help your odds of winning alot secondly if you aren ' t communtincating with your team ie game chat or a call , that can help alot lastly it seems like you might have a low rage tolerance , if you think your about get very mad or what not take a deep breath look back at why you died reset your self and pretend the game just started and you have a second chance

3. i feel like the total opposite , swap almost everything you said the other way and thats me . im not edgy , i think my iphone is okay , idk what music i listen to but its not rock musichttps    billwurtz . com  , i like my parents , dont really care about anyone else . i dont use spotify , but instead just using a 3gb folder called " music " . i do use netlflix sometimes . i find that interesting

4. look i ' m not saying there isn ' t value in those studies , and that parenting style . it ' s just not exclusive like you seem to think it is . try raising children with different types of challenges , like autism spectrum disorder or oppositional defiant disorder , then tell me there ' s a one size fits all . also , confirmation bias . there , now i ' m really out .

5. you think that , and its not easy ofc , but its really just a case of finding someone like you . my husband and i can do ' nothing ' all day . even a week if he ' s off work .

6. i think the guy just look like him , not much more to it .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

7. what ' s been going on inside of my head ? been staring at the ceiling , for hours on end can ' t really think of anything else that i can do  maybe i can go out , and find my way , or maybe i can chill out , stay in today they sound like fun , but maybe another day  sorry , not sorry ! i couldn ' t help it ! just ignore this post , wanted to vent out .

8. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

9. this guy is like herpes . just when you think it ' s gone it shows up again with a vengance to irritate the holy shit out of you .

10. those kind of games have that " feature " but it ' s not what i meant . i think i just made some term up in my dreams or something like that . thanks for the answer though

11. i feel the same about reyn , i like riki he acts like you would expect from a nopon but reyn has just as much out of place lines as riki if not more . i know he is the best friend and everything but how can he be so stupid considering who he hangs out with . reyn and riki are both comic relief characters but i think riki has more depth . and i think riki would be far less hated if reyn had just kept his big mouth shut in riki ' s early cutscenes . reyn also has the least interesting heart to hearts with a few exceptions while riki has some of the most heartwarming . his voice might be a little grating to listen to but that is just the best any western could have done sounding ' childish ' without having an actual child or a woman doing it .

12. social studies . i can ' t stand sjw ' s that think everything is your fault just because you ' re a straight white middle class male . not everyone is like that , but there are enough to seriously rustle my jimmies .

13. i agree with you for the most part , but some of the halloween items , like the templar ' s spirit for the medic and the squid ' s lid for the demo actually look pretty cool . i think they should just do away with the restriction .

14. off topic about this picture but on topic about the bikes do these bikes have better baskets ? like are the holes on the side of the basket huge because the baskets are useless if you wanna keep your phone or anything in there because they will just slide out . like today i used one in miramar and i had a can of iron bru import from scotland i think and it slid out the side of the basket and pierced a hole in the side causing it to squirt out this is one of the older bikes

15. i see where you ' re coming from . it makes sense . i just think that when ai starts to become more effective in it ' s uses we will move on to another thing . i like to use maslow ' s hierarchy of needs as a sort of comparison . once you fulfill your needs and for food and water you move to relationships and love . i think we ' ll just move to the next level of the pyramid

16. there was this girl holding a sword and when i asked her why she just said that she always came prepared . i ' d like to think that she and her friends were actually having some variety of supernatural adventures right beneath all our noses .

17. coincidentally just finished my latest rewatch last night before bed and this post made me chuckle . creed ' s appearances in the last few episodes , and the grass roots story , is pretty funny . i like to think that creed , out of all of the characters that use their real names , is most like himself in real life .

18. it could do although it isn ' t very likely i just can ' t really think of anything else that would click like that and freeze a pc

19. i like to think burps are just your mouth farting

20. timing when to buy a home is difficult since it will obviously be a long term investment . i think you should gauge where you are living to determine if you have confidence in your city and county first . if you do then go out and buy a home that you like and can afford at the best possible price for you . trying to timing the market for a home is just not worth it .
