1. cool ! that ' s a lot of info , i ' ll have to wait until i get home tonight to dig into it . i ' ll have to give voya a good look to see what their fees are like . i might just dump my schwab ira into voya , if the numbers are right . i could also shop around some more , since i ' m not tied to voya anymore due to employment . thanks for the link .

3. that ' s really interesting to hear ! never thought about it before trying . i just figured it would feel all good and nice but it doesn ' t feel like very much . it was a sun flower so i ' m " assuming " it was real .

5. they should either remove the tac or rework it . i would rather they rework it though , my idea is make it more for shooting further away just like the heavy shotgun .  another way it could work is for bonuses for getting those meaty body shots . hitting every shot on the body should do some good damage .   x200b  pump for headshots , tac for bodyshots . also it should replace the need for an smg  secondary weapon . it needs to be a viable option or it needs to be removed .

6. no worries man i was just trying to suggest that we greet newcomers like this with advice instead . something like " you need to chill . for your own good . or you ' ll be disappointed . or something that makes them feel welcome . that last guy deleted his thread . didn ' t seem like he felt welcome at all . and he was just happy to finally have made up his mind .

7. brecci was good though , this isn ' t . i wasn ' t saying it was the remington , it ' s the only comparable in one shot kill type of way . it ' s bad when i ' d rather use fists in half the gun fights tbh . and the sg12 isn ' t garbage unless you can ' t click the trigger more than two times . any average player can use the gun like any other , sure it ' s no saug , but it ' s still way better than the mog12 . it ' s just depressing .

8. i ' m the third , walking dead isn ' t a horrible show at all , it ' s just has " filler  like " episodes that can be boring but when the good ones do come on its worth it .

9. like with anything , just be as careful as you can afford to be . take pride in your gear and it ' ll serve you well . cases are a good idea but not essential  however , it ' s better to have one than not .

11. dude if there is an audience for it then why wouldn ' t i ? it just seems like an honestly genuinely good idea .

12. at a dinner party , i asked a couple good friends how they met . one of them dumped the other to date my so for a year and then they got back together . everyone in the damn room apparently knew because they all just stared at me like i was crazy . my so never told me this shit .

13. compare his lifestyle to the previous one . the current pope is much more modest with his attire and seems to me like a genuinely good guy . it ' s a nice message and you are just hating so you can hate on religion . why do you care ?
