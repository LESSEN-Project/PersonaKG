1. i don ' t really see how you could die from it , unless the hair follicle somehow got infected or something . that sounds like one of those internet " facts .

4. didn ' t  pics used to have a rule along the lines of " the picture has to be interesting independent of its title " or something like that ? even then , there was no moderation of the sob stories , but now i don ' t even see that rule on the sidebar anymore . this sub is really going to shit

7. it takes me a few minutes to really focus on my text book , so it helps when i ' m in a quiet place , maybe with a candle or something that calms me down . for some reason studying scares me  like i won ' t be able to comprehend the material , or i ' m reading the wrong things , so anything that helps me relax i try . for that reason i don ' t like studying in a public place . music helps too but sometimes i get distracted by the words .

8. " no talking . no more talking " " you don ' t pay me enough to talk to me like that " no really , they haven ' t paid me in four weeks .
