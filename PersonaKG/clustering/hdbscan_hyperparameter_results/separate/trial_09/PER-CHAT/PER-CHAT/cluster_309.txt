2. i found a yellow bird only once . it was hiding behind a dumpster at the car wash leaning against a garage . the map made it look like it was in the garage , which is probably why it was still there . i only bothered to look for it because it was right next to the nest i was releasing in . i  ve learned not to go out of my way looking for them anymore .
