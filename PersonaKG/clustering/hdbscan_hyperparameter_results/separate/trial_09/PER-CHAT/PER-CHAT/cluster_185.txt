3. the good ones always have a particular , well  drawn mood . they push your entertainment tension and mind to somewhere it hasn  t been before , and hence they make you feel a way you haven  t felt before . to be a good horror movie director you have to possess very precise control of your craft . the timing has to be just right . there  s a careful balance of lingering on a shot juuussst too long just to give each scene that extra tension and to trigger the audiences  imagination . same goes for the type of shots . the beautiful thing about horror movies is that the scariest part is what you as a viewer imagines is about to happen , because your imagination knows exactly what you  re afraid of . the director makes you do your own scaring , and that requires massive levels of finesse . if you ask me

4. as a guy , i can tell you , he  s not stopping . it  s not a matter of you or the other girls , it  s a change . i agree that the pictures over video is probably i  m the minority but to each their own . unless you  re always there to have sex when he  s horny , probably nothing you can do about it . the best thing to do is just what you have , express your discomfort and how you feel and leave it alone . let him work through and compromise for you , or not . its not worth starting a fight , not for either party . i hope your bf calms down on it though so you feel more comfy , good luck .
