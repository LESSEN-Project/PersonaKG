Total from this dataset: 5

1. you should stop trying very hard to get her to orgasm . many women , even those who do orgasm from penetrative intercourse , will get flustered and self  conscious and turned off if it ' s apparent to them that a guy is that focused on her orgasm . if she can ' t make herself come by masturbating , it ' s unlikely that anything you ' re doing is going to change that . focus on pleasing her and making her feel good , by her standard of what is pleasing and feels good , not yours . most women need to feel relaxed to climax , and feeling pressured to climax by your partner is the opposite of relaxing . here ' s a question  whose problem is this ? is your wife bothered by her lack of orgasm , or are you the person who is most upset about it ? if the former , there are workshops that she could attend that might help . if the latter , why would you create a problem in your marriage where none exists ?
