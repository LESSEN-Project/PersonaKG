5. you could just unfriend  delete the annoying people off of your feed , it leaves you with the people you actually give a shit about and means you can still at least have an active account should you need to use it in the future .

6. you people will never stop trump . how can you people expect to stop trump if you people refuse to argue against his policies ? all i see is a bunch of people complaining about how " mean " trump is . the washington post lost their access to trump events because the majority of the articles they put out on trump have nothing to do with his policies and instead they just focus on trying to get the reader to become irrationally emotional so they can guide them into hating trump . maga

7. i need to collect my bags up top , which on many occasions were either attempted to be stolen or people thought it was theirs . i should note i  m one of those people that likes to wrap their handles in every color of the rainbow , just to avoid exactly what i mentioned .

8. sex trafficker because most king pins have standards a lot of people have mom ' s that they ' d die for , but a sex trafficker is one cold motherfucker . just the fact that he  she could be manipulating you and you not knowing is unsettling .

9. well , that disproves my theory that people on the internet are dickheads because they aren ' t seeing a human face when they ' re posting something ugly . now i ' m just down to most people being dickheads .

10. when people touch your stuff . it happens too often that people just pick up my backpack and throw it on my lab instead of asking to free the seat next to me . and for some reason its always women who do that , guys always ask
