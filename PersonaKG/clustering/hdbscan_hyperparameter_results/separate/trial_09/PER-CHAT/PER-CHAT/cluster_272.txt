   (ID: 97a098bef8517b2080cad8aa73f738b95e795b18)

2. it ' s not really faking it though . you ' re just putting the diagnosis out of your mind . you ' re temporarily living your life as a regular person that just does stuff differently . it ' s just a mindset change to help you better become aware of your actions that are excusable by your asperger ' s and those that are not .

3. i legit saw the news and then i watched his last apology video . i cried . it has just been an extremely rough period for etika and he just couldn ' t pull through . it was not his fault . it was no one ' s fault . he just said a lot of things that backfired on him and then refused to get help . he was aware of his own situation but he just couldn ' t make it . he was a really cool dude overall who was always enthusiastic and funny . it ' s just sad to see him go away . rest in piece desmond amofah . we ' ll prove you wrong and never forget you .

4. the vaping itself , actually . all i care about is a device that works . if it works , i ' m happy as a clam . nobody bothers me about vaping . in fact , i get more condescension amongst vapers than smokers . everyone else seems either really interested or just minds their own business .

5. not really , it ' s not all that uncommon in the lesbian community if you ' re in a relationship . which she is , just definitely not with me . we each have a wife at home .

6. i legit prayed once . it was to move into a certain house . we ended up moving there . i guess i prayed to " god " or whatever . wasn ' t really a clear person in mind . just wanted to move lol .

   (ID: 6692d386ab188df76448f18f0e9d59c1e6d88c50)

8. i ' m really sorry but you have asked so many questions about absolute random stuff that you would probably be better off without . just go on tinder and get yourself a man or something , please .
   (ID: 93e3d10c1d0bffae76c0adb5d9a96d6abf1aade9)

   (ID: 9286ff57fb4290178a79b38d20f6a95da9d2267f)

11. just act really happy that they invited you and pretend you thought you were the right person all along . but do ask them to call you by your real name if they talk to you .
   (ID: b863480affffa35b0ead5c7bc5daa4c4099c0cee)

12. my eyes are bleeding . even if all these emojis are a part of the joke which just makes no sense in this case , it ' s still really painful to see
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

13. if you found them because you were also using the app , then you can ' t really be mad , but you should definitely talk , discuss being open , or just break up . if someone else found them and showed you , just break up .

14. it  s actually insane to me how ppl call tat waiter a creep and suggest op should report him to the restaurant . with the given info the waiter really might have just tried to be as friendly as possible  maybe just really likes kids  has grandchildren himself . he even gave her a desert for free , jesus . just to be stigmatized for being a pedophile , potentially being fired ? op , yta .

15. that ' s not really her goal though , is it ? if westeros was being run by a benevolent ruler , she would still be invading the continent to reclaim the iron throne . she just happens to have lucked out that someone worse than her is currently in power .
   (ID: 1daf414799a71e9da93424af4505068a3a02f6ce)

16. maybe we ' re just lucky . its a really popular video from what i can remember .
   (ID: 4e0f41bc85f51f64d9103c2a165328ff6329dea1)

   (ID: f179711c18514780c1b0257643d893ef1cf5a081)

18. they could just be really busy . that is a possibility , i hardly speak to my best mate anymore , but he works real fucking hard now so i understand we can ' t hang out everyday anymore
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

19. nudes shouldn ' t really be required . when you ' re in a relationship , just the thought of em ' makes you happy . counting the days till you get to see em ' again .
   (ID: 8712de543372bc5f398d43ea5b918c85efc5dda7)

20. get really close and do the whole " i ' m not touching you " thing . then if i get bored with that just start copying them .
