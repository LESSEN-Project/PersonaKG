6. though this particular instance of your feeling is about harry potter , the deeper seeded feeling seems like a lack of self worth . do you find other symptoms of this ? do you sometimes take non critical comments about you critically ? or feel attacked by other people  s comments or perceptions of you ?

11. ! most of these top players are streamers with lots of people stream sniping them . easy to rack up kills when noobs are doing anything they can to kill you . and honestly , who are you to judge anyone else ? he asked about the scoring system and you ' re here talking trash about his record . people like you are what makes this sub look so bad .

15. how do all the houses store their money ? granted i ' m only reading asos , but so far no one has come upon another house ' s stash of gold no spoilers please , and all the wealthy characters seem to carry only small pouches of coin . also any idea how the currency works ? one gold dragon seems like a shitload to most poor people

16. now that seems a little harsh . why should i murder my wife when she ' s of the same mindset as you ? she hates all varieties of olives . and why should i commit suicide ? i actually save people like you and she by eating all those unwanted black olives . seems pretty shortsighted of you .
   (ID: 0e56d8a3bf928d2e85ff5b7a5a98f913d2826b00)

17. if they ' re volunteering it as a conversation starter , cool . a lot of people with asperger ' s do this . it can be mistaken for narcissism but it ' s more about trying to find something to connect over , because in social interactions , one ' s self might feel like the only " safe " topic , at least to start . if someone keeps changing the topic to themselves , pulling discussions that others are having to " let ' s talk about me " , that seems more like an attention  narcissism thing and yeah it can get old fast grinning  face  with  sweat
   (ID: 2f62aeebd18bd873078151ee21a92be33ffd3e29)

20. well , if you stand under the wrong tree a pissed off drop bear might get you , but a snake will only strike at you if you startle it when close enough that it doesn ' t feel like it can get away  like if you ' re crashing through the bush chasing one or two terrified people . i ' d be at least a little concerned , but then , i ' m not a murderer . if i was a victim , i ' d take the chance of a snake bite and leg it at the first opportunity . i save my ' everything in australia will murder you ! ' stories for my kiwi husband and friends  it makes me look like a badass when i tell them about how i killed an eastern brown with a shovel or found a redback in my bed .
