3. it was kinda unbearable , but in a good way ?  i get exactly what you mean ! it  s like , what you  re doing feels good , but at the same time the area is too sensitive so it feels like too much at one time ? i was also confused by that the forst time i came , f17 too here btw !

4. i like to watch you have a good time . nothing like the glee during the aftermath of some new trauma . it ' s interesting to see how much joy comes out of this fucked up shit .

8. i definitely agree with that boss and the kotor characters . seems like a good time to implement them since no movies are coming out so they could be filler characters .

9. depends on whether it ' s a good marriage or a bad one . a good marriage is like living with your best friend , but you also get to have sex with them all the time .

10. i hope you both are ! it ' s a good feeling knowing that you have someone who cares about you no matter what and accepts your flaws . knowing you can barely talk for years while you ' re off doing your own thing , but then when you talk again it ' s like no time has passed , that ' s a good feeling , too .
