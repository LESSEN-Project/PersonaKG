3. no offence taken , it ' s not just about the pvp , it ' s also about farming , which is fine if that ' s how others want to play . i was of the understanding that fw was about conflict and dominating the enemy , this can be pretty hard if the enemy just warps off when i turn up , if you ' re at ' war ' then be at ' war ' . i can understand why these ideas may not be for you in particular , but maybe , just maybe , a lot of others may be just as frustrated as me and actually want to have some gf ' s . i like different points of view as sometimes brilliant ideas can evolve , how  what would you like to see done to improve fw ?

5. many subreddits have rules about what can be posted . you just have to follow these rules and find the appropriate subreddit for what you are wanting to post . some subreddits even have certain times that they allow certain things to be posted , it can be rather confusing . once you figure out which subreddits  communities that you like and want to be a part of it will be easier . one more thing , most subreddits have a minimum account age  karma requirement before you are able to post anything at all . so , just begin commenting on posts and gaining karma , eventually you will be able to post like everyone else . just dont ask the mods what the minimums are , this will likely result in a ban .

6. could you imagine saving an orgasm for later like a " pick  me  up " you can just activate when you want it ? that would be cool

8. i see that , but it  s still the fact of if someone doesn  t want to see it , why would you do it there ? just like there are toilets , there are also breast pumps or you could just do it at home . i would completely be alright if it were at home with friends over , but when it is random strangers , just be used you have a child doesn  t mean you get to expose yourself for your convenience
