1. religious bigotry is why people like you don ' t get respect . you offer nothing but hate

2. it ' s your choice , and everyone has their reasons . i sometimes feel like people who don ' t drink can be a little judgmental of people who do , but i grew up around baptists so maybe thats why .

3. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .

4. i get why some people don ' t like the casting choices but why not give them a chance and at least watch some of their performances which by the way i can ' t find much for anya

5. saw someone post something like this the other day . i don ' t understand how people don ' t get , it ' s not at all confusing . users submit any content they like , which gets voted on by the community , and those which get overwhelmingly positive feedback reach the front page of the internet

6. um , no the odds of him having a child are the odds of anyone else having a child . you either do or you don  t . and he could use a surrogate like plenty of straight people do too .

7. i absolutely hate the threads that are deep  seated in woman hating . yet these people cry and moan about not having friends or a life outside of reddit . gee , i wonder why ? maybe if half the people on reddit stopped whining , stopped giving into the hivemind and show girls some respect . maybe , juuuuust maybe , she will like you . also , reddit is not a reliable source of dating advice ! when a single woman goes on a date with you , all your karma points don ' t mean shit . show her you ' re not an asshat and she ' ll like you .

8. well , as harsh as it might sound , there might be people in your life who have slept with everyone but you and they still don ' t owe it to you to sleep with you . that said , i guess it ' s one ' s own choice whether one wants to hang around with a person like that , not out of spite , but out of being annoyed by being regaled with all the fine details which might be tmi .

9. i have the mentality of " well i don ' t like myself so why would other people like me . this just makes me push people away . the few people that i feel comfortable talking to always remain aquaintances .

10. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .

11. couldn  t agree with you more . yes it wasn  t a perfect remake but it was pretty damn close in my books . if people don  t like remakes , i get that . but i can  t understand why people on reddit hate on this movie otherwise . i  m not sure what people who didn  t like it would have changed . the video said jungle book was better ? how ? they were almost the same in turns of animation . i liked it . my friends liked it . like you said the original will always be number one in my heart . but this was a damn fine movie in its own right .
