1. that is a deeply reductive line of thought . i don ' t deny the fact that sex is fun . but we live in an age where we no longer have to be slave to our primal impulses . have you read about maslow ' s hierarchy of needs ? you ' re stuck on the lowest level . your biological duty , as you put it , is to procreate , yes . then what ? what is the point of just fucking around if you have no other reason to live ? take it from me , living a shallow existence like that is incredibly unsatisfying .

2. i understand full well what the symbolism behind all that stuff is intended to mean , i just strongly disagree with it . it ' s not about false patriotism ? dude , what world do you live in ? i don ' t care what your reasoning is , having kids recite the pledge to a flag every morning is brainwashing . they ' re basically being forced into patriotism without being given a chance to decide tor themselves as to whether or not they even agree with it .

5. like all dating apps . when you do finally meet someone who you like and get on well with . they live miles away ! this will be no different . just accept your gonna be single forever . it ' s easier that way . trust me .

6. me ? i dont have an existential crisis anymore i accepted we probably live in a simulation a while ago sounds stupid but look up neil degrass tyson ' s video on it he explains it really well but you should probably just take your mind off of it and or work toward accepting it and like me it might give you some weird peace knowing that nothing you ever do will matter .

7. nah it was on instagram , i regretfully used to be apart of the whole depression community and it  s not like everyone  s convincing each other to cut themselves and shit it  s like the complete opposite but some of them always seemed to be trying to one up each other if you get me ? it was quite toxic . then this girl went live and just oof .

8. it just is daunting to me to have such a large population for a city , and i would hate to move into the " bad parts " unknowingly . it would be like someone moving to townsville and accidentally going to live in vincent . they . would . die .
