4. thanks , that only made me think everyone else was doing the same thing , and doubled down my fear that they were just tolerating my presence out of politeness . that ' s pretty much how all of society works , we all just tolerate each other existence . you fit right in .

   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

   (ID: 3bc536069edd6aa052ced5b6ea5f69eefae07cb7)

10. so what if they ' re not the highest quality ? op is proud of them and i think they look nice , so just stop being a dick about it
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

11. you think a decade and a half of blacklisting , effectively destroying his ability to have a career and a prosperous life , is a just reactioon to what you classify as dumb mistakes ?
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

12. just when you think it ' s gone you hear the eeeeeee .
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

13. that ' s just statistics at work . if you have ever even glanced at the numbers to see how many planets are around how many stars around how many galaxies then the idea of any single phenomenon occurring once and only once becomes so unlikely it ' s borderline insane not to think there is life out there .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

14. why should you panic if there is nothing to lose . youre not playing in the katowice grandfinal . just try your best and if you fail , think . about what you could have done . better in that situation . you learn by mistakes
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

15. go , why the hell not ? just be smart and have a plan to gtfo if everything goes south midway through . i think you should tell someone you ' re going , a friend an adviser or someone you can count on if it goes to shit . you will regret not going .
   (ID: f4e4929bb0bef09e7eb72aaccf20c2d9454729c7)

16. not really with having the realization that i never really loved anyone or love anyone . as i think about it i just sort everyone based on if i can tolerate them
   (ID: 4e784da799782c45d8883de53e87a533129a3b8e)

17. just gonna throw this out there but i think the older brother is gonna be ippos first pro opponent , cant remember his name but its the one who quit and got fat  they just look similar imo , have similarly aggressive personalities and overconfidence in their under trained fighting strength , its just a feeling .
   (ID: 64ee30820164d5febf4618f35085fd26a3387cc9)

18. your reply made me think about it more . in another example , i guess if someone wanted to change their clothes for free at a gilded wardrobe they would just go to another person ' s house party . it ' s lazy , but effective i guess . i think i ' ll just visit a poh and get someone to make flatpacks for me there .

19. actually i just realized op  s would still be wrong because the apostrophe shows ownership so i think it would just be ops . my bad
   (ID: 5042e4f4cf4f00f86836211d30b97922c92f0b46)

20. if there ' s nothing i can do , i just think .
