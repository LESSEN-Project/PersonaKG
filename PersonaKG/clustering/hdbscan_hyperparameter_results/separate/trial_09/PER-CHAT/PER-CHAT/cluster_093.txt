1. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .

2. she gave both of them the exact same treatment and even tried to get him to hang out at a different time . how is that playing favourites ? he doesn  t get to kick someone out of the friend group just because he  s not comfy around them anymore . everyone else is still friends with her . it doesn  t matter that he was around first , she  s here now and has just as much right to have friends as he does . it sucks that he missed out on game night because he didn  t want to see her , but that  s his problem , not op  s .

3. because they are angry and frustrated that things aren ' t going the way the want them to go with op . they express their frustration by slamming doors since , a constructive dialog hasn ' t happened for a long time . there have been only shouting , blaming and anger . op you should just bake some cookies and invited your roommate for some tee and talk about bettering your living situation . when you both work hard on yourself you can improve the life of yours and those around you . or just put a bucket of wood glue on top his door , heat up his door handle while he sleeps or just lock his door from outside , when he slams it again , until he has starved so much he will be sorry for his behavior and won ' t do it again .

4. well , i too do not want any spoiler . but that ' s just life in the internet man . there will be spoilers . just finding a way to combat this rather than staying inside a cave until your screening time .

7. just keep in mind that ghosts are totally weak and our spirits can totally overwhelm them . my approach to ghosts now is i ' m sad that they failed to reincarnate , so i want to help them move on that ' s kinda what i was told all the time too while growing up . sometimes i wish one of them would just come talk to me without appearing scary .
