Total from this dataset: 5

1. watch it again . its after he turns and runs . listen to them talk about it , as well . not even close . and if he had called it and thats what caused kozma to break off , why do him and holiday look at each other like a couple of bumbling idiots immediately after ? regardless of how you think of that particular call , instant replay would be of huge benefit to all teams in the mlb .

2. do you think it ' d work ? maybe , maybe not . the biggest problem is that marcone is assuming that when dresden comes for him it will be a straightforward assault on marcone in a position where marcone has the advantage . harry ' s a lot smarter and sneakier that that . the thing is that marcone as a character is a lot like harry . underpowered compared to some of his enemies , but smart enough to win anyway . a conflict between the two of them is likely to be a lot more like a chess game than a straight  up fight .

3. i think a lot of this comes down to the definitions of coercion and seduction . yes , in seduction the idea is to do your best to be enticing to someone . however , this should not be confused with a bending of their will or a manipulation . coercion is doing whatever is necessary to achieve a desired response from someone else , including putting extra pressures on them , which can be easily done if the coercing party is in a position of power , whether that is physical strength , employment , or status . seduction is like giving someone all green lights , coercion is like trying to take the steering wheel .

4. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .

5. i think it was more that his character evolved the most . he started out as a date rapist and eventually ended up a monogamist who openly loves blair . he still makes mistakes of course , but he is actually remorseful and doesn ' t continue to repeat bad habits like all the other characters . also , his character has a lot of dimension , which makes him more interesting than someone like nate .
