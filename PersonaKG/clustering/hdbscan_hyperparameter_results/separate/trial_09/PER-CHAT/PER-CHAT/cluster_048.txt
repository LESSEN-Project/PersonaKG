1. since it ' s under the table , i ' m guessing the money your parents give you can be treated as a gift . as such , there would be no taxes owed or paid since it ' s not on record at least i ' m assuming your parents did not note it in their business expense report . since it doesn ' t sound like an actual " job " job , then i ' m also going to say that this isn ' t something you plan on writing on your job resume in the future . if that ' s the case , pocket the money and save  invest wisely .

8. i agree ! to pretty much anyone in a western  hemisphere or of european lineage context it  d be a fist fight . but , in their context though they see it as innocent not to say it  s not ignorant of medical conditions and genetics , etc , caring and a less awkward way of telling a person they  re getting pudgy . if someone was really offended they would be profusely apologetic , but also completely not understand what they did wrong and still chalk it up to a foreigner not understanding the culture .

9. roby  " have you ever done anything to hurt the national security of this country " what a pointless question ! regardless of whether he did or not , the only way he would say yes is if he believes he has taken actions to purposefully hurt the country . he ' s not a cartoon villain . he ' s a misguided idiot .
