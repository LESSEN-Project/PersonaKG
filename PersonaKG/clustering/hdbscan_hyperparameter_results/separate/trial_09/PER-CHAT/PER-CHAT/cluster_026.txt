1. esh . he  s the asshole for getting you something he should know by now that you don  t like , but yta for throwing away food . i hate onions too . and i  ve had this exact thing with my cheesesteak . and i picked as much of the onion off as i could and just ate it . there  s way too many starving people and children all over the world to throw away food

2. people are giving you shit because of your attitude . you ' ve came across as someone that thinks they know better than the fbi because you ' ve done a little course on profiling . you have also mentioned several times that it doesn ' t matter if you ' re wrong . well it does . like i said in a previous comment , what if one of your students makes up scandalous lies with absolutely no evidence about another student hen goes and tells the whole school . would you just let it fly because ' they were wrong ' like you said , these comments ' don ' t hurt anyone ' and your comment about having to treat him as a pedophile even though he ' s been cleared because of your job is insane . every teacher or person in charge of children across the world treats michael jackson as a pedophile ? come on .

3. first of all . the phrase white ass bread upbringing is pretty spot on . i will say i don ' t expect people to understand or anything like that . honestly , i just lament the lack of diversity in which i grew up . i believe whole heartedly that empathy can be a major component of basic human connection . but it comes back to the question of how do i empathize something i haven ' t been able to really understand , you know ? i love the advice of being a quiet student og the world though . i just feel like that ' s what i have been doing and wondering if i can do better now , if that makes sense .

4. kind of specific but i  ve felt most comfortable when it  s a guy that  s sitting next to me . esp when i was sitting first and then they sit next to me . i know it sounds weird but it makes me feel kind of . special ? anyway i  ve never actually had even a friendship come from the conversations but as long as they  re being nice i like talking to people . i may seem like i don  t wanna talk but i  m just shy . i just wish they  d seem like they talked to me bc they wanna get to know me . it always seems like it  s out of boredom or being polite .

5. whoah . does this ever work for you ? like after you meet the girl ? what happens ? she ' s just like , oh you are awesome i dont care that you photoshopped your photos ? or do you fess up , or just lie and say they are old ?   x200b   remind myself to never trust mens photos again  up until now , all i ' ve heard is my male friends or matches bitch about women who don ' t look like their profile pictures . what ' d you do if a girl showed up who looked nothing like what you pictured ? are you interested still ? people have a problem with that because it ' s being dishonest from the get go . it has nothing to do with what magazines do to make money , we are never going to meet them . or more people would know models don ' t look like that !

6. really , i have to thank you for the exchange we ' ve had . i intend to share it with as many people as i can . my friends all over the internet , my peers at work , and all the folks i have contact with on social media . i plan to share it with strangers at every opportunity . and you know what , those folks will share it with their friends and acquaintances . it will go far and wide . on and on . all over the country . look back at the lengths you ' ve stretched to bend reality because of your obsession with guns . the facts you ' ve attempted to dismiss because they don ' t square in a gun nuts head . the reality that americans kill eachother with guns more than any other developed nation . that america leads the world in mass shootings . keep hunting your hogs as the world looks back at you with disgust and pity . i should feel sorry for you but i don ' t . i have common sense and you do not . this is the last time i ' ll be responding to the nonsense you post . just know that you ' ve provided me with enough evidence to convince all those that have yet to be subjected to the garbage you and your ilk spew to reject it on a logical and factual basis . sleep on that . like i said earlier . thank you . your posts are nonsensical and increasingly bizarre . you have confirmed to me and to all that i intend to share this exchange with lol , which is a hell of a lot that gun nuts are real and are preposterous . so in love with the ability to create death that the essence of living is total lost to them . thank you . you have gone beyond proving any point i wished to make . once more . the gun control lobby have nothing to fear from you and will soon see their advocacy pay dividends because of crusading sophists like you leading the charge .
