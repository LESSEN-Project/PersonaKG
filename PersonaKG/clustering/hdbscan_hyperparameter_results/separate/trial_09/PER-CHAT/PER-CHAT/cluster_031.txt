SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 7

1. its was my first one too , so i recommend you jojo ' s bizarre adventure , mob psycho digit and overlord . jojo ' s is a must have for anime fans . just watch it even if the first episodes are more or less bad . if you liked one punch man you will also like mob . that all i want to say to that . try overlord if you want something new .

2. we ' re together for nearly digit months now and i understood how important she is to me . i won ' t get into cliche descriptions but what i want to say it how awesome it feels when someone is genuinely themselves and open to you . she knows how much i love her . there basic  username101 , aren ' t you the sweetest bestfriend in the world ?

3. that ' s the key , practise ! if you ' re shooting digit or so over your much better than average . i ' d say you have talent but if you want to get better than that practice more and have lessons more frequently . any way thats what i hope to do because if i dont i wont progress much .

4. depends how urgently you need an extra merge for scoring purposes . if this gets you over some arena tier threshold or makes it a lot easier , i ' d say merge . but as you said ,  digit merge doesn ' t do much in itself so i ' d say fodder her if you really want to do that build .

5. i typically find it easier to show them a picture if i want a new style . if i want a trim i just say something like " a digit fade on the sides and just the tips off the top "

6. all first want to say this is just an idea for going forward this is not something i am telling you to do . this was put together during chat after the show . fast forward world digit years ryan plays baby , geoff plays vic  lea baby , gen plays lea elf so still young jp plays smee dwarf so still young sorry jp no better idea came up . again do what ever the fuck you want to , but thought it was interesting to pass on . thoughts ?

7. producing an average digit episode anime costs around  digit million , and if you want to provide animators with a liveable wage , especially in america , that ' s going to increase quite significantly . and that ' s when the studios are already established . so i ' d say start by building up some capital .
