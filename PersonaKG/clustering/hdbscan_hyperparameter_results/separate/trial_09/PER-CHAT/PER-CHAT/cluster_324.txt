13. the post says not to bring a kuruma or other armored vehicles . you replied to my post , you must have that that digit statement . so what do you do ? you wring a car with weapons in a heist with you to use it in that heist . i couldn ' t care less if you used it to drive around in and then parked it at the side of the road . instead you decided to use it . i have explained why i rather not have people use those cars makes it more difficult for other players because enemies scatter , the passengers never gain any decent gun skills because the vehicle is doing all the covering for them  generally speaking people who drive armored vehicles are douchebags who ram into each other with their cars or drive over people . still using your car is the douchy thing to do if people ask of you not to use it .

18. tbh there are a lot of 2d games that are better than hzd , such as super mario bros digit and digit . i ' m not saying this game doesn ' t have its niche fanbase that will replay it people such as yourself , i ' m saying it wont be the sort of timeless game that continues getting new players into it years and years after release . it will instead fade into obscurity . the reason it wont age well is , as i mentioned , the fact that it ' s a copied and pasted open world format in an already overrsaturated genre . and it ' s boring .
