1. i wouldn ' t worry . even if something came back on you , it would come down to the prosecutor . does he think he could prosecute you in a charge , and would it be worth it ? it would be pretty easy to convince him that a jury would let you off all day long . guilt or innocence means very little at times . you wouldn ' t be worth their time . no offense .

2. and then cry rape the next day . you said that . not me . women do go to bars , drink , meet men and have sex . i doubt their intention is to accuse someone of rape after such an event , but it does happen . if you say it doesn ' t then you ' re not being honest .  edit  you also said  i have never heard of a woman needing to get drunk to have sex with someone . again , i dont think this is an honest statement either . i would almost be willing to bet you that more than half first time sex between couples involve some alcohol . its going to be hard for me to find anything statistically on that because every time i try to google it all that comes up are alcohol related rapes .

4. i still prefer vodka funny story  when i tried it for the forst time i told said friend that i afraid that i might get addicted to weed , and he told me not to worry . a day after my first high said friend offered me weed again and i said no thanks . i am a guy that gets to addictions really easy , and i still refused . that ' s a message to our fellow friends , if you think weed will make you a junkie , it ' s simply not gonna happem , of i turned it down , you will . definitly

5. i think maybe he ' s referring to the fact that in the rpg rules , sponsored magic is something you choose whether or not to use , and you take debt every time you do . in the novels , pretty much all of harry ' s spells were enhanced with hellfire involuntarily the whole time lash was in his head .
