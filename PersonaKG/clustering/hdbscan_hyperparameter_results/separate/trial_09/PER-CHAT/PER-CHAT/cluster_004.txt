1. if you honestly expect me to sit here and believe then you got another thing coming . what you just told me was some straight up mgtow shit . now building yourself is a good thing . it ' s always good to live your life and learn new experiences , but flaunting it in order to get women won ' t attract the right women . i don ' t have to look like guys on the media to get a girl . guess what ? i ' m not and i can accept that . i don ' t want to be that guy . girls have the right to choose who they want and so do we . i rather live my life how i want to , than live a lie to make a girl happy . stop going around and telling bullshit lies just because you ' ve been rejected .

2. for fucks sake . no i ' m no talking about iraq . enjoy a joke . live life for fun . quit looking down your nose . fine , call me a " foolish yankee " if you want . i ' ll laugh at myself too . because i really don ' t give a fuck . i ' m here for fun , laughs , and good . why anyone would want to analyze a silly joke to the point that you have is beyond me , but please feel free . i ' m sure it will enrich your life and give you a extra pip in your step . carry on .

3. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart

4. shunning women  relationships , the amount of stress it has taken off my shoulders is indescribable . we live in a day  age where people are expected to look amazing , have great jobs etc . mostly for the benefit of others , especially the opposite sex . getting rid of my social media etc , and realising i don ' t want a relationship was a good decision in my case , i can now focus on me , and what i actually want to do with my life on a personal level without worrying about getting a girlfriend , if i ' m good looking  cool enough etc .

5. well , if memories could be restored and uploaded in the new brain , that person could live some of his life back again , finishing whatever they had left before dying , or just because they have the money , and don ' t want to die yet , to learn about cultures faster and shit . like a hard drive that you can manipulate but then you can restore it as how you got it . i dunno man , i ' m pretty drunk .

6. i don ' t have experience with cheating parents or spouses , at least not that i ' m aware . i do agree with you that is wrong and harmful to both women . however , if i were in your shoes , i would have to ask myself some questions . first , what do you want to accomplish by speaking with your mom ? you clearly cannot change her behavior by talking to her about it , as you have tried that . secondly , what kind , if any , relationship do you want with her ? if you intervene in some way call the wife , confront the man , etc , you will be further alienating your mom . and lastly , can you live with this knowledge and not intervene if that is the only way to save your relationship with your mother ? if you answer these questions honestly and with great contemplation or not rashly , i believe you will know what course you should take . good luck !
