5. he didn ' t almost collapse a grooming gang trial and it utterly transparent that you only all of a sudden give a shit about the victims because you think it bolsters your point of ' football man bad ' . you didn ' t care about those girls before and you don ' t care about them now and that is precisely why someone like tommy robinson came to prominence .

10. this actually sound like an issue with the pc  mac  s hardware . you could check your activity monitor and see if the interface is initiating some type of search for new software , but i don  t think that  s what it is . turning off the internet is recommended for optimizing your daw . but who are we kidding . i don  t think many prosumers do . this isn  t a very common issue which is another reason i think it  s the computer  s ports .
