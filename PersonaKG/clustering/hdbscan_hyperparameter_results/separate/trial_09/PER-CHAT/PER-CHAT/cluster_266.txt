5. excuse what . was that a compliment ? or do i not have freedom of speech ? i called myself ugly stating that i cant relate in that aspect but i came up with the simple idea maybe that she should go with her husband so if something happens she has someone there for her and someone who can make her feel better about what just happened and so he can tell them off like most guys do
