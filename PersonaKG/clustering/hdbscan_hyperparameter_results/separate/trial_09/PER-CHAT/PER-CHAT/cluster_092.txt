1. ya i want to have sex . not hurt anyone just use their mortal vessal to accept my genetic material and have hehim make a decent chunk of change for a few moments of his  her time . and that way theyd be regularly tested and deemed fit for service . untill they have to " get service " so to speak , then they take some time off till they ' re ready again if they so chose .

2. i was just answering op  s question . sorry if my response offended you . if you don  t want to have in depth discussions about the show and waste your time , why even browse this subreddit ? that  s kind of the point . i love the show how it is i was just giving my opinion of what i would do if i could change it . no need to get upset .

3. sending a message is definitely a possibility , i just doubt it will be through time . hopefully we ' ll get some more info on this soon . i don ' t want to discuss fan theories  i just wanted to talk about time travel in general .

5. personally , i ' d save experimenting with new forms of weed for when you don ' t have anything else going on . you ' re paying for the concert and you ' ll want to enjoy it , so why take the risk that you ' ll be too high to fully appreciate it ? there ' s also the risk that you ' ll underestimate your tolerance or the dose and you ' ll just be spending the whole time waiting for a high that never comes . if you do decide to try edibles , just follow the normal advice and take very small doses with plenty of time in between .

6. that  s the thing though . we don  t have to be in the mood . we may just want to get on with whatever we are doing but the little voice inside our head is just saying the weirdest of shit that half the time we would never even dream of doing . it  s really god damn annoying . imagine having a tiny sex offender stuck in your head
