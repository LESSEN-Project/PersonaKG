   (ID: 7c444bdb5e40b14c80aedd1bf794f5902bb7133e)

2. i think it ' s a really useful device and it has two uses three if you count getting mew so it ' s a good buy imo
   (ID: 315ad21e3ce098f09bec23f9b7509d07540912c7)

3. i think the amount of toxicity a person experiences can and will be different from someone else , so asking how toxic the game is won ' t give you a good answer .

4. fast . ai will be a good place to start . deeplearning . ai by andrew ng is also an option . both use a bit different approach . andrew ng starts from basics . fast . ai goes top to bottomi think .

5. let ' s think nope . nothing good has ever happened .
   (ID: 0def2b70456d7a000d0e2b3611ac80cd2990e21c)

6. thank you . i really appreciate it . at times i really think i ' m alone feeling this way . the books though , that ' s a really good idea .
   (ID: 298dd327349771a27c9a14437b3b5a53d0bd9e35)

7. i ' m glad that they moved away from that . i think the floating words thing is used way too much in tv now . the first two examples that come to mind are sherlock and the good doctor .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

8. you look great . tbh , either way looks good , neither of the lengths are bad . i think the shorter looks better in these pics because it ' s easier to style .

9. i think it ' s a nice app . new vocab is presented in a way that is easy to learn and backed up by flashcards , pictures and matching . this is the same way i learnt greek . the interface of the app honestly feels cluttered and out of place imho . it ' s a bit laggy as well . i think it would be nice if the app could be designed around the materiel design or a similar flat design . overall , it ' s a good app and i look forward to using it .

10. thank you for the reassuring words . you think abstinence is a good idea ? won ' t i orgasm too soon if i keep hard anyways ?
   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

11. talk to your uncle first , and then all of you can talk to your mom and convince her this is a good idea . i think she would take it more seriously if everyone talked together . good luck !
   (ID: e216f2a1e0d7d814b7ad58452ce6ac21e0b763fc)

12. very good point , didn ' t think about that aspect . but the fact that op started with " being in la " makes me think it ' s for social media purposes .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

13. the button may be sticking it could be something underneath that ' s causing it . if you think it could be this , check out some youtube videos on how to take it a part . i had a trigger that kept sticking and once i took it a part and cleaned it , it was as good as new .

14. no i honestly think it ' s a good idea ! how am i so off base on this ? yes power banks exist , yes solar chargers exist but if you dont have any other options in the moment this could be a super convenient thing to be able to go and buy . jesus by all the downvotes and sassy comments i ' m getting your think i ' m advocating the clubbing of baby seals or something
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

15. i think because it is , by definition , virtue signaling . " look at me i ' m being a good person i ' m going to film and post it on the internet for the world to see " . its basically doing the right thing for the wrong reasons .
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)

16. . i mean , i ' m a decent artist i think but that ' s really good for using a phone , especially right off the bat .
   (ID: 215e84ecea95592e4d8f3f8e0619a61b503078c3)

17. this is a really nice post so i think you should let my son have it as he  s been doing really good in school
   (ID: 888fecec3c361bbe3db00f64ff7cf51950d332df)

18. it ' s been pretty good . i think i ' m about to head to bed soon though . how has yours been ?
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

19. i felt the same way in the past . but maybe the fact there is no objective point is a good think ! you can choose to do something or absolutely nothing .
   (ID: cae6d1fb1a818280e66de4a71148560d2d217d70)

20. i think they screwed up with the character daario naharis in game of thrones . maybe not the worst casting decision , as huisman does a good job . but they turned what was supposed to be a blue hair gold toothed barbarian into a pretty boy heart throb . come on hbo .
