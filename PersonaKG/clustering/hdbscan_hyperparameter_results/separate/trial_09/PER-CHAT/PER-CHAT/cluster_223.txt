1. makes sense . just funny how all ' s i did was make an observation which is most likely correct and instead of either acknowledging it , or moving on , they have to be so salty for some reason .

3. in the previous version of the app , if i clicked on a response in my inbox , it took me directly to that responsibility and showed the parent and grandparent comment . it did this regardless of whether or not the comment itself was hidden due to being nested too far . now if the comment is hidden it just takes me to the thread and it only highlights the comment if i open every hidden comment until i find it . edit  after further investigation i have found that i can no longer view the " community information " aka sidebar . this is an issue that needs dealt with because otherwise mobile users will have to rely on pinned posts to see the rules of the sub

4. this is enlightened . complaining is not the same as soliciting advice . so often a child ' s minor complaint about something gets a response telling them what they did wrong , just making the kid feel bad .

5. what compromises did you have to make ? did you have any ideas you really wanted but were just left on the cutting room floor ?

6. i just did a research paper in this . when you accept their terms of service , you agree to let them track other activity on the wifi source . at one point while facebook was active , you probably got a text or call allowing facebook to see your number and it  s activity while on the wifi

7. was the baby worth it ? did the baby change your sex life ? what about the relationship ? is your husband still attracted to you even though you are a mother ? sorry just really really insecure
   (ID: 85ada8069a64aa3ed39736f565e8a9ceed369acd)

8. why did you delete your post ? why are you doing the exact same thing you just called the op out for ?
   (ID: a4eb94a9fe8ebabb780c319cc7d3f552eb79625e)

9. what the hell happened to jeff ' s face ? did he get plastic surgery or is it just extra make up ?

10. me and my friend did this , only problem was his clutch was totally different , i ' m used to hitting the friction point after barely releasing mine . his is almost all the way out . we swapped the light turned green , he stalled out a dozen times . i just dumbly sat there slowly inching the clutch out .
   (ID: aaaecf7e1ff261f2a41ad2f7d0229a3f043cb546)

11. not me but my friend got high off of inhaling a dryer sheets . he did it as a joke cuz he found it in a sleeve . he told us that the entire day was just gone from his memory and the day prior as for some reason he went to another high while we were walking home . he said it ' s pretty terrifying and he would never wish it on another person .

12. nothing to really settle . if all he did was change your password , just change it back or change it to something else . it ' s a small issue that can be fixed in 2mins
   (ID: 9ec4f8c81572a0a43c8d624fb459f565cd019aad)

13. what the hell did i just watch ?
   (ID: f4588f2a476206e602fe5b84647a1e777eaae604)

14. yeah but why tf did you decide to post this on here . i support the lgbtq community but jeez man , chill out and talk about that stuff someone else . it  s just a meme
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

15. well you just did it , how does it feel ?
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

16. i nearly did this to a player , not out of spite but by mistake . two accounts would go around our area , take all of the gyms and golden razz spam anyone who tried to retake them . they ' d just monopolize the area twice a week . asked around , no one knew who they were , so based on the behavior i figured it was a multi  account spoofer with a bot set up to berry feed . nearly reported it , but then i found out from someone at a raid that it was actually just a couple from the next town over who drove around and played super aggressively . would have felt really bad if i ' d reported then although niantic doesn ' t do anything about those reports anyway .

17. saw dogs getting killed for food . it wasn ' t even an ethical kind of kill , they just beat the dogs until they stopped whining . the dogs did even fight back btw , it ' s also on youtube
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

18. well . did i ever mention it had to be something out of sci  fi ? kaijus ? zerg leviathan ? maybe , just maybe , a superhero ?

19. it isn  t . it is just showing the influx of marvel meme formats on this sub the past few days . did you see the above comment ? i chose a dc template because it  s ironic .

20. " why did i just type this incoherent bullshit , and why can ' t i stop myself from posting it "
