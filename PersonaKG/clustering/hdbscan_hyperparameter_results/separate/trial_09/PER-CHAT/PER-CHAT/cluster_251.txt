2. do you think they would still be missing parts of the brain ? it looked like the nodes would cover an inch diameter so there would definitely be blind spots .

5. again . it ' s unlikely you ' ll ever like the way it sounds , because it ' s not what you ' re used to hearing of your voice . but others may like it more than you think .
   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

   (ID: 080eedcfaabe8f67b2c0a8da33a3a401906822f2)

12. i like that . i think the origin of " god bless you " was the belief that when you sneeze some of your soul escapes .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

13. i constantly try and constantly fail to explain the meaning of " arrombado " to non  brazilians . the closest meaning i can think of is " what you would call someone who drives one of those trucks with testicles hanging , changes lanes without signaling , almost hits you and acts like you are the wrong one .
   (ID: 9a13b21f54717da1499379b5cb0e991e82d4c90f)

14. isn ' t that a power move ? for someone to pick a much younger partner ? they can do whatever they like and have full emotional and sexual control . that ' s what i think is happening .
   (ID: f042043ff04e1f2bd28d7c34b7937eb8bf31c76e)

15. it sure looks like it to me . what makes you think he doesn ' t like you , because everything you have put here is very much in the yes category or am i missing something obvious like usual ?
   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

16. true , but to me , i think it seems like a question they should be answering rather than asking . that ' s why i ask several questions about working conditions and technologies used , etc .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

17. hopefully given a break . like , a few lifetimes waived or something . i think about this often .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

18. makes perfect logic when you think about it , but if we sound different to how we actually sound , i wonder what they hear in relation to how it sounds ?
   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

19. i think hot manifests crazy , and i like hot . so by the power of association , i like crazy
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

20. i think i found it ! something called " captain blasto . this article says that one of his lines is " honey i ' m home "  here ' s a gameplay video , though it looks ps1 instead of n64 . but this is definitely your guy , in space with a blaster with the wisecracks very much like the gex game i remembered
