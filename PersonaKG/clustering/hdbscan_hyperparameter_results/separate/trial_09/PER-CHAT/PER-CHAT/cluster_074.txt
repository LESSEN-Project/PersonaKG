1. i have been exploring him a lot looking for things i may have missed and seeing what i can do with him , but he still feels like trash . unless someone finds some move or tech that i ' m not using or don ' t know or something , i think he will just be garbage again .

2. it just makes you a shit person . like they would care about that , they ' re cartel members . i think everyone would wish for a quick and painless execution if they somehow got caught , and they probably know that too . by making it the complete opposite it really sends out a clear message , don ' t mess with these guys or you ' ll found yourself tied up in a basement , your body full of drugs to keep you alive longer so you can suffer more , now that ' s enough deterrent .

3. i don ' t know man . it ' s either they do mistake considering namco like to do mistake for example release dark souls dlc before release date or its 2b assets . it could be a bug fix but i don ' t think bug can take up that much space . i think maybe the unreleased edge master stuff ? or new feature . we can just hope we discover something when the download finish .

4. i think i would feel weird fucking anyone else if i had someone i loved and cherished . either we are just simply wired differently , or you are lying to yourself about one or the other . you might not love and cherish this soul mate as much as you think  or you might not know what to do with some strange if you got it ! like the dog chasing the car ! i don ' t mean to be offensive at all . i hope it all works out for you both . just remember she ' s almost to those " dirty thirties "

5. hmmm . i ' m going to have to add this article to my bookmarks for the same thing . thanks for the article , it ' s amazing to think about what you ' re missing because you just don ' t know about it !

6. you know you don  t have to follow a guide right ? one thing about majority of the players playing this game is that they don  t bother to adapt , they just mindlessly play and when something kills them , they think it  s bullshit or the build is trash .

7. hi there ! do you give out your friend code for your wii u i ' m assuming you have one ? if not what ' s your nnid so i can follow you on miiverse ? apparently you have a youtube channel but i ' m sure i can find that just by googling also what do you think about the tower of smash leak ? do you think it ' s plausible ? lastly sorry lol me and a friend are looking to get into the competitive scene but don ' t know where to start , any suggestions , like where to find tournaments and stuff ? thanks

8. i do know a person who broke off a needle in their arm and just left it . years later i guess some sort of a pimple or sore developed in that area and he squeezed on it and the needle came oozing out . i don  t think you should risk it though and should see a doc .

9. i know the dog one got digit  upvotes but i don  t think you copying it with cat will have the same result . just saying

10. i think it would be awesome to have something set in capone era chicago , but i don ' t know how much you could actually do with it . just seems like a cool concept .

11. come for the odd1sout memes , stay for the furry memes . i don ' t think he ' s salty either , he ' s just being honest . modesty should be appreciated , not expected . ya ' ll acting like you wouldn ' t do the same in his shoes , yet calling him salty and egotistical . the whole post nuking thing is probably more of a strategic decision than anything else . if he ' s still around here , let him be and don ' t call him out . that way you get the best of two worlds  you know he ' s a furry and no odd1sout low quality memes . and james , if you read this , no one wants you to leave , but please , stop gilding stuff , it ' s not a reward , it ' s encouragament . you ' re already a " popufur " , furries will go to the moon and back to kiss your butt , gilding them just amplifies that .

12. learn how to joke and also learn that you are not the uk fanbase universe . plenty of friends down the road from me right now and we had a few that were all out of sorts with how the game went last night . i obviously don ' t think the season is over , was just playing up the fact that some of the fans i know were flipping out unnecessarily .
