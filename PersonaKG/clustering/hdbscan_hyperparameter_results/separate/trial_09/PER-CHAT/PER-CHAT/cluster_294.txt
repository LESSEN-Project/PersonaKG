1. it isn ' t animal cruelty to leave a dog home for that long . while i ' m at school , my dog is left home for around digit to digit hours , and most of the time she sleeps , plays with her toys , or just stares out the window . as long as they ' re well potty  trained it won ' t be painful or hard to hold it together for that amount of time . when my dog was a puppy we had someone to come at noon and let her out , but now she doesn ' t need that anymore .

4. this one time me and two of my friends were all hanging out on a weekend off school . we went down to the basement of the place i was staying at , a little before noon to play horde mode on gears of war digit which had just come out a little while later we decided to come back up and see about ordering a pizza or something for dinner somehow it was digit  digit in the morning and we  d just completely lost track of time  there were no windows in the basement and no clocks , so when we were expecting to come up in time to see the sun getting low , we got hit with the really bright morning sun . all three of us just kinda went  oh damn it  s late  and wandered home

6. by no means an expert just from my experience lvl digit at this time . digit  from my experience incense only works for you my wife has the game too , beside me on the couch will not see the same pokes or any i see when i have incense activated . incense seems to attract pokemon that are " native " to the area , but not necessarily the pokemon on your nearby list . i use incense when i ' m sitting at home being lazy because when i ' m walking around they pop up regularly but hardly at all when stationary . incense seems to create pokemon rather than attract nearby ones . thats all i got , hopefully someone else can help with your other questions .

7. i agree with this digit  . when i put my blinker on to get over , more than half the time , the person i ' m trying to get over in front of speeds up to stop me from getting over . so i just quit using them .

8. wow ! that ' s a lot lol thank you . i own a aspire breeze and it says on the packaging that i should not go over 70vg or 6mg . so after reading this i could go past digit but it would just take more time to wick ?

9. this woman must have talked to my wife . she started out with a dildo just slightly larger than my cock . over the years , she ' s purchased progressively larger and larger dildos to fuck me with . she recently purchased an american bombshell with balls . it ' s about digit inches long and almost digit inches across at the widest point . the first time i saw it , i protested quite a bit . she smirked and said , " just the tip sweetie . " that was a couple months ago . last weekend she went balls deep with it .
