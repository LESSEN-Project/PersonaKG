2. if i have to go someplace new for some sort of obligation , i don ' t mind a long  ish drive . it gives me time to get mentally ready .
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

5. that may be the case i don ' t really notice a difference in ttk but i ' ll look for it next time i play but having at least one teammate means much less fire coming out you compared to playing solounless you are purposely playing a high  threat tank role which is why it is easier .
   (ID: a9e8779a80280c00c5063e221eaeba0431068276)

6. apprenticeships ! you can work and get a degree at the same time . you do it with a company , you get a reduced salary , but it means you don ' t have to pay anything , and you get experience in the workplace . you do come out of it with a degree in whatever field your apprenticeship was in
   (ID: c1af2a10f968ba6f52d825dbf8fc9b8210db72ba)

7. teach them that there is no end to your problems  it is a race with no finish line so take your time and don ' t rush through life only to regret it . i wish i learned that sooner
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

8. on desktop all right let me rotate my screen to see the biggest conspiracy of all time that doesn ' t give anything to anyone and costs billions of dollars but fits my absolutely crazy worldview in which government is incompetent enough to leave major flaws in their models which don ' t exist if you look closely but i looked from far enough to see them !
   (ID: e6e1db90a47dca83004beacbcc9004bec464c7d0)

9. you  ll go through about an hour or so of practicing the moves on the ground with the guys who will be strapped on to you , they never once talked about what to do if you wanted to back out , so the thought was never in your mind . when you get up in the plane , they  ll talk you through it while you reach altitude . when you reach altitude , you don  t have much time before they pretty much throw you out of the airplane . it was fun , i was excited to do it so i was never scared of it .

10. the reason the different categories exist is because some pets they don ' t have the time or interest in making the necessary animations for them to overrides , every pet that they don ' t make the animations for become followers instead . i do wish they ' d stop releasing new pets as followers because they ' re universally ignored if they can ' t be used for overrides , but hey they ' re a lot cheaper to produce and pad out the content so jagex likes them .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

11. . so ? i don ' t recycle . why should i conserve the planet for a bunch of assholes making billions exploiting it ? just give them more time to do what they please ? what ' s my " contribution " gonna do , compared to an oil spill ? what ' s my carbon footprint compared to a multinational ' s empire ? fiat iustitia , et pereat mundus .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

12. i don  t mind telling the lazy ones to go out but those that don  t give me time out of their life when i do are the ones that kinda piss me off , like just tell me you  re not interested so i don  t waste my time thinking about you .
   (ID: fe4ddb52a6f20437e3f3c6003b775cb72c3d048f)

13. this is the only time i don ' t feel bad for guilt tripping somone
   (ID: 1955f382f8fc2d10480017d73817b8c3b41c2a02)

14. but can the picture just be from the best time screen ? and taken crappily because i don ' t have a capture board for my 3ds ? also , i ' m lazy and only really speedrun the time attack modes so the game will be the stopwatch .
   (ID: e53542ff680164cdf45964372fb47cf6a7d48484)

15. i used to worry about this , in hospital , with doctors and stuff . you wonder if you will get a tingly wingly but it ' s really not an erotic thing when it actually comes time to lift your gown . truth is doctors don ' t have a fuck to give . there is probably a person in the next room with his dick chopped off . whether you get aroused or not doesn ' t make an ounce of difference to them . don ' t overthink it .
   (ID: 06080b0d1273cc2321b21dde5865b5c1c5180e56)

16. i only experience a split stream if i don ' t pee immediately after ejaculating . i usually get an urge to pee within five minutes after sex or masturbating . i hold it for a while before going , it will do the same thing that you described . i started sitting down to pee while at home around six months ago and a lot of my problems have been resolved . i ' ve found that in the sitting position , urine is able to exit the urethra better and i don ' t need to shake or pump out any remaining liquid when i ' m done . i still use a public urinal when it ' s available , except when i ' m at work because it takes more time and my boss qualifies for a stupid loophole in the state break law .
   (ID: 24d2489761902de9148fe06d43ec8d7e34c8e35b)

17. try to waste their time as much as possible by pretending you don ' t understand what they are talking  asking about
   (ID: f4f004d4cf95fb0021d8bdc10767d5f3e74d3bc9)

18. salary . just get the job done and don ' t worry too much about what time you arrive in the morning .
   (ID: be9f60605270d73ac3a4e5b587575b1f65df15f5)

19. " life is like a box of chocolate "  forrest gump " english mother     , do you speak it "  pulp fiction " listen , i ' m a politician , which means i ' m a cheat and a liar , and when i ' m not kissing babies , i ' m stealing their lollipops , but it also means that i keep my options open "  the hunt for the red october " well , that could be useful when the time comes "  the hunt for the red october , also there are a lot of iconic quotes , you don ' t need to dig to deep to find ' em .
   (ID: ad95cb68c3ea444630fedc23f3d4596fafc60464)

20. yeah it ' s annoying but over time it does get better . it will always be there but you get used to it . i don ' t worry about it much nowadays . if i ever get a flare up or more pain than usual i do the exercises over a week or two and it settles down again .
