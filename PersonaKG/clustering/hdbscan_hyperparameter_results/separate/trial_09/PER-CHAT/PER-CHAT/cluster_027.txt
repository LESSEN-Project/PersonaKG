2. i feel like it wouldn  t be so good honestly . i know i shouldn  t judge a book by its cover but the movie  s plot seems too bizarre to me .

3. you know what , i kinda like this . if you can clean this up a bit , this style could be good .

4. thank you ! this is the comment i was looking for . i didn ' t know goggles had a dvr feature . i own a 3d printer so i was just going to fab up a mount . but , at any rate , the foxeer seems like the way to go . i ' ll ditch the pdb , and get a better vtx and transmitter . investing in some good goggles makes sense to me since they will likely outlast the drone . looks like i have some more research to do .

8. not very good , i only know what a pc has to look like on the inside not idk what i would do for the outside , maybe like a glass box with led lights ?

9. it  s sort of a human pheromone . certain smells attract us like how we know something tastes good before we eat it based on how it smells .

10. that can ' t be healthy . yeah my friends are literally the reason i even know of furries because their the ones that told me about them in the first place . now of course it wasn ' t good stuff but i gradually started to like them from my one sided mind .
