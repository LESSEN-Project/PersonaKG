1. this sounds like you  ve had quite your share of shitty experiences in this particular category , sorry man . i don  t know what to say other than people can really suck and human nature is shitty . i feel like stims have the potential to bring out the worst in people for sure .

2. i can safely say that that has never happened to me , although it sounds like an extremely dickish thing to do . i would put this to people who don ' t know anything about you judging you having seen you for about a minute therefore they are meaningless .

3. no problem at all . as i said and as other people have said , you ' re probably going to find a lot of common qualities among most atheists , and can probably make a bunch of ' most atheists are . ' ' . skeptics . ' is a good one that ' s mentioned further down statements that we wouldn ' t argue much against . one thing i am , and i believe that many fellow atheists also are , is humanist . i don ' t know what else you ' d like to talk about . personally , i ' ve never been religious and had very little exposure to christianity or any other religion as a child , so i ' m still learning what parts of my world view would be interesting  novel  different from your own views or from those of religious people . what would you like to know ?

4. one of the biggest errors our little human brains make is assuming people we know are the same from day to day . many people do not understand the episodic nature of depression . i strongly encourage you to mention to a friend of parent something like " this may be out of left field , but between you and me , i ' ve been feeling kind of blue lately . i know i don ' t show it , but i guess i could use a little extra support at the moment " say it in a way that feels like your voice . saying it out loud is scary , but surprisingly therapeutic in and of itself .

5. well , this depends on the person . as for me , i consider any superstitions as something weird coming from the past , so i don ' t believe in them . also there are some superstitions noone believes in , which are still being used sometimes like spitting over the left shoulder to prevent happening a bad thing that was mentioned some people say " spit ! " after someone said about something bad that could happen , although they know this doesn ' t work
