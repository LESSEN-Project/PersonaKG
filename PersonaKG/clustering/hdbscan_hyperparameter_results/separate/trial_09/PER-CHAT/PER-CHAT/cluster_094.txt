1. you know you ' re not a bad or dumb person for not getting every cultural or artistic reference in everything you read . hell , the simpsons and family guy are full of references to art , pop culture , literature and more . many people miss some of the references but still enjoy the surface story . having said that , i do like to look  stuff  up when i come across something that seems to be fact based in a piece of fiction . i read a lot on an ipad and highlight something , and use the web  search feature . it takes a little longer but hey , it ' s not a race . take it easy .

2. i just say hey to people i know , try to make conversations of needed , this avoids awkward attention , because i just look like a normal human , talking and laughing , but little dot hey know

3. this is crazy to me . being in the military , i never encountered people like this . it ' s really hard to believe they are out there . but i know they do exist .

4. except no , you do have responsibility . you know that word is offensive which , i would hazard to guess , is why you like it , and further you know what it means to call someone that . it ' s a legitimately offensive thing to call someone , and just because people have called you a faggot and you didn ' t care doesn ' t mean that other people can ' t be legitimately pissed off by being called that , or by that word being used . the idea that you can use a word like that and have no responsibility for how people react is like saying you can swing a baseball bat at someone ' s head and have no responsibility for them being pissed . it just doesn ' t make any damn sense . if you were as emotionally mature as you say you are , you ' d take some responsibility for your own actions instead of projecting that onto someone else . own your shit instead of forcing other people to pick it up .

5. and the only reason we do is because of our absentee mods . you know that the fact that i can post here makes people froth at the mouth and i would be banned almost immediately like i am from most other canadian subs .

6. dude yta she ' s digging for coupons it would be different if she was getting tash food or like clothes . it ' s fucking paper coupons . you guys are having issues affording food so you gotta do what you gotta do . sell clothes , some people sell sex , some parents forgo food to feed their kids , some people commit crimes . and you have the audacity to be mad at your wife for digging for coupons . like are you shitposting ? if it feeds your family and it doesn ' t cause any harm it ' s doesn ' t matter . put your " pride " aside . and if it really bothers you sell your clothes get an extra job start giving up food you know ? things that all suck more than digging through trash .

7. my mom ' s exactly the same way , it ' s like she ' s in a cult . and she ' s not even a fan of trump , she just is against abortion and hillary clinton . today she said " well if they aren ' t vetting people and that happens he has a point . there should be middle ground happening here " i told her they are vetting people . in the past she ' s said that " obama likes muslims too much " and i ' m like " where the heck are you even getting that " i told her there ' s absolutely no policy that i know of that showed obama liked muslims a lot . she ' s a very intelligent person , kind hearted and not racist towards anyone and to hear her make a statement that the previous potus liked muslims too much without any kind of facts to back it up really disturbed me .

8. like i said i never went on vacation by myself , so i dont know if x country is cheaper than y . so if the kind people of reddit can point me in right direction , that would be great

9. honestly not that bad , you know people like you for being you so that  s a plus .
   (ID: 2657c8854c93e48c0bab9764c7904833e823cac9)

10. shit that doesn ' t apply to me . like i know that there are other people in the world that the question applies to , but why the fuck are you asking a question to tow truckers only !

11. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them
