1. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .

2. i would actually like to play this scenario . but , the thing is , everyone would just camp their wool the whole game and there wouldn ' t be too much pvp . also , i think popular people ' s wool would get target too much . but overall , great scenario !

3. other family members watched all of it , so i ' d be in the room through most of it . i think early on i just decided it wasn ' t for me . i get why people like it but it was marmite to me .

4. i think what he does takes a lot of work , but it seems that he ' s very happy to take something he read and just run with it because it sounds disturbing or creepy or weird , regardless of whether it ' s true or not . he ' s sacrificing integrity for shock value , which kind of sucks , but i guess it demonstrates the priority is getting views , rather than being informative on less mainstream topics and encouraging people to think critically about the world around them , as i had optimistically hoped the series ? might be . it seemed like he was going to do something groundbreaking but once you realise he ' s just reciting pseudo  facts he found online it just gets kind of flat .

5. i just think that people who get mad at trees and reindeer on government buildings are just getting mad at a part of christmas that pretty much the entire country celebrates , and isn ' t even remotely christian . gotcha . as a us citizen i pretty sure you ' re aware of our world champion status at getting butthurt . nothing official or otherwise will keep grumblers from grumbling . officially removing its religious status whatever that looks like would just provoke an even bigger response as i see it .  yeah , i ' m not trying to . i ' m starting to think i should have made my frame a little more concise as to what i meant by christmas being ' not christian ' . ya , this is the reason i think people are kind of lighting this idea up . it ' s what made me think the reasoning had an emotional basis   as stated it ' s a bit off  balanced .
