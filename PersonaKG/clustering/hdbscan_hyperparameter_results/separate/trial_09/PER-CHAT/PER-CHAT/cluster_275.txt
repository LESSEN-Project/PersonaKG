2. getting paid  digit million a year to do whatever i feel like all the time . it ' s not my current job , because no one will pay someone to do that . i ' m not going to do anything to get that dream job , because it ' s impossible . reality kept me from it .

3. an injury  free and professional neymar is priceless , but this isn ' t the version that barca are getting at the moment , and barto should realize this . what guarantee is there that ney won ' t start sulking if he gets benched by griezmann or dembele and start publically courting real madrid or city ?   x200b  plus , barca , like psg , need neymar to be fit for the cl , and if he gets injured  suspended once again around the time of this sister ' s birthday , he would probably be worthless for barca . he sucker punched barca digit years back , prolonged his stay to collect a bonus , and hardly left barca any time to get a replacement . barca have already bought griezzmann and de jong . so how much can they spend in subsequent windows if they splurge money on neymar next season ? players like busquets , rakitic , pique and vidal may need to be replaced soon .

4. yea but i do kinda understand why they havent done it yet since they have alrady kinda made a schedual for digit and they will have to fit it somewhere so it may slow down the development of other stuff like the new war since even tho its not that hard of a thing to do it still takes time to do it .

7. we are finding it fun and manageable as we enter month digit with our digit month lab . he  s definitely not an adult yet and there is training that needs doing regarding occasional rude behavior and overstimulation , but he  s very nice to the cat and has a great temperament . for a first time owner having a baby at the same time as a puppy or young dog might be crazy . a new dog is kind of like a baby , you  re always trying to figure out what it wants and how to get it to go to sleep ! perhaps i  m speaking too soon but as long as we have a dog walker and have like . digit hours outside of work to train  exercise  bond with him , he seems very happy and sleeps all night . we ski on weekends and feel bad about the alone time , so usually try to spend one day doing a lot of dog  centric active stuff with him .
