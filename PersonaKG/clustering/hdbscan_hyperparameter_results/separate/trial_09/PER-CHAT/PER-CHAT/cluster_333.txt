1. my opinion on the subject tends to piss people off to begin with  i hate it that any single group has been indoctrinated by judeo  christian hegemony and then adopts it as if it  s their own bias . african , afro  caribbean , and african americans are the unfortunate prime example , but it also extends to native and aboriginal peoples across the world . the british , spanish , dutch and french came in , installed  buggery  and  sodomy  laws which criminalized homosexuality . the european dominion of the overseas territories brought with it puritanical religion which became deeply entrenched and persisted  in most cases still persists to this day . i wouldn  t blame these communities for a second , most of them had third genders and  or never had a prohibition on homosexuality until white people told them to . and the rest is history .

2. my point is that theres a legal limit on how drunk you can be and drive , if you are below that limit you can drive . for most people , having two drinks puts them below that limit .

6. league schedules and tradition of being a " summer festival " are trivial issues compared to real world problems . i ' m not saying qatar will be a disaster , i ' m saying the construction projects are shady . thousands of people have died , worker conditions are horrible , safety standards are poor . people are sacrificing their lives and enduring brutal labor to build the stadiums . they should host the world cup somewhere thay either has stadiums already , or at least has ethical labor laws .
