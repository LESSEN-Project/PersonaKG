4. digit months ago heck , even digit months ago is a long time to remember content from test . i absolutely think it ' s representative . the odds of you remembering more than digit random question are very slim . when i retook the tests , i think i remembered digit question total not per exam . i just retook fl digit the last time i took it was in late march  1st week of april , and i seriously didn ' t remember anything from the test . 3rd party exams tend to be deflated , so i wouldn ' t worry about those too much . if anything , they ' ll help you hone in on areas you need work on . you ' re doing great !
