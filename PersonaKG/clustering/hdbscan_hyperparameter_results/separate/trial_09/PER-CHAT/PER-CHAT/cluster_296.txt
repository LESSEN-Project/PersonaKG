17. i ' m responding to this   if you told one lie in your life is it fair to describe you as a liar ? i ' m saying , not your whole life . but if you ' ve told a lie in the past week , i would describe you as a liar . there ' s a period of time somewhere between a week and a lifetime that it should be forgiven .
