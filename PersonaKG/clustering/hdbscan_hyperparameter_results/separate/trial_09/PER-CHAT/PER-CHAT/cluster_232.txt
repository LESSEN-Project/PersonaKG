1. sorry my dude the situation here is just not what it was . at first i thought i was gonna get to break the geneva convention for christmas but the state is doing a good job to calm everyone down sadly enough

2. reposts . many of us would miss out on some good content if not for reposting . i understand the bitching when someone claims it as their own , but otherwise just shut the fuck up about it already . and those ' karma decay ' tables are really fucking obnoxious , imo .

3. thanks ! and yes i was talking about the night vision . since now i  m assuming the night vision won  t give any real details in the character all you need to do is just a fix up and you are good to go . but i  m just a casual gamer who is giving a really , uninformed opinion . again good luck to you !

5. embrace it . nothing good will ever happen if you bottle it up and keep denying yourself . you ' ll just end up hurting yourself .

7. not sure what you meant by that ? i was just letting you dig your hole of assumptions until you finally called me a carnivore . felt good to throw that one back in your face .

8. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !

9. just sit with good posture ! i have some friends who game with their feet up on the desk . one of them already has back issues and he still does it !
   (ID: 5d6cecafd26473d96b39b973965364f09d4d41f1)

10. i wish you could meet my cat , buuuut . learn more about them and what their body language means . understanding them helps a lot . and just keep an open mind over all , good luck !

11. good luck . if you get a craving , just do something different . for instance , if i get one in the car , i ' ll change the channel and listen to something else that distracts me . on chantix , the cravings pass pretty quickly , if you have any at all .

12. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .

13. good explanation , thanks . i agree . manhood can  t be measured , as that plays into the concept toxic masculinity . then the belief of manhood being measured should instead be just considered how macho someone is ? not in a negative sense for example , if you see a strong , burly man with a beard and place him next to george constanza , considered the former with higher manhood is wrong , but instead maybe more macho  stereotypically masculine characteristics ?

14. quick question instead of posting a new thread  for you toy collectors , is there a particular set  line of sw toys that is sought after or preferred ? or do you guys just collect figures that looks good
   (ID: b4fb8e20516a28baa38075931e9715db2375a956)

15. good luck my friend , you got this ! just remember , others are comparing themselves to you as well , everyone does it .

16. if you send me pc vods i can still analyze them and give you coaching tips or just discuss strategy via discord , but i cant join games on pc . good luck finding a coach though !

17. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

18. it ' s just so good .
   (ID: 52f4e645771d12babe63c93a43451316a5fb0980)

19. you can ' t just ignore the good that ' s happening .

20. i should of known that the prices for these pokemon ones were too good to be true . they are quite hard to get hold of here in the uk , so fraudsters have filled the gap in the market by flogging these fake ones . ebay will be on your side to and help you and get you a refund if you receive a fake , it is just a lot of hassle that is probably best avoided !
