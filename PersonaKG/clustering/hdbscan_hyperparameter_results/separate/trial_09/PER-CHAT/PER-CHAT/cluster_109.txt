2. this is how players get hurt . having to think to much and letting up , not doing what you would naturally do . this is more of a problem than the refs . they should just play digit  hand touch and qbs should wear red jerseys the whole year if this is how it  s gonna be . i understand the league trying to protect the qb , but this is just absolutely ridiculous now .

6. interesting to see the mix of opinion on the 30k london salary . for what it  s worth , i think this seems bang on what i would expect . for those saying it  s very high  my first job was in a london call center and it paid 18k back in digit . i was an unskilled uni dropout with a poor work ethic . you can get to 30k by default just by adding a some skills and experience . for those saying it  s very low  this job is looking for someone with digit year  s experience . so the target candidate is going to be in their early twenties and most likely has no family or other responsibilities . they  ll manage on 30k just fine .

8. i ' d do it . aside from milf rebel team , chimaera is still the best capital ship . i think you could get to top digit just by using these digit crystals so there is a chance that it will even pay you back .

9. i think the overarching theme i ' m hearing from you and others is to value myself . i think that ' s my digit theme , because it keeps coming up . that must be telling me something about myself that i clearly am just starting to realize . thank you for sharing your journey !
