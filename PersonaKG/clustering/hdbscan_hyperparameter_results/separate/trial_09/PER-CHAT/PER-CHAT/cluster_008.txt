2. ok , honestly same i ' m one year ahead of you , but in the uk , we can ' t just pick up a class . i figured out i wanted to do theatre when i was digit . i hadn ' t studied it for two years , and i couldn ' t pick it up . so i ' m doing whatever i can outside of school . but now i ' ve been hit with the issue of " how the hell do i pay attention to anything in school " you ' ve gotta look at the bigger picture . universities want to see that you ' re a rounded person if you choose to do that , so you ' ve gotta have something else to show for yourself . most importantly , what your dad said about some actors not making it ? no , most actors don ' t make it . it ' s ridiculously competitive , and you ' ll have to work multiple jobs just to keep on top of rent and stuff . or , you can work hard in school , get a solid fall back chemistry for me and then know that you can work a good job alongside auditions . then you can spend longer auditioning and stand a better chance of actually making a living on acting . if that doesn ' t help , then find something in the other classes that interests you . sure , maybe chemistry isn ' t your thing , but that one topic on equilibrium you love . or you hate shakespeare , but you find the casket problem in the merchant of venice fascinating . great ! find little things that excite you and cling to them for dear life . finally , if none of that works , just buckle down and get it done . accept that you will fuck up your life if you don ' t finish highschool so you just have to . talk to your teachers , reward yourself for revision , don ' t be too hard on yourself , but just get it done . it sucks but you don ' t have a choice . feel free to send me a dm , you ' re a theatre kid my age  we ' d probably get along lmao

3. the thieves guild found when me when i was a young child on the streets of taichan , the wide slums adjacent to the walled capital city samhai . at some point in those first few years they found that i didn ' t trip magical alarms and that made me much more valuable to them . i became a burglar as a child while the other children were pickpockets , ascending quickly to a middle ranking position by the time i was thirteen years old . however then things became a little strange . magic is typically an endeavor of the wealthy . magic books are expensive and complicated magic is usually learned in the academy in samhai . but nearly everyone of a certain age learns some piece of magic . there is an internal force that takes time to develop and usually begins to express itself with puberty . in strong magicians it finds ways to come out , like sparks from their fingertips or burping fire . if those magicians are found in taichan they are whisked off to samhai to be adopted by powerful families and trained in magic . even the thieves guild will make deals and surrender their talented magicians . this is why i began magic lessons at thirteen . most other burglars used magic constantly to evade magical defenses . i had never needed it , and just focused on quietly slipping through the house and identifying valuables . a part of me didn ' t believe my job was dangerous until i saw a veteran burglar ripped apart by magical wolves in a house in samhai . i wanted as much protection as possible after that and sought magic instruction immediately . the problem was , i couldn ' t do magic . everyone laughed when they heard and joked that it was good i was a talented thief because i wouldn ' t get anywhere in high society . over time however , and through my own small experiments , i learned that not only was i incapable of preforming magic , i seemed immune to it . i put my finger into a magical flame , had the best con artist in the guild try an illusion on me , didn ' t even feel the attacks from our best combat magician . at this point everyone was amazed and sort of unsure of how to treat me . even our leader was perplexed . " see , i ' m sure the academy wants you , but for what ? i ' m just as sure you wouldn ' t want to be their lab rat . " oren said . he and i were alone in his office , part of the tunnel network underneath taichan . " they would pay me for you , but you make that much every digit months . i would be a fool to give you up . in fact , i think this means we can go bigger . " " what do you mean , bigger ? " the image of ghostly wolves ripping into theo ran through my head . " i mean what ' s the one target we have never hit before ? " oren said . " there are two , " i frown , " the academy and the king . either one would be a terrible idea . " " i meant the academy . the king ' s guard has swords and spears , i ' m pretty sure you aren ' t immune to those . " " but you don ' t know if there ' s magic in the academy we ' ve never seen before . i don ' t really want to push my luck . besides , what ' s to stop them from destroying all of taichan and our tunnels if they wanted to ? " " only one thing . the thing you ' d be going there to steal . ruan ' s stone . " great prompt ! i might write a part digit if there ' s interest .

4. " sir . " i try to interject but the old bearded man keeps shouting . " i can ' t find a damn thing in this place ! " his face has turned a boiling red , in contrast with his milky white eyes . steam shoots from his ears . " sir ! you ' re looking in the wrong cupboard ! " i shout , " sit down ! let me help you ! " " speak up , boy , i can barely hear you . " he grumbles , " sit down ? oh fine . " i pull up a chair and he settles down into it . " teacup ! " he shouts , and i hurry to retrieve one . i place it in his left hand and he points his right finger at it . a stream of boiling water pours from the tip of his finger like the spout of a teapot . i hand him a tea bag . " so what were you looking for , sir ? " " ahh . just an old book . what ' s the point anyway ? i can ' t even read the thing . can you read ancient greek ? " i admit that i can ' t and avoid mentioning that we are in the kitchen , not the library . i also don ' t know my way around very well , so i ' m a bit relieved . the building we are in is not a conventional home . it is a grand , curling spire dozens of stories high . this would be a problem for the old man if he were not able to float , up or down , straight through the center of the spiral staircase , easily arriving at a floor usually the wrong one much faster than i can climb the steps . " why did you need the book , sir ? " i ask , " what are we doing today ? " " ah the village by the river has a bridge troll they need taken care of . the messengers are on their way here now . " i know better than to ask how he knows this . he continues , " i remember the spell anyway . no one else can be bothered to learn the stupid things . " or no one has the ability . the old man , while grumpy and difficult , is also the greatest wizard alive . he is known as the wizard with no name although he hates the title , assuring me he does have a name . he also says his name is probably unpronounceable for me and might make my heart stop beating . i have been his assistant for digit weeks , in exchange only for room and board . i am an orphan and this is the only apprenticeship i can find , although i know i have been treated much better in town since becoming associated with the wizard . just then , i hear the loud knocker at the front door bang through the tower . " well ? " the old wizard says , " get a move on . " i hustle down the hundreds of steps , watch the wizard float down past me , and arrive at the door as he waves his hand and it slowly opens . two horsemen stand outside with four horses , wearing the light armor of provincial soldiers . the messengers jump a bit then take a step forward . " great wizard ! " one begins , " we have traveled fifty miles to retrieve you ! our town is under attack . " " bridge troll ! " the wizard loudly interrupts . " it ' s just a damn bridge troll and you fools can ' t simply kill the thing . but fine , i ' ll deal with your troll in exchange for a small yearly tithe . " the messengers cringe , knowing how poor their town is , but the wizard doesn ' t see the reaction and they agree on a portion of the harvest for the payment . the wizard smiles , " good ! now that payment is settled , where are your horses ? i know i ' ve been smelling some . " i lead the wizard to a horse and he floats onto it while the soldiers gape . i mount one beside him . " take your time getting back , " he says to them , " it should all be cleared up by then . " we trot off but all movement by the horse seems uncomfortable to the wizard . strangely he nudges his horse to go faster and faster and i urge mine to match him . as we ride the horses seem to bounce less and less . one lets out a loud whinny and i look down to see that their hooves are floating above the surface of the ground . the horses seem to know where they ' re going because at this point the wizard is feeling around in his beard for fuzz or food . we arrive in the town in two hours , much faster than the eight hours the fifty miles would normally take . as soon as we near the perimeter i hear the sound of fire and screams . we slow our horses and trot forward until the troll comes into view . it is a monstrous beast , taller than rooftops , grabbing women and children where it can while the men fight to hold it back and secure the town ' s population in the large central church . " how big is it ? " the wizard asks . " about digit feet tall ? " i guess . he chuckles , " they ' ve been procrastinating , huh ? alright bring me to it ? " " bring you . to it ? " i ask hesitantly . " don ' t make me repeat myself boy . how else am i supposed to handle it ? " i shudder then grab his horse ' s lead . i walk our horses through the town . the soldiers shout at us to get back as we pass their perimeter and we ignore them . eighty yards away the troll notices us . " he saw us , " i say , " straight ahead . " " good , " the wizard smiles . he cracks his long fingers . suddenly , a flurry of words burst out of his mouth . in it , i hear what seem to be thousands of unique sounds adding up to dozens of languages . i hear a goat ' s bleat , snake ' s hiss and baby ' s laugh . i hear words that sound as powerful as crashing waves and silences as deep as the moment before dawn . my vision shrinks into a black tunnel until suddenly the words stop . i see the bridge troll frozen in place . it slowly falls with a huge crash like a massive tree . " good , " the old wizard grins , " now show me to the food . i ' m hungry . "

5. life digit is the only one i know by name . it tells you where someone is and you can even get notified if they arrive in certain places . i  ve seen stuff about the other ones as several different apps . don  t really wanna look into it bc it makes me feel icky . my parents use the tracker app mentioned . idek why tho as i have no social life but knowing they  re more helicopter parent  y than i thought doesn  t really let me sleep better at night . they also claimed at one point to have one that lets them see my texts but nothings come of it . the one thing that ppl use as an excuse for this shit is that it would be good for monitoring kids and just . no . use parental controls . these things  ll just turn your kid into a paranoid , anxious mess .
