5. i  m not sure what the limit is , but there is some value of goods that you  re allowed to bring in as personal luggage that is allowable as tax free . if you  re worried you can voluntarily declare it and see what they say , but probably smarter to check the regulations online first . if you  re below the allowed value then don  t bother declaring since it isn  t required , but keep the receipt and maybe a printed copy of the regulations in case you get stopped .

6. don ' t say that . the fact that you are afraid to lose your creativity is well enough a reason to continue this fight . you have to keep at it because you deserve to be happy and have every right to enjoy life . waking up every day is you winning this fight . seeking help is winning this fight . dont be afraid to quit something or start something , be it medication or not . if something doesn ' t suit you or brings you to a negative state of mind , change it , talk to someone about it , or eliminate it completely . keep up the fight .
