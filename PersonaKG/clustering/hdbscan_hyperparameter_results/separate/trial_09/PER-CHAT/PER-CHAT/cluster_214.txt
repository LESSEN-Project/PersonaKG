1. i understand intersex . i get transgender . you wanna be the opposite of what you are . you identify with being the other sex . i ' m talking about people who claim they are neither . no , you were born with a vagina or a dick . you can ' t be neither just because you fucking feel like it .
   (ID: 8285a776fd60b145ed2afc145cdf2b926b93ed8b)

2. i totally agree with you . but there comes a point where people like me who like trump or just getting so f   pissed off that we ' re going to do anything and everything we can to get him re  elected no matter what .

3. yeah that ' s fair enough , although players like t . brady and sydney crosby actually do do that , it ' s just more difficult for then to build super teams around them . lebron has only been able to carry a shit tier roster to the finals twice in his career , and in this year ' s case a lot has to do with the weak competition in the east . also the commercials , stoppages , and fouls are actually the biggest issue with the nba . the o my reason it seems like the " main theme " is because it ' s them only thing people are responding to . they have no answer for the terrible stoppages , fouls , and commercial breaks .

4. he could be , and i can see where you are coming from . or he could just be a lonely old man who wants to be friendly and you ' re the only one who ' s actually engaged him in conversation when he ' s tried . maybe he sits alone in front of the tv by himself every night , hoping his kids will call and they never do . eats lunch alone because he doesn ' t get along with the other professors , etc . maybe you ' re like the one person who has been actually friendly and not just professional with him and he looks forward to it each day , which leads him to go a little overboard . like a stay at home parent who talks nonstop the minute another adult is around not being there to see his interactions with other people , it ' s hard to tell . i like to give people the benefit of the doubt .
   (ID: c673eb9fda8629b3a86935092a2668010b581ab1)

5. i like seeing other people progress , and its inspiring to some people . no hate towards you op , but please realise that not everyone thinks like you and just because you dont like it , doesnt mean everyone doesnt like it . thinking like this is how you get toxic people who shame anyone different not accusing you of this tho

6. the guy is just bad at grammar and making coherent sentences , yet some people still believe that he will actually go and admit things like that to public .
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

7. is it just like practice ? i mean i feel like i shoot for the head and it just doesn  t happen for me . and how do people  see  when they are jumping around ? i can hardly aim staying still and these fuckers start jumping ! how can you even see what  s going on so much is moving . thanks for the response !
   (ID: 7c0a90108389e898ab80f1c7af44e170b85c6d76)

8. its negative because the people who feel like they are treated unequally would end up wanting to be treated better than equal . its just like the some of the lgbtq people who call themselves a million different genders . it makes no sense , and it ' s just unreasonable .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

9. for the most part . the problem as i see is that the investgation was long and publicised . its been at the forefront of the news cycle for almost two years . people are burnt out on it and tired of the far left and far right . its like listening to two children argue and fight with each other . at some point everyone just wants the politicians and judiciary to shut up and run the country .
   (ID: 79e5228419de270c01297915dbce56be0063c52b)

10. by the simplest and most accurate definition , it ' s a particular act that you personally sexualise more than just about anything else . it doesn ' t have to be innately sexual . just like sexualities and , closer in relation , fetishes , nobody knows why fantasies exist . but there is speculation that the reason they remain fantasies is because people rarely see themselves participating in real life .

11. yeah that  s true , not as many people are getting third party tests for sarms like they do for gear . i just wish we had some sort of better system
   (ID: 4654e3a9a75835f9ff28170ddf31d5d3cf296ea2)

12. how do people not just sit back and be like . this is ridiculous !
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

13. i see it and i see people in the comments like " omg there ' s no way your dads so cray cray " and it ' s just sad to see some people are that gullible .
   (ID: a73b0dda35d389b4f74e47db6574e0f71738b683)

14. okay , so you  re asking for yourself ? sorry , i assumed you , like most people , were just curious . the biggest thing i had was to use my intellect instead of how i felt . i felt like shit and wanted to die , but i knew in my head i wasn  t and people loved me , i was also just curious , and i can  t find out what happens next if i  m dead . as for life itself being meaningless , so what ? just because no one will remember you in a hundred years doesn  t mean you  re pointless right now , you can have a very real impact on a lot of people in a lot of ways . when i felt like i didn  t matter because humans are expendable , i just had to realise that we are , but not to each other .
   (ID: f8a8648f114c1dd8984a809bd49816978d9970c0)

15. yeah , sucks to see bitlife get more buzz like articles and youtube videos . i remember even seeing people saying how original is their logo , knowing they just got it from instlife
   (ID: 2f03a8d589defb9434044b9ef9bfffc676e2b49a)

16. someone called me some bad stuff and admitted that the intent was to harm me . took me almost a year to figure out that bad people just exist and can fit in with society like everyone else .
   (ID: c9b1e924c86788c982ec59df3d5704354a2a4ae1)

17. does foster actually exist ? i always thought it was just a joke we were playing on americans . kind of like asians selling feng shui to white people
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

18. no not all of them . just the ones who suck and are losers . some people are a  ok they just like being alone and that ' s cool too .
   (ID: 840f5d9bddf24e024b9a70f13cdde62d41604e77)

19. guess my point is , there ' s always a lot of hate towards white people and slurs , but it ' s kinda just shrugged off like nothing . it ' s like most see it as okay .
   (ID: 65b64663fe8890c471866a25cf075ff50d852dbf)

20. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
