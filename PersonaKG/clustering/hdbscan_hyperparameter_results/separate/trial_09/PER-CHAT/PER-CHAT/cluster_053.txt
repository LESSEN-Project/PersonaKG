   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

19. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .
