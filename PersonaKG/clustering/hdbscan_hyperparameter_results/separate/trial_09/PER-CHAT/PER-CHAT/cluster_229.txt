6. it sound that those people in your life are holding you back and that isn  t good for mental health . i  m not saying you should get rid of them but certainly make them aware that your life is more than chores or work and everyone needs a hobby and shouldn  t have to hide it .

8. why does anyone defend anything ? it all comes down to perspective . some people can  t see beyond the mistakes he has made and some can  t see beyond all of the good he has done . its beliefs and values . some defend him because they are more alike than they are different and same goes for the other way around . it  s really fascinating to see how much effort people put into making sure everyone knows how they feel about someone else .

10. choose your poison that ' s a nice test to give to people that are literally incapable of telling good from evil , because you made them in such a way . doesn ' t sound very flattering about god ' s character , is it ?  christianity at least imho is a soothing white lie i prefer calling it opiate of the masses . it helps one notice both great utility as a painkiller and horrible side effects .   x200b

15. that ' s what i wonder . it seems that so many people in power are bad people , and i wonder if that was their end game from the beginning or if they started with good intentions
   (ID: d23bd8fb57b99544637110d5b376dba68b3e2d0f)

16. i hate when people doesn ' t understand that an elementi has not the same properties in every molecule he ' s in . shouldn ' t otherwise your mouth explode when you put salt on food because of the sodium ? or oxygenated water be good to drink ? this is simply pure ignorance , even middle school teaches you this
   (ID: 4cd63391f1644eb1dde02717bf6a72fc6c22acc7)

18. maybe ask about how the minor is used in your major . and maybe discuss books if you ' re into that ? or ask her about her life  career . idk , i barely talk to people much less professors . good luck .
   (ID: 618e7c681a628e6c6c5521926bf4d17deb5ed5d6)

19. i was never really bullied in grade school and high school because i befriended the bullies . they had use of me helping them out with their grades , general companionship , and lending an ear to their issues , and i had use for them protection from other bullies , general companionship , so it was a mutually beneficial relationship . i thought i was above it all and would not succumb to their bullying influences , but come high school , something snapped . the good girl who was too nice for the bullies to bother , who nobody really minded , became a bully herself . i suppose it was their influence , and the anger and rebelliousness inside me that i repressed throughout my childhood that made me snap and become mean to specific people , and nice to everyone else . i had a track record of being good that nobody believed that i was capable of emotional cruelty .
