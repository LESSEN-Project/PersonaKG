1. morgan wallen is pretty successful in the country world , but i guess that ' s not exactly " mainstream " so point stands . show sucks , but there have definitely been some talented folks make a career off of their time on the show , so it ' s not totally bullshit .

2. blizzard has already said that a questline would be needed once bfa launches . dark iron  zandalari are a selling point for bfa . it would make sense that we need to land on kul ' tiras  zandalar and befriend the races before we ' re able to play them . i doubt rep will be a factor unless the quest lines while leveling get you revered  exalted , with honored  revered being the requirement . but only time will tell , once more alpha  beta information is gathered .

3. my busdriver used to make me walk a mile to my stop because it saved him two minutes on his loop . we always got to school with plenty of time to spare . parents today need to let their kids grow up a bit . it ' s not dangerous for them to walk out of site of your home . there aren ' t predators lurking on every corner waiting to steal your kids .

4. then you went to a bad range . i would love to tell you that does not happen but my experience has been it is more common than not . i hope your co worker took the time teach you basic safety and operations , and that you enjoyed your self .

5. lol that ' s not what i meant . let me rephrase it . i have to do that for my pedantic kid all the time eventually everyone would be returning their worn out lifetime warranty shoes and getting new ones for free . when all their customers are doing this , how do they make money ?

6. why does what you do in your free time have any bearing on what you do at work ? in your mind , is it impossible for someone who likes to get high to refrain from doing so at work ? if you drink beer or alcohol , how is that any different ? should having a beer at home disqualify you from driving a forklift at work the next day ? these are genuine questions .
