2. oof , as a woman i suggest you not to spoil women that much , some of us get used to get all we want and then it ' s really hard to get on track again . not my case , i made clear to my boyfriend we are equal and he can count on me as much as i can count on him . i suggest you to talk to her and give her an ultimatum , you should take care of her but she ' s abusing it and not thanking what you do for her . obviously you need to change this , and don ' t have any kids for now , neither more pets or expenses . that wouldn ' t be good for the kids or you .

3. no way , and i don ' t recommend anybody to date someone who has a carbon copy of their personality . i ' d prefer someone that is a good balance for my weaknesses for instance i have a useless sense of direction and can be stubborn often . i want to date someone who will make me a better person , not who is a mirror of myself .

4. you don ' t have to kill anyone to be a good dm as long as they and you are enjoying yourselves then you ' re doing great . however that being said if you have players that want to change characters an epic death could be warrented .

5. why would you want to drink rocket fuel ? once you try the rb  v you ' ll understand !  the first step to dealing with a problem is admitting you have a problem  jase robertson the jase roberton quote reminds me of another , though i am unsure originally uttered it " i have a serious drug problem , the problem is i don ' t have any " but jase had another good one with " you can see the true heart of a man when you ' re out in the woods with a weapon . dick chaney must have had a similar philosophy about ' getting into someone ' s head '

6. i hate streaming movies , the quality no matter how good your internet is almost always is worse than the physical copy . another reason i don  t use it is because there have been times at my friends house that we want to watch a movie but he only streams so if his internet is out and it happens pretty often , he  s pretty cheap we can  t watch anything .
