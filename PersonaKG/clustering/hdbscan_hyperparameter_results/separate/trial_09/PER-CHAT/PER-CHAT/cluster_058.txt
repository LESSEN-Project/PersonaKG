2. wouldn ' t everyone be a little bit suspicious , do you think that some people might assume you did something and go after you or at least heavily question you ?

4. they shook your hand and smiled at you because their religion instructs them to do so . if you gave a neighborhood party and a guy from down the street came and did something disruptive , i think you would consider it disrespectful in the same way people here think you were being disrespectful . i ' m finding it hard to believe you are actually this dense .

5. google is a search engine . when you look something up on google it gives you websites that may have the answer your looking for . however , google is not the actual place where the questions are being answered . reddit , however , is a huge network that basically guarantees a couple of answers at the least for any question you could possibly imagine . think about it , why did you ask  why do people post here  on reddit instead of typing it into google which would supposedly give the same answer

6. ok so how did those people kill them if they did not use a gun ? nobody ever tells me that part . i dont really care how because i kinda think dying by anothers hand is the issue . so to balance yourself before your audience could you please include the overall death rates ? its a sanity thing for me at this point . thanks .

8. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .
