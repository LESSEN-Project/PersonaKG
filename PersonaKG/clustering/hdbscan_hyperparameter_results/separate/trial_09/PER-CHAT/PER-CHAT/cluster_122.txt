SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 5

1. it was a franchise about killing greek gods . then we kind of slid in the viking world which made little to no sense . i don ' t want a white greek going around killing chinese god ' s too . that just doesn ' t fit . you can make his kid do it for all i care . but not kratos

2. i was thinking something closer to " hey that was immature maybe don ' t do that again but we want you back if you ' ll act a little more mature " that ' s obliviously just the bullet points i ' m going to put some care into it but i do understand where you ' re coming from thanks !

3. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better

4. that is just too random . i mean , the caves themselves seem huge , no matter how far , i still see areas of darkness . so i ' ll try and fully explore the area , i guess . i don ' t want to die and respawn , since i mined up lots of ore .

5. yes for the stats , companies need to show that they have women . but the way to treat a woman vs a man is not the same at all . a woman isn ' t taken as seriously as a man . i don ' t want to victimize women , it ' s just what i see . maybe that we aren ' t at the same step . and when i searched my job it was very hard and i had a lot of negative answers even with successfully tests .
