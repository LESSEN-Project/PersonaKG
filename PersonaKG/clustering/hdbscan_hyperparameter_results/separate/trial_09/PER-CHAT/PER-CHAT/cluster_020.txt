1. i  m not a troll . you think anyone who isn  t asian can immediately relate to what you go through ? that  s why i  m asking this sub for perspective . i really just don  t understand why it  s such an issue . economic success will get you practically anywhere you want . on average , you all have money . if you think you  re too ugly to land a date , get plastic surgery . you  re too fat ? hire a personal trainer . dress poorly ? buy better clothes . you can afford it . who gives a shit about how your race is represented in the media ? you think other races are drooling over black guys because hip hop is the most popular genre in the country ? nah bro . economic power is all that matters

2. you do realize that the whole election thing is a show . our votes don ' t matter . they just want you to think they do .

3. it is during these times when i am alone in bed that i remember how my head fits so perfectly on your shoulder , that your arms around me is the safest place i ever knew , that being around you is all i ever want to be . i never knew why you just left without saying anything . i should have been over this . but the truth is , i don ' t think i will be .

4. would be nice to have your own server . it wouldn ' t work like you think though . you ' d end up with a server that only your friends and you play on . think about it , if they made it were anyone could pay for their own server , everyone and their mom would want one . so all these active players start playing on their own private servers . all alone . even without having private servers , how many servers are there with high pop ? not that many . i love the idea , just don ' t see it ever working

5. do you really think the game is " unplayable " on consoles ? the fps problem is the only thing holding me back right now . i like the game concept but unblockable fast attacks sound like a big problem , and i ' m a casual gamer , i just want to play for the fun , so i don ' t like that . don ' t you think it ' s possible for ubisoft to fix this ?
