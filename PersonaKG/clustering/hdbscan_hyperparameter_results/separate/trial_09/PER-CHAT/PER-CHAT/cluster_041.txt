3. do all the volunteering  internships you can , i suggest thesca . org in the us totally worth their one  time application fee , it ' s super easy to apply for things once you have your profile . be willing to travel wherever you get offered a position . alaska doesn ' t get too many applicants , so it ' s a good starting point  just be willing to go without internet or cell service for a long time . it can get lonely .

4. first of all , how would time travel " write out " those characters ? i ' m not sure i understand  just need some elaboration . second , " easy " writing usually isn ' t good writing  it ' s lazy and uncreative . the russos are better than that .

5. just go to the gym . it sounds easy but that ' s all you can do . just do it . try to bargain with yourself . and in time , with baby steps you ' ll get out of your shell . i can ' t really imagine what your voice must sound like tbh but i find it super immature of ppl to openly make fun of something you can ' t really change . remember ! they are wrong . not you . you can ' t do anything to change your voice . there are weird ways to try but they may not work . ppl know you can ' t change it . and they make fun of you anyway . that ' s plain wrong no matter how you look at it . keep working on yourself and don ' t forget that you have the potential to improve . but they will always be assholes . good luck !

6. 26m here . you basically just described me . so not alone ? though i also dont feel good about this ravenous pessimism toward dating either but can ' t shake the feeling that it ' s all a waste of time

7. can you stop feeding a troll ? there are so many inconsistencies and indicators that op is just some wannabe fiction writer that it  s becoming ridiculous for you to defend an obvious shitposter . i get it that you try to take it serious for the off chance it  s real , but i  m sure you can spend your time in a better way than feeding into attention  seeking from some douche with a made up sob  story . and following that argument you  d literally have to give advice to any random shitpost that you come across this relationship subreddits ? do you do that ? otherwise you  re just a hypocrite that cares for the stories that got you a good amount of attention  karma yourself .

8. lager tastes different to me every time , if it  s after a very long hard day at work especially in good weather then it  s the best taste ever , other times it  s just so , straight after food it tastes pretty bad to me so i guess it is whatever to mood strikes me

9. judging by your response , youre probably a terrible parent who doesn ' t take the time to enforce standards of good behavior in children , and instead says ' thats just the way kids are ' and lets them run around batshit crazy being a fucking menace .

10. i went and saw bohemian rhapsody by myself when it came out . it was a first for me going by myself , and i actually ended up liking it more by myself because no one was distracting me by talking to me . no one gives a fuck if you  re by yourself anyway , you  re just going to see a movie , no one  s paying attention to anything but the movie . have a good time !
