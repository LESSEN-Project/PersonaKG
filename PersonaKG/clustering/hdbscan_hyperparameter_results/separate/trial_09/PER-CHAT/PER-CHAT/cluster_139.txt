11. we can ' t know how serious he is until we see him interact with other characters . all we know of his character as yet is that he gets really mad when you chain him to a wall for days on end . pretty sure old dante would show similar anger and defiance were he somehow imprisoned for a prolonged period of time .

16. from what i understood is that you ' re wife is basically boycotting you in bed for weeks at a time . you should know that according to the hadith , the angels curse her until dawn for that and she is constantly sinning . your ' fantasy ' about getting a second wife is not haram . allah has made it halal for a reason , and if you can fulfill the requirements , go for it ! otherwise , this can be reasonable grounds for divorce . allahu ' alam .

19. because the heat of the sun , and the amount of water and salt and all the time that it ' s been there . there is more water and more area affected by that than in your glass of water . although maybe it ' s an interesting experiment if you put lot of salt in a small container , you heat it up and when you ' re gonna smell it , you cover you head and the container with a towel . if you try it , let me know what happens .
