1. not being a dick , but why would you want to know what happened in the comics if you aren ' t up to date ? just curious .

2. living in the area we all know just how bad br can be at times . whether it  s the traffic , poor drainage , failing school system , old infrastructure , or a lack of entertainment , it  s just not something i want to be reminded of on a daily basis . i get wanting to be made aware of the issues but it seems like the same issues have been around br for ever with no sense of improvement in sight .

6. youtube is going to be your best bet . as someone else mentioned , just pick a topic and go . if you ' re wondering how brakes work or how you replace them , or you want to know the difference between engine configurations , etc , you should be able to find a video explaining it .

7. why ask a question if you ' re going to incorrectly assume the answer ? i know you were trying to be sarcastic , but it just comes off as smug . i ' m sure you could convince me and others of your argument if you actually tried , but that doesn ' t seem to be your goal here . if you do want to engage in meaningful discussion , i ' m all ears .

8. that idea is still there , you just have to ignore society and their ideas of livelihood . honestly , the thought if having kids isnt in my book and i still dont know if i want to get married . so i ' m just living and loving my life the way it is now .

9. yea , you didnt answer the question . a drunk guy is held responsible for his actions if he is drunk and has sex with a drunk female . a drunk female cant give consent because shes not in her right mind but a drunk male is supposed to be in his right mind enough to know that the woman is too drunk to give consent . its a double standard that is ridiculous and you can down vote me all you want for it . but just answer the question , thats all i ask .
