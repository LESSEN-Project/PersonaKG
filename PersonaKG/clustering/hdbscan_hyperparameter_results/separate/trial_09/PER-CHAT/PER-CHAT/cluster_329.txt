1. as an outsider looking in , it often seems these days anyone showing pride and waving your stars and stripes are automatically seen as trump supporters and with that comes accusations of racism etc how is public displays of patriosm actually seen in america ? note  this isn ' t my thoughts just what i often see on social media .

3. hmm . interesting . seinfeld saved bee movie for me . if i hadn ' t been a lifelong fan of seinfeld i probably would have seen how bad that movie was . instead i could laugh at the jokes because they reminded me of the show just enough .

5. my thoughts on them , while not having seen them , is that i probably won ' t watch them . documentaries are supposed to be even  handed approaches to complex situations , but often end up being propaganda with a little egalitarian flavor . i have absolutely nothing against vegetarianism or veganism or pescatarianism or whatever , just documentaries with a mission .

6. i got one for you , too  what about a god who created everything which includes sin , if he created everything , who had his own son killed to get forgiveness . he could  ve just forgiven us , because it  s him that is the forgiver . if you argued he didn  t create sin , he could actually do an innumerable list of things that would help more than killing your own kid .

7. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .

9. i  ve actually been on reddit for a year but i had to create a new account because i got spammed after one of my posts got 30k upvotes . rip my inbox so much spam . i  m mad because i had so much karma , but i  ll just get more whatever .

11. it ' s a text message . if it was urgent , you should ' ve called , imo . we ' re all adults and we ' re busy living our lives . a text message just frankly isn ' t a priority .

14. i  ve just got this horrible feeling that we  ll end up back tracking on the due to international pressure . international law stipulates that we cannot leave someone stateless but what for the islamic state , the one that she left for ?
