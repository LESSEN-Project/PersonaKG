5. something that relates to a talent or a goal of theirs , especially if it ' s a little bit beyond them . for example , if they like drawing , get them some really nice pens or paper , so they feel both validated in their craft but also inspired to do more .

6. that sounds like you have some really tense fingers , no idea what would help with that . my best guess would be to pay attention to your hand while you play and see if it gets super tense , and if so relax a bit . otherwise visiting your doctor might help

7. it sounds like you are taking the right steps . i really hope she hasn  t been kidnapped and hoping for a logical explanation for you and her .

8. the dire wolves have been in the show since the start but i never really felt like they were all that big and scary , i love how this scene really shows that off , however it was the end of that . ps  she could have easily rod the wolf over the horse .
