1. if you just kind of brushed him off at first or just nervously laughed you ' re kind of screwed . he thinks he ' s " wearing you down " at this point . just tell him no and do not explain why . just say no . if he doesn ' t get the message , it may be time to talk to your supervisor about it .

2. i wouldn ' t say that amanda punches harder . cyborg is the bigger woman , and punches pretty hard . amanda ' s punches are just faster . so by the time cyborg is extending her punches , she ' s already getting rocked by amanda . either way , you ' re right that she didn ' t fight smart . it ' s what happens when you ' re the hunted for so long , you forget to keep doing what got you to the dance .

3. not if you say you are going to admit an increased amount of people in a one year time frame . what do you mean it literally happened today ? what exactly happened today that allowed the nra to take control over trump ?

4. i always notice the people that say this either have a 4x4 truck or youve just been lucky on the road . i drive a semi and dont blame anyone for going slower in snow  ice conditions . if youre unsure its better to take it slow rather than making a mistake and sliding through an intersection or causing a pile up . i do understand everyone has to be somewhere but not everyone is as experienced so just take your time or leave enough time in the mornings .

5. that is not mainly what we are talking about . sure , occasionally you will wait on a foreign guest but that is not happening all the time . also , most people do tend to do some general research about a country before they just go set foot over there . the tipping culture in america is fairly well known and it  s depicted in their media regularly . but i stand by my original comment , if you are foreign and you come to america and learn about the customs and then say that that  s stupid and you  re not going to tip , you are a cheap asshole .

6. i  m just giving you a hard time . i  d say the first but cut more off the top .

7. i ' d have to say ori and the blind forest . it ' s such a beautiful game with such a beautiful soundtrack . the story is told with few words and more visual story telling . that game never fails to make me shed a few tears , even on the 5th playthrough . it ' s not playing a platformer , its living the trials of ori and it just submerges you so well that i ' d have to say it ' s my all time favorite game .

8. i have a hard time believing someone in the trek universe hasn ' t tried this . i am also trying to figure out if i should say this happened on titania or just go straight to saying it was the klingons on uranus .

9. how long until uber just decides to give the police real  time data on us instead of fiddling with our phones ? then , if they can ' t solve a crime they can just pin it on the closest driver at that time , case solved . now that i think about it , nsa and cia probably already have this . unconstitutional you say ? nah , they say ! it ' s for your protection ! it ' s to get the terrorists ! astonished  face

10. if it were that bad , id just say it outright , but then again  im working as a part time cashier so me losing my job is less of a big deal lol . i doubt youd lose your job for that though .
