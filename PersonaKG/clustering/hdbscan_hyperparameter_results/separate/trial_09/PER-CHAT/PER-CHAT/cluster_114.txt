1. definitely nta but your bf is because if he can ' t respect someones boundaries  consent than that says a lot about thew kind of person he is . i really don ' t think you should have kids with this guy and while i don ' t want to get all up in your personal life ' do you really want to be with a guy who doesn ' t understand consent and the meaning of the word no ?

2. think about your network . can you build one quickly , can you survive without it ? if the answer is no , don ' t go . you are married . how does your husband feel about it ? is your relationship solid enough for long distance . if it works out , what will your husband do for work ? can he transfer ? its your decision , but you are also a team . if he doesn ' t want to leave or can ' t , you may not want to take the job . can your finances handle supporting two households ? if you move to establish the homebase across the country , your husband still needs to maintain the current home . this means a strain on the finances . can you afford it ? do you want to ?

3. i think that cheating should be some sort of crime . if you make a commitment , you stay true to it . if you don  t want to honor the commitment don  t have a relationship with someone who does want a commitment

6. watching what is happening , while they reply to our comments on here and their forum . i can ' t help but think that the money activision is forcing their hand on a lot of this . its like getting mad at a f1 driver for letting his teammate pass him on the last lap . it seems ridiculous when you ' re watching , but we don ' t hear the owner of the race team in his ear saying " if you ever want to race again , let him pass " .

7. well i don ' t think i can convince you if you don ' t see it , but for me , it ' s more about them becoming too human . and i associate digimon with much more human  like creatures mostly because they talk to you  i never made it far enough into the show to get to machine guns and stuff . i ' m a biologist , so i love animals , and i want my pokemon to stay animals . if it ' s based on a cat , i want it to be a cat , not some human  cat hybrid looking thing .

8. you think nobody has ever typed out a bunch of paragraphs telling me to shut up before ? i ' m not going to stop and there mods abandoned this sub years ago . you ' re the one who opened up a comment that was downvoted into oblivion , don ' t open up comments that have been buried if you don ' t want to read them .

9. what do you think makes someone able to have these thoughts , glitches , finding past lifes , seeing future life , etc ? i never have had anything happen to me . i don ' t understand but want to .

10. think , does it really matter . if this is all a dream don ' t i want to have the best dream possible ?

11. will you be my gbf ? no bitch i wont . if you only value me because you somehow think my sexuality will get you some perks then i don ' t want to even associate with you , let alone be your bestie .

12. if it bothers you that much , think about it more like this  your parents are rich , you ' re not . you don ' t have to take their money if it makes you uncomfortable . if you ' re old enough to move out go for it . tell em you want to succeed on your own merits , then try it .
