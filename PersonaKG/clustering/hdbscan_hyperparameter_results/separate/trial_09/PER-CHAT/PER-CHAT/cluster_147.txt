2. that makes your opinion even more ignorant than it already was . or maybe your definition of abuse is different from mine . or maybe the abuse you suffered was insignificant . you obviously don ' t know what you ' re talking about becuase no woman who does would say any of the things you said here . nothing about this is funny . how dare you go online and perpetuate the idea to even one other woman that she could possibly deserve to be abused ? shame on you .
