3. i ' m not sure that abortion is the reason . most of our parents were in the " silent generation "  that group of people who grew up in the great depression but were too young for wwii . the greatest generation crammed all their child rearing into the post war period and the result was the baby boom . the baby boomers are the moms and dads of gen y . i agree we are the best generation , though . i ' m proud to say that while the baby boomers partied in the mud at the original woodstock our generation rioted at the one they tried to put on for us .

17. well i seem to be somewhat unique in that i can ' t honestly say i relate to any of them , at least certainty not on the level of a lot of other people on this sub . i am very lucky to have never personally experienced any of the problems portrayed in the game . that said i do definitely sympathize with them quite a lot . i ' d say i sympathize the most with sayori probably because my sister suffers from depression , followed by natsuki . then yuri , then monika . i love natsuki the most though .

19. it is not the same because as white people we have not been the victim of systematic oppression and fetishism and our worldview does not allow us to understand the experiences of people of colour because we are in a privileged position where we have not dealt with the obstacles faced by poc , so who are we to invalidate what this girl has to say ?
