3. its okay if you haven  t played ds , as long as you acknowledge that piece of information . the idea that the reality of bloodborne and the reality of ds are one is pretty . stupid i must say . therefore its important that we establish a common ground of understanding , you know ? to put things into perspective , you wouldn  t start a race facing the wrong way would you now ?
