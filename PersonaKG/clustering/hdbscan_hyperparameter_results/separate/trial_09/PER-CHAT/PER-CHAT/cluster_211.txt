3. it  s dogshit , but it has dinosaurs . so the real question is , what is your importance ratio between a decent movie and the presence of dinosaurs ? more than half the movie is set in a house . the action is crap . the characters are crap . the plot is crap with a capital c . the twists are predictable . the only interesting story thread is completely wasted for a last minute gag . the climax is essentially the same as the last jurassic world . it is a poo movie . a poovie . personally , i fucking love dinosaurs and dino related movies and i still found it to be a stinker not worth my time . the only good thing about it is that the ending opens up potential for the next instalment . i wouldn  t waste my time homie .
