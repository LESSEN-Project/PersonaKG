1. why would someone just entering the business turn down a job opportunity for low pay ? i certainly know i wouldn ' t , and the prevalence of internships shows that people are willing to basically work for free as long as it gets them experience .

2. i guess now we know , varys never had a hidden agenda . he truly was just a guy that wanted the best for the people of the realm . his passing is even more tragic if one considers this .

3. " secret " , just go through all people who can cursive and you know

4. you know those people who lose a tonne of weight then gain it all back , getting to be at least as big as they were before they started ? that ' s you if you aren ' t careful . it is much harder to keep going once you attain a place you ' re happy with as you lose a major motivator at that point . just remember every bad day is literally undoing the hard work you went through to get to where you are now . past you says you ' re a dick and should keep on eating right !

5. everyone is someone ' s kid . so everyone will be missed by a couple people . unless you ' re a total piece of shit and your parents are dead , in which case just do the world a favor , know what i mean ?

6. ummm . wow ! it wasn ' t the nazis who built that wall . yikes ! i correct my previous statement , you should have just learned history ! that was not such a wall , that was to keep people in . much easier to do if the gov ' t kills anyone you know if you escape . kind of puts a damper on escapes and the ability to plan them with others .

7. it happens . not many people know what dyspraxia is so i just explain it to them
   (ID: df1ced988175856d5a5b468166271e5d777e4a3e)

8. i know it ' s someone else since you replied with decency . just find it comical how my own view and something that should affect no one still offends people . it ' s a pathetic culture we have going on .
