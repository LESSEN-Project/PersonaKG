1. yeah apart from the signature in the book from our dear fred , which is digit , there seems to be no other date . thank you for your help ! any idea roughly how much it ' s worth ? i did buy to sell it , just saw it and grabbed without doing research .

2. did you read what you just typed ? if something has low odds and it happens it is generally considered lucky . doesn ' t always have to be , for example , two digit stars to be lucky . edit  yes i ' m aware that you could also be unlucky in this same manner . but i would not consider this to be unlucky .

3. merch is not a fanbase , but again my point about the underlying story has to make some sense to you . also america is obsessed with junk media , not all but the majority pushes this fanbase towards fringe . i apologise to those who didn ' t get that . if you have ever looked at tik tok or whatever for more than digit minutes you are probably going to still be offended . also just being extra anal , those two stores do nothing but by merch for new games so i would be curious how well kh sells compared to something for scale . i ' m not doubting it did well , just curious .

4. apology accepted , sorry for being mean to you earlier . arguing in general is really not my style especially with someone who  s almost digit decades older then me . since you revealed yourself probably so should i . i  m student for eastern europe , and yes , eastern europe sucks pretty hard . not a redhead but i enjoy smoking as well . i just can  t help bit ask you how did you draw a line between me and americans since english is not my native language lol
