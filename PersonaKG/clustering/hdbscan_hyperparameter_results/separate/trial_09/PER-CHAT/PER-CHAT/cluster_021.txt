SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 6

1. when you have to walk in a dark or creepy area , phone someone and chat so that you aren ' t alone . make a point of mentioning your exact location multiple times . if you are extra nervous , you can say things like " i ' m almost there " or " do you see me yet ? " to suggest someone knows you very nearby . you could even do a video call with them so that they can actually see you and your surroundings , though you don ' t want to look like an oblivious dummy paying too much attention to your phone . if you can ' t get someone on the phone , or if you don ' t want to call someone , you can also phone your voicemail . it ' s going to keep reading your options back to you so that there ' s always noise on the other end . just don ' t have it too loud so that other people could tell you ' re talking to yourself .

2. for the same reason people don ' t call an apple a banana . or call a dog a cat . it ' s the wrong word and confusing . even if you do allow it where do you draw the line . people are already starting to want to identify with other animals , plants , inanimate objects , and fictional things . your biological sex kinda trumps your gender identity . with all that said , if you look the part i don ' t mind calling you whatever . if you wanna identify as a woman look like one . but don ' t get pissed when that one day you forget to shave that beard i refer to you as he or call you mister . same for women wanting to be a man . at the end of the day it ' s not really a big deal till someone makes it one . remember just because you want to be something or think you are something doesn ' t make it true . we usually refer to things like that as delusions or a mental disorder .

3. i don ' t give a fuck about anyone except my friends and family , which is why i don ' t want to be paying for anyone else ' s shit through my tax money . if someone who was in need came asking for monetary help , i will gladly volunteer some cash over , i always do if i have cash . i don ' t like being forced to give charity . i think it ' s theft . but generally , i think it ' s rude to kill people , don ' t do it . it ' s rude to physically and sexually assault someone , don ' t do it . just because i don ' t care about most people doesn ' t mean i ' m not considerate enough to hold a door open .

4. it ' s the worst thing when you like reading but everyone thinks it ' s stupid and cuz you have crippling anxiety you stop reading cuz you don ' t want people to think your a " nerd " or a " geek "

5. if you can ' t countenance a person ' s art because the person is trash , that ' s totally your own personal choice . i just don ' t think that social pressure to boycott art like that is healthy . people should be allowed to choose for themselves if they want to consume that kind of culture or not .

6. believe whatever you want , i ' m clearly not going to change your mind . i don ' t think you understand the fact that people can be serious and humorous in one video . you do you . whatever .
