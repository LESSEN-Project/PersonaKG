2. i ' ve seen a lot of baby angle stickers lately , i thought they were for living kids and referring to them as darling little angels . that is weird and sad if people are advising one and all that they ' ve had miscarriages . also i know a single woman who has a full family set of stickers including dog , so her house doesn ' t look like easy pickings to thieves she says .

3. ehh no that  s not quite what i  m getting at , i know what you  re talking about . like someone looking off in the distance or distracted while talking , that  s not what i  m referring to . i  ve seen several people who talk with their eyes closed , like speak full sentences with their eyes closed . or they look up while their face is facing you . it sounds bizarre but if you know what i mean then i bet you agree it  s annoying . idk why people do it . some strange social phobia maybe
