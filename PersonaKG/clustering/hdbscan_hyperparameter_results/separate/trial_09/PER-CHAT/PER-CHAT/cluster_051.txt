Total from this dataset: 8

1. my parents don ' t actually physically give me an allowance , just money as gifts for birthday  christmas  newyear . but obviously i ' m using communal internet , electricity , water services , but i don ' t contribute to those bills . my parents also pay for more than half the food i eat , because they ' re buying food for all of us and we all eat it together . basically if it ' s something they also want  need  use , they ' ll pay . if it ' s just for me , like if i ' m going out to get food or for my own electronics  vehicle  music stuff , then that ' s out of my wallet .

2. i have thought about it . i want some money to sustain myself with , like , food and stuff lol . also , i just don ' t feel like i am in a place where i could right now . the closest i have gotten is through plotting to run away to alaska or utah haha

5. sometimes it ' s not a matter of preferring one person over another . you may love your so , but get no sex from them . you don ' t want to break up , but need sex , obviously . so you find someone else you like . not love , but just like . like enough to have sex with . you don ' t find that person preferable to your so on the whole  just for what you can ' t get from them .

6. forget about skin color . that  s just completely irrelevant . who cares what color anyone in this story is ? if someone breaks into your home , you have the right to shoot them ! i don  t own a gun but shit like this makes me want to get one . you have a right to protect your home and yourself and the person who broke in is a criminal and should have been aware of the risks ! bring on the downvotes , i don  t care . seems like i  m the only person here with any sense in their head ! why are you sticking up for someone who broke into someone else  s home ? play stupid games , win stupid prizes ! duh !

7. it is but it ' s better like that , plus if i really don ' t want to continue i just break up and appreciate my privacy again until the depression comes back .

8. i don ' t consider it a waste . at the risk of sounding ignorant , budget has no impact on how i grow . my personal grow is my hobby and stuff i want to do like plant manipulation or literal pet projects . if i get the right seed combo , i could make potential f1s that yield ungodly amounts per ft2 . if i get the wrong seed combo , i just made a new genetic that none of my friends have . so to me , that sounds like a win  win and not the loss  loss you want to present it as .
