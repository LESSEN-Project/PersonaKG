1. shadow assault is unquestionably the least desirable . it ' s not a ' bad ' , heroic in reality , vp is just fantastic . most of the other less than desirable heroics i can think of niche use for , but that ' s the most difficult one . the other two that come to mind are rain of chaos which is decent for zoning during a push , and mind control can be used for picks in some cases . i wouldn ' t recommend picking them most of the time , but you can come up with situations where they are pretty decent . abby ' s construct blanking out on the name , is good and bad in so far that if not stopped it can do a lot of damage . it limits his team  fight potential though , so unless your team can compensate in some other ways it can be difficult to use properly . it has high potential though , and under the right circumstances is arguably superior .

2. my whole life . looks , intelligence , talents . every time i meet someone who is better at something i think i ' m getting good at . i pretty much nope out and change course . i ' ve become somewhat a jill of all trades but master of none .

3. i dont think anyone goes into the field of social work with salary maximization in mind . as a business major i recall others mocking the social work majors at graduation . " oh what a bright future they have " , they mockingly said . it was funny at the time but i ' ve come to learn those in the field are truly helpers inherently . some are even empaths . dont think so negatively . if one therapist turned you off try another . god knows the field is packed . good luck .

5. i think it ' s because half the time you keep talking to the wrong end . pick the side that ' s not blowing hot air , and you ' ll have a good conversation . if you do pick the wrong side , run , for it will soon be smelly .
