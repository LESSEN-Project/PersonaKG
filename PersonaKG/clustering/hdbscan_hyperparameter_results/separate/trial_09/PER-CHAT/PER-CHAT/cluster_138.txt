1. i am american in uk , it  s ironic we reflect each other in a way . i do not feel  free  in uk and i feel like something is right on top of me figuratively . admitted we do get a bit anxious when a cop is around , but it  s really only when driving because if not following the law you will get punished . here in uk the cops are basically unrespected or unfeared by criminals to be the point i have seen plenty of fist fights right in front of cops here in uk and have even seen the cops not stop a fight or a guy on a drugged rampage while in a smaller town . like you i do appreciate uk , and love the experience but i just prefer back home

2. she  s taking my advice and basically just dropping subtle hints to see if she is bi or gay . asking her outright could go multiple ways and , like you , doesn  t wanna risk her friendship but is contemplating if it  s worth the risk since if she is bi or gay they might end up in a relationship . so it  s a difficult scenario . see what kinda friends she hangs out with since gays tend to congregate in my experience and find out what her previous relationships were like if she  s had any . so far it  s going pretty well and hannah is pretty sure she  s bi but still needs to find out more before she moves forward with it . oh yeah i actually had a situation similar to that with my partner , neither of us knew if the other was gay or straight or not . i  m pan so and i  ve dated girls and guys in the past , they  ve dated only one girl and regretted the relationship . after i found out they were pan too because i noticed a lot of their friends were gay , they had an even amount of girl to guy friends , they never denied being gay , etc so i asked them out and apparently they liked me for months on end . now we  re in an almost three year relationship . i hope all goes well for you smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

3. so , everyone and everything on earth would be some sort of a tool  obstacle that could help you discover what life really should be ? i apologize for this , but i can ' t keep up with this right now . i ' m a bit tired and unfocused . i ' d like to keep talking with you about this , but just later on if you ' re ok with that . before i go , i ' d like to show you something musical that i ' ve found to be very interesting . these are many different genres of music . the top layers represent the most conventional and standard types that everyone enjoys . the lower genres are . strange , before anything else . this is completely off topic , but i kinda wanted to leave you off with something i personally , could never make any sense of . maybe you can ?

4. um , sometimes they wake me up . there are times when i ' ll just go through the whole thing , even when it ' s bad . today , i woke up with a heaviness in my chest and shortness of breath from a nightmare that lasted days in dream . sometimes in my dream , i decide to fly . it ' s never super easy to do . i have to really try hard . a lot of times i will just jump really hard to start flying but it takes me a few minutes . i love flying in my dreams even if it takes a while to do . i also like to call my husband , almost like a companion . sometimes he ' s already there . i ' ve never been able to have a companion in a dream till recently and only my husband . now , we get to do a lot of fun and cool stuff . he looks like he does everyday , which is mostly flip  flops , not matter what the dream environment is like . it ' s really fun to watch him hunt off crazed post apocalyptic creatures while he ' s running around in flip flops .

5. hmm , well i can be pretty bitter about it too . although i still occasionally get propositioned for sex so i guess i could be uglier . too bad i ' m kind of involuntarily asexual meds and other issues or else i ' d sleep around more . at least someone wants to touch me lol . i ' ve done the weight loss thing and that didn ' t really help not like those before and after pictures where the after is a totally cute guy . it doesn ' t help help that i ' m a socially anxious and naturally introverted reserved person been that way since before the tumblr era so it ' s hard for my inner personality to come out so that ' s another strike . i guess just hold on to see if someone can look past looks and try not to be a forever aloner . pretty hokey advice that i try to give myself .

6. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .
