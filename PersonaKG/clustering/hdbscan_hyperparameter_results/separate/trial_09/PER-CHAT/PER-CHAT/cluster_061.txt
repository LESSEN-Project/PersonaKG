1. i relationship is a commitment . i guess it isnt just women but people today want the benefits of the relationship without the ups and downs . also women expect to shoot a man down who has been courting them and have the dude treat them the exact same . i wouldn ' t treat anyone as well as i treat my wife .

2. yeah , i ' m waiting for my legs and arms to rot off , the cancer to spread , and my life to be completely be disassembled by people who i never meant ill  will for . even my family is going to be killed . strict . i just want to be father to my kid and have him have someone to look up to by living well with the short  trip i was given . maybe , too late .

3. why would you want to hide your personality ? i see it as expressing your true self to people , because i have been liying to people for too long . on the other hand there is the argument that , well accourse it ' s just a hobby and that people shouldn ' t care what hobbies you have , but lets be honest , who ' s personality hasn ' t changed because of the fandom ?

4. thing is i wouldn  t call it a debate if we were to go by the textbook definition . i could almost guarantee that if i sat down with lorinbassnectar he wouldn  t want to have a debate about policy he would simply shut me out . i  m sure , and maybe i  m making an assumption , but i  m sure that we could both agree that a lot if not the majority of his fan base has no knowledge about policy and simply follows what is posted . that  s what i find dangerous . when so many people look up to an individual they treat his words as facts , and this applies to both sides of the aisle . i also call it dangerous because it is a sure way of not only ostracizing a large portion of your fan base who listens to your music to escape reality but it could even pose the problem of many people losing hope in one place where they thought they could find it , and that is dance music . that  s just me and i can tell from the many downvotes that  s it  s not a very popular opinion .

5. it was mostly just talk , and they acted like they were showing what the people want , even though a lot of people wanted pewdiepie to be in it , or the whole jake paul suicide forest ordeal .

6. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .

7. and that  s ok , you should like what you want , i just wouldn  t recommend it based on personal experience . but i respect people  s choices

9. you may want to play around with this idea  these gems are obviously powerful . there are many creatures in the world that want that power for their own ends , or simply just to acquire it for themselves . a powerful gem will attract interest from some people and creatures . a group of them being collected and held in the same area will attract them like a magnet . so just because your pc ' s are looking for them , doesn ' t mean there isn ' t someones else too .

10. it can . or , even of or doesn ' t , some people just want to escape what they have going on , and in that form .
