1. if that  s your opinion then so be it . on my end i will always carry and use my pistol . there  s been so many stories of non  lethal not working at all . hell there  s a bunch of stories where lethal force barely worked . a police officer in illinois had to shoot a man digit times with his . digit before he stopped . i don  t think anything non lethal would have even phased him .

2. sorry i didn ' t mean rarely activated . i meant it ' s rare to have digit or more negative effects on at once . especially with vero cleansing . but yeah i do see the benefit to her 2nd skill . but i ' m also interested in getting my dragons team to auto . i don ' t think changing the lead will result in an auto ready team . is there a monster i have that would really help me out . su perhaps ? or maybe throwing verad into the line  up .

3. this card is basically a zero mana discover a spell . u can either play the discovered card or another spell but either way you are still paying full price it ' s not that similar to glyph because the discount doesn ' t last . it ' s not a true discount like prep because the card itself costs digit mana . personally i don ' t think it will see any play outside of hagatha .

4. yeah i was reading his post and was unable to even answer what the third perk on a shotgun was . he first said it was two shot and then anti armour and then digit  strength which i don  t think is even possible . he should be reported to mods but in my experience they dont do shit anyway

6. real talk , self control and no small amount of will power . also when i decided to stop i went out and bought digit or digit of those little cheap nail clippers they sell in the checkout aisle and put them in drawers and on shelves etc . around my house and one in my car so i wouldn ' t have an excuse to bite . i don ' t let my nails get too long so i ' m not tempted . think of the upsides too , i don ' t have to be self conscious about my fingers now when i hand over money to pay for things or go to shake hands with someone . it ' s super unsanitary to bite and chew your nails no matter how much you wash your hands , i play guitar and when i would chew really bad it would hurt sometimes to play , not anymore . think of all the plus sides to quitting , you can do this !

7. yes you can be religious and rational i don  t think the earth is only  digit years old for example but do you really think asking questions like this would come off as anything other than a stereotypical reddit atheist getting ready to school me with le facts and logiquetrade  mark ? like these questions imply that creationists are irrational . also who tf is ken ? and ham ?

8. you think they should love you because you act , ' nice ' when everyone is supposed to do that regardless . you watch too much anime and are a creepy weeaboo loser . you don ' t share your cheetos . these are the top digit reasons .

9. i don ' t recall hearing the word sportbike when i had a norton in the digit ' s . i think it may not have been invented yet . none the less , norton was the sportbike of its day . there were plenty faster bikes but no one could keep up with me on the mountain roads .
