1. can you explain why this is so bad ? if i ' m paying 20k a year to go to school my classmates shouldn ' t make it my responsibility to make sure they don ' t kill themselves .

2. yes this is the reason why i don ' t buy a nc . its almost as if they are trying to make it realistic in the way that illegal activities are better money than honest ones . i wouldn ' t mind paying to keep my popularity up so i could have fun in my nc when ever i wanted .

3. no never . you have to be open and talk about it a lot before hand to lay down some basic rules , the do  s and don  t , discuss limit and what you wanna try or willing to try . once you got that down and you fully trust the person you shouldn  t have any issues . at least i never had . of corse you can have issues or be betrayed but that  s why you need to fully trust the person before hand and make sure to be in a safe environment .

4. a chaotic evil person would not be inthralled to be in a group , but would be in one because those " other guys " make great meat shields . they would be very selfish , not understand the concept of doing something without greater gain to ones self aka doesn ' t understand sharing , or parenthood . ce person would not kill indiscriminately because arrows , swords , and money don ' t grow on trees , but if something is in the way . its dead . a ce person respects only one thing  power . they will follow power . a person with more power is feared , equal power respected , lesser power abused .

5. so many talk about climate change because it ' s cool and do a couple of meaningless actions that make them feel better about themselves . if you truly care then don ' t have kids , that has a real positive impact on climate .
