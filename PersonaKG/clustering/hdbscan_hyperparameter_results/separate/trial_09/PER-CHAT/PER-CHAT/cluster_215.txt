3. the judeo  christian god is an absolute of everything we consider desirable , to the extent that it is unattainable and conflicting , all powerful , all knowing , and all loving sound good on paper , but conflict with the presence of evil polytheistic religions tend to have gods that celebrate human characteristics and imperfections . unfortunately , gods that celebrate human characteristics like partying , drinking , war , and sex aren ' t good for " controlling people " everything good is attributed to one god , everything bad attributed to our humanity .
