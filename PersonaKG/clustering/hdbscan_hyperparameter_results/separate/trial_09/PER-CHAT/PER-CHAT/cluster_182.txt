4. motive always should be considered in a crime . if you killed someone because they raped your wife . , that ' s one kind of murder . if you killed someone to get your rocks off , that another more serious kind of murder . if you killed the president , that ' s treason . personally i think the people who killed matthew committed an even worse kind of murder . it took several of them to kill a poor defenseless gay guy . they tie him to a fence , beat him to death as he begged for his life , just to get a few bucks ? no . , because he was gay . what a bunch of cowards . hell will be too good a place for them .

5. hmm . good point . my argument seemed to be a bit flawed . i guess it  s just down to the amount people use and nothing else . or is it . i guess imma have to come back to this topic at a later date and think about it a bit more

6. it ' s good to hear he doesn ' t mind the crate . i wish my friends had gotten one of those huge metal crates , i think that would have saved their dog . i wish we could have conversations with our dogs and explain what ' s going on where there is thunder or fireworks . i imagine they think the world is collapsing around them or something . i have heard of people using dog training cd ' s that play scary noises or you can just use youtube videos and teach them its no big deal . good luck !
