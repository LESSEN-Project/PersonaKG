1. esh unpopular opinion but there ' s nothing brave or special about coming out as asexual . she sounds like an insufferable person but at the same time you say " you were only sitting there to get closer to your crush " and implied that her asexuality doesn ' t matter to you because you ' re not interested in banging her anyways .

2. " allowing " for direct negotiations is a fallacy because it ' s far easier for a large employer to play hard ball than it is for an individual worker to find another job . " allowing " for direct negotiations is not a kindness . i ' m happy that you enjoyed your own employment situation , i have no personal problem with this kind of thing so long as it isn ' t coercive . like you say yourself , by offering more money for the time they should be able to find willing workers . but allowing them to compel this kind of thing is terrible .

3. do you smile back ? if so , the next time that happens say , " hi . how ' s it going ? " or something casual like that .

7. as someone who stays outside the usa i can honestly say that i ' m not even surprised any time he says things like this any more . i should be shocked or embarrassed for him but i ' m way beyond that .
