2. it cost you  digit to build the whole thing from start to finish ? or is that not including the case and wires and all that ? if it was digit bucks total that ' s pretty good . it cost me i think like  digit  digit or so to buy my te2 chun stick although it is an amazing stick all ways around so i like it a lot .

3. agreed . i think this is good idea but i would go one step further and still have a qualification process . maybe instead of having to win digit games you only need to win digit and players already in the " real " wl cannot compete once qualified . love the idea of lesser rewards . kinda like the ncaa tournament vs the nit .

5. seems like a wholesome , genuine bio and its good ! to maybe spur more interest , i would add what your favorite burger spot is as well as where you enjoy getting pizza from . someone may relate or have that in common with you and will give you a reason to ask her on a date , like if she enjoys , " digit guys " then maybe you could both grab a bite over some convo !
