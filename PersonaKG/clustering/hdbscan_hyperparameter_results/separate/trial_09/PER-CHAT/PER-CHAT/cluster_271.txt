1. just an idea but maybe write him a letter in the form of an invitation to hog warts and list the series as his school books ? you could expand it and add other " supplies " and take him to hogsmeade in the wizarding world to get the stuff like a stuffed owl or something although that part sounds like a much pricier ordeal

2. they should be set up like recipe combinations like if you guess a powerful combo it will occur with that shortcut but if it ' s not a combo it just cast one spell then the next and wastes a little mp .

3. i was raised in a community that believes men should decide everything and you as a girl should just do as told , that goes for big stuff like getting a job or small things like how much makeup you wear . thank god my parents never raise me like this , but sadly , almost every one in my community believes this . even young peppers .

4. real are worse than atleti at the moment . even on paper , atleti seems stronger . real just has many players who peaked a couple seasons back like kroos , modric , marcelo , ramos and carvajal , and have become very inconsistent now . add to that permanently inconsistent players like isco , vazquez , etc . and compare them to atleti ' s squad .
