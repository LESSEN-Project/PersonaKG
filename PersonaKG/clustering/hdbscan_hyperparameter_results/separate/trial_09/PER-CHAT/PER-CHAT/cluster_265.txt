1. losing my home in a wildfire and getting back on my feet after . it has been just over a year and i still feel like i am in limbo .

3. got my left side  ribs done and it was surprisingly not that bad . it just feels like something scratching you over and over . line work is less painful than shading , in my opinion . i actually kind of like how tattoos feel but . i ' m a weirdo .

5. dang that sounds like a tricky situation . i also have a shitty sister but she ' s not on drugs . just a serial bad attitude to everything , causes dramas because that ' s what she lives for . makes life tougher than it needs to be .

6. this girl straight up told me , " if i ever have the opportunity to rape you , i will " not to sound cocky , but girls have always been attracted to me and i thought she was just trying to stand out , in some weird kind of way . i like dark humor so i befriended her . eventually i found out she wasn ' t joking as she literally tried to make opportunities . like , asking me to come stay the night and drink and do drugs even though she doesn ' t do either . she was very touchy feely .

7. i get them a fair amount a month and i just wake up and feel like i can  t move or breath and i have to imagine in my head me violently making a jerk movement and i shake out of it and wake up
   (ID: 7dfa169bdfe2df7e214baa35fc2f2b73cbb10c46)

8. i enjoyed how you became self  aware toward the end of your post . parents are just humans , figuring it out as they go along . difficult kids teach you a lot very quickly , and make conflict with docile children feel like a walk  in  the  park .

9. so the person with income can ' t just use up the other person and then abandon them with nothing whenever they feel like it .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

10. ha ! i ' m like you  i find all that stuff just massively fascinating . not sure how i ' d feel paralysed and not able to communicate , though .
   (ID: bb79791c3753a1fc8ece696b3835b0f59ddccc90)

11. they give me a reality better than my own . i get to feel like i matter . or like i ' m a badass . or hell , just plain feeling relaxed . it ' s just something for you to look at like hey , life can suck , but at least i ' m a hero to hyrule .
   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

12. for me it ' s the idea of surrendering all control to someone else and having nothing to worry about . i also like the feel of a diaper , that will seem odd to most but for those of us who do have a diaper fetish it makes perfect sense  it can be about them hugging the genitals or about the comfort you get from them . the main thing to remember is that every adult baby is different so just because one adult baby likes it not all of us will .

13. i just feel like the extremely stupid shouldn  t have children , that  s all . and for the record , you still have yet to answer one of my questions entirely , and you lied about having a masters in physics so .
   (ID: 0adc203530167f27a334f03a3d44b3c302d91f2a)

14. didn ' t feel like reading all the comments . save your money just have a shake . it has them all .
