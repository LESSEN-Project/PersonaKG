1. actually what your describing is a thing that has nothing to do with anger . " call of the void " is when you see an opportunity to do something you know to be horrible and feel a sudden urge to do it . this happens to let your mind know it has control over the situation . like standing on the edge of a cliff . the mind goes " this is scary , i could fall , i could die " so the next step is " i could kill myself , but i won ' t kill myself , so i ' m not going to die . does that make sense ? tl  dr you ' re fine , everybody feels this , it ' s a way to feel in control .

2. do what you like to do . even if you earn more  in the current position , it would be worth it to step down if you ' d enjoy it more . that would also mean less income which could make it harder to pay off loans so definitely consider the long term effect of that . if this company plans on going public let me know
