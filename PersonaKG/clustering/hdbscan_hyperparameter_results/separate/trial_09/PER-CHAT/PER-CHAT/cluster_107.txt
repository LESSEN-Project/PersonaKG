1. i talk to people every once and a while they hate me at first then get used to me and friend me out of pity . i don ' t know why they do that they could just stop talking to me if they hate me but it ' s just what happens .

2. well you can see if you items are still in your stash . you can add another option so it works that way . but you can also do it manually just gab you items and then " rightclick the courier icon to send it back to the first person " many people don ' t know you can do that dx

3. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show

4. tpms are horrible , especially in the cold . best bet is to look at the tires and if it doesn  t look flat , it  s not . it  s just a cash grab against people who don  t know how a normal tire looks

5. hey man , almost everyone will agree that no one is really paying attention to you , most of them are focusing on themselves or their phones . and the ones that look at you are looking at you because you are looking at them . i also suggest ask one of the people there to give you a nice tour , just so you know where everything is . just have fun , don  t push yourself too hard that you hate it , but also don  t be so easy that you don  t see any progress . do be aware of your surroundings , wear comfortable clothes and put your weights back and bring a towel .

6. you know , i often wonder that myself . i myself wouldn ' t fall into the hot category , but there seems to be a disproportionately large amount of young , attractive people coming into the industry . i honestly don ' t know why , but i ' ve also noticed it . plus  uniforms always make people just that little bit hotter

7. because most people know that they can just choose to ignore things that don ' t interest them . i suggest you work on that , for your own sanity .

8. i get social anxiety too sometimes when i ' m in larges groups of people when i smoke . i don ' t know of a way to counter that , but alcohol makes me much more sociable , while when i get high i ' m just chill and spaced out . try smoking alone a few times to get used to the feeling of it , and try to smoke with people you know well i would suggest .

9. what . i thought he just meant like anyone or anything it doesn  t matter what it is . i don  t know why so many people start bringing random bullshit to a random comment . it  s a hobby people have now to get offended by everything they see that might be offensive to them . i meant no hate with that comment man  shrugging

10. it was sarcasm , and the woman i was bantering with seemed to get that . i don  t know why you didn  t . as for  maybe read the news  , i know about all that and just because there are some people out there exploiting the me too movement doesn  t mean everyone  s lying . to imply differently is crass and misogynistic . we  re done here .

11. why are you so quiet ?  or  how come you  re so shy ?  i don  t really know you that well if you  re asking me that , and some people are just shy . also anxiety , but that  s not something i should bring up .
