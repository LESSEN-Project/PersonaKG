1. what the fuck ? i wonder if these kinds of people ever take a step back to question their insanity and then go ahead and do the crazy shit anyway . or if they do question themselves , what sort of stuff do they think is too crazy and don ' t follow through .

2. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .

3. because when you ' re in rome you do as the romans do . unless you ' re obviously a tourist or you don ' t speak english at all , i think it ' s really rude to go out of your way to speak in a manner people around you can ' t understand . my wife does this to me in spanish when she wants to talk about someone we see while we ' re out or whatever and it annoys me to no end .

4. i think people that use no true scotsman fallacy to distance themselves from " extremist muslims " will generally have no problem using it again with " stupid muslims " , so don ' t expect instant deconversions from people you intend to debate . still , it may help with people on the fence , go for it .

5. i ' m not the guy begging for karma tho , besides , you don ' t have to be a jerk about it , also , i think not even half the people here give a fuck about your 10k karma

6. lol . not on the topic of coltee ' s shirt , but larissa is extra annoying this episode with these cosmetic procedures . coltee ' s annoying me too . and jay and ashley . i don ' t think any of these people don ' t annoy me any more . maybe pedro .
   (ID: 85a05d28a3a638ea67074ae6793644f5f667c9f3)

7. i think a lot of people who are at that point don ' t think anybody cares to listen to them , and they have thought that for so long , that it is very hard to reach out to anybody

8. i disagree with this article . i think " thank you " and " i ' m sorry " are sometime necessary acknowledgements of the fact that someone else exists   a person who has their own thoughts and feelings and things to do . i don ' t expect my kid to feel some kind of heartfelt gratitude for me getting them a glass of milk but i do expect my actions to be acknowledged with a polite " thank you " . i ' m in favor of politeness as a social norm . by telling a kid that this is a situation requiring a polite action you help instill the fact that other people matter .

9. when you use contraception that is " terminating something living " , i . e . , millions of sperm . of course you don ' t think that those lives are important , and certainly not as important as your convenience . it ' s very easy to decide what sacrifices other people should make .
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

10. i think i  m a nice person , but i don  t let people take advantage of me nor the people i love . i become a lion if anyone hurts or is disrespectful to my loved ones
   (ID: d95d3548a9506e48c5310c85f3b2994820405e0d)

11. i think it changes for each person , which is why i don ' t think it makes sense when people talk about not " crossing the line " .
   (ID: a98df1d16d4e1204ace7856449444a3afbb80743)

12. people are less defensive when they don ' t feel attacked . true . nepene ' s above comment addresses this quite nicely . i ' m curious what you mean regarding socialism   it ' s a catchy turn of phrase , but i don ' t think i completely follow .
   (ID: 17b8a304069d7530607e28f8e04d840e28be0d3e)

13. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

14. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

15. i agree porn isn ' t the healthiest  most ethical of things . but i don ' t think anyone has ever used the pornhub app to kill a room full of people because his penis was feeling extra tiny that week . priorities .
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

16. no one is saying anything other than the footage was creepy . i don ' t understand what the deal is . are people not allowed to think it was creepy ?
   (ID: 88c35221745da41b29ff5b9f921026de5ccbb6c0)

17. i think they can be funny with context , i don  t think people are laughing directly at rape when they make those jokes . ones that are like that are very stupid .
   (ID: cae6d1fb1a818280e66de4a71148560d2d217d70)

18. its more the " it ' s ok for me to have slept with a lot of people  have sex on the first date because i ' m a guy . but if a girl does it , she ' s a slut . " that ' s a problem imo . if you ' re not being hypocritical than i don ' t think it ' s an issue . i think there is some on the reverse too  " it ' s ok for me to have slept with someone of the same gender , i ' m a woman . but if a guy does it , he ' s gay . " basically  don ' t shame someone you wouldn ' t have them shame you for .

19. not if your education sucks and youre on internet to try and make others think a big penis does the job . lmao don ' t worry , most people saying this are arrogant or uneducated .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

20. after reading a lot of mmo forums and seeing a lot of crazy things yes , i do believe he was serious . if you think people don ' t have that viewpoint , you should put aside your own bias .
