3. did you ever consider that your own habits and personality are your roadblock to those things ? if you never make an effort to better yourself or even try how can you blame the world for your blunders ? nobody is depriving you to your right to anything . companionship isnt assigned , its something that is found , love is something that is developed along with intimacy . its not just something like equality and civil rights . theres not a chance in hell you could tell me that you cant find a single woman that you cant connect at least a little bit with and work into something more intimate if you want .

10. yta generally i wouldnt reccomend buying something for other peoples super invested hobbies unless you are equally invested and understand what they would like  want . you are likely to waste money , and in this case its money both of you share through marriage . you also come across as really selfabsorbed in all your replies , refusing to accept the fact that what you did was wrong , and it came from the fact that you have very little clue about what your wife does . im sure your heart was in the right place , but your actions and words speak for themselves

11. i am already electing to not have biological kids because i don ' t want them to have to face this reality . i wouldn ' t be surprised if humans kill ourselves off in the next hundred years . " oh but did you see this adorbs cat video " facepalm

14. one morning , i just woke up and said to myself to stop feeling sorry for my life and get on with it . i am a physical and sexual abuse survivor , and everyday , i would dig myself a deeper hole to crawl in because i hated everyone , didn  t want to leave my house , wanted to sleep , and got disgusted with myself . i  m not sure what clicked in my brain , but i  m glad it did . i  m now living my life to the fullest .
