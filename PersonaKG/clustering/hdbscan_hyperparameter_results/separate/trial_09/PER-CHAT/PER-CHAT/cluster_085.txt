1. no , but next time check if you power off your phone . obviously you won ' t hear the alarm if you power off it but check before you go to sleep , i recommend if you send multiple alarms every 5mins just in case something like this happens again

2. i ' d still be able to text . but my thumbs would fly up towards the closest perspective of my eyes like they ' re in front of my face . and the letters would seem like they ' re popping up and out of the screen . so i ' d even astound myself how i type in full sentences while i ' m watching all that go down . it ' s a vicious and perpetual cycle of hallucinating . by the time i ' m down i just put my phone down and take a deep breath " glad that ' s over with "

4. there  s a sub called  entitled parents  that  s full of things like this . it is difficult to have a child with special needs . you deserve to have a nice time , just like everyone else . but , you can  t ruin everyone else  s time in the process . if your child is screaming and yelling , you have to leave . you  re not being discriminated against , no one is picking on you , you are disturbing a place with a set of rules and you have to follow those rules .

5. it ' s not about time . you just have to immerse yourself by moving to a place where the language is spoken and it will flow like a period .

6. with your husband ' s permission , you could start a blog and write about your experiences or just post here every monday and tell us about it . you could spend time researching ideas for next weekend . maybe learn to deep throat or other creative skills he might appreciate . shop for some sex toys . i like the blog idea , though .

7. thanks for explaining . i can understand employees wanting to get paid for the work they ' re doing , but that seems like a really harsh punishment for just a minute or two of time .

8. the title would probably be called , " slice of light . " the plot o my movie would probably just be the story of my life , focusing on minor issues with my life like failing a test . i would probably be narrating over different parts of the story , similar to tfs ' story of trunks . it would probably have some parts very brief , the parts that i dont remember very well , and the vivid memories would be very detailed and exaggerated . an example of this would be when my parents told me that we were bnb going to move . it would end with the present  me on winter break with my family , in the eighth grade .

10. tracing words repetitively . if i get a series of words that sticks in my brain wether i am having a conversation or watching tv  i trace the words on my right leg , and can do it for hours just impulsively . it honestly feels so stupid when you see a mazda commercial and get the tag line ' zoom zoom ' stuck in your head for a period of time and you ' re just like , why ? it ' s funny , and since it ' s one of my harmless rituals i have , it ' s not a big deal in my everyday life lol .
