1. thanks for the links ! i will give it a good look .  157k is less than 773k or 249k digit your sample size is not exhaustive anyway . this is google scholar buddy . digit 157k mentions are a lot of mentions . you can also go for a more qualitative approach , and enter a library ' s medieval section . tell me what you find ! digit whoever mentions " byzantium " likely mentions " ere " too , for example . these numbers are interwoven .  you consider it to be popular it is , though you don ' t seem to know much about the subject matter to be so surprised with term . unless you don ' t speak english as your first language ? i know that in my mother languante we don ' t commonly " byzantium " nor " byzantine " . but in english it ' s commonplace . you know what , maybe you should go to askhistorians after all .

2. i bet they will sit very far inside of your fenders and may rub your front struts . sn95 digit  digit offset sits further out than s197 digit  digit and i don ' t know what the s550 offset is but i would have to assume it ' s more similar to s197 than sn95 .

4. it ' s is a repeating pattern but the picture doesn ' t show enough of the chair to see if it repeats more and i honestly don ' t know if i have the patience to do more than glance over . . digit . i see this in two different places " digit " is the patter distinct enough for me to spot easily .
