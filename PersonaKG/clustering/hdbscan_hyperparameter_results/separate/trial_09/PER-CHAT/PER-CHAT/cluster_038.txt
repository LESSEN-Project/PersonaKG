1. i lived there as a kid  looking at this meadow , i ' m like , " i think i ' ve actually been there ! "  then i get sad because i never appreciated being there as a kid  now that i ' m grown , i can ' t just pick up  move back .

2. yeah i agree with you ! i think we  ve just become so used to saying it , but not actually feeling it . especially when it  s like someone that maybe you  ve had a crush on and then they get in to a new relationship and you tell them you  re happy for them , but you  re actually a little hurt .

3. i ' ve heard flight control makes fun of you , i think it ' s funny as hell . like the guy said , it ' s not a bad thing , just a preference and a sacrifice of an internal .

4. you ' ve completely missed the point . no one is asking you to like the song . i ' m just wondering what you gain by bashing something on reddit . i ' m not a fan of the song either , but this thread is entirely pointless . are you hoping eminem fans will read this and think ' holy shit . that guy is right . i should throw away my slim shady c . d . s ' ? or are you just looking to get attention ? grow up . go listen to music you like .

5. apparently " triggered my trap card " comes from the yu  gi  oh show thing that was popular back in middle school that means , from what i understand , is that the other person is getting " owned " because they set off a reaction of events that works against themselves . so i dont really understand this statement as i ' ve never watched yu  gi  oh but how i interpret the ops statement is that " if you sleep with a girl that used to be a guy then you ' ve given them the upper hand and got owned by them by validating their femininity " . or something like that . i ' m not saying i agree with them , i ' m just saying i think thats what they mean .

6. i ' ve never heard anything like that when it comes to innuendos . i think the person is just speaking nonsense . that ' s something i would do if i liked someone when i was younger . it ' s a lame attempt at flirting and the person probably gets enjoyment out of your confusion .
