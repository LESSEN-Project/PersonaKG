1. losing partial  full control of myself is a scary concept that i don  t think is just limited to me . you do you tho
   (ID: 8ea8e4a00c3f2a64096e00bdbba0247e580cdb17)

2. to me , a hobby is doing something you like and makes you happy . what others think of it is irrelevant  unless it happens to be illegal . gaming isn ' t my thing , but if you enjoy it , great ! just don ' t let it or anything else run  ruin your life .

3. how are you expected to play knowing that you got traded ? i don  t think it has to do with deliberately underperforming and more to do with just being generally out of it .

4. i didn  t find relief with omep  i didn  t find relief for the occasional heartburn but have the shortness of breath under control with zyrtec and singulair . which would make you think its just allergies . but i have every other symptom of lpr , and if i don  t watch what i eat the shortness of breath comes back . so it  s been a combo of avoiding my personal triggers and these meds are helping for sure

5. yes it would be , he already feels lonely for not having a girlfriend . what do you think his friends leaving will do to him ? you might just push him to complete loneliness and sadness . i too have never had a girlfriend and my friends are my emotional support so i feel him . he needs you guys please don ' t leave

6. there is the other side to this . which is there used to be no other problems but the db is such a big problem that they don ' t think about the rest of it . when your so says , i love you i am sure your automatic response is , i love you too . but do you , have you actually thought about it or are you just saying it out of habit .
   (ID: 3b45915d58b20f0e2abb6b26d4534980a5d3aa68)

7. so what if they actually don ' t like you ? does that make you worth any less as a person ? i don ' t think so . opinions are not real and this is why  if some stranger walked up to you and said  " you are such a shoelace " you ' d probably be indifferent and you wouldn ' t care that much because it just doesn ' t make sense , right ? so if you swap the word " shoelace " for " asshole " and you swap the word " stranger " with " friend " does that make any difference ? probably not because it ' s just a word . you are not obnoxious . somebody may think you are while somebody else thinks you ' re not . you may even be your own worst enemy because you call yourself obnoxious ! it ' s just in your head though , don ' t believe the demon that exists inside there solely to give you a hard time . it ' s not real .

8. i don  t think they are ugly , i just think it  s interesting to see something marked on someone and think what was the motive behind the tattoo and what  s the story .
   (ID: c5e877ff3be5d3571f5fe899f55887a6f608ee98)

9. i think as a canadian this reflects how i feel accurately . it ' s not that i don ' t like america or americans , or that their ideals aren ' t the closest to ours . but if there is truly a superpower that is a threat to world peace , it is without a doubt america . i think just what transpired over the past year there , shows me that at some point an american civil war is a way greater threat to world peace than anything china or russia could do .

10. it ' s clear that azan is her priority . i don ' t think you ' re too uptight . nickle is a horrible excuse for a mother . i mean she has her daughter calling azan " daddy " , and that ' s just the start of all her issues . i ' m sure nickle loves may , but she neglects her and uses her as a bargaining chip , and i won ' t even start with the " daddy " thing . smh .

11. i mean he has a point  when kids are crying and stuff to their parents because they didn ' t make the playoffs they are being kinda spoiled . i just don ' t think that it is rooted directly from getting an end of the year trophy . there are probably other parenting issues there .
   (ID: 89c3606d2dfc5d2a2da97fb49ddc1894f8bf330f)

12. not a jab at you op . i just don  t think it  s a fat shaming movie . more anti  costco  amazon  lazy  consumerism  idiocracy
   (ID: dd0e84182036131d3b7cbc9bcb07384502b3c1a8)

13. i think more characters should of died . as an example i don ' t think nagato should have been able to resurrect everyone after his attack maybe like kakashi but shizune , ebisu , ibiki , they could just stay dead to me .
   (ID: 76b9606d2d21bcdc24810e0215e37a6a9d45b771)

14. god , i make this game sound dry , don ' t i ? i just mean that it takes a certain type of person to enjoy it and i would hate for you to find out that you don ' t like it . most of us , obviously , think the game is amazing .
   (ID: 05ea8ab3980e7e9b17e008954c8e6b0d7355612a)

15. i should have written my comment more carefully . that ' s not what i meant at all . i don ' t think my point came across . i hate microtransactions just as much as anyone else . and i ' m sure game devs do too . my point is game designers don ' t deserve to be harassed on social media when it ' s the suits at the top who make these business decisions . game designers are employees just like anyone else and it ' s not their fault that the game has microtransactions .
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

16. i understand . i  m just not much of a lebron fan , so it  s hard for me . also don  t think he  s even close to the goat . best of this era ? sure .
   (ID: f90b0d899acf3c82adaa55fb250d0c7ea9eaeaf3)

17. for me a coincidence is the just that . a coincidence . i personally don ' t think they mean anything although they can be kinda neat .
   (ID: 3eef66654202ad187ad73806fb9c9788d0119cbf)

18. i guess i just don ' t see where this is going ? i don ' t think a single person has agreed with you . maybe you should try it and post your results .
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

19. so just because you disagree with it , you think it should be okay to censor it ? don ' t you see how slippery of a slope this is ?
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)

20. i don ' t think others are wrong , per se , mine just works for me . the whole " faith " thing .
