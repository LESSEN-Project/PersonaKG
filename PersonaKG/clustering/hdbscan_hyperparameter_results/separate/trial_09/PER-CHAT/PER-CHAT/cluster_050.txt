1. ugh , thank you so much . i feel like it ' s all out of my control , and if i think about it too hard , i start believing all the lies the anxiety and depression start to manifest . thank you so much for making me feel better . i know it ' s all gonna be okay , but anxiety makes it so hard to remember that .

2. btw , do you know any animes like nhk ? i mean , not necessarily it should be about hikikomori , but with similar psychological context that makes you think " wtf am i doing with my life " or something like that .  .

4. i didn ' t know about the ice cap thing you mentioned , but i feel like governments should do what they can to try to minimize it , i think that we should work towards developing a way to harness fusion power and attempt to proliferate that around the world and that would solve nearly all of our energy problems and it wouldn ' t polute

5. i drew this in about an hour . i drew a background as well , but didn  t shade it in or bold the lines because i didn  t know if i would even like the finished product . what do you think of it so far ?

6. first off , i like the thinking behind this and it was really well thought out . however i think i  d have to disagree with this . i feel like euphoria is trying to be as original as it can . they make it like no other show that i know of , and i feel like they are creating their own plot . but if this is some version of romeo and juliet , i wouldn  t necessarily be mad about itexcept for the fact that fez would die plz no .

7. i sincerely hope it works . i know everyone has their things they have to deal with . sometimes having someone there makes it easier . if it was me , i  d like to think someone would take a chance .

10. interesting . but i think the ' exposing to everyone ' sounds like kind of a mean threat that would cause more drama . but i wouldn ' t know .
