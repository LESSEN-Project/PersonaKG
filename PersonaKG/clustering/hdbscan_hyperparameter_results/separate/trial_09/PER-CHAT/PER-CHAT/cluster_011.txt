1. but reincarnation is a supernatural occurrence that ' s only based in religion . the closest to what you are describing is jainism . it ' s still a religion though . i ' m just busting your chops though . all great fictional stories use selective liberties with facts . don ' t let my nitpicking screw with your story ideas . if all authors did that nothing would get written .
