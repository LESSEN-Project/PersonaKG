   (ID: 2266c34274940e2ea1a22a3dee5a3cbcdad25f53)

19. the most common entry points are  gaunt  s ghosts  follows a company of imperial army soldiers led by comissar gaunt . good for a perspective of the regular soldier in this grimdark setting eisenhorn trilogy  follows inquisitor eisenhorn and is a good source to understand how the imperium works space wolf omnibus  follows the process of recruitment  training  creation of a space marine . the main character knows almost nothing of the galaxy , so he and the reader learn together horus heresy where i started  it actually is warhammer 30k , with it  s story being about the imperium civil war and the rise of chaos across the galaxy . self contained and explains why things are so bad in 40k . the only problem is that it  s a huge series with over digit books though not all are necessary reading . yet i absolutely encourage you to read  em all
   (ID: 127d601df381c9f971eae1e3fd42953571015813)

20. yeah you ' re good . if it ' s hitting high 80s use some software like afterburner to set a limit on it . you should be fine though .
