2. i don  t think they are ugly , i just think it  s interesting to see something marked on someone and think what was the motive behind the tattoo and what  s the story .

3. how are you expected to play knowing that you got traded ? i don  t think it has to do with deliberately underperforming and more to do with just being generally out of it .

5. what is their to argue about ? it  s pretty opinion based . i don  t think any scientific arguments will change someone  s perspective who truly believes it is murder

6. i don ' t care if you have black friends . i think it ' s wrong to only care how a person looks and not take anything else into account .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

7. i honestly don ' t think he needs any rework , if you are looking for a counter , hold still during the duration of his drone . it ' s that simple . if you get rushed and have to move then that was probably the point of the activation of the done .

8. speaking spanish in public so no one knows what i ' m saying is so fun . i do this in the mostly white neighborhoods i go to . i don ' t think everyone likes it tho lol

10. i don ' t think the average gamer could even survive a week in the woods , let alone survive not being corrupted by the marker , or killed my necros
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

   (ID: 1cedb012c7702cdd6cf28839fd31ce2bb1eea04c)

13. i used meditation about a year ago to help cope with stress and my night terrors , i stopped over the summer , and now that classes have started up again , my night terrors have come with them . i don ' t think meditation is bullshit , but i can understand why you would .

14. you don ' t . you just think you do .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

15. the lyrics are literally " this one ' s a contradiction because of how happy it sounds , but the lyrics are so down " i don ' t think it counts , it ' s too obvious . some other twenty one pilots songs would probably fit better .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

16. so just because you disagree with it , you think it should be okay to censor it ? don ' t you see how slippery of a slope this is ?
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)

18. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

19. i don ' t think that is laughter . it is probably saying " get your friggin ' grubby man hands off my body "
   (ID: 60767c0b3f4fbb31bad0bee921528b0976287f68)

20. i don ' t think there is any " one " for us . i think there are many potential people for all of us . if we just spend our lives bettering ourselves , being alert yet patient , we will find happiness . in ourselves and in someone else , if we so desire . all will work out . red  heart my two cents .
