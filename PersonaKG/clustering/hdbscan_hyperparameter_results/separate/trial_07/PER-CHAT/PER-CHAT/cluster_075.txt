1. there ' s someone for everyone  they ' re out they ' re waiting you and all other shitty variations to give people false hope . to me it ' s better to think " if it happens , it happens "
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

2. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .

4. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .

   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

7. i think most people miss the problem with her name . the problem is stupid parents naming kids stupid names . that is the real problem .
   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

8. it honestly not that . i think it  s smugness coming from people who think they are more important than they are .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

9. or it ' s a bullshit made up story , hoping that they will be one of the first to receive it . reminds me if some guy who demanded to receive his kickstarter shit faster than other people because of some condition . think it was shiftware .
   (ID: b25bdf3935142c93d642393810cba283ec3b801f)

10. i agree . do you think it ' s white people ' s fault that the number of black people in these fields is so small , like a lot of people think ?
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

11. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

12. pescatarian i think is the term people use .
   (ID: 40a3b3e3ead468881f7392ff22e867f06207755d)

13. i think that people shouldn  t have to lie about their beliefs . i think their religious beliefs shouldn  t be mentioned at all
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

14. i think it ' s perfectly fine to call people out on their shitty spelling and grammar . now everyone knows what our opinions are . hooray !
   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

15. people often hide names in screenshots , i think it is  was against the rules to include them .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

16. it ' s insane that people think we all came from two people .
