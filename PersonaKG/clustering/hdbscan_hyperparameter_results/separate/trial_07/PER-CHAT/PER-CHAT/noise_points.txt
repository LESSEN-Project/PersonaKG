1. i did address this point specifically , i specified that  at least to me  a power gamer is somebody who ' s game revolves around making the most powerful build , and sure , some of them are ok , but often times i just find their personality to be garbage . i addressed this as well , my argument was  why do you need to make everything difficult ? what advantage in storytelling is there to make those random goblins incredibly dangerous ? if every encounter is dangerous , even the homeless bum you were just trying to mug for rp purposes , then things become incredibly unrealistic and immersion  breaking . i had that experience before in a game of werewolf  the apocalypse , our ragabash tried to scam a bunch of homeless dudes and for no reason at all they ended up being vietnam vets who stomped her into the ground . it felt so bullshit and unfair to just artificially inflate the combat . should the little old granny secretly be a level digit wizard so when the pcs try to steal her , she casts fireball on them ? and as an additional point , every combat should be there to facilitate a story , if it doesn ' t do that , it doesn ' t belong . the point of combat should be that by doing this combat , the party has chosen the route by which they will progress the story , it doesn ' t need artificial difficulty to it .

2. if that was my sister i would do the good old " listen here you little shit . " talk . i broke many people ' s bubbles this way . i would tell her off , break everything into her face about how embarassing she actually is . you do everything she says and ignore her tantrums , try to not accidentally push her buttons etc and expect change . it ' s not happening and you ' re giving her more control over you . iron fist for people like your sister !

4. why ? because all men must be manly ? again , it  s because you don  t like it that it is a problem . not a problem for the guy wearing the make up because he likes it . also , i don  t count restaurant staff as role models for my children . i am their role model , and i will explain to them time and time again that people can express who they are , even if we don  t find it  normal  or  cool  .

5. i say go for it ! change is good , and for your situation and everything you described moving is definitely going to be good for you . you don  t want to keep thinking about doing it for years and regret not going sooner .

6. you can ' t really do anything . she has got to help herself . you can report her to your ra if you think she is a danger to herself , otherwise there isn ' t much you can do .

8. in my teens i wasn  t very sensitive to the subject . definitely use derogatory words and definitely wasn  t befriending anyone who was openly gay . but then i moved to ann arbor to work at my aunts bar and the very first two friends i made where gay but i didn  t know for like a month . that really opened my eyes . these two are amazing people , and after talking to them i couldn  t believe all the hate they have to face day in and day out . and i used to be apart of that . i can  t believe i used to think and act like that to another human just because of one difference . i will never use homophobic terms again and i pray that everyone in our society regardless of sexuality will receive the respect and happiness they deserve . i will always stand up for love for the rest of my life

9. it ' s hard for me to say , i ' ve seen fucked up shit and that ' s shaped me to the person i am today to some degree , but i don ' t know if i want my kids to see the same kind of stuff , but at the same time i don ' t exactly want to censor what they can and can ' t see , i suppose the most i would want to do is make sure they get whatever they need to get done first before they get on screens and if i catch them looking at something i might have been looking at i ' ll explain to them what it is and that i don ' t think they should be looking at it but they ' re their own person and can decide what they do and don ' t want to look at

11. well when you tell a group of people somethings not for them publicly i wouldn  t exactly be surprised when they don  t go see your movie . it  s not hate for the character or movie , it  s poor decisions to bring personal political stances to marketing your film .
