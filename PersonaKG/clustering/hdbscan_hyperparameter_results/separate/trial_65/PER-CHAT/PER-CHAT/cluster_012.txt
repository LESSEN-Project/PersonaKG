1. as much as this would be great , it  s still a lot of money . as if we already don  t get robbed every paycheck anyways yknow ? granted there are things our taxes go to that , aren  t really beneficial . but it  d be a rough time i think . what about you ?

2. maybe a local charity would help the most . for example , you could set up a charity to pay for girls to go to college who couldn ' t afford it . it could inspire others to do the same in their towns .

3. tax cuts should be used as a reward for the ' job creators ' who do their fucking job . i don ' t see any around these days .

4. you know what would happen you said to all of the billionaires " hey big bank account boys i ' m going to need to you to hand over everything you have so that overall you ' re only able to be worth digit million dollars " they would say " alright let me just get that to you right after i move all of my assets to another country that ' s not going to steal my money and possessions that i earned , oh wait a minute now that i have my assets and myself out of the country you cant tax me and you ' re now losing millions in tax revenue "

5. i know you ' re going to get downvoted and are using hyperbole , but that may not be bad for them . not a " forced labor " kind of thing , but something designed to show them the value of work . maybe they could help build a park or something like that .

6. yeah i ' m with you . it ' s hard to imagine that ' s what bernie ' d do with it . i guess if i can trust him to be president i can trust him to do the right thing with a few thousand bucks or whatever though .

7. hypothetically . would you really need to launder it if there  s not more  illegal  money coming in ? cause you  d have to use some of it for a front to actually launder it . but why not just keep it in cash ?

8. more like nothing will come of it even if they doanything . what can a poor person actually do ? i struggle to buy ramen noodles . you think any politican is gonna listen to me compared to the poeple bribing them ? no amount of angry phone calls will do shit . what am i supposed to do walk to washington and picket infront of the white house ? that will also solve nothing . the people in power get to make all the choices . we can vote , and i do , but that obviously does nothing in the long run when things are this bad . digit . digit percent just apathetic my ass .

9. it depends on the charity  some pocket the money for themselves which is why the founders of a lot of them are millionaires . but if it ' s actually going towards a good cause , i don ' t see why not . i ' d probably choose to feed and  or vaccinate children .

10. well , you didn ' t add a " serious " tag , but i ' ll give you a serious answer anyway . i ' ve done a fair amount of research on this . all adults   the ones with the money   hate school fundraisers . the idea that gives you the absolutely best return is this  you send a note home at the beginning of the year explaining that you know everyone hates school fundraisers , and you are therefore going to dispense with that nonsense and instead request " direct giving " include an envelope . ask parents to donate the amount of money they would otherwise be wasting on wrapping paper , cookie dough , and other crap they only buy to placate their children . you will end up with substantially more money than if you actually sold the wrapping paper or cookie dough . if you ' re dead set on holding a fundraiser , try the " original art " one . find a company that prints original art on random things mousepads , t  shirts , coffee mugs and does school fundraisers . they will provide your school with all the materials . each kid draws a picture and then goes around to family  friends and tries to get them to buy a mousepad  t  shirt  coffee cup featuring their original art . it ' s still a terrible idea , but at least you get something your kid made instead of some awful cookie dough .

11. no , not just free stuff . you want to force the wealthy to work for free for you .
