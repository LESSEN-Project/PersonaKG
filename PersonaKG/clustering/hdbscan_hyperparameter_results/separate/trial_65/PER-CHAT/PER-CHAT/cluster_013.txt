1. teacher is alive but shaken up . would have thought the police should have been involved earlier rather than a slap on the wrist by the school . seems very serious to me .

2. don ' t think that ' s the case . this mentions nothing about an injury here , just the marine ' s takedown and then how he was restrained . the robber was put in handcuffs , with no mention of needing medical attention .

3. it ' s not ok , and yet men being violent to women because they do things like ask to be spoken to respectfully or decline to have sexual intercourse with a man is so common that pretty much every woman can tell you about a time it happened to her , it ' s often dismissed with " boys will be boys " or " she was asking for it . violence isn ' t ok , but when women are violent to men , it ' s usually to protect themselves and when men are violent to women it ' s so often because men have been taught that they aren ' t supposed to control themselves . like i said , every time i ' ve seen a girl kick a guy in the nuts , the guy was being a shit . meanwhile , every time i ' ve seen a guy physically assault a girl , it was because the guy was a violent asshole who didn ' t like being told " no " so , until we come to a time when every single man has a story about being kicked in the nuts by a girl for no reason while very few women are every assaulted , it ' s a meaningless equivalency . guys being kicked in the nuts for no good reason simply isn ' t the epidemic that girls getting assault for no good reason is . if you ' re getting kicked in the nuts that often , you should consider that either you ' re behavior is awful or your friends are , and make changes accordingly .

4. yeah , he had a digit revolver i think , and a shotgun . police also found bombs in the area . people said this kid got bullied quite often and even by the coaches so he did it out of anger . the shooter also said he didn  t shoot anyone he liked .

5. holy fuck me ! that ' s awful , i feel bad for your uncle ' s friend . , that ' s why i feel so bad for truckers , people are assholes because they think they are faster and can get away . what they forget is that the trucks are way bigger and will crush them like a bug , how did your he handle it after ? i can ' t imagine even though in a way the guy deserved it for being an ass , it still had to affect the driver . edit  spelling

7. lol ! but seriously , it ' s ok for people to talk about thing in hindsight , but if you are in a situation like that and feel threatened and are concerned for your families safety then calling ti an over reaction is slightly wrong . i mean , an over reaction would be to keep going right ? one hit and she was down , he didn ' t start stomping on her like so sort of berserker . that would have been an over reaction . he pushed her way after she pushed him to show that they shouldn ' t mess with him . she started to advance on him , in his mind he is surrounded by a bunch of teens who will most likely fallow her lead . one punch in self defence and in defence of his family . situation deescalated . obviously one punch could have killed the girl . but she and her pack of friends were the aggressor . should he just man up and let them feast on his bloody corpse while his family run for shelter ?   x200b
