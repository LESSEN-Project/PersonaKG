SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 6

1. we are particularly good listeners by nature so that ' s why people tend to dump their problems on us . also , i feel we tend to understand and put ourselves in their position thus being able to say what we might do to help improve the situation . personally speaking , if a friend asks me how i ' m doing i just say i ' m fine since i feel my problems are mine and i don ' t like unwanted advice . so , if i were you i ' d learn how to tune out when people start wittering on about their problems or make yourself unavailable for a while . hope it gets better for you .

2. i talk to people every once and a while they hate me at first then get used to me and friend me out of pity . i don ' t know why they do that they could just stop talking to me if they hate me but it ' s just what happens .
