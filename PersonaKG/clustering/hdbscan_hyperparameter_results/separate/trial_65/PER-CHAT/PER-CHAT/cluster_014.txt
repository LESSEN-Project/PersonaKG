1. i  m not clicking the link because it  s digit  digit and i genuinely don  t won  t to entertain the thought if it is real . but i fail how it seems to relate to redistribution of wealth ? are you equating this with the koke brothers sitting on billions while there are homeless people in new york ? i fail to see the link you  ve made

2. anonymous has to be a troll . there ' s no fucking way anyone can post that seriously .
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

3. a brief look and i am guessing it is real . i can ' t take any more than a brief look as my liver is already in open rebellion and i think exposure to that site would probably prompt a few more organs to join it .

4. oh riiiiiight . i forgot that we are in a time where black people getting shot for no good reason but needing help or being not white is hilarious .

5. what kind of world do we live in when white people cannot drive through these types of neighborhoods without being victoms of police profiling .

6. do you have any evidence that the murder was ordered by the dnc ? why does one get the benefit of the doubt and not the other ? because one fits your political narrative of harming your opponents . and the other doesn ' t .

7. wait . is this real ? i ' m not on about the trump thing
   (ID: 420a86ecfb9d645349db591746d0cdeba4b68f37)

8. see now you are just trying to bait me into political arguments . i ' m not biting . i will not be commenting on comparisons to school shooters , real  world terrorism , etc . it is insensitive and unfair downplay the severity of these actions so much that you can compare them to a tv series . these are real lives being effected not just characters on a show .

9. more like there are too many fucktards on twitter who are dumb enough to fall for 4chan trickery . do people not use snopes any more ?

10. what world do you live in ? doesn ' t matter what the facts are . reality will become whatever narrative the media wants . if he is a lone wolf muslim terrorist who swore loyalty to isis before he died , that ' s what he is . period . it ' s a conspiracy theory to think differently than what the media tells you the facts are .

11. or , this will blow your fucking mind , the guy drove away in a panic because there was gasps a shooting ? also my point still stands about them assuming the hate crime , what if it was a muslim and they assumed it was isis ?

12. it probably is fake . there  s thousands of people on this app . he  s claiming something that is pretty extraordinary . if e can  t provide even a piece of evidence or a hint then i won  t give him the benefit of the doubt . that  s just me though

13. what  s the crime , 4chan could prove he  s innocent , they did solve a killing after all

14. it ' s cnn . i ' m not sure i trust it but i hope it ' s not real .
