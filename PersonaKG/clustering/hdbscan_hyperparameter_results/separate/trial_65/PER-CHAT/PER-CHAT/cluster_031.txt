1. interesting take . don ' t have cls . running the squad with thrawn currently . i ' m assuming the removal of thrawn and r2 and the addition of hy and ezra will benefit the overall synergy . you don ' t really need too many damage dealers as dn removes two per battle anyways . it ' s digit v digit basically and gk never dies when i play ai .

2. the thing is , phoenix aren ' t meta . they just help a lot early in the game as their tags allow you to unlock ep , thrawn and chimaera . it saves you time and makes you pretty competitive early on in arena .

3. put the good deathrattle minion in your deck i found the problem in the good word . there are no really good deathrattle minions right now .

4. this is how my b  w knights deck started . i needed a lower power deck for when i end up in those awkward super  casual pods . it ' s been interesting to have to tell myself ' no ' when i come across cards that would be great it in it . that ' s a whole new realm and i ' m sometimes proud of my restraint .

5. i hate using it . the snipers are going to be really hard when i  m going for dark matter .

6. this turn one is auto concede from odd rogue since the only aoe they really have is fan of knives . then for the late game i run two doomguards , two digit mana digit  7s and leeroy to finish it out . i ' ve found it to be one of the stronger aggro decks but there are a lot of digit or digit card combos . all i did was throw digit digit mana heal boi and digit ghouls into regular zoo .

7. none are droid leaders . and to throw jawas in there like it  s a solution is laughable . i get what you saying though but all of those choices barring the laughable jawas and my man lobot are better with their actual factions .

8. our ranger may be the most op character in our group at the moment . not sure why everyone says they suck

9. these all look really nice and could make some non meta characters viable . maybe i ' m not really too versed on how good these upgrades are

10. chi brew is better for single target  with serenity , and eventually when you get digit  set and a higher ilvl and class trinket let ' s say average digit  you ' ll want to run chi explosion  ascension for multi and single , as it just gets easier to manage with very little difference in dps . i might be wrong about the last bit as its been a while since i ' ve gone and played ww , mostly brm at the moment . the most important thing to remember is that this is a game , and   you have to play it my way or not at all   personal preference takes precedence over min  maxing unless you prefer to min  max and like doing as well as you possibly can .

11. i think the strongest card you have is beelze , if you wanted to build a twilight deck around him you could pick up some lightsworn cards in conjunction with plague spreader zombie . maybe google " twilight deck " for some ideas .

12. shadow assault is unquestionably the least desirable . it ' s not a ' bad ' , heroic in reality , vp is just fantastic . most of the other less than desirable heroics i can think of niche use for , but that ' s the most difficult one . the other two that come to mind are rain of chaos which is decent for zoning during a push , and mind control can be used for picks in some cases . i wouldn ' t recommend picking them most of the time , but you can come up with situations where they are pretty decent . abby ' s construct blanking out on the name , is good and bad in so far that if not stopped it can do a lot of damage . it limits his team  fight potential though , so unless your team can compensate in some other ways it can be difficult to use properly . it has high potential though , and under the right circumstances is arguably superior .

13. balancedsuperpowers i like it more than godteirsuperpowers or shittysuperpowers because it provides a bit more of a dilemma i would like to go through there and kinda debate with my friends if you would want that superpower downside combo

14. not an answer but atlas is not that good maybe just the puch , just team up and go farm him . i ' d suggest look in recruit for casuals every now and then to get it eventually . so you

15. ultra necrozma malamar is probably more consistent than this . you have way too much going on . i also don ' t see why you run ditto since you don ' t run metang . also you need digit ultra balls

16. is there a particular reason you dont want baze ? i feel like it ' s the same with wiggs  if you have one , you might as well get the set .

17. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .
