--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 319

1. definitely say something . call her , though . tone can be kind of difficult to determine through text and you don ' t need want to give her any more reasons to push you away even more . " hey , insert sister name . how you doing , casual chatting , blah blah blah . i need to talk to you about something . i feel insert everything you just told us . i know it ' s your wedding and you can do whatever you want , but i ' m starting to think that you don ' t even want me there . if not , that ' s fine bc you ' re kind of being a bitch and i could do without all the cross country trips . if you genuinely want me to be a part of the wedding , then act like it and maybe ease up a little bit " . feel free to modify to your liking .

2. he is trying to pimp you out . i suggest you tell him that his friend can ' t come over anymore . you need to put your foot down because if you don ' t , your going to be sleeping with all of his buddies and whomever else .

3. agree  don  t change yourself , but do open yourself up to make small talk with people throughout the day . grocery store , gym , anywhere you  re around people . good luck op ! don  t rush it !

4. sounds to me like you ' ve been screwed over a lot and are making the best of your situation . sure , the person you live with is your mom but you ' re paying your share . you ' ve got a roommate you just happen to be related to . you ' re doing what you have to do to take care of your kid , no shame in it .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

5. you need to be assertive about this . the template for an assertive statement is " i feel  when you do   , and i wish you would    " in this situation you could say " i feel sad or maybe uncherished , neglected , abandoned , or lonely ? when you don ' t get to know my family , and i would like you to come to thanksgiving dinner and talk to them " please learn this and use it . it must be said calmly and conversationally without expectation of changing his behavior . you are clearly stating your emotions and the behaviour of your ideal mate . if he still refuses to change his behavior , then you should decide if you can visit your family without him for the rest of your life .

6. esh leaning on nta provided you used protection . anyway you can send him a message and tell him whatever you want if you think it  ll make you feel better but i doubt it  ll have any affect on his behaviour what so ever .
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

7. your relationship sounds absolutely awful and i have no idea why you ' re still in it .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

8. i definitely understand that . i felt the same way for a long time . then i realized that i shouldn ' t change my life because of what someone else might think , especially since i was not intentionally doing anything to anyone . it ' s a tough thing to deal with but i hope you can come to terms with it before i did . it took me way too long .

9. no man , it  s easier done . make your intentions known , if she  s not feeling you , move on . they  re are too many amazing women to be sweating one that might not even be interested in you .

10. usually i hate when someone goes through other peoples phones , but when you have that gut feeling you have every right to do it . unfortunately for you , you found something very bad . she blows you off all the time and yet has great convos with other men ? pictures ? compliments ? seems to me this is very much cheating . run .
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

11. i believe meeting people isn ' t hard , but bonding is . so best advice is to genuinely be happy before you meet someone . listen to music that makes you feel good . this isn ' t necessarily your favourite music , just something chill . for me what a wonderful world by sam cooke works .
   (ID: 4a03851d25b2526583af78261bff2af13796094e)

12. i do not lack the needed intelligence . i know i could lose some weight im not obese but just close to overweight with a bmi of about digit . digit . i don ' t really want to be appreciated or liked for having a good physique or expensive clothes but for who i am . unfortunately my generation grew up to be materialistic . i feel like even if i do shit to grow my self worth and confidence i just try to conform to society which kind of makes me angry inside . it seems it is more important how you look like then who you are nowadays and it is igniting some kind of fury in my mind . i understand being fat for example is unhealthy but even then , why wouldn ' t any one be able to love you for who you are .

13. if i were to stay with her , i would try my best to give her attention back and be the best boyfriend i could be . that  s not how i could see myself as an asshole . the way i could , would be me losing my patience and leaving in two months .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

14. most guys just go for it . if your super uneasy you can ask her first . i ' ve been asked before , it ' s not a total killer either . don ' t worry if it ' s not perfect !
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

15. honestly the best thing for you to do is to tell your boyfriend straight up the entire situation . i don  t think the relationship will last sadly after that because he is straight and he can  t force himself to be attracted to you afterwards , but for your own personal happiness and mental health you need it tell him and transition . but who knows he might still retain attraction to you afterwards , it is a possibility . i know how bad dysphoria can be , my partner is trans and i  ve been with them before and after their transition and they  re much happier now than they were before . i hope you too can remain friends since all that would happen is that he loses attraction . best of luck to you , be brave and you can make it through . i hope all goes well red  heart

16. did you ever talk about it ? with someone close or a professional ? i mean i was in an abusive relation once , took me a couple of years to get over the most troublesome aspects mostly because i acted like i was ok . but i ' m in a happy relation now . i ' ve just been really open about it with my partner and she knows that there are things that trigger me . she tries to help me with it . it ' s nice to have a partner .
   (ID: 5bb6e2d4db1d5ccf3a1f430564735551dfb4c28b)

17. seems like he has a lot of baggage going on . he ' s sexuality interested in other people and is likely cheating , or going to cheat outside of the rules . if you have rules like you do , you shouldn ' t be together . it ' s gonna get ugly if you stay .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

18. dont worry i gotchu fam , see im digit myself and i have a gf who likes to show off skin obviously not nude . anyways if it was a real concern id explain to her one last time that if makes you uncomfortable seeing another guy is getting pictures of her with only a towel on . if shes sending you spicer pics then id see this as less of a concern anyways if this still continues ask for her friends what they think try to get them on your side and from there just ask them to help you convince her to stop . if this still doesnt do anything ask for an ultimatum this is a last resort . ultimatums work digit  of time because it makes the other feel trapped and stuck with an a question thatll change the course of the relationship . if the ultimatum succeeds be extremely nice to the other person otherwise theyll think they made the wrong decision . if otherwise then there are plenty of fish in the sea . let me know what you end up doung because im actually interested

19. well i always walk into a room with my head held high and with purpose so i start off looking like i belong  have confidence . really watch how you present yourself , use your body language to exude confidence . one thing i try to do but is so hard is to make eye contact when speaking with others . when interacting with people , i try to stand still and not fidget with random shit like my hair , phone or whatever because that comes across as being anxious . one thing i do which isn  t the greatest is i act cocky and borderline conceded . it makes me feel better and people who know me know that i  m not being serious . but sometimes you really do start becoming this person you  re channeling .

20. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .
