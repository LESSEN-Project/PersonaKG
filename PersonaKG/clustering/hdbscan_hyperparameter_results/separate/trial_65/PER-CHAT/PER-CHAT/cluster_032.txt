Total from this dataset: 8

1. after personally experiencing dmt , i am very convinced that there is an afterlife . when you are at this place , you have memories of before you were a human . try to take back those memories with you is like forgetting a dream .

2. honestly , i don ' t know . i ' m agnostic myself so i believe that there ' s just no way we can be sure of anything one way or the other . i wish i could suspend my sense of reality enough to fully believe in a heaven . i would seriously love to just know for sure i was going to see my grandma again one day .

4. you get to be a ghost for a while , then its lights out . but i only believe this because i find it comforting to believe there ' s something non  permanent after death .

5. it ' s the same as life . once you accept that you ' ll die someday it ' s much more please t not having to worry all the time .

6. fellow religion subscriber here . i have the same thought . my best guess is suicide leads to hell because life is worth living no matter how hard it is . some divine wisdom thing . hope you keep on pulling through , we  ve got this !

7. it ' s the end of the world as we know it .
   (ID: d8b92be4e0b1e639cde4ac3fc3f079b296813fc5)

8. i think death is a state which alters our consciousness to the same form of life in an other parallel universe . so that we can live better and evolve . inspired from time is a flat circle !
