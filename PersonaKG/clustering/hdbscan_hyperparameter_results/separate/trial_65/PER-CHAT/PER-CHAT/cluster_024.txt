1. i was taking a shit in my alternative school bathroom stall , put my phone on the floor so it wouldn ' t fall out my pocket and break , some guys walked in and saw it on the floor , my teacher thought i was watching porn , my probation officer heard about it , i lost my phone to him for a week . that ' s my only story so far . and it wasn ' t even a porn watching story .

2. i was in a car accident with my best friend and he died . i was conscious the whole time but remember nothing . those hours that disappeared before i came to in the hospital , it ' s a different kind of scary .

3. not sure if this counts but i was out walking my dog in the when i come across one of my classmates tied to a tree , unconscious and severely dehydrated , apparently some other class mates mugged him , beat the hell out of him and dragged him into the woods , naturally i untied him and explained what i knew to the police and i know very little after that , the two thugs and the victim did not come back to school and the teachers did explained the circumstances , i was never called as a witness , my guess is they plead guilty to whatever charges or because they were minors got a slap on the wrist with a new identity , apparently the victim did recover physically but lord knows what going through that really does to you .

4. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .

6. no , i never told anybody . it ' s hard to explain , but i just can ' t get it out of me . i was afraid for so long that i would be judged , or that people would " feel bad for me " . i know what happened was horrible , but i ' m in a good place now . i don ' t want unlock that part of my memory for someone else to see , if that makes sense .

7. i had philophobia . i don ' t know if i still have it . it ' s basically the fear of love . i have it because of my parents . i had to watch them constantly argue . their sick relationship and the fact that they hardly ever showed any signs they loved me , caused some brain damage to me and now i usually can ' t listen when somebody is talking about love , especially very traditional love . i hate family as a unit and i hope i will never have children . also i find newborn babies disgusting because they are kinda a " a fruit of love " .

17. oh , we ' re talking about cops ? once in high school , this convenience store owner called the police because my friend and i were smoking weed behind his store out of the way , out by a tree , not even on his pavement . cops show up , we toss the joint , and they want to get us in trouble but can ' t really do much without evidence of actual weed . so they start looking for the joint and my stoned friend bends over to help and one of the cops literally pushes him away . never forgot that for some reason . it was such a hard shove and the friend was really just trying to find the joint to help these cops get him in trouble , lol .
