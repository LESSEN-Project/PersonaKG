1. i have to agree honestly . as much as i like skins with different styles , this new mentality of " i dont like their hat , get rid of it " and " make this character blue because i said so " is so uncalled for

2. yeah exactly . i personally don ' t really like the new design myself , but if people do , perhaps there ' s something there that i may have missed out on . perhaps some cool new feature i missed out on that makes it better than what ' s already here . i mean , if it ' s not broken , why fix it ?

3. even the new tim comes as a gift . and no one claimed that this is more than a slight refresh . nobody has the reason to complain , especially when the new parts are going at the old prices .

4. getting real tired of this dumb idea that comp and trim are now easy like you didn ' t have to do everything else on the req list . for comp the only difference is people who would ' ve paid a leech , don ' t have to , it hardly undoes everything else on the cape .

5. to be fair this is what the community has complained heavily about since release . is this not what they wanted ? no sense in complaining about it how it is now if you were complaining about how it was before , as you  ve asked for these changes , specifically .

6. i don ' t know man . it ' s either they do mistake considering namco like to do mistake for example release dark souls dlc before release date or its 2b assets . it could be a bug fix but i don ' t think bug can take up that much space . i think maybe the unreleased edge master stuff ? or new feature . we can just hope we discover something when the download finish .
