1. yeah it ' s generally a good rule . but my little brother takes it too far . you to one tiny thing to him , he says treat people how you want to be treated then drops bombs on you .

2. they always signed us up for whatever activities we wanted to do hockey , baseball , figure skating , dance , etc . and made sure they brought us to every single lesson or game . not only did these activities teach me so much about goal setting and working with other people , it showed me how to support the people you love .

3. instead of tucking me in to bed as a kid with the whole " don ' t let the bed bugs bite " deal , my mom would kiss me goodnight and say " you can do or be anything you put your mind to " and i think hearing that every night developed my confidence and strength for the rest of my life so far

4. my mum taught me to lie to my dad about how much she spent on clothes from an early age . he knew we were lying and never challenged it . not sure why she insisted on lying about everything she bought , my dad couldn  t have cared less . nice memories

5. my parents would always make me apologize to someone personally if i was rude , inappropriate , etc . so as to show me that your actions , even if they are only words , can hold significant consequences when used improperly . they also showed me the power of them when used in the correct context and situation .

6. as a teacher , i have usually had the lower echelon of students in my classes . it is fairly frequent that i ' ll be cussed at , most of the time because i did something the kid didn ' t like . i ' ll just reply with something like , " why thank you john smith , that is the nicest thing anyone has ever called me . i appreciate that compliment , i really like you , too " sometimes it pisses them off more because they don ' t have control over my actions . after all , when cussing out a teacher , they usually expect an explosion from the teacher , which classmates will film to make vines or other social media videos . most kids will usually realize that they aren ' t going to win and just mutter a " fuck you " and then go back to doing something less inappropriate .

7. yea , schools also do a shit job of showing what respect is . if you have to say it , you don ' t have it . pretty sure anyone can get the gist of it after that
