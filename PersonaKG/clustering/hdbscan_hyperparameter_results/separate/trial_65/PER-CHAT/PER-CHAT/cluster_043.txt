1. first off bud , i  ve played since alpha . secondly i didn  t say anything was over powered , you do know how to read don  t you ? they asked what we thought was the best character offensively , it  s an opinionated post , the  competitive  aspect of the subreddit has nothing to do with options or thoughts . your assumptions and negative responses are the exact reason this game is dying .

2. no mans sky always were a good game . you suckers just say it is  was bad because the creator overhyped it and lied about some features . blame the creator . not . the . creation . thats not just about nms , its about every fucking thing  your wife died giving birth to your child ? blame yourself for making her pregnant or dont blame anyone thats just one example . and also the game became really good after those updates . fuck you . haters gonna hate .  digit

3. that wasn  t me who said that lol . i played the shit out of the first destiny . every dlc , did every raid , all of it . the game is absolute shit . i understand that that  s my opinion , but i truly do not get how people like that game . didn  t even waste my time buying the second one . so disappointing that bungie abandoned halo for this garbage

4. but what you dont understand is the reward that epic gives for you for the grind . were not selfish and clearly youre angry that you cant play as much . but youre not gonna play digit hrs a week to get omega after digit weeks . thats not how it works . you need to put time into the battle pass . say , you go to work , part time whatever . you dont enjoy the work you do , but at the end of the month you get a paycheck . its the same with fortnite .

5. you complaining about free rewards ? it  ll get better and more competitive as you grow within the game . i assume your still very new at swgoh and are clumped with people who are probably not that into it the same way you are .

6. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .

7. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .

8. that hs nothing to do with it . nice try though . the game had no real progression . it felt like a waste of time to me . hey look everybody ! someone who is a crybaby because someone has an opinion on reddit !
