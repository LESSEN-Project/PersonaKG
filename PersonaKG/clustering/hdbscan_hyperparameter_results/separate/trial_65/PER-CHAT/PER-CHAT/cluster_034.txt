1. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

2. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .

3. i mean if the government told me it was to help stop a world wide war and you weren  t going to get hurt and you believed them ? bull crap jumping on a bus hurts you and other things don  t and are debatable whether it  s a bad thing . that  s why i always hated that compassion that parents like to do . theres a difference between hitting someone because they told you to and jumping in front of a buss . for example in middle school once we were allowed to walk around by a teacher in the classroom this is important and a guy was pinching me and was chasing me so i kept walking away and he kept walking faster and so i ran and got in trouble . but would you really say did i deserve to take the blame for running ? look at it from the women  s point of view . if all of society and every authority figure told you your life and that of everyone you care about is in danger and the only thing you can do to help is hand out a feather . you would do it ! you gotta understand the whole context and the thing being done and the relative morality of it . individuals are not always responsible for there actions . there are always factors involved that take away the choice .

4. ok , i get the point of this and i  m sure it would help clear this up with some people but , if you force a man to get pregnant and carry the baby wouldn  t it be going against their consent thus making you the rapist in this scenario ? i  m not trying to put down somebody  s experiences with this but that sounds really morally wrong . not that any of the other stuff happening isn  t . i  m not trying to say something against this i  m just arguing morals .

5. fuck that . women who don  t let men have an opinion on abortions but expect child support are something else . it wasn  t the immaculate conception ladies , his sperm made the baby too . i don  t know how to make this situation work for both men and women . however , simply ignoring the fathers opinion is completely unfair .

6. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

7. if i woke up and found out i was sustaining your life because it would be the right thing to do . people have many rights to do wrong things , but it doesn ' t change the fact that it is wrong . having a right does not morally justify every circumstance . and there is a difference between action and inaction . taking an action to end innocent human life is always murder .

8. she is violating the child ' s body by having it torn up and sucked out of her . she is using the child ' s life as a sacrifice to her convenience . yes , slavery is always wrong . in a perfect world this wouldn ' t be a problem in the first place . but in the real world i choose the lesser of two evils . taking an innocent life to prevent your own suffering is wrong . please be intellectually honest and stop using the fringe cases as an excuse to justify the common occurrence . they are definitely worth considering , but even if they were justifiable , it doesn ' t mean the others are . i am pretty sure i have heard every reason that pro  choice advocates have for abortion . and so far , they don ' t change what i see as a very simple truth . it is always morally wrong to take an innocent human life . and , though you are free to disagree with my view on morality , i can ' t think of anything worse that one person could do to another . saving innocent life  saving bodily autonomy .
