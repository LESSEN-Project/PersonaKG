1. that ' s a very good question . it makes many possible browsers go away .
   (ID: 3ad18913fe75fd4a63c4ae0d0255c37d90fd7144)

2. probably current patch apart from very minor changes . they rightfully so don ' t want to change the meta a lot right before such a big tourny .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

   (ID: 800762ac8d54632109094a4e9132fe0aed711561)

   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

6. other is a lot of , well , other . it  s a bunch of cached crap . backing up a resetting might do the trick
   (ID: 0f6c6c4bd3531c7f028b4bf901123522dd67c300)

7. there ' s only about three of those that i don ' t use but any of em could be causing your problem , or even a weird interaction between a few of them
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

8. i have the same question , they are useless
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

9. offers the option to share music through facebook messenger i admit i don ' t know the full story behind the apps , i read the article though . i suppose i could have been more specific . i have no clue why these apps would need read access , writing is fine , that makes sense its a one way street . read and write access though ? why ?

10. yeah if the case cover is off i would suspect bad contact of the cooler to the cpu . with a good aftermarket cooler you shouldn  t be seeing temps like that .

11. nothing changed ? what are you talking about ? the defensive meta is gone after all the changes . it ' s not as reliable as before to stay on defense . for honor is in a digit times better place than it was when this year began and there was no way to do damage unless you picked a dlc character and everything was shadowed by timesnap and it felt clunky . sure , they need to optimize conq ' s bashes and some more character , but even if they leave it where it is , it ' s still a fuck ton better than year digit and a little bit into year digit .

12. the large roster . a year ago i was afraid the game would end up having almost the same size of a roster as brawl did .
   (ID: c378ee827fb7d26c7ea685ec1dc451bf264b0151)

13. so this is a  premium  snap you would have to pay for ? i still don  t understand why anyone would pay for that .
