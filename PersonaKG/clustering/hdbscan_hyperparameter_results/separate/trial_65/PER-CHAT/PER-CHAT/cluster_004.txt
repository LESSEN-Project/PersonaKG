2. after a nasty change if leadership we believe you are just too close to the former director and our lawyer thought it would better if you resigned i broke no rules

3. that is what is going on here . big company wants to make sure each termination is bulletproof so nothing comes back . i am glad you understand my view that he is not a good cultural fit . he makes me cringe with every customer interaction and i don ' t have the time to stand by him constantly and go through what is right and wrong . it seems to go in one ear and out of other . i think the whole outfit would be much more credible if we didn ' t continue to have him on board .

4. i don ' t think the complainers get it . the guy could ' ve retired and then there would no more new shows ever . the fact is , when he was terrestrial , he was a machine because he needed to keep high ratings to justify the costs . now that ratings don ' t mean as much and he ' s an older guy he ' s entitled to more time off . he warned everyone over and over and sometimes i think you won ' t appreciate the digit  day weeks until it ' s all re  runs all the time .

5. but . what reason do i cite for leaving ? i have no professional issues . i  ve never been in trouble . i bend over backwards for my guests , after all their happiness is my tip . but like i said this is what  s happening .

6. i ' m curious as to what exactly the drama was ? your mentor seemed like an asset to the company . it ' s messed up how things like that happen .
