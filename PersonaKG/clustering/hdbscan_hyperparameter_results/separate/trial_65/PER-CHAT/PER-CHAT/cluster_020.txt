1. all i see here is a good pilot communicating with a good gunner . if that team they were destroying had a single squad in it that dedicated a minute to shooting that bomber , it ' d be dead . hell , a single fighter or attack plane running the correct loadout would shred that bomber in a half  second . a single tank that ' s half  decent at leading projectiles could smash it instantly during a bombing run . vehicles are supposed to destroy uncoordinated infantry easily , but a coordinated effort easily destroys any vehicle . behemoths are far from broken . if a team has to fight a behemoth , they likely control most of the map . if they control most of the map , they have more than enough stationary weapons lying around to destroy it in less than a couple minutes . which is unfortunate , because behemoths are supposed to be overpowered  they ' re designed to allow a team to easily catch up to the winning team , but rarely succeed at doing so . the " oversights " you ' ve mentioned are much different than the ones i did . yours are perceived as overpowered because the average player does not use teamwork to properly counter them . mine are perceived as overpowered because zero effort was put into fine  tuning them to a balanced state . a flat damage bonus to all weapons will always result in clear  cut best choices . they never learn from this in every title they make . if they actually put time into giving every weapon different damage stats in hardcore , issues like these wouldn ' t exist .

2. i ' m confused what you ' re upset about . a gunslinger who understands how to use his class to its full effectiveness ? much like a titan putting a bubbleshield directly over a control point and sitting there with a shotgun , or titansmashing everyone at a control point ? haha , as a fellow hunter , i have to say , i ' ve tripped my own tripmine grenade and killed myself more times than i ' d like to admit golden gun gives hunters zero shields , nor does bladedancer . all they had to do was go in one of the two other entrances , double team him and he would have been gone . instead , they filed in the same door over , and over , and over again . edit  just watched the second video . derp . yeah . this is why i always roll my eyes when titans complain that hunters are op .

3. i thought you meant spy as in a russian spy or something , besides that possibly they figured he was already dead , i mean i  m pretty surprised jager survived the crash in the first place

5. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .

6. having a deathcam is way to casual already . if you want dedication your screen should turn black as soon as you get killed

7. it ' s not really shepard anymore , the shepard ai has much bigger priorities than talking to an old crew now . everyone would think he just died during the crucible firing .

8. that ' s true . i ' ve been killed while ducking as well so , you ' re right , he should ' ve been able to kill the gunner at some point even if he had been ducking .
