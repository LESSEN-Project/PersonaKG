5. i get stuck in a place with no dimensions , it  s just darkness around me . i can see things , but can  t tell how far away they are because i have no frame of reference for their size . it  s really hard to explain . it  s almost like floating , but i have a feeling of being heavy , almost weighed down by something . i guess the best way to explain it would be emptiness , with an occasional object in the distance ?

6. digit weeks ago i got cross faded and became unresponsive . i entered what we dubbed  the abyss  and it was the scariest place  feeling i have ever experienced . it was basically like the place in get out or like being in a dark closet where you can hear everything but cant move or speak .
