1. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !

2. hahaha no , i ' m sorry ! i think i know what ' s happening . i didn ' t object to you using the term pseudoscience , but to you defining as science with shaky bases . it ' s just flat out not science of any kind , only posing as such . that ' s the distinction i was trying to make you understand . i think i might have been a bit clearer , but i ' m on the phone , so i was perhaps too curt . sorry again .

3. " i don ' t know sql , python nor r , i don ' t have any technical skills as i am a manager , i manage people . " no , son , you ' re the manager of a machine learning squad and you ' re proud of the fact that you have no technical skills ? get the fuck out of here you lil bitch

4. yes i  m fully aware , but through consistent elaboration then maybe i could help at least one person learn the truth and show them the difference . as long as just one person learns from me , then my efforts are all worth it

5. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .

6. ' god ' already has a meaning . do you want me to start calling keyboards ' christmas ' and my car ' the virgin mary ' ? you ' re not saying anything with any meaning whatsoever . the scientific method isn ' t about ' fitting in ' baseless preconceptions . i ' m sorry if you ' ve heard my response before ? i ' m not sure what you mean by it being a ' standard ' response . it ' s how i think , not how i was told to think .

7. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

8. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

9. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .

10. funny how you haven ' t actually been able to make a logical counter argument . you ' re just saying " you ' re wrong " without the logical backing that i have . then the " boo hoo whatever dude ! you ' re , uh , just like , uh , a flat earther dude " really , i am ? i ' m literally just like a flat earther ? that is your brilliant counter argument ? that saying it is wrong to promote a lie is exactly as bad as lying ? that is what you ' re telling me ? do you . do you realize how incredibly stupid you just made yourself look ? you just made yourself look like a clown .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

11. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .

12. well . im just gonna be honest , becuase i dont lie . i actually think this is the stupidest arguement ive ever had . your a man who has wayyy ! to much time on your hands sir , you think that my spelling mistake is soooo important to the boiling point where you actually have to not only once but multiple times correct me . hahahahaha copy . you know what , i have an idea since your soo good at spelling . you should be a teacher yes yes . well maybe i dont think even english teachers care an english teacher so you dont have to correct people on reddit . you have two paths in life , my friend . the road where you keep going on this path , and gain lots of enemies . or if you seem to care and have been reading this far , you can look at yourself and maybe say ' there are lots of things i can be doing right now . have you seen your fam in a while , your mother must be so proud .
