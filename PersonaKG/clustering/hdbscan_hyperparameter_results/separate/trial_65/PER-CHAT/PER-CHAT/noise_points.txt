1. if you can ' t try and keep up with them , let them go .   x200b  try to know what your capabilities are . there may be some times where you are actually left alone intentionally or unintentionally where you have to defend yourself for a short period of time against a horde or a big enemy . work a little bit against the tide when you find yourself in this situation and i ' m sure you will better yourself in some way . make a game out of it if you have to , and if you survive on your own for that time , be proud of yourself and reflect on how you did it .   x200b  be patient always . if the rusher dies , kindly remind them that this game works with teamwork  or don ' t even respond at all to them . my experience has mostly been them ragequitting after dying so i could go and revive the bot for extra help .   x200b  don ' t be mad if the group fails . keep trying . it ' s just a game  a beta version of the game , at that . it ' s going to need revision before it becomes a truly enjoyable and playable game .   x200b  edit  oh and always keep player outlines on . you can coordinate yourself to stick with the main group going at a better pace if you know where everyone is .

2. that ' s what it was like for me , maybe the business was dodgy , maybe not though because my other friends who worked in other businesses experienced the same thing . maybe i was unlucky ? but it can affect people in big business .

5. i ' ll agree i have read that this is a problem . i wasn ' t as aware about this . seems silly to tax the people trying to give a child a home .

11. we all have those moments . even as a citizen there will be times that i hate my country . when it feels like nobody gives a fuck about you or your problems and struggles , you start to resent them for it .

12. it  s more like you return to home . i think it  s a pun on peter being a kid like spider man get back home ! or the chancla !

14. currently off on a trip visiting family , if anyone noticed me being a bit less active then that ' s why . i recently started playing crusader kings digit , it ' s a lot of fun

15. being treated nicely isn ' t what everyones after , some people prefer someone who ' ll challange them . whether it be intellectually or spiritually or whatever . lots of people are also still searching for what they want . someone might think they want excitment rather than someone who ' s more chilled and later find out they were wrong . there is also the possibility they just don ' t want you and thats it . idk its not an exact science . last possibility assuming you haven ' t made a definitive move on her is they think you ' d make a move if you wanted to and have given up on their end . if you think this is it , just try having a chat with them and say your piece . it ' ll happen or it won ' t but its better to have a answer i hope you enjoyed my ted talk

16. thing is i wouldn  t call it a debate if we were to go by the textbook definition . i could almost guarantee that if i sat down with lorinbassnectar he wouldn  t want to have a debate about policy he would simply shut me out . i  m sure , and maybe i  m making an assumption , but i  m sure that we could both agree that a lot if not the majority of his fan base has no knowledge about policy and simply follows what is posted . that  s what i find dangerous . when so many people look up to an individual they treat his words as facts , and this applies to both sides of the aisle . i also call it dangerous because it is a sure way of not only ostracizing a large portion of your fan base who listens to your music to escape reality but it could even pose the problem of many people losing hope in one place where they thought they could find it , and that is dance music . that  s just me and i can tell from the many downvotes that  s it  s not a very popular opinion .

17. remember that other one where he got the volunteer to murder stephen fry ? he also used the " anchor " and " color " concepts in that one . it think it is bullshit to suggest anyone can be persuaded in this way  as you mention , there are extensive screening and editing processes that db doesn ' t share with the audience . he just really knows how to pick em .

18. it just makes you a shit person . like they would care about that , they ' re cartel members . i think everyone would wish for a quick and painless execution if they somehow got caught , and they probably know that too . by making it the complete opposite it really sends out a clear message , don ' t mess with these guys or you ' ll found yourself tied up in a basement , your body full of drugs to keep you alive longer so you can suffer more , now that ' s enough deterrent .
