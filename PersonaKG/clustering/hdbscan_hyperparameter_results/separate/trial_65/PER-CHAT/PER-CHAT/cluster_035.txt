2. while i wait to see an endo about finasteride , im just letting mine grow its a bit thin on top but digit  digit  minoxdil seeme to be helping , get some hair thickening shampoo too . i use fixing gel  putty to style it which is simply brushed back , it keeps it all in place and stops it from look untidy . i would not cut your hair to be honest .

3. do you enjoy getting fingered or licked ? woman can do that , are you gay ? now that is a little atypical but assuming he likes to fuck you , he ' s not gay .

4. well , if we accept ourselves  just as we are  then nobody should ever work out because you  re changing your body , put on make up because you  re changing your physical appearance , wear clothes because you  re covering your natural body , or change yourself in any way because if you do , you  re not accepting yourself just as you are . everyone  s perspective of self acceptance is different . some people don  t believe in getting butt lifts or boob implants , some do . regardless , people still get them . people getting packers is trans guys accepting themselves as who they are a man . hypothetically , and assuming your a male , if you were in an accident and lost your dick it  s happened to many guys , you wouldn  t do anything to help yourself feel better about the loss ? i mean , since you should just accept how you are now . i do recognize that i sound very condescending in this comment and i  m not going to deny it , i  m just trying to counter argue and use your logic against you .

5. i think you ' re good as you are . never listen to these negative people , just ignore them . your hair looks pretty nurtured  normal , and your breasts might be smaller but that is completely okay , there is nothing wrong with you ma ' am !

6. i suggest offering to do it for him with a sock , and setting aside a  special sock drawer  . people have weird sex things , and you learn them as you get to know them better and better . if you  re honest , you probably have a few of your own weird  things  . a . m . i right ?

7. whatever you ' re into , your dick is completelty okay . imagine that there are men who are envying whay you have got there .

8. that sounds rather tricky , because ultimatley i would think your not going to want lots of male muscle in the long run , you ' ll need a certain amount of fat to your shape . at the moment im 176lb ' s with a fairly feminine frame but im working out a lot . im trying very hard not to build too much muscle and just tone up . i dont want my biceps or calfs to get any bigger for example . i could be totally wrong but i would think you need to gain some fat , but keep working out while putting the weight on to keep it under control . if you suddenly put on 20ib worth of muscle you going to look far more masculine .

9. your body looks absolutely perfect to me , but make yourself happy !

10. ah i see , so the actual answer is nothing to do with circumcision , it ' s about hygiene . okay then . you should find yourself a hygienic male . i can confirm , having never had dick cheese myself because i know how to operate a shower , that it is just fine .

11. should i be having an awkward conversation with my partner then ? i figured it was just a thing that happened to guys with a foreskin . he showers daily and his hygiene is otherwise fine but i do notice it gets kinda . gooey under there

12. it  s ok that you felt your dick twinge when you noticed his lips . sounds like you both have some exploring to do .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

13. i agree with this . it is impossible to tell someone how they should feel about themselves . but for whatever it ' s worth let me say i imagine you make most men horny . i hope you get what you need from the labiaplasty .

15. i have to agree with regenboog as you progress through your transition you will feel more comfortable with yourself and your femininity will come through nauturally . clothes are a different matter , if you are pre hrt , its really about how confident you are .

16. sadly , hormones can  t fix all our features  even though hrt for transmen is stronger than trans women most of the time . i know personally i  m a guy and all but after going on t , i got more dysphoria around my chest when i was pre op , female organs and bottom area . i changed drastically but that made things i can  t change stand out even more . that happens a lot when people transition . hrt is not going to make our lives perfect and amazing like many people think . i personally believe that  s why a lot of trans people are depressed and stuff after hormones , they imagined their life to instantly become perfect and all their problems go away . our problems will still be there after hormones , i knew this . i just knew that my problems will be easier to deal with as a man than a girl for me .
