1. definitely ! and what bugs me even more is when my friends correct the mistake they made when i can clearly understand what they were trying to say . does anyone else get mad when their friends correct their typos ?

2. it makes me uncomfortable too . i ' ve come to respond with " thanks , it ' s been hard work . conversation usually ends there .
   (ID: 7911b1d92de80b0e1abd4e2a29e4f762a8a2908f)

3. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?

4. don ' t try to act it was intentional or that you were serious . just laugh in a way , that indicates that you know you just did something awkward . thats how you show confidence and the ability to laugh about yourself . but you still need to stand your ground , if your awkward moment becomes a permanent joke about you . but the absolute worst thing you can do ist to become the aggressor , if you try to bring the attention to somebody else , by beeing an asshole , you show everybody your low self esteem and bad character .

5. yta let people be the people they are and for the times they do things that you don ' t agree with let that shit go and just have fun with them .

6. maybe its their way of letting you know how ridiculous you ' re acting ?
   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

7. because when i get asked if i read or like books , i always saw i do . because deep down i know i should read and it  s embarrassing to not know a book title or author . that  s why people get mad . dude , if you know you have a grammar problem and you dislike reading either accept your non existent interest to learn or start reading . it  s not hard . i hate when people say they love reading but can  t name a single novel or book .

8. i don ' t . what i do find annoying is people who use irony ineffectively .
   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

9. maybe they were once a delivery driver and knows what it ' s like to have to turn around and go back so they feel bad even though it is your fault .

10. we all screw up and make mistakes . you will make more in your years of driving . just kind of put your hands up and shake them and that kind of acknowledges that you know that you were wrong . it ' s sort of a visual " sorry . he can ' t do anything with your license plate . even in the worst possible case that he could , it ' s his word against yours . it ' s not even worth his time . he probably just let the dust settle . if you ' re on the road , you have to deal with people who make mistakes and assholes alike .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

11. as someone else said , you need to go with it . two ways to do it  have a comeback . you said you ' re not good at it , but keep trying to think of some even after the fact . if they ' re falling into patterns with what they ' re saying , you should be able to use one of those . build off one of their digs and take what they said one step further . part of this might all be part of being low man on the totem pole , but you want to show you have some edge so you ' re not always that guy . good luck op .

12. i have this problem too . my trans best friend and i refer to each other as " tr    ies " all the fucking time because we both understand that we ' re doing it to take the piss out of actual transphobes . but then i really have to try hard not to refer to other trans people like this . it ' s really bad lol basically , you ' ve just gotta surround yourself with people who aren ' t going to use that language . we automatically pick up and appropriate the language of those we surround ourselves with something something egotistic in  grouping .

13. if we are quiet in a group setting it does not mean we are having a bad time . although it ' s a nice gesture , you don ' t have to constantly check on us . it makes us feel insecure and like we ' re doing something wrong .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

14. look and acknowledge when this bs happens to you and you will understand how annoying it is
   (ID: 41fc1b2c09d5a16a25f120edde55b2a6e2e54e29)

15. so you ' re clearly letting it bother you and they notice that right ? people like that feed off of your response . you have to learn how to not let it bother you .
