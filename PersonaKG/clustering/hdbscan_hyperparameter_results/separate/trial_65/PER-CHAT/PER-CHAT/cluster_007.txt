1. i ' m fresh out of high school , and i hated when people would do this . or brag about how they only smoke the ' good ' weed . granted i know there is a difference between mid grade weed and high grade , just shut the fuck up and smoke it . it ' s pot , it ' s going to get you high regardless . why do people feel the need to brag about such things ? shouldn ' t weed unite us ?

2. i said it affects everyone differently multiple times . which means  some people can have negative effects and some people don ' t . what else is there to say about it ? i told you that your peers at college will be suggesting this to you because they don ' t experience these things . a lot more people who use weed have positive experiences than those who suffer while using it . plain and simple . it ' s also a drug that needs much more testing to understand it . if you want to talk to your friends about it in school you ' re going to either need to simply decline or educate them on current studies about the drug . they aren ' t going to just stop using weed as a remedy because you said it makes your dad ' s delusions get worse . people without any severe mental disorders aren ' t going to care quite frankly . i ' m not trying to be mean at all but i know stoners and i know young people . you ' re not going to have luck if you are looking for people to acknowledge something they like to do for fun is not good for them . you are perfectly entitled to not use thc regularly and disapprove of it as a form of medicine , but other people are entitled to use it and approve of it despite its negative effects on some people .

3. oh boy lol . i don ' t fly anymore , but no i wouldn ' t ever fly under the influence of anything , even cough medicine . it would be very irresponsible for people to fly while stoned or under the influence of any substance . the reasoning is pretty obvious . you misunderstood my statement about employees . of course they should be working sober . what they do in their personal time is really none of my business although i mostly employ writers who work from home so i don ' t really care as long as their work is to my liking . my point was , if they are going to use a mind altering substance after work , i ' d rather they just smoke weed instead of drink . weed doesn ' t cause hangovers during work hours . i ' m not advocating people get stoned or drunk during working hours . you are just buying into the narrative , that ' s my point . you have these stereotypes about pot smokers that just aren ' t true , but you are still perpetuating them with zero basis in fact . there are plenty of motivated and successful people who smoke pot during their personal time .

4. yeah i agree with you . life is about balance . besides smoking and heavy drugs i do all those things . it ' s just objectively a bad idea .

5. why don ' t we just dump amphetamines in the water supply ? isn ' t this pretty clearly a slippery  slope fallacy ? is there a real counter  argument to the ' better living through chemistry ' idea when we ' re talking about decisions individuals and their doctors make ?

6. who the hell started the idea that making cigarettes more expensive would get people to quit ? that ' s not how addiction works .

7. i am inclined to agree with most of what you said , and i ' ll look at the studies , but i suppose it ' s partially what i was trying to say , no drugs are safe , legal or illegal , if done wrong . i tend to indiscriminately tell people not to do the illegal ones though , since they can destroy your life , in fact it can have nothing to do with the drug and everything to do with the social situations illegal drugs tend to put people in . though i ' m sure you know that much too .

8. i mean even the most ardent marijuana supporters must concede it makes people less active and lazy . what are you talking about ? sure , some pot smokers are lazy , but are they lazy because they smoke pot or do they smoke pot because they ' re lazy ? there ' s a lot of really lazy unmotivated people that don ' t use any drugs at all . how would you explain that ? maybe we could just blame video games or something else in that case ? some people are just lazy . you do know people of all professions smoke pot , right ? i ' ve smoked pot since i was digit . got a pilot ' s license , college degree , and have run my own business for the past digit years . just about all of my friends smoke weed and they have all been employed for decades doing just fine . they have spouses , are great parents , own nice homes , etc . you know what makes people less active and lazy ? being hung over . i ' d much rather my employees smoke weed at the end of the day to wind down and get to work the next morning well rested . you ' ve bought into the narrative that has been preached to you since birth . this , coming from a dare graduate lol .

9. i digit  agree with your statement about people who are new to recovery low key bragging about their use . when i was in rehab there was always a group of sprouts sitting around trying to outdo each other with stories of how hard they supposedly were . i ' m not sure if they were trying to prove something or romanticising something they could no longer have now they are in recovery  i know how easy it is to become preoccupied with living in the past and sharing stories of the " good old days " when you know those " good old days " are no more . kind of a coping mechanism , however there was definitely a stench of one  upmanship lingering whenever the topic of drug use came up which was often as it was the reason everyone was there in the first place tldr  drug addicts like to talk about drugs
