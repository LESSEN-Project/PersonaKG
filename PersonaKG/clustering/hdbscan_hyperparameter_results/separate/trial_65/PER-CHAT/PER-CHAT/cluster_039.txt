1. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .

2. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .

3. you don ' t see the problem at all . you don ' t know any of the complexities or the implications of the issue , and that ' s why you think copy  pasting your own method would work . how offended would you get if the us told your own government  hey , our economy is the most successful in the world , you should copy it directly . of course you ' d be insulted . you should run your own country to your own circumstances , and we should do the same .  copy pasted from question digit mins ago

4. im liberal and i dont bealive that solution for europe is just to welcome more and more refugees . we have to cure the cause not the consequences . i also bealive in death penalty . a serial killer is just a burden for a society .

5. i don  t understand this aversion to violence that you have . take electrical cars for instance , they  ve been around for decades and the only reason their use is not widespread is because of the influence of the car , oil , and car maintenance lobbies . cars cause , what , digit , digit  digit , digit deaths in the us yearly . is this not structural violence on a mass scale ? and how about if we were to apply this to big farming . syngenta , conagra , cargill , and monsanto now run all pretty much digit  of food production in the us . this has wreaked havoc on small family run farming operations as thousands of families have had to close their farms . is this not another example of structural violence ? there is no way to achieve the things you want  democratically  or without violence . the only way to achieve the things you want is to brutally and violently repress the ruling class , namely the purveyors of capital formation and accumulation within the transnational corporations . the transnational corporations will never relinquish their power and wealth willingly . to believe so amounts to liberal idealism .

6. i absolutely agree . i can ' t believe we as the people simply allow ourselves to be taken advantage of like this

7. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?

8. but the left has a ' my way or the highway ' mentality do you not even realize how biased you just were ?
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

9. i like how your brain works my friend . if only politicians would stop thinking about their campaign funds and start thinking like you

10. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .

11. not american either , and sure , sanders would have been a better option than any other candidate . as far as unemployment , i will admit i have not seen data about it however , i seriously doubt it ' s been lowered significantly without useless spending from the government . i personally don ' t see a problem with oppressing people who have done bad things before or believe in white supremacy . not sure what is the other type of oppression you mean . why do you believe people should own firearms ? do you seriously not believe there is danger associated with that ? what is this islam problem you are talking about exactly ? if it ' s extremism , it ' s really not exclusive to crazy people with islamic beliefs . this problem is due to mentally unstable people misinterpreting their religion and brainwashing uneducated people . have you ever had a real conversation with a muslim ? what is your honest opinion about how sweden should be handling muslim immigrants ? last thing , do you not see any problem with blatant lying to the press and population ?

12. oh , i still say israel shouldn ' t . but you wanted a answer from the left so i gave you one . me being from the right doesn ' t mean i ' m unable to give a left answer .

13. really ? you feel the need for personal attacks because i disagree with you ? well , how about you try understanding the sentence before you attack someone . let me help you " it ' s exactly why i oppose tax hikes right now "

14. ever country shows certain degree of hypocrisy . when there are so many people in a single country , long term rational decisions are tough to take as humans tend to give more weightage to short term experiences while making decisions . also in democracy leader who want to come to power again , it ' s easier to take actions which seems sweet for short term . that migrant worker construction  worker most probably , isn ' t gonna vote .

15. you have a perceived notion on the us government ' should ' run . which you literally just proved my point . you don ' t understand how they actually work .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

16. you have got to be kidding . how in the hell do you classify this as racism ?
