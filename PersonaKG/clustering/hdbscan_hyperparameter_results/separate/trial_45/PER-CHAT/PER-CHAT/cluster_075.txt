1. the weirdest thing you have to get used at is that your bullets wont hit where your crosshair is when you go full auto . if you want to hit something you have to stand still and either burst or singletap . if you want to fullauto you have to learn how to control the weapons recoil .

2. if you can ' t try and keep up with them , let them go .   x200b  try to know what your capabilities are . there may be some times where you are actually left alone intentionally or unintentionally where you have to defend yourself for a short period of time against a horde or a big enemy . work a little bit against the tide when you find yourself in this situation and i ' m sure you will better yourself in some way . make a game out of it if you have to , and if you survive on your own for that time , be proud of yourself and reflect on how you did it .   x200b  be patient always . if the rusher dies , kindly remind them that this game works with teamwork  or don ' t even respond at all to them . my experience has mostly been them ragequitting after dying so i could go and revive the bot for extra help .   x200b  don ' t be mad if the group fails . keep trying . it ' s just a game  a beta version of the game , at that . it ' s going to need revision before it becomes a truly enjoyable and playable game .   x200b  edit  oh and always keep player outlines on . you can coordinate yourself to stick with the main group going at a better pace if you know where everyone is .
