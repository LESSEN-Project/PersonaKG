1. okay but what about men who sleep around ? it  s fine to think this as long as you hold men to the same standard

2. it ' s not ok , and yet men being violent to women because they do things like ask to be spoken to respectfully or decline to have sexual intercourse with a man is so common that pretty much every woman can tell you about a time it happened to her , it ' s often dismissed with " boys will be boys " or " she was asking for it . violence isn ' t ok , but when women are violent to men , it ' s usually to protect themselves and when men are violent to women it ' s so often because men have been taught that they aren ' t supposed to control themselves . like i said , every time i ' ve seen a girl kick a guy in the nuts , the guy was being a shit . meanwhile , every time i ' ve seen a guy physically assault a girl , it was because the guy was a violent asshole who didn ' t like being told " no " so , until we come to a time when every single man has a story about being kicked in the nuts by a girl for no reason while very few women are every assaulted , it ' s a meaningless equivalency . guys being kicked in the nuts for no good reason simply isn ' t the epidemic that girls getting assault for no good reason is . if you ' re getting kicked in the nuts that often , you should consider that either you ' re behavior is awful or your friends are , and make changes accordingly .

4. people are seldom rational about their sexuality . the flip side is that being in a relationship is so socialized into people from an early age that they fail to recognize that it  s an active decision that you need to make with another person and then participate in , the latter involving a continuous renewal of  wanting it  . you can look at others and feel sexually charged ! that  s human , but failing to recognize the decision you  ve made to be in a relationship is an active process is something that a lot of people end up screwing up . it  s not to make it sound like a chore ! certainly too there are other configurations of and agreements to relationships , but the primary recognition , as far as i  m concerned , is that you have to be an adult and responsible for making a choice to be in it . otherwise , why bother ?

5. you  re making it seem that everyone who plays video games or anything like that is a lowlife piece of shit , my dad  s an avid gamer , is about 240lbs and could probably bench press about 250lbs , i  m not that far behind him and i play video games as well . maybe don  t generalize when you say that every gamer is lazy or is weak . and the reason that men don  t think that women should get it into their minds that hitting a man is okay is because , what if that man retaliates ? the woman could die , and it  s hard sometimes not to fight back , especially if it  s really bothering you . men don  t like to feel pain , neither do women , so why benefit one at the other  s expense ? double standards are bullshit .

6. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting

7. dude , seriously , get over yourself ! i  m so sorry that i didn  t phrase my original comment to be  this specific man is really something else . just this one ! all the rest of em are ok !  like fuck off , men do stuff like this all . the . time . so stop caring about being generalized and go actually try for some positive change since youre not one of those guys .

8. how you treat your partner during sex and how you treat the opposite sex in general in your everyday life are different . what is being a  fuckhole  for chad even suggest ? having sex with an attractive man ? what a wild thing to do ! says the guy who would probably fuck anything with a vagina .

9. dude , if you have an attractive so , let her show that shit off . you should take it as a compliment when other people want to fuck your girlfriend . if you really can ' t handle her style , then maybe she ' s not for you .

10. ah i see , i would be lying if i said i hadn ' t done similar things in the past aha . do you actually enjoy the music  dress sense you are " rocking " at the moment ? haha , or is the sole purpose of it to please this girl . because i know it sounds cliche , but you are better off just being yourself man
