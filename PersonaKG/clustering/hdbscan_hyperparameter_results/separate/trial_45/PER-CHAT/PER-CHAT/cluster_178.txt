1. so i just recently re  watched the digit  digit batman film . saga ? i ' d also just yesterday posted on lounge about how much batman forever didn ' t live up to my fond memories of it . i still liked batman returns even though i felt that it is more goofy than ' digit batman . i like michelle pfeiffer ' s selina kyle , devito is so good . it did bug me that the world ' s greatest dective didnt work out that his date was catwoman sooner . uhm , the siouxsie sioux song is also good although it ' s certainly not the best orginal song the franchise produced . instead of alien digit that i haven ' t seen yet you should definietly do the sync  points on batman returns , batman forever the purgitorio film and batman  robin . good soundtrack , bad almost everything else

2. it ' s just crazy rng . if it was a mode where it was bo2 round wise and you got all your health back after each game then it ' d be a lot more reasonable to beat . but asking players to fight digit  digit fighters that can pop off out of nowhere since they ' re a npc and can just decide when to tech every grab and aa any jump in is just ass . it doesn ' t help that you have to watch your character do his little dance every time you ko someone . you have to do digit fights and that ' s a solid digit minutes of just sitting there waiting for loading . hell , i ' d accept the game mode as is if they just made check points for hard and extreme . have it be a random drop like the current buffs and things but make it cost double the cost of a full restore or something like that and it can only be used once . i ' m thinking of this digit ways . one is where say you get to round digit  digit and you buy the check point . if you get to round digit and lose you just go back to round digit where you bought it , like you ' re setting down a marker . or when you buy one it just lets to do the fight again if you lose but you can ' t stack retries .

3. although i love clannad and code geass with all of my heart . they arent flawless . and i dont think its good to keep saying to yourself that nothing will beat this anime . because then you ' re making it harder for yourself to find a really good anime . i recommend going in every anime with the thought that this could be you ' re digit  anime . this way you can enjoy more anime .

4. it ' s based on a novel series which does go further than the anime . there ' s digit novels and the anime adapted the first four .

5. i feel like i need to say something here so i will . all three games are phenomenal . when i think of a souls game i think of challenging gameplay . dark souls digit was my first game and i loved the shit out of that game , still do and plan on getting the remastered when it comes out . tried demon souls but it would constantly break on me so i just quit . played through dark souls digit and due to the changes in combat was given the chance to better myself and git gud again . it had a beautiful world that made you question wtf was going on . it had a plot that was there only if you took the time to look . these things to me are what make a souls game a souls game . i just started playing three recently and i  d guess i  m about digit  digit of the way through the game from what i know about it . its fucking awesome starting out already knowing how the combat works . but because of this , i can  t git gud at it because i was already good at it when i started . i beat gundyr first try . dark souls digit took away what i wanted from a souls game , to be able to proudly say that i got good enough at the game to beat the everloving shit out of it . don  t get me wrong i  m absolutely having a blast playing it , and i definitely wouldn  t call it a bad game . digit and digit feel like adventures , while digit , much like its predecessor demon souls , feels like i  m just playing a game to get to the end , kinda like chores almost . finally , how in the actual fuck are you gonna say digit isn  t a souls game ? have you fucking played it ? have you beaten it ? it  s just as much a souls game as demon souls and bloodborne . in fact dark souls digit is more a demon souls remake than a dark souls digit sequel , they just threw in the same item descriptions and a couple characters from digit . if you think dark souls digit is the purest form of souls which it is than digit , being totally open with a vast array of ways to start is more like dark souls digit than digit is . there it is , my thoughts on the matter . downvotes welcome here smiling  face  with  sunglasses

6. i see what you mean . i ' ve never played reach ' s multiplayer so i can ' t say much about the problems you mentioned , though they do seem pretty bad . personally my main draws were more from the single player modes , especially campaign . i thought the alien invasion story was actually quite good , since it showed how massive and powerful the covenant was , and how ill  equipped the humans really were to fight them . it was definitely more grounded and military  based than the other games , but i personally liked that sense of desperation and scale the setting gave off .

7. probably one of my favorite game . the combat and movement are fluid , and the maps are very well designed . if you want to play stealthily , the maps offer many different ways to achieve your goal . if you want to don ' t want to play stealthily , you get a large array of weapons and powers . just watch stealthgamerbr on youtube to see what i ' m talking about . great replayability , and the dlc that comes with this bundle is excellent as well  they ' re not just short missions , but lengthy sets of missions which introduce you to new characters and powers . the only drawbacks i can think of are that some people may not like the artstyle , and that people complain about some powers being op . also , if you ' re a completionist , finding all gold in every stage is a pain . for  digit , it ' s a must buy imo

8. thinking more about it this looks . bland ? rushed ? i don ' t know . it has the standard plot , is all serious , all very cookie  cutter . where is the variety in locations ? mainframe was a city inhabited by standard everyday computer people going about their lives . here it looks deserted apart from the evil robots trying to kill them , and twinkly purple buildings . doesn ' t even seem to be any variety in the environments . hopefully the games will be back . and always trying to kill them ? that wasn ' t the case in the original series , where we had other villains and situations . will there be anything like high code , a relatively light  hearted adventure ? and good god , will anyone be able to suffer the live action ? this is not reboot . in any shape or form . at least not from what we ' ve seen so far . this is generic , predictable , and yes reboot may have been all those things and more , but it didn ' t look like it just hadn ' t tried . the name alone , and seeing if they can redeem megabyte becoming santa on his sleigh , are the only reason i will give it a chance . but resurrecting the show for the lame " oh hey now teenagers from our world can magically teleport into the computer world so we ' ll have rad skater dude and jock dude and nerd dude and girl dude " really makes me want to cringe and  or punch people until they get smarter .

9. everything is bullshit if you don ' t have an answer to it . personally you pick it if you can get bursted down a bit quickly , and there ' s probably digit key heroes that are pretty tanky and do quite some damage . other than that the attack range is so much better , you ' re illusions get it too and you can take t3 and barracks in like digit seconds

10. strong story and a solid world is all i want , took a chance to play battlefront digit recently and while it plays well and everyone is dressed up like they ' re in star wars , it doesn ' t feel like star wars

11. tbh there are a lot of 2d games that are better than hzd , such as super mario bros digit and digit . i ' m not saying this game doesn ' t have its niche fanbase that will replay it people such as yourself , i ' m saying it wont be the sort of timeless game that continues getting new players into it years and years after release . it will instead fade into obscurity . the reason it wont age well is , as i mentioned , the fact that it ' s a copied and pasted open world format in an already overrsaturated genre . and it ' s boring .

12. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .

13. i was excited for fo4 because i have tried to get into fo3 many times before and always failed to enjoy it . i was hoping that fo4 would fix the problems but i was disappointed . other people may be able to overlook the issues i found with the game and enjoy it for its other merits , but i found the same flaws in digit as in digit  the most significant point  clunky combat . i can ' t really describe what " clunky " feels like exactly but the movement and the shooting feel " slow " and unresponsive , and they don ' t feel like they really have an impact . i found these same issues when playing skyrim and this seems to be a trademark of the elder scrolls and fallout series . the movements don ' t seem to really connect to your enemy , if that makes sense . perhaps it ' s an issue with animations ? a polar opposite to this would be games made with the source engine where all your actions feel more " precise . " again , i can ' t really describe what i mean as it ' s a subjective feeling . the ui , in addition to the combat , felt extremely clunky . everything from equipping items to switching weapons to navigating the menu to using vats felt like a chore . it seems like i could never navigate the menus consistently . i also wish they could have implemented a good minimap instead of the linear compass thing not sure what it ' s called . having to access the pip boy again , navigating menus to look at the minimap which turned out to not be helpful at all was a nuisance . optimization . i may be wrong here but i feel like i should be running the game better than i am . i have an i5 digit and an r9 digit . i have everything set to high or ultra except for god rays , which i set to medium . i set aa and af to low . i occasionally dip into the digit  digit range . i realize my graphics card isn ' t top of the line but i get better performance on games which are more or equally as visually demanding . i never dip below digit fps in games such as fc4 , gtav , and dying light , and i have the graphics also set to high  ultra with low aa and af .

14. the first digit harry potter games for pc were good , but after that everything went to shame . can you imagine nintendo making a game about the triwizard tournament ?

15. idk , i  m able to relate to nearly every message and character in the book . halliday  s created the most immersive  video game  in the universe and yet it  s so much more than that . people get lost in it .  the missing millions .  all just because he wanted people to like what he liked . and that somebody like wade who had quite literally nothing but passion and skill for the same things was able to beat his game . i think cline wrote every character perfectly , being able to understand their plights , i mean even sorrentos character was compelling , somebody you really wanted to hate . the references were insane . i didn  t even grow up with the old school games but the attention to detail was incredible . in an era where aaa titles don  t even come with enough content for digit month , cline was able to imagine up a place where everything was under digit platform , the whole world shared halliday  s creation , gunter or not . free learning , unlimited content , whatever your hobby was , it was in the oasis . i  ve never wanted something to be as real as i do the oasis . but the themes hit home too . the problems with being overly connected , letting the real world pass you by . the want and need to not let corporations rule the world . i just think it  s amazing start to finish . i understand liking something and later feeling differently but man , this book , i don  t think i  ll ever get tired of .

16. i ' ll watch the first digit episodes with the rewatch . if i like it , i ' ll just watch it on my own .

17. are you taking about trails in the sky digit or trails of cold steel digit because the english release of sky digit came out last year and the japanese release of cold steel digit came out last year and they usually take a couple of years to be translated . you can definitely start playing cold steel digit without having played any in the trails in the sky series . the first sky is only  digit at the moment but the other two are still somewhat expensive , by my standards at least . i haven ' t actually played the third sky , but i think the story is only somewhat related to digit and digit , in that it has the same characters but runs somewhat parallel to the story of digit and digit , which is a continuous story .

18. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

19. why would you start at water digit ? if you haven  t maybe it  s time to see everything that happens before it . manga  s probably easier , it  ll save you a lot of time
