2. when you ' re the only one in your first grade class whose favorite novel is frankenstein , it dawns on you that you might not be normal .

3. if done right , a collection of vignettes can be incredibly engaging . suttree by cormac mccarthy is a prime example of this , or steinbeck ' s cannery row . one of the things that makes it doable is how the vignettes tap into the reader ' s humanity  there is something they can connect with . i think it ' s a cool idea . who cares if it ' s the in thing right now .

4. i can ' t watch the films due to the fact that i ' ve not read the books . i know that ' s weird

5. nah . i like what i watch , but spoilers for the shows would be a problem .

6. for me it depends on what else it would be , for example lord of the rings sounds interesting .
