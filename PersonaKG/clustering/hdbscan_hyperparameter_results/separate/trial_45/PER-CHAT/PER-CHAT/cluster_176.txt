1. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .

2. this post is actually a pretty good start . whether you realize it or not , you ' re reaching out . now you need to go to a doctor , or a therapist , or whoever you feel comfortable with , and tell them all of the things that you have told us here . i ' m no doctor , so i can ' t say one way or the other whether or not you actually need medicine . but that ' s all the more reason to go talk to a real one . if you really do have depression , you might need meds . you wouldn ' t leave any other disease untreated , right ? as for the girl in the pic , i ' m guessing you look nothing like her . the hard reality is that you probably never will . everyone is different . you need to stop comparing yourself to other people , because you ' re only hurting yourself more . chances are , that girl has insecurities of her own . everyone does . but you can ' t let it control your life .

3. i dont believe anyone truly gets over their first love , its an internal battle but you ' ll eventually realize you love the idea of him rather than the person . the biggest thing i noticed is even when you were madly inlove with eachother , you were always going to him , mentally and physically . you seemed to be putting more into the relationship than him and thats not a good thing . a healthy relationship requires balance , obviously sometimes the scale is tipped but it takes you both to balance it back out . my advice is to live in the moment rather than the past . its not uncommon to miss him , frankly it would be inhuman to completely try to erase him from your memory . what you need it more balance , but for yourself . dont let your emotions and memories tip your scale , keep your new memories and your new emotions in check on the other end . meet new people , focus on your school work , and ensure you ' re traveling forward rather than backwards . he has moved on , maybe not with the best intentions but you need to move on as well . try to open your heart to the possibity of him being happy without you and you being happy without him . if you can both realise you ' re happy without one another , you will finally have some closure . a stepping stone to happiness is forgiveness and remorse . know what you did to his current relationship and see what you can do to fix it . i hope you can take something from this . best of luck .

4. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .

5. hey . you have everything you need inside of you . all the power in the world , all the love . everything . you  re gonna make it through whatever it is you  re going through . you  re not just gonna make it . you  re gonna fucking thrive . wake up every morning and name at least one thing that you  re grateful for . like being able to communicate w complete strangers on the internet . anything ! the list will keep growing and you will start attracting all that good juju you want . sending you love .

6. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .

7. maybe i ' m coming off as too depressed . i wouldn ' t say i ' m officially " depressed " i live my own independent life . i go to school in a major that i love . i workout digit  digit times a week , i taught myself to play guitar , i fly  fish any free chance i get , i love hanging out at winery ' s , i love to cook for other people and i love to just be outside . today i did a ten mile bike ' n ' hike . the problem is , is that i do most of these activities alone or with my guy friends . i don ' t know though . maybe i do need some form of therapy and anti  depressant . the main issue is , it would mean i ' d have to tell my parents . i don ' t want to admit to them that i have a social anxiety that comes from fear of initiating a conversation with a woman . my dad made a joke the other day that he thought i was gay because i ' ve never brought home a girl from school . i took it personally . i don ' t know why i ' ve built this up to be so much harder than it should be .

8. im gonna tell you , mate , taking your life only hurts the people around you . not one single person is thinking life would be better without you . high school is no determination factor anyway , life changes after high school and you can make life what you want it . you can start and entirely new life for yourself , you ' re moving on to how you want to impact the world . i know talking to someone isnt at the top of everyones lists when it comes to mental health but from experience , it really helps . reddit is a really good place to get your emotions out mate . there are lots of people on here with the same problems you ' re going through and we ' re trying to overcome it together . we ' re here for you , mate .

9. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !

10. oh , honey . sending hugs . can you ring a friend for a chat ? you need to speak to someone who knows your worth . i hope it gets better or , if not , you find what you need . good luck .
