1. do we really need the same operator , but on a different team ?

2. depends how urgently you need an extra merge for scoring purposes . if this gets you over some arena tier threshold or makes it a lot easier , i ' d say merge . but as you said ,  digit merge doesn ' t do much in itself so i ' d say fodder her if you really want to do that build .

3. this turn one is auto concede from odd rogue since the only aoe they really have is fan of knives . then for the late game i run two doomguards , two digit mana digit  7s and leeroy to finish it out . i ' ve found it to be one of the stronger aggro decks but there are a lot of digit or digit card combos . all i did was throw digit digit mana heal boi and digit ghouls into regular zoo .

4. chi brew is better for single target  with serenity , and eventually when you get digit  set and a higher ilvl and class trinket let ' s say average digit  you ' ll want to run chi explosion  ascension for multi and single , as it just gets easier to manage with very little difference in dps . i might be wrong about the last bit as its been a while since i ' ve gone and played ww , mostly brm at the moment . the most important thing to remember is that this is a game , and   you have to play it my way or not at all   personal preference takes precedence over min  maxing unless you prefer to min  max and like doing as well as you possibly can .

5. interesting take . don ' t have cls . running the squad with thrawn currently . i ' m assuming the removal of thrawn and r2 and the addition of hy and ezra will benefit the overall synergy . you don ' t really need too many damage dealers as dn removes two per battle anyways . it ' s digit v digit basically and gk never dies when i play ai .

6. this is how my b  w knights deck started . i needed a lower power deck for when i end up in those awkward super  casual pods . it ' s been interesting to have to tell myself ' no ' when i come across cards that would be great it in it . that ' s a whole new realm and i ' m sometimes proud of my restraint .

7. shadow assault is unquestionably the least desirable . it ' s not a ' bad ' , heroic in reality , vp is just fantastic . most of the other less than desirable heroics i can think of niche use for , but that ' s the most difficult one . the other two that come to mind are rain of chaos which is decent for zoning during a push , and mind control can be used for picks in some cases . i wouldn ' t recommend picking them most of the time , but you can come up with situations where they are pretty decent . abby ' s construct blanking out on the name , is good and bad in so far that if not stopped it can do a lot of damage . it limits his team  fight potential though , so unless your team can compensate in some other ways it can be difficult to use properly . it has high potential though , and under the right circumstances is arguably superior .

8. balancedsuperpowers i like it more than godteirsuperpowers or shittysuperpowers because it provides a bit more of a dilemma i would like to go through there and kinda debate with my friends if you would want that superpower downside combo

9. ultra necrozma malamar is probably more consistent than this . you have way too much going on . i also don ' t see why you run ditto since you don ' t run metang . also you need digit ultra balls
