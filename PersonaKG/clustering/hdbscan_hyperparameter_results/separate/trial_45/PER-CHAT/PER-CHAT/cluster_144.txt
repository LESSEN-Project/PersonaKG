2. ummm . wow ! it wasn ' t the nazis who built that wall . yikes ! i correct my previous statement , you should have just learned history ! that was not such a wall , that was to keep people in . much easier to do if the gov ' t kills anyone you know if you escape . kind of puts a damper on escapes and the ability to plan them with others .

3. yes i  m aware of that , trying to stop the twat laps around harrods , but in this case i can  t see any wrong doing . the police officer should really have gone through a red light without his audible siren on in such a busy area .
