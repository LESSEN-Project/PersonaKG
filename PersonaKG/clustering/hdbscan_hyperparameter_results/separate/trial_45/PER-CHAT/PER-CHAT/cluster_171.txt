1. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .

2. 26m here . you basically just described me . so not alone ? though i also dont feel good about this ravenous pessimism toward dating either but can ' t shake the feeling that it ' s all a waste of time

3. hey , first off , i wanna thank you for being real with how you feel . and congrats to losing 90lbs , that ' s absolutley insane ! the first thing i thought of was the concept of " stinkin thinkin " and how our mind sometimes plays sick games on us by saying we are " not good enough " in reference to tinder , , , anyone can make a profile so why would you deny yourself the opportunity to have one if you want one and try it . you may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome . but it starts with you making one and knowing that if others can have it , you can too . also youre so young that you can bounce outta this mindset . first i would take your chance on the girl you want . ask her to the gym or something , and if that doesnt work , go in on the tinder and try what have you got to lose ? nothin , but a mindset that needs updated . im sorry if thats harsh because i do empathize feeling that way , because ive been there but ive found the way out too by putting one foot in front of the other and takin that chance with a girl . i believe in you bruddah

4. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .

5. the relationships i ' ve valued most came from the women i didn ' t initially think were the most beautiful . life has nothing to do with looks . if you don ' t have a real relationship until you ' re digit , consider yourself lucky  it ' s all a waste of time . bullshit this , bullshit that . most dudes just want a hole to stick their cock in and are willing to lie to you every word they say to get that . some women have figured that out gonewild exists for a reason . don ' t feel dependent on a relationship for happiness or validation . that ' s only going to be a let down . once you feel happy with yourself , love will come naturally . ask anyone over digit thats been through a few divorces  you have to love yourself to love another . anything else is lying to yourself to pretend to feel happy .

6. bad break up ? if so you got to let it go . if not , then go outside and explore somewhere where people are accepting , like a sports bar or social clubs or something where you can add to peoples conversations
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

7. i went on because life is about the present and future . if you regret , you will be wasting your time and proving , you can ' t get over someone . be a man  girl stand up and find someone who loves you . there are more fish in the sea , and if she  he left you it ' s because she  he didn ' t love you enough so why waste time on a lost cause . you are beautiful and deserve someone who sees that

8. was at that point digit years ago , no friends , wife left me for a woman , family digit miles away . i found this to be my new life , a reset . now i have remarried and have an incredable full life . grab life by the horns , get out of your comfort zone , do new things . you don ' t have to be alone .

9. did you ever consider that your own habits and personality are your roadblock to those things ? if you never make an effort to better yourself or even try how can you blame the world for your blunders ? nobody is depriving you to your right to anything . companionship isnt assigned , its something that is found , love is something that is developed along with intimacy . its not just something like equality and civil rights . theres not a chance in hell you could tell me that you cant find a single woman that you cant connect at least a little bit with and work into something more intimate if you want .

10. being single does suck . i ' ve been single my entire life m16 . i usually cope by hanging out with friends . i know i ain ' t the best looking , nor am i fit . but yeah . i get how you feel . life does suck that way . whenever i feel down about being alone , i usually think " i ' ll find that person eventually " some day you will . just continue doing what you like , and hang out with your friends

11. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

12. i  m sorry this is happening to you . i know how this feels and i can tell you it  s never good to have a crush on your best friend . i hope things work out for you .
