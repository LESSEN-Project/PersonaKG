--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 16

1. i said it affects everyone differently multiple times . which means  some people can have negative effects and some people don ' t . what else is there to say about it ? i told you that your peers at college will be suggesting this to you because they don ' t experience these things . a lot more people who use weed have positive experiences than those who suffer while using it . plain and simple . it ' s also a drug that needs much more testing to understand it . if you want to talk to your friends about it in school you ' re going to either need to simply decline or educate them on current studies about the drug . they aren ' t going to just stop using weed as a remedy because you said it makes your dad ' s delusions get worse . people without any severe mental disorders aren ' t going to care quite frankly . i ' m not trying to be mean at all but i know stoners and i know young people . you ' re not going to have luck if you are looking for people to acknowledge something they like to do for fun is not good for them . you are perfectly entitled to not use thc regularly and disapprove of it as a form of medicine , but other people are entitled to use it and approve of it despite its negative effects on some people .

2. who the hell started the idea that making cigarettes more expensive would get people to quit ? that ' s not how addiction works .

3. i ' m gonna be serious for a minute though , i lean towards against high driving . i know a few seasoned tokers who can handle it , but most people can ' t really drive high very well . there are exceptions though , and i would include myself in that . it ' s important to note though , that knowing your limits plays a part .

4. because why not ? life is fucking ass , it makes me feel something for once , and will shorten my life expectancy . like damn , where ' s the fucking down side

5. interesting ! i think most people don  t think about the effects of producing such things , rather than just what they promise to do .

6. why don ' t we just dump amphetamines in the water supply ? isn ' t this pretty clearly a slippery  slope fallacy ? is there a real counter  argument to the ' better living through chemistry ' idea when we ' re talking about decisions individuals and their doctors make ?

7. my point is that theres a legal limit on how drunk you can be and drive , if you are below that limit you can drive . for most people , having two drinks puts them below that limit .

8. from my understanding the gov ' t isn ' t going to flip the bill for the drug tests . the people he is drug  testing , the people trying to feed their families with what little money they have , will be paying . i most certainly do not agree with this policy , granted , if you don ' t have money for many things you shouldn ' t be partaking in nefarious substances , but that is irrelevant . a prerequisite of welfare shouldn ' t be a drug  test . have you had a job in the past digit years ? have you looked for a job in the last digit years . whats that ? yes ? ohh here you go . wait wait wait you ' ve smoked pot this month because life sucks ? sorry pal your kids will have to starve

9. i didn ' t want to make a full post about this but i see you a lot in comments . so i ' m doing my first dosage of 600mg i ' ll be doing 300mg and than waiting an hour and doing the next 300mg , i think ill be fine . my friend on the other hand is doing 800mg for the his first trip , should i try and get him away from that idea ?

10. depends on where your mind is at the time . how was your day ? are you happy ? sad ? angry ? how much acid ? what kind of trip are you looking to have ? have you ever dropped acid before ? are you an experienced cosmonaut ? there ' s nothing wrong with dropping acid alone at digit pm . as long as you are doing the drug and the drug isn ' t doing you

11. oh boy lol . i don ' t fly anymore , but no i wouldn ' t ever fly under the influence of anything , even cough medicine . it would be very irresponsible for people to fly while stoned or under the influence of any substance . the reasoning is pretty obvious . you misunderstood my statement about employees . of course they should be working sober . what they do in their personal time is really none of my business although i mostly employ writers who work from home so i don ' t really care as long as their work is to my liking . my point was , if they are going to use a mind altering substance after work , i ' d rather they just smoke weed instead of drink . weed doesn ' t cause hangovers during work hours . i ' m not advocating people get stoned or drunk during working hours . you are just buying into the narrative , that ' s my point . you have these stereotypes about pot smokers that just aren ' t true , but you are still perpetuating them with zero basis in fact . there are plenty of motivated and successful people who smoke pot during their personal time .

12. wait , you mean to tell me a drug created by big pharma is bad for you ? now i  m no doctor or scholar but it doesn  t take a  study  to prove that the shit they tested on us in the military and the shit they force feed everyone is terrible for you .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

13. i mean even the most ardent marijuana supporters must concede it makes people less active and lazy . what are you talking about ? sure , some pot smokers are lazy , but are they lazy because they smoke pot or do they smoke pot because they ' re lazy ? there ' s a lot of really lazy unmotivated people that don ' t use any drugs at all . how would you explain that ? maybe we could just blame video games or something else in that case ? some people are just lazy . you do know people of all professions smoke pot , right ? i ' ve smoked pot since i was digit . got a pilot ' s license , college degree , and have run my own business for the past digit years . just about all of my friends smoke weed and they have all been employed for decades doing just fine . they have spouses , are great parents , own nice homes , etc . you know what makes people less active and lazy ? being hung over . i ' d much rather my employees smoke weed at the end of the day to wind down and get to work the next morning well rested . you ' ve bought into the narrative that has been preached to you since birth . this , coming from a dare graduate lol .

14. yeah i agree with you . life is about balance . besides smoking and heavy drugs i do all those things . it ' s just objectively a bad idea .

15. ability of judgment is not binary absent or present . your decision making procedure takes things into account using different weights for different factors when you are drunk than it normally does when you are sober . that can make you misjudge some situations and make undesirable decisions . i think you are just politically against people who use their drunkness to excuse their misbehaviour . yes they suck . but they may be telling the truth as well as lying and using it as an excuse , you never know .

16. i am inclined to agree with most of what you said , and i ' ll look at the studies , but i suppose it ' s partially what i was trying to say , no drugs are safe , legal or illegal , if done wrong . i tend to indiscriminately tell people not to do the illegal ones though , since they can destroy your life , in fact it can have nothing to do with the drug and everything to do with the social situations illegal drugs tend to put people in . though i ' m sure you know that much too .
