5. reddit has some crazy idea that all lobbyists are just running around with briefcases full of bribe money and buying votes . while it is true that some corruption exists , there are tons of legitimate lobbyists out there doing good work . how do you expect all the senators , and representatives and other government officials to learn about issues ? lets say we want more solar power . we can all post on our representative ' s facebook page saying " yay solar " and linking to random websites with statistics that say solar power is great , but that will just get lost in the other pile of every other person ranting about what they want . now lets say that people pool their money and hire someone who has an intimate knowledge of the cost  benefit of solar power and can not only put together a persuasive and concise report , but can answer any questions on the spot that may come up . that person can do more in digit meeting to inform a representative on the issue than digit , digit people ranting online and writing letters could ever hope to do . lobbyists can do great work and i know multiple people who work as lobbyists in multiple fields , many for non  profit companies , and none of them are dropping off briefcases full of cash . if you want to ban every profession that has corrupt individuals in it , lets go ahead and ban all cops , teachers , doctors , accountants , realtors , nannies , waiters , and pretty much every profession , because there isn ' t a single profession out there that is free of corruption . how many people do you think would be cops , doctors , and teachers for free ? and do you really think that would increase the quality of work from that profession ? if lobbyists are really corrupt , do you think that having them not be officially paid is really going to stop them ? how about instead of making a crazy statement like banning a paid profession , we simply enforce the laws we have regarding government officials taking bribes ?

6. i know you ' re going to get downvoted and are using hyperbole , but that may not be bad for them . not a " forced labor " kind of thing , but something designed to show them the value of work . maybe they could help build a park or something like that .

7. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .

8. no , not just free stuff . you want to force the wealthy to work for free for you .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

9. i mean i guess . it  s more of a live your life type of motivation thing not take it literally and blow your money haha .

10. well that just sounds lazy to me . is that the only reason people want illegals is so we don  t have to do the jobs nobody wants to do ? what job could be so terrible that somebody wouldn  t take it ?
