SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 8

1. shark . i ' m more likely to survive . crocs kill quickly , a shark will most likely just take a bite and move on once it realizes humans don ' t taste good .

2. and then they  d likely sanitise it or not serve the food . what do you think happens in a regular restaurant when that happens ? they just leave the blood and hope for the best ?

3. it would not be a bee , it has the advantage of only having to learn how to float like a butterfly , and conversely nor would i fight a sword wielding butterfly . i reckon i could take a beluga whales so long as it comes into my neighborhood .

4. i ' d eat a human . i ' m not sure if it would by gamey or tender .
   (ID: f6b8978c4b660719e17dff38ba86c988b9bf86f5)

5. i ' d probably take my chances . i mean we live in a world where living things must kill and consume other living things for survival , so , how much worse could it be ?

6. well , if you stand under the wrong tree a pissed off drop bear might get you , but a snake will only strike at you if you startle it when close enough that it doesn ' t feel like it can get away  like if you ' re crashing through the bush chasing one or two terrified people . i ' d be at least a little concerned , but then , i ' m not a murderer . if i was a victim , i ' d take the chance of a snake bite and leg it at the first opportunity . i save my ' everything in australia will murder you ! ' stories for my kiwi husband and friends  it makes me look like a badass when i tell them about how i killed an eastern brown with a shovel or found a redback in my bed .
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)

7. but at least everyone else will have something to eat . that is , if you like soylent green .
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

8. sure do . and then you also risk having someone see that you haven ' t touched that juicy last bite yet and assumes you must not want it . they might try to steal it from you . this causes table fights . but ofc i wouldn ' t be brining no spoon to a knife fight . especially if its my last bites i ' m fighting for smiling  face  with  horns
