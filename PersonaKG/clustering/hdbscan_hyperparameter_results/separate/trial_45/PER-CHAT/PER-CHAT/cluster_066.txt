2. holy fuck me ! that ' s awful , i feel bad for your uncle ' s friend . , that ' s why i feel so bad for truckers , people are assholes because they think they are faster and can get away . what they forget is that the trucks are way bigger and will crush them like a bug , how did your he handle it after ? i can ' t imagine even though in a way the guy deserved it for being an ass , it still had to affect the driver . edit  spelling

4. don ' t think that ' s the case . this mentions nothing about an injury here , just the marine ' s takedown and then how he was restrained . the robber was put in handcuffs , with no mention of needing medical attention .
