   (ID: 130fa156e7a286a021dcdff2492d6048231cb82f)

2. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .

   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

4. the staring . of all the things i found difficult over there , staring was one of the worst . you might think that being taught not to stare at funny  looking people is common for children around the world . nope . and what do you do when it ' s a parent and their child , staring and pointing together , like they ' re watching an orangutan at a zoo ?

5. school textbooks in vietnam are amongst the tightest controlled , most heavily censored , and most unyielding to change of any " permitted " writing in vietnam . they are gone over with a fine  tooth comb by the party to make sure that the content fits in perfectly with their desired ends . education ' s end is to make the model citizen as they see it , to fit in with the big picture that they promulgate .
