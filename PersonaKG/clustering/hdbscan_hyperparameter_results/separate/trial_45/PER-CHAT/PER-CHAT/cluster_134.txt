1. that ' s not pc . it ' s applying a term to people who don ' t need them . i am man . i am a not a cisgender male who identifies as a man . i am a male . have been since the day i was borng . period . you don ' t need ways to differentiate me from transgendered people .

2. i disagree with the others here , queer is perfectly fine to use . it  s clearly based on the context when and where it  s even potentially offensive . if you want to be more specific and sensitive  queer identified  is a safe bet .

3. i think they ' re just not putting up with people ' s shit anymore . at this point it ' s like " i am who i am some fuck you if you don ' t like it ! " they just people to stop treating them like shit for it .

4. i ' ve personally faced violence for being a transman more than once , and i live in a really bigoted place filled with truly awful people . i totally get where you ' re coming from  the point of my comment was actually to point of that transmen face their share of issues with being trans . most commonly , in my experience , misogyny that reduces us down to genitals and the use that men can have for them .

5. to be fair i kind of find it interesting . being a straight furry is like being gay in the world . we ' re made fun of , some people ignore us very small minority , but still , and its very difficult to find people you can relate to . so you won ' t find solice here . it ' s the world upside down and its sometimes fun to see what would the world be with lgbt being the majority . i know it can sometimes suck , but hey , being a furry is a choice unlike race or in some cases , arguably , your attraction . you have to put up with all the bullshit , but you can quit at any time .

6. i understand intersex . i get transgender . you wanna be the opposite of what you are . you identify with being the other sex . i ' m talking about people who claim they are neither . no , you were born with a vagina or a dick . you can ' t be neither just because you fucking feel like it .

7. lol what are you going to say ? just straight up ask  what are your views on feminism ?  you think a guy that wants to have sex with you is going to say  oh i hate women  ?

8. is there a difference between transgender and transsexual ? is transsexual considered to be an insult ? i ' m genuinely curious . all this gender talk frustrates me sometimes , there ' s so many genders and no one talks about sex  what ' s in your pants , or whether its there naturally or artificially . that ' s the thing i care the most about when it comes to romance and sex as a gay guy .

9. people hate trenders because it takes a legitimate and real identity and crap we  re born with and turns it into a game . being transgender isn  t fun . dysphoria isn  t fun , even if your dysphoria isn  t that bad . i didn  t choose to be born like this , i would never choose to suffer like i have speaking of personal experience only . dysphoria sucks ass and it genuinely upsets me when i see girls trying take something that  s been a real challenge for me and thousands of others and turn it into a fun little game . i really don  t understand why you  re defending trenders . they  re literally just cisgender people trying to get some oppression points . they aren  t people genuinely questioning their gender because they aren  t in this category , people who can  t transition in any way , etc . they  re taking a label and exploiting it for their own personal gain . they  re going to one day change their mind and then the consequences are left to those who are actually transgender . if you want to see in a difference situation and circumstance why trenders are doing more negative than positive , then i  ll give you one . the people who are sad for a few days and say  i  m depressed  . the people who are a little nervous and say they have an anxiety disorder . or , those people who like cleanness and order and say they have ocd . we all know that mental disorders stem from the mind just like being transgender , our brains don  t align with our birth sex . you can  t choose to have a mental disorder you don  t choose to be trans , you choose to transition yes but you are born transgender . the people who label themselves as such when they have the littlest of symptoms are doing more negative than anything . same goes for here . girls who like boy clothes  etc . aren  t transgender . or those girls who are little or very masculine . just because they don  t like their boobs doesn  t mean they  re transgender . plenty of women don  t like their breasts . for transmen , it  s not only that they don  t like the lumps on their chest  it  s that it  s supposed to be a male chest than a female . our brains are telling us that it  s supposed to be a male chest , but our anatomy is giving us something else . then that  s when dysphoria kicks in and so on . the brain section is actual scientific fact . not some principle . there  s evidence of transgender people  s brains not aligning to their assigned sex . my brain is similar to my father , not my mother , because of the slight differences between the two brains . we are having a discussion here . i haven  t told any trender anything nor spoke to one and said anything bad . there  s no actual way i can ever  police  anyone  s identity . having an opinion is not policing . i  m not gate keeping either . i wouldn  t say this to an actual trender because i  d say it in a completely different way .

10. ok then give me what you would consider the rightful definition of an incel , and why do you fit it ?

11. I am antifeminist.
