5. you ' re staying strong mate , good to hear . it might be unnecessary to reward yourself ' cos you ' re doing so well anyway , but you could always treat yourself with something like a massage , pamper treatment or the like . your way of rewarding you , if you think about your winnings and the fact you ' re not pissing your money away on booze instead like we all have , i reckon it is well deserved ! not your thing ? ziplining ?
