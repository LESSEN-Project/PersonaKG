1. " sugar is the devil , don ' t eat or drink overly sugary foods " , says me , chomping on my third wagon wheel of the day .

2. eating smaller amounts isn ' t the hardest thing in the world if you eat the right stuff . things you " can ' t live without " you will still miss most likely but will find other wonderful things instead . rip pizza eating right in a controlled environmental is easy , eating right elsewhere is hard . so the restaurant put fries on your plate even though you asked them not to ? not an excuse to eat them . meat is awesome forever . ok i knew that already but it ' s still true .

3. define too little . are you eating digit ? digit ? digit ? digit ? generally i follow the belief that starvation mode is bullshit and would ignore it and trust your body but there are certainly plenty of people who think the other way . i only eat once a day and the number of people who tell me i ' ll lose weight and feel better if i have breakfast drives me quite barmy sometimes . your body is actually quite smart , listen to it . do try and eat good things though , especially if you ' re eating far under . vitamins are important !

4. if you try and eat a little something at meal times even if you  re not that hungry then that might prevent you going all out after you  ve gone a long time without food . you  re probably a lot more hungry that you realise

6. again with the orchid . they ' re pretty and all , but i feel like they don ' t really add anything to the dish . my crew and i call this type of garnish " culinary masturbation . but hey brother , you ' re trying and you ' re learning in the process ! good for you and keep it up !

7. my jnmil ' s sister who is a way bad jnmil , once talked to me for an hour the night before my wedding about eating special k only until i started to see the " worms come out " , so like a special k cleanse . because it starves the worms . worms need meat !   . i will add this to my arsenal because god knows i ' ll have to use it .
