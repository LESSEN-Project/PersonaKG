4. oh , thank you for the compliment  to divulge the circumstances though , it was on the way home from my last shift of the week and we didn  t discover the break until a few weeks later  so i actually had a few days to recover and by the time the injury was apparent it had already made enough progress to be ignorable my only regret is that i  ve got a four inch ridge of bone or tissue or something back there along the crack because of the way it healed . i  ll wear a hat until i die i think
