2. this is enlightened . complaining is not the same as soliciting advice . so often a child ' s minor complaint about something gets a response telling them what they did wrong , just making the kid feel bad .

10. waaaaaaay too many blockbusters i know daredevil isn ' t a part of the cinematic universe , but it was much better than any of the movies minus the fillers and plot holes it didn ' t follow the same formula of intro , blah , blah , and buildup to the cgi fight scene at the end , yay everyone ' s happy now . it had depth . it had enough time to explore both the hero and the villian . i felt like if mcu took a page out of the netflix book , they ' d be a little better off . i don ' t understand how people are still so impressed by the same cgi anymore . it ' s gotten bland . also , the action was very organic .

11. oh , well if it  s clear then there  s not really a reason to worry . your nails might look shinier , but no one is going to notice a detail like that .

12. thank you ! i guess i  ve been too preoccupied with thinking about the  who am i now  and so ive completely failed to think about the  who do i want to be in the future  wow . this is eye opening . it seems so basic , but i completely missed it . thank you . . and new socks would be nice . there  s nothing better than a plush , new pair of socks .

18. i hate such mis direction . a movie should be like fight club with subtle clues all around place . maybe its just my preference .

20. yeah that  s what everybody keeps telling me . not to get to personal because i doubt you have time for my life story , but since i was very young i noticed that i could put in very minimal effort and still get by with decent grades . everybody always called me smart , hardworking but i knew it was a lie . sometimes it feels like it  s gonna take the rest of my life to reverse the bad habits i  ve developed so i can start believing i  m smart myself .
