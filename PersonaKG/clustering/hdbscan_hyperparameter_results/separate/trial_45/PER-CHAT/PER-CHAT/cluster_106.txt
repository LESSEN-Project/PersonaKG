3. yeah , if a directors cut comes out that ' s digit  hours long then maybe . i know i ' ve crapped on it so far but ww , flash , and even parts of aquaman were good just wish dc would stop trying to race marvel and just make good movies .

4. i definitely agree with that boss and the kotor characters . seems like a good time to implement them since no movies are coming out so they could be filler characters .
