1. my grandpa is a mason , my uncle was , my grandma is in amaranth and my mother was in rainbow gals . i have no idea where secrets societies get a sinister reputation . all they do is help each other out and raise money for charities .

2. i ' m not going to trying to convert them , the chances of converting a anti  fur is extremely low , we should just accept them for who they are . i mean that ' s what our community is about right ? acceptance ?

4. it ' s very simple , if i say i want to be a vegan because all i eat is fruits and veggies but like me i ' m also a bow hunter i will be denied entry . why ? because i ' ll be breaking a tenet of the cult .

5. also , most people in the states are apolitical  depoliticized and best praxis would probably be to date them and radicalize them . we all have long and winding political developments and it ' s good to meet people where they ' re at and engage with them . this could also be applied to liberals  conservatives , but probably not with reactionaries . although you never know ! i wonder if any communists have converted a reactionary
