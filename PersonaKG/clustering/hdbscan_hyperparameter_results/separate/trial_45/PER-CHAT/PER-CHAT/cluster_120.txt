2. got it . in that case i believe ml could help and agree with the post from woodsja2 . i ' ve taken the andrew ng course they mention , and came away with a pretty good understanding of the different techniques . that said , to do this right probably requires prior experience . good luck , should be a fun problem to work on !

4. youtube is going to be your best bet . as someone else mentioned , just pick a topic and go . if you ' re wondering how brakes work or how you replace them , or you want to know the difference between engine configurations , etc , you should be able to find a video explaining it .
