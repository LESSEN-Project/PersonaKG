1. well , i love bill burr , and i also think oprah winfrey is a mostly useless gasbag , and i thought the viral ad was retarded . but for the sake of a balanced discussion , i would point out the emotional attachment between mothers and their children . yes , it is more physically demanding to be a crab fisherman in alaska . nobody is disputing that . but i bet if you asked any mother who has lost a child , she would rather pull traps for ten years than go through that again . maybe it ' s possible that the word " difficult " might mean different things to different people ? reddit is usually home to the nitpickiest of nitpickers . i ' m surprised nobody has brought up this point . and now i get downvoted to oblivion .

2. look i ' m not saying there isn ' t value in those studies , and that parenting style . it ' s just not exclusive like you seem to think it is . try raising children with different types of challenges , like autism spectrum disorder or oppositional defiant disorder , then tell me there ' s a one size fits all . also , confirmation bias . there , now i ' m really out .

3. itt everyone has parents that yell at them for trivial things , proving that we ' re all in a matrix and a part of the hive mind

4. i don ' t dislike kids as a general rule there are of course exceptions and provisos but i don ' t like responsibility and obligation . cats i scoop a shit box and throw dried food into a bowl for , but then i can fuck off for hours and hours and no one gives a shit . i mean , it stands to reason if you want to do your own thing , you don ' t saddle yourself to a being that depends on you for everything for survival .

5. all those so called ' syndromes ' are bullshit . it is bad parenting .
