6. still my point stands . shooting someone because they  re that desperate is wrong . you should never shoot someone unless you are physically in danger . somebody might be that desperate , just let it go just get your shit insured .

7. i have never stated that disobeying an officer means you deserve to die . i don  t think that at all , i think that anyone when encountering the police should obey an officers orders because it gives you the best chance of getting through the situation with a a better outcomelesser charges and b reduces risk of bodily harm . please don  t put hateful intentions onto me as i wouldn  t apply them to you . i  ll i want is for people to be more informed on police work , by doing so we make lives easier for everyone

8. i don  t understand this aversion to violence that you have . take electrical cars for instance , they  ve been around for decades and the only reason their use is not widespread is because of the influence of the car , oil , and car maintenance lobbies . cars cause , what , digit , digit  digit , digit deaths in the us yearly . is this not structural violence on a mass scale ? and how about if we were to apply this to big farming . syngenta , conagra , cargill , and monsanto now run all pretty much digit  of food production in the us . this has wreaked havoc on small family run farming operations as thousands of families have had to close their farms . is this not another example of structural violence ? there is no way to achieve the things you want  democratically  or without violence . the only way to achieve the things you want is to brutally and violently repress the ruling class , namely the purveyors of capital formation and accumulation within the transnational corporations . the transnational corporations will never relinquish their power and wealth willingly . to believe so amounts to liberal idealism .
