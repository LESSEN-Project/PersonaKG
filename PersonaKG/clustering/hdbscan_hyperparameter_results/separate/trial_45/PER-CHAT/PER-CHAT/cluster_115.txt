1. regardless of the selfishness in your ideas , which caused the existance of the kids in the first place , in going to say that my point is , that you cant expect kids to be slaves because you provide them food and shelter . " i give you shit , so you should do exacly as i say " that sounds like a regular employment , except the kids can ' t quit . they have to put up with you . and they dont even realise that because you have fashioned their brains the way you want . im digit and took me digit years and living away from home to realise that parents are the entitled ones . i hope for the sake of kids , fair doesn ' t only come in octomber to your house too .
