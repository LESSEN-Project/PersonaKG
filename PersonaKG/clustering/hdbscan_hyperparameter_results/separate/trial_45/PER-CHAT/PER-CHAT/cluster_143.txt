1. well she also thinks that not voting is voting for trump so basically buzzfeed  vox  msnbc has rotted her brain to the point you can  t even talk to her about politics without her screaming over you so it  s not any use

2. that  s absolutely true . every angry word published will hurt and continue to hurt those children forever . that  s always been my biggest problem with bethenny .

3. if you ' ve been paying attention to anywhere outside of this circle jerk of a subreddit , you would know why people are bashing this episode .

4. i  m not saying . i agree . the question being the magnitude of the offense . i myself have family that actually work on the show via union chicago teamsters so it  s not in their benefit that it gets cancelled . however , it begs the question  isn  t it strange how this guy creates an entire scenario that  s fabricated from the start albeit he quickly lost control of it and the show is not being affected ? yet , rosanne for comparison affects all the actors and crew just from a remark ? a verbal statement that cost no one nothing aside from those that decided to give her to time of day . not sure why i  m being downvoted  i asked if there was more information and all i got was  ummmmm  and  uh  s  and answering questions with questions . there  s no useful information with that .

5. in what way was it clear that he had assistants feeding him information ? i ' ve never seen his live show but i know he has been under intense media scrutiny for his entire career . if he was cheating in this way i can ' t help but feel he would have been publicly busted for it .

6. i think most people miss the problem with her name . the problem is stupid parents naming kids stupid names . that is the real problem .

7. major props to her honestly , i ' m assuming youtube didn ' t know about this when the video was made , so i wonder what they ' re going to do .

8. a lot of people complain about this episode because they think it  s specifically geared to appeal mmj fans . truth is , you don  t have to know about it at all to find the episode entertaining . i thought is was pretty damn funny

9. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .

10. kind of interesting that rather than show the entire twitter discussion , the writer cherry picks quotes to prove that carole thinks she  s superior . you know how even one thread on this subgroup can lead to several discussions and responses . i could cherry pick any thread to prove a point . this is exactly the same as bethenny  s  harassment  by jason . she presents him as an unbalanced dangerous stalker . when you read the actual court transcript it  s completely different . so  show the entire twitter feed including what prompted carole  s responses or assume it  s bethenny  s pr people trying to protect her by questioning other castmates behavior . another article from the poor bethenny minions .

11. even though felix constantly gets targeted by vox , wsj , and other mainstream media , he doesn  t let that effect him , he just ignores it since the articles aren  t true . he doesn  t do what makes us happy , he does what makes him happy . he helped some smaller channels get popular . so felix is truly a kind and caring youtuber
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

12. he is appreciated by the meme community as well as markus persson is .
   (ID: 337350fc54133b327ce0d6d9f385f82a2a6738cf)

13. he deserves more subscribers . he ' s not as popular as he should he . he ' s one of the best guys on youtube . it ' s sad to see him so low and cancer so high .
   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

14. are these people and their one sided twitter beefs a joke or something ? this phd person has to be satire . then there  s the troll who keeps trying to stir up stuff with rackets for attention i guess ? maddox needs better foot soldiers on social media , the cringe is unreal .
