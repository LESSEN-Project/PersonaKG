6. pulp fiction . interesting directing but the plot as a whole was awful and the witty dialogue couldn  t make up for a lack of a sense of purpose . an issue i have with many nonlinear stories is that it detracts from the tension in certain scenes . it  s like when you  re reading a book and see that there  s still digit pages left , so you know nothing bad is going to happen to the main character .

7. not sure if considered a cartoon , but the intro in up , you couldn ' t help but feel bad
   (ID: 199ca187d50b43aebb52968a5525289cb65a1520)

8. i literally don  t remember anything from the show besides its title . that  s how shit it was .
