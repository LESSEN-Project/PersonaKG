1. i can relate , when i was dating this ome girl earlier this year id rather hang out with her than do anything else , she just made me happy . heres the thing if you hang out with them too much there eventually gets to the point where you get bored of them , lose your interest in hanging out with them . i know i know you might be saying that you wont and some people can be like that and never get bored of them but incase you do take a step back but not to far back , they ' ll think something is up when in reality you jusy want to create distance to rekindle the flame of loving their company . thats my opinion atleast

2. make sure you love yourself . be happy with doing things on your own and don ' t rush into anything without getting to know the other person well .

3. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted

4. i digit  agree , confidence is everything ! many times people didn  t realize how short i actually am hell , some didn  t realize i was shorter than them sometimes because i did the same made it a non  issue and where i lacked  i made up as well . the more you don  t care or act like you don  t care , the more other people will take the same attitude . i admire your attitude bro !

5. as someone who puts up walls like it  s my job and also someone who  s last relationship crumbled because of it , the best thing i can say is to try . also , be patient , it takes time and you have to let the person get comfortable with you

6. snap out of the loop and start approaching . i understand how you feel about everyone feeling tired after work . but , you could be the make or break in someone ' s day . consider a party with your boss . everyone is shaking his hand and being all professional . and then you walk in and treat him like a normal person , and bring in high energy . he will like you and respect you for being real and treating him like an actual person . others will see this and start doing the same . break everyone out of the loop . just because everyone else is doing something doesn ' t mean it ' s taboo to do something else . take risks . now do the same thing in dating , break everyone out of autopilot . change what is perceived as normal everyone doing their own thing , to approaching . you will definitely get shot down more though , since some won ' t be in the mood to talk .

7. i gotchu bro . you may be asking yourself , oh no what do i talk about ? when approaching a girl . no worries ! as another user mentioned , get on board day is a great opportunity to meet a girl that has a similar interest as you . you dont have to tell a joke or have some jaw dropping awesome first line , you can literally just ask  how long have you been into topic ?   what is your favorite thing about topic  keep in mind that not everyone will click and if it doesnt , dont tell yourself that youre bad with girls . i promise you that there are guys you could try to be friends with and it wouldnt go so well either . why ? because not everyone is going to click , i promise you that i wouldnt click or be friends with almost digit  of the guys in my classes if we tried to be friends . it  s just because people are different . so don  t get down , go out there , be confident , be yourself , and if you fail , get back up , dust yourself off , and try again ! you got this ! p . s . none of the bad interactions will matter in digit years when you  re as happy as can be with your s  o good luck bro

9. thanks for the detailed response back i  m really the same way a lot of the time  i really only talk when it  s important to me and try to stay comfortable wherever i am with a calm attitude . i would rather observe than participate . it  s hard for others to  read  a person who acts so chill i don  t think being late would really affect someone else feeling uneasy around you  it  s not necessarily a  flaw  but could be misconstrued as being confident you  ll be okay if you  re late . i would definitely try to stop being late . you wanna be seen as putting in as much effort as everyone else . also , help out your coworkers ! especially the new ones  being the big kid on the block is intimidating especially if they don  t feel like they  re meeting your standards . ask someone who seems to be nervous around you for help to figure out nyc mass transit and see what happens  they might start to feel more comfortable . try to be a little less chill  most people are uncomfortable around others who seem to be confident in their silence because it kinda makes you seem like a stranger . try to observe others around you  are they asking questions often ? are they talking amongst themselves while you just observe ? what can you do to relate to them ? incorporate yourself into other peoples  lives and i think you  ll see a big change . in regards to meeting a girl  you should remember that women want to feel calm with their man  don  t try to throw out how chill you are  instead just show them a different side to you . as a first date do something really actively fun and faster paced like roller skating or an adult jump house . if they have strong opinions on something you kinda feel indifferent about , join along in their fury if it  s not that big of a deal . just little things to make you more relatable . relatable is the key word here for sure ! good luck
