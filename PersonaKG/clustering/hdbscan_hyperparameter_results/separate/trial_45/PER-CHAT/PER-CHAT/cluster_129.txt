1. it makes me uncomfortable too . i ' ve come to respond with " thanks , it ' s been hard work . conversation usually ends there .

2. because when i get asked if i read or like books , i always saw i do . because deep down i know i should read and it  s embarrassing to not know a book title or author . that  s why people get mad . dude , if you know you have a grammar problem and you dislike reading either accept your non existent interest to learn or start reading . it  s not hard . i hate when people say they love reading but can  t name a single novel or book .

3. if we are quiet in a group setting it does not mean we are having a bad time . although it ' s a nice gesture , you don ' t have to constantly check on us . it makes us feel insecure and like we ' re doing something wrong .

4. i don ' t . what i do find annoying is people who use irony ineffectively .
   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

5. so you ' re clearly letting it bother you and they notice that right ? people like that feed off of your response . you have to learn how to not let it bother you .

6. when i for some reason or another , i or someone else makes stupid mistake or such say " humans are stupid " most people take it as offense  they don ' t realize i am human too and i have to explain it , always , to them .

7. ehh no that  s not quite what i  m getting at , i know what you  re talking about . like someone looking off in the distance or distracted while talking , that  s not what i  m referring to . i  ve seen several people who talk with their eyes closed , like speak full sentences with their eyes closed . or they look up while their face is facing you . it sounds bizarre but if you know what i mean then i bet you agree it  s annoying . idk why people do it . some strange social phobia maybe

8. my father taught me to always hold a door open . for people . it is in the guise of manners . we as well mannered people you and i both will do things for other people that are nice . i hold the door open for people , pull out a chair , help you put on your coat , carry your bags and it is all because of good manners . if i were to do the opposite  walk through the door without holding it , leave you to carry all your own bags etc . would you feel that i am being rude ? i don ' t know because i don ' t know you . maybe you would feel angry that i am just looking after myself . maybe you would feel happy that i wasn ' t assuming that you needed my help . but i know that i would feel rude . the way i was brought up was to help people and to have good manners . that is probably why benevolent sexism happens , people really feel as though they are doing the right thing . as for the calling people honey or sweetie , i am with you on that . i get called that by old ladies " oh aren ' t you a sweetie " that guest at my hotel . but if someone were to say in a certain context i can understand your frustrations . like a lot of things i think there is a line that you cross when you act too familiar . but don ' t be embarrassed for you , be embarrassed for them for not knowing correct social etiquette .

9. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?
