1. just hear me out ! taking time to really think about what you ' re eating is connected to whether or not you ' re living a happy life . that ' s why i think it ' s really important . so , there are animals that are carnivores , right ? you know , like lions , cats , and vultures . you won ' t find meat from carnivores like that at a restaurant . why is that ? because its too smelly to eat ! it ' s disgusting ! listen up , guys ! cats are too disgusting to eat . are we on the same page so far ? on the other hand , have you heard of a fish called " sweetfish " ? sweetfish don ' t eat bugs . they only eat algae . they ' re vegetarian . usually fish guts are too bitter to eat , but sweetfish guts are delicious . it ' s because they ' re not carnivores . so with that logic in mind , all the meat we consider delicious is from herbivorous animals ! cows , pigs , and chickens ! the better their food , the better they taste ! which leads us to this conclusion . humans would taste gross because they eat meat ! well ? how do you like the conclusion i came up with ?

2. in not sure this is unpopular  but yes there is only so much seasoning , so many ingredients you can add before a dish starts to be horrible . nevertheless people want the best , most expensive , extravagant thing they can find . even absolutely fresh , local ingredients prepared by highly trained chefs will only get you so far in terms of a mark up . food is ultimately just dirt , seeds , and slaughtered animals  the gold beckons you into a web of sin  but don ' t go in

3. yes , that ' s why i said responsibly . red meat isn ' t going to kill you or shorten your lifespan if you do it in moderation .

4. i love food . i love almost all food . i can cook very well , and have a deep and broad knowledge of food . but you know ? i still like shitty hotdogs , kfc mac  cheese and rainier ale . my appreciation for the nice stuff doesn ' t dilute my enjoyment of the cheap stuff .

5. there are some foods that need to be cooked that are otherwise toxic , quinoa for example . the ' cooking destroys nutrients ' thesis , although often true is irrelevant . you can eat eat a greater quantity of steamed broccoli and recieve the same amount of micronutrients as a smaller quantity of raw brocolli
