1. compare his lifestyle to the previous one . the current pope is much more modest with his attire and seems to me like a genuinely good guy . it ' s a nice message and you are just hating so you can hate on religion . why do you care ?

2. he didn ' t almost collapse a grooming gang trial and it utterly transparent that you only all of a sudden give a shit about the victims because you think it bolsters your point of ' football man bad ' . you didn ' t care about those girls before and you don ' t care about them now and that is precisely why someone like tommy robinson came to prominence .

3. while i know mocking gobert for crying leads to a toxic environment , is there not some point here in at least examining why he  s crying ? gobert , reigning defensive player of the year on a team playing great and trending upward , broke down because he didn  t receive an individual honor . specifically , an individual honor that feels more like a popularity contest for an exhibition game . can he not let this past him ? does he really need the validation from a combination of fans , players , and journalists to let him know he is a good athlete ? he  s last year  s dpoy ! on a great young team ! i don  t want to attack the act of crying in itself , but i feel like for me to defend it , i would have to know he  s crying for something that matters . if he cried after getting knocked out of the playoffs , or blowing a digit point lead , i would understand . crying after not receiving an all star bid ? i guess i just don  t get it . if there  s something bigger i  m missing here , please enlighten me , because i really want to understand this better . i just feel like if i was an nba gm or coach , i don  t want my player getting worked up over not receiving an individual honor when i  m focused on winning real games .

4. fuck that . if you actually read the article along with his response you he acknowledged it and apologized for it . not to mention he emphasized personal growth . it  s a joke and i applaud his response  we are in a social atmosphere that reflects witch trials at this point .

5. basically , if he  s a changed man , why is he bringing this up now ? if he  s moved past this , why does he feel the need to express this ? being love and validated aren  t synonymous . you can love your pops , but think his actions are wrong . furthermore , people are in love with what they think liam is . who outside of his close friends and family really knows him . how many people loved kevin spacey before he was ousted ? i dont think you understand what i mean when i say he  s seeking validation . he wants people to say  yeah , i understand how you could have those thoughts  . that  s why it  s selfish , it  s self serving . he could have said ,  i was a racist who unjustly went around hunting people i knew nothing about hoping to kill them to satisfied my twisted definition of justice . instead he churched up the story to try and justify is actions . like i  ve said , if a white person raped his friend , would he have acted the same way ? i  m willing to wager he wouldn  t . we can be empathetic , we aren  t monsters , but we don  t have to validate it . these are the thoughts of a fucking racist .

6. ive watched the whole video and i am not sure if you read my post . my main argument is not autism . it is other minor damages caused from vaccines
