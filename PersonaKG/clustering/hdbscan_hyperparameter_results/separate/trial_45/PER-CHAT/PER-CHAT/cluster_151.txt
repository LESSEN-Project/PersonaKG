3. scam ! scam ! scam ! i love how these scammers try to disguise what you will be doing    handling and monitoring some of my financial activities . aka the classic i send you a check that is fraudulent , but you won ' t know til days later . meanwhile , you wire me money before you find out my check is a scam scam and yes , if it ' s too good to be true , it is too good to be true . they are counting on desperate people to fall for hey , i can make  digit a week just working digit hours a week ! sign me up ! before having a chance to really sit down and think about the true nature of the job .

4. aussie here , so what i ' m about to say may not apply in the us , but going around to talk to sparkies face to face is worth digit resumes you send out . do the leg work .

5. interesting to see the mix of opinion on the 30k london salary . for what it  s worth , i think this seems bang on what i would expect . for those saying it  s very high  my first job was in a london call center and it paid 18k back in digit . i was an unskilled uni dropout with a poor work ethic . you can get to 30k by default just by adding a some skills and experience . for those saying it  s very low  this job is looking for someone with digit year  s experience . so the target candidate is going to be in their early twenties and most likely has no family or other responsibilities . they  ll manage on 30k just fine .

9. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?
