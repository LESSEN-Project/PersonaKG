1. no . they do not even do that when striking the ball . why did you comment on a topic you know absolutely nothing about ? did you want to mindlessly make a fool of yourself ?

2. i know its not so easy to do when shit like this happens but . do people who do this not train themselves to get out of this situation ? as i understand you are supposed to roll onto your front , get your ice axe thats tied to you and kinda use it as an anchor ? i mean there were parts there where it seemed like he was just sitting up like he was on a slide

3. i think what ' s scary about this video is how the cammer seems to be paying attention and driving in a relatively safe manner , yet still is unable to stop in time . this situation happens all the time where traffic slows suddenly , and i " use up " some of my stopping distance . usually , rather than slowing even more to return to a safe following distance i will follow too close for a few seconds until traffic speeds up again . i think most people do this , and it can be really dangerous in those few seconds .

4. regardless , everyone , blind people excluded , can adjust the focus of their vision at any time . this is not unusual .
