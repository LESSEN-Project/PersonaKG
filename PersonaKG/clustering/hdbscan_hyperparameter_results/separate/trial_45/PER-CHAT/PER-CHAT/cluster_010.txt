1. yeah , true . there are so many worse companies . just the first thing i thought of . it ' s great for talking to my friends and family all over the world as well as promoting myself , but i hate to see how people are addicted to it and over use it as well as whatever privacy stuff they violate .

2. could not agree more ! both yelp and tripadvisor are driving me nuts with this photos and reviews thing . maybe apple can implement a system where it controls and presents its own photos  reviews whereby third parties then fill in for missing data and countries not served ? i suspect these things will come in time , including the ones you mentioned , though apple  s methodically iterative approach sometimes does take more than a while .

3. whoah . does this ever work for you ? like after you meet the girl ? what happens ? she ' s just like , oh you are awesome i dont care that you photoshopped your photos ? or do you fess up , or just lie and say they are old ?   x200b   remind myself to never trust mens photos again  up until now , all i ' ve heard is my male friends or matches bitch about women who don ' t look like their profile pictures . what ' d you do if a girl showed up who looked nothing like what you pictured ? are you interested still ? people have a problem with that because it ' s being dishonest from the get go . it has nothing to do with what magazines do to make money , we are never going to meet them . or more people would know models don ' t look like that !

4. when every single picture has any filter of any kind and you can ' t tell what they really look like it drives me crazy . i stopped looking for girls on tinder because of that .
