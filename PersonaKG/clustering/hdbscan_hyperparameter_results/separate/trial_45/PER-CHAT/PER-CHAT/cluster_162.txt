1. the same thing happened to me . i do believe that there are induviduals who misuse sm and take it too far crossing the line to rape . mine eased me into a light sm world . very light . made me trust him . told me all of these things . then when i was pulling away from him he went from digit  digit and choked me into a submissive state . when you fear for your life and that you won ' t wake back up the next time he chokes you until you pass out , you go into shock . or at least i did . i thought " i can ' t say no because if he doesn ' t get what he wants he will hurt me more " and that was a serious thing for me because i couldn ' t possibly have imagined that he wanted more . but he did . then he went right past sm and straight towards torture and humiliation . all without my consent . he knew exactly what he was doing . he knew from our previous discussions that i never would have allowed that to happen . he also knew me . so he choked me enough to make it happen for him . i ' m sorry you went through all that . sm can be really tricky , my personal experience aside . because i really don ' t have any . but i did do a lot of reading on it after my rape . to help me understand why . it takes a lot of trust . if someone goes against your comfort zones it is not a good sign . a sm shoukd always be respectful no matter what .

2. i can understand why you ' re uncomfortable but i think the term rape gets thrown around too much sometimes and this is one of the times . would this have been such an issue of he didn ' t cum in you this time and just did what he normally would do ? i think the issue is more of him just not being careful about pregnancy not about the sex itself right ?

3. hey it  s good you  ve acknowledged you have a problem ! i don  t think disliking your boyfriends watching porn is inherently a crazy thing but the depths to which it  s making you suffer isn  t normal . do you have any trauma or mental illness history ? things of that nature can influence feelings like this . i know you said you  ve tried therapy but i would give it another go , and or make it a requirement that your bf  s don  t watch porn . some men don  t watch it in the first place

4. oh my god if his fetish has this much of a hold on his love life you don  t need to be with this person . have you told him everything you mentioned here ? about how uncomfortable and skin crawling hes being ? it  s cruel of him to expect you to change your body for his fetishy desires .

5. few men can resist swatting a woman ' s ass when presented in that manner ! lol . i see what you mean about the difference between wanting and needing submission . i hadn ' t thought about it in those terms . i think you ' re in a much better place than you realize , though  you ' ve grown confidence and you ' ve clearly thought through your emotions and understand yourself pretty well . you know you have a weakness , and you know you want to overcome it . your miles ahead of most people , and you have what hopefully is a promising relationship with a guy who won ' t push you back toward your old behavior because your relationship isn ' t based on a bdsm dynamic or even a common interest . and if he agrees to give you a light spanking now and then , so much the better !
