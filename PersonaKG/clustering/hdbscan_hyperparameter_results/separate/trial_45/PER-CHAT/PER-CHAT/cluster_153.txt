1. it really depends on where you live . some places require behind the wheel experience prior to getting a license , and the amount varies . do you live in a city with public transportation ? do you have friends or access to uber to get around ? what about a bicycle ? i would recommend trying to calmly talk to your parents about these things . maybe let them know that you do not want to move out the day you turn digit , but you will need certain freedoms to agree to stay . please don ' t speak angrily or sound like a threat . just explain what you want and listen to their side . maybe you can get a compromise .

2. do it ! who knows , maybe you ' ll fall into another career path you love even more ! i took off several years after college before taking the pre  reqs . i learned a ton , had some great experiences and some not  so  great experiences , and am pretty happy with my decision i guess we ' ll see how my cycle goes . i actually think you ' re very mature  you ' ve figured out what might be best for you !

3. i was just like you at one point . i had no idea what i was going to do . take any job that sounds legit . no craigslist ads or anything and be upfront . everyone in the world wants to work in hollywood . i don ' t live in l . a . , and i never wanted to . there are jobs all over the country that you ' ve never heard of that go almost unnoticed because everyone ' s solely focused in hollywood . it ' s a really long story , but it was a lot of fun and good fortune getting here . p . m . me for a very long story . by the way , i was scared too . i just didn ' t want to live my life letting fear hold me back . if you try , something will come of it .

4. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

5. it wouldn  t be a bad idea to have an older student tutor you . does your school have a peer tutoring program ? lots of people struggle with math and geometry takes a lot of understanding about different shapes as well as a lot of equations . it could be as simple as you simply don  t understand how it  s being explained to you and you need a new perspective . if you  re not willing to get a tutor you  re going to have to put in double time on studying . write and rewrite problems and how to solve them until you understand how you get the answer correct . you can do it ! it just might not be easy

6. apprenticeships ! you can work and get a degree at the same time . you do it with a company , you get a reduced salary , but it means you don ' t have to pay anything , and you get experience in the workplace . you do come out of it with a degree in whatever field your apprenticeship was in

7. i believe the benefit you  re speaking of is a state benefit for your father having a disability rating from veterans affairs . here  s the criteria . go to school . nothing wrong with doing what you  re talking about with the music store but realize that  s a hard path . take a variety of classes . see what  s out there for you . you may end up going after something totally different . i always encourage people to look into nursing . is it glamorous ? no . but you can make  60k per year for digit  digit hours per week . you can even do it with a two year degree . that also gives you an income where you can start giving music lessons or working part  time at music store so you can learn the business . best of luck to you

8. well if it were me i would definitely keep my solid plan a and atleast have the good job that you majored in . but at the same time don ' t just let your true love for writing die . i ' m not positive how to go about it but i feel like you could get your first book published and see how it does ?

9. i worked like this for a while digit years or so , and liked it . bosses understood we had to have breaks every now and then and we did when we wanted to . i do not think it ' s too bad , each brick  thing moved being less than digit kg and you can do the work how you like , it was more freedom than in most of my it work most bosses didn ' t know what they were talking about . so basically , i didn ' t see negatives  you got   from bosses for doing " hard work and not complaining " is good in any later work you like  apply . if you don ' t get decent wages then that ' s a different issue altogether .

10. don  t worry about those digit b  s . i  m going to be a senior and as of right now my gpa is at digit . digit , i  ve not taken a single ap class and have made a couple bs as my final averages . you know whether or not you can achieve as in a class and if you did your best and still made bs , it shouldn  t matter because you tried your best

11. you can try . but engineering is hard , it can be really frustrating when you don ' t understand something . i ' d tell you to get a teacher , but you can certainly try to do that on your own . who knows , it might work . you ' re doing something really challenging . be prepared to be frustrated , but be patient and persistent .

12. every job will do , as long as you adjust your living standards . i don ' t want to argue that living coast are way to high in the last few years . and that mini jobbers don ' t get paid enough , is also true . but thats how things are at the moment , so you have to adjust . at most places your job you doing besides beeing in school won ' t pay you an own apartment . the higher the coasts of living are in a city , the more you have to find things to cut out . get a roommate , maybe even more . just buy cheap foods that are on discount and stock them . use a bike if possible instead of public transport quit your gym and start bodyweight training shorten your shower times buy everything possible used . sadly a lot of students have to work a lot , while also balancing school life , without a fair payment . so you will just need to be really lucky with your job or you have to really cut back in your living standarts for a few years . maybe even share a room and give up your privacy . i don ' t wanna get into finding somebody helping you out with money , you probably wouldn ' t have asked if this possibility exists . hopefully we students use this unfairness as motivation to make it possible for the next generation to have a healthy work school balance and getting a fair payment .

13. digit months ago heck , even digit months ago is a long time to remember content from test . i absolutely think it ' s representative . the odds of you remembering more than digit random question are very slim . when i retook the tests , i think i remembered digit question total not per exam . i just retook fl digit the last time i took it was in late march  1st week of april , and i seriously didn ' t remember anything from the test . 3rd party exams tend to be deflated , so i wouldn ' t worry about those too much . if anything , they ' ll help you hone in on areas you need work on . you ' re doing great !

14. is english not your first language ? you don ' t need a degree , any degree helps . but you can show up to some smaller towns and look up lesson plans online and just start teaching . build your clientele , develop a reputation , and grow your business

15. hey all , so i ' m currently a 1st year physics student in one of the better uk unis and am starting to fear for my future . the thing is i only have enough money to sustain myself for the duration of the course , that means that i will only have the opportunity to do one internship because of how the uk system works , no masters studies , no digit year industry placements . so after digit years i will have a bsc in physics and will be looking for a job . i ' ve tried reading up online what a physics graduate can do , however most of the conversations are geared towards masters and phd ' s and for undergrads they usually talk about majors  minors in the us , which isn ' t a thing here , i only have physics to my name . now , i don ' t care that much if my job has little or nothing to do with my course , as long as it doesn ' t feel like my education was a complete waste of time . though it seems to me like i can ' t get into nucleaoptics  medical  meteorological physics , because they have enough masters and phd applicants . i like programming , but i won ' t be qualified enough to compete against compsci  engineering graduates , even if i take extra modules in them .   x200b  so besides teaching which i really don ' t want to do , am i completely screwed ? i only have one chance at an internship , what sector should i aim for that has no problems accepting physics bsc ' s with a little bit of experience ?

16. what are you studying ? if it ' s not something you can take to the marketplace and secure a job right away because of your education you may be wasting your time and money . also , if you are going deep in debt for your education beware .

17. think about your network . can you build one quickly , can you survive without it ? if the answer is no , don ' t go . you are married . how does your husband feel about it ? is your relationship solid enough for long distance . if it works out , what will your husband do for work ? can he transfer ? its your decision , but you are also a team . if he doesn ' t want to leave or can ' t , you may not want to take the job . can your finances handle supporting two households ? if you move to establish the homebase across the country , your husband still needs to maintain the current home . this means a strain on the finances . can you afford it ? do you want to ?

18. just apply , you don ' t need any experience . you apply , they call you in , you take a test , if you pass they do an interview .

19. if it bothers you that much , think about it more like this  your parents are rich , you ' re not . you don ' t have to take their money if it makes you uncomfortable . if you ' re old enough to move out go for it . tell em you want to succeed on your own merits , then try it .

20. in toronto theres a company called fix it females that higher mostly women but they want ppl who are ' ' experienced ' ' even though a lot of them aren ' t , but apply anyway say you have painting experience . best way honestly is to be a helpelabor at sites , sweeping , passing tools , moving what you can etc . and you gain experience through that . tbh like digit  of construction crews your ganna experience peverted guys cause most of them are rough around the edges high school drop out type guys so you gotta find the right crew
