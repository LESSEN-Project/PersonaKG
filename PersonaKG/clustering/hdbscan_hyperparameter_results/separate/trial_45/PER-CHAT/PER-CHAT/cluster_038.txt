3. could his terrible decision making and chronic lying and inordinate greed and hate mongering not infect every aspect of life in america ? i will stop talking about that guy and will actually stop thinking about him forever when he is in jail where he belongs . frankly , the fact that a person could commit this many freaking felonies with zero repercussions and still have people saying , " ew , can we just stop talking about him " let alone actual supporters denying that he is a con man and a criminal are a lot more remarkable to me than the fact that his behavior comes up every time the topic is " something stupid " or " something evil " or " something that needs to be changed  fixed " people who actually like america should be talking about it more . it will already take decades for us to repair the damage he ' s done so far . so yeah , he might come up in conversation proportionate to his impact on the world . if you would rather live in a place where nobody feels safe offering their opinion on politics , you could move to china .

4. it  s unclear what knowledge , or lack thereof , hannity is using to make his prediction . i hadn ' t listened to hannity in almost a decade , so i first asked the question " how the fuck does this putz know any damn thing about the inside of that administration "  phone calls between hannity and trump are frequent occurrences , discussing everything from hannity  s show to trump  s frustration with the mueller investigation and to what the president should tweet , according to more than a dozen friends , advisers and associates of trump and hannity who told the washington post in april . oh . you know , somehow this seems worse than trump being a fan of alex jones . at least he ' s widely known as a crackpot yelling from the fringe . hannity is still , somehow , mainstream .

5. as someone who stays outside the usa i can honestly say that i ' m not even surprised any time he says things like this any more . i should be shocked or embarrassed for him but i ' m way beyond that .

6. you should see his previous speeches where he essentially generalized the population of mexico as a bunch of rapists , murderers , and thieves . i can ' t figure out the exact reason , but this has to be a smoke screen . someone , somewhere is doing something diabolical , but we ' re fixated on trump and what he will say next . tl  dr illuminaughty touched my body .

7. amlo is just another stooge that protects and propagates the interests of transnational capital . he provides cover and a nice veneer while the capitalists go in and loot the natural resources , markets and labor of the country . much in the style of an obama or trudeau . i have no idea why you think anyone would care what time the asshole wakes up at and why you find this at all admirable . it ' s funny you would leave out the chavistas and maduro . why do you have such little political imagination ? why do you think your liberal tendencies are at all permissible in this sub ? are you another one of these white latin american men that has no problem stomping on the rights of indigenous peoples so long as capital accumulation processes can go on unabated ?

9. no , he ' s not . unlike satan , trump is real . he ' s not a threat because he ' s evil or out to watch the world burn while he cackles . he ' s a threat because he ' s out only for his own power and is unwilling to compromise on anything or admit any sort of mistakes like his general pershing claims . he lies constantly . not in the way other politicians do , either . he lies about meaningless bullshit that embarrasses him when disproved like lying about being invited on talk shows and major issues that can place the us in a tenuous situation like lying about how the us is in a prime position to rain hell down on north korea , when the navy hadn ' t changed it ' s readiness level . he is uneducated on what it takes to be president , he is a horrible businessman , he has never been proven to have any knowledge of foreign affairs , he places his own family in positions of authority they have no qualifications for , and he is a massive hypocrite . he ' s blatantly unqualified for the job he has . he needs to go , as soon as possible . anyone with eyes can see that .
