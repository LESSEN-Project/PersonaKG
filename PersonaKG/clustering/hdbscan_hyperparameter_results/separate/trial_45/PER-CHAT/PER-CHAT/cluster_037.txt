1. jeez , and i thought i had to much free time on my hands . why would anyone want to watch them without the context of the game ? that seems so weird to me

3. yeah that ' s fair enough , although players like t . brady and sydney crosby actually do do that , it ' s just more difficult for then to build super teams around them . lebron has only been able to carry a shit tier roster to the finals twice in his career , and in this year ' s case a lot has to do with the weak competition in the east . also the commercials , stoppages , and fouls are actually the biggest issue with the nba . the o my reason it seems like the " main theme " is because it ' s them only thing people are responding to . they have no answer for the terrible stoppages , fouls , and commercial breaks .

4. with soccefootball there are so many players around the world , plus the transfeloan system , it makes it easy for the wealthy clubs to acquire good players . in the nba it ' s a lot more difficult , sometimes there is nothing they can do . teams like the lakers and knicks would have been relegated a few years ago , despite how big of fan bases and wealth they have .

5. i haven  t watched in some time now , but there was a time , where i used to watch every single episode . why ? you ask . for the same reason i tell idiots who claim it  s fake . we all know it  s scripted , but the answer is in its description  sports entertainment  it  s fine if you aren  t entertained by it , but why ruin it for the rest of us that are entertained by it ?

6. it ' s because no one who lives from delhi is actually from delhi . most other teams are centered around states whereas delhi isn ' t classified as a state and it ' s tiny compared to other states . new management have gathered loads of new fans . mostly college students but good nonetheless
