3. i ' d imagine a vast majority of people attempting to get this skin did it in the first few days of it being released , and we saw zero proof of it being unboxed during a time where most superior packs or packs in general were probably being opened . i ' m less likely to believe it actually existed during that time than i am to believe that they simply waited less than a day before notifying players of an increase . as much as i hate to don a tinfoil hat , it ' s also possible that they purposely delayed the tweet just to make it seem like it was actually obtainable before . if anybody went as far as to take some sort of legal action against them for falsely advertising an item as a possible reward in a virtual lottery , delaying the tweet is one way for them to prove themselves innocent .
