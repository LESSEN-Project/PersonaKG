1. even the new tim comes as a gift . and no one claimed that this is more than a slight refresh . nobody has the reason to complain , especially when the new parts are going at the old prices .

2. i have to agree honestly . as much as i like skins with different styles , this new mentality of " i dont like their hat , get rid of it " and " make this character blue because i said so " is so uncalled for

3. i feel like ever since digit took over everything halo has severely dropped in quality apparently that includes text on a box which would be so easy to spot and cheap to fix that they just really must not give a shit anymore

4. yeah exactly . i personally don ' t really like the new design myself , but if people do , perhaps there ' s something there that i may have missed out on . perhaps some cool new feature i missed out on that makes it better than what ' s already here . i mean , if it ' s not broken , why fix it ?

5. yeah , they could have swapped these amateur  oriented modes " effects " and " scene " for u3 and u4 . they messed this up on the d7100 by putting " effects " between u1  u2 and m  a  s  p and i still like the d7000 ' s approach on this for the same reason  on this type of camera , they could easily go with m  a  s  p , u1  u2  u3 and nothing more . if the d750 could go up to , say , digit fps with a grip and if it had an adequate buffer depth , it would be something of an upgrade from the d700 . i agree it could be named d650 , because the d6xx could have more serious af in the first place . if i was soon going for an fx body , i ' d gladly pay the price of the digit for a d750 without these things that are crippling it .
