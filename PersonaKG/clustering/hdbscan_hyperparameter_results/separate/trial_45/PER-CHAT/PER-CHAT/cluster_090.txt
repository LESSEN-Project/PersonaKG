3. because you can get back at those who hate you and think you won ' t amount to anything by living to see them grow old and whither and die while you laugh in their faces living a happy life while the only thing that made them happy was ruining the life of others . and you can and do attribute to society . whether you ' re following the status quo or trying to change it or even actively go against it no matter what you are contributing . culture doesn ' t change without someone changing it . if martin luther king jr didn ' t exist there ' s a large chance that there would be even more racism thrown towards the african american people . if shows like ru pauls drag race or queen eye not exist the lgbt community wouldn ' t get the recognition respect and love it deserves . you could be the next world changer . and if you aren ' t there ' s nothing wrong with that . not everyone can be as influential as that . but , even if you arent you can still get back at those empty terrible people with no one to love and no one who loves them by living better and being happy . it might take a lot it might take a while and it will most likely be hard but wouldn ' t it be worth it to see them look at you happy and healthy while they wallow in their own sadness to the point of having to take it out on others ? their words and actions and feelings may hurt you to the enth degree and there will always be more people like that who do those kinds of terrible cowardly things but the best way to get back at them is to not become what they think you will . you can do it . i believe in you . the human will can do so much more than you think and i know you can get put of this hole that they ' ve thrown you in and look at them triumphantly as you stand atop th mound of dirt they dug . i know you can do it . everyone can no matter how feeble or weak thy think themselves to be , everyone has the strength to climb out of their hole . especially you . good luck in your journey op .

4. im really interested in how your scar looks . i know i sound pretty creepy , but i just like seeing some wounds but they are being really not nice to you , as if it was your fault that you happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and get injured by the wrong person . i understand that it may make people especially kids feel uncomfortable , but if they just see things like that from a young age , they just won ' t grow as discriminant as the people are nowadays . i wish you best luck , and don ' t let people limit you just because of some damn scar . that doesn ' t make you a different being . you ' re still the same human as everyone .

5. you sound classy and intelligent . don  t let people make you feel bad for being passionate about anything . are you mixed race ? i  ve read this book and really i think everyone should read it but i feel like it would especially benefit you . it  s called  born a crime  by trevor noah . i think you would really enjoy it and maybe it could bring you some understanding as to why you  re facing these problems and another way of looking at it and having someone to relate to .

6. i  m not a very . consoling person , but you know what ? fuck  em . i know it  s really hurtful to have strangers comment on your appearance , but they  re the sad fucks who  re mocking passerby  s . but you ? you  re working hard to turn it around , and that  s commendable . so keep it up

7. where did you gather that i think everyone owes me something ? last time i checked friendships are a two way street . i get what you  re saying bro , but you don  t and never will know the extent of my friendships with these people . and just for the future , there are nicer ways of getting this point across . maybe think twice next time you call a suicidal person a  douche who thinks everything is a fucking gift  .
