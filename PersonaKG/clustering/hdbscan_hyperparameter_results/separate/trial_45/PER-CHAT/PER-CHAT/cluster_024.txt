4. yeah that ' s what i was also thinking about , like i understand it was declutter but she kept saying how much she loved it and how good it was , i thought it was a tad wasteful tbh and she wouldn ' t of been able to sell it or give it to a friend as it was so used . yeah i think if it ' s a tutorial you could just show the colour and i ' m sure unless it ' s the rarest colour ever majority of people would have the exact same colour or similar in their collection .

5. i can see your point . i have no idea who this artist is as a person . i always try to separate the art from the artist but thank you for letting me know about them .
