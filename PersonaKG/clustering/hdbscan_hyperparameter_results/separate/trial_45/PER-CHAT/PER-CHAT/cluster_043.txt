1. i have no issue with sex workers , i don  t like how tons of people on twitter are attacking anyone critical or satirical of sex work like it someone makes you immune to lampoonery or criticism but why should it bother me what consenting adults do for a living ? also i  d be remiss if i didn  t laugh about the thot audit fiasco in which all these premium snapchat hoes got investigated by the irs for not paying taxes on their income . don  t say we need to treat sex work as real work and then try to avoid income tax

2. first of all , thank you your response . i don ' t need imagine what it was like being gay and hated for it digit years ago . i experienced it first  hand and growing up in caribbean as a young child . i experienced hatred from non  police officers and non  white people . people can be assholes regardless of their skin colour or profession . assholes are assholes regardless of physical appearance . and people can be great people even if at first glance they don ' t look super nice or friendly . anyway was seeing a lot of " they can march in the parade , just not in their uniform " being written , but the impression i was getting is they they simply aren ' t wanted so that ' s why i was asking . i respect if people don ' t want people identifying as police officers there . i have my own feelings on the issue and those are affected by my past experiences . so , i ' d imagine it ' s the same with other peopel . i ' m just seeking to understand other people ' s points of view on the issue , so thanks again for sharing yours . it was very informative in a good way . do you feel walking on a group wearing a blue and white t  shirt that says tps is different than a group walking in a green t  shirt that says td ? i think your partially answered this question in your second last paragraph , but i ' m not sure i understood what you wrote there because the end of that paragraph seems to contradict the start of it .

3. alot of guys do . i ' ve had girls trying to get me to do it but . i don ' t do it . what does it matter really ?

4. maybe it ' s just me but i don ' t think i ' ve ever really been around people who really care that much about how others get their rocks off , and i ' ve lived in three different countries all over the world . sure , people might crack a joke or tease someone for it , but i don ' t think anyone really cares any more than they would if they found out about any other fetish . it ' s simply a non  issue . that ' s why the parades  culture thing feels so bizarre to me . it ' s as if they are deliberately attracting attention and criticism by shouting about something that the general public couldn ' t care less about .

5. i see that , but it  s still the fact of if someone doesn  t want to see it , why would you do it there ? just like there are toilets , there are also breast pumps or you could just do it at home . i would completely be alright if it were at home with friends over , but when it is random strangers , just be used you have a child doesn  t mean you get to expose yourself for your convenience

6. " being gay just means you like guys , so if you are a girl that likes guys you ' re gay . i don ' t see why people make a big deal out of being gay "

7. i totally agree ! it ' s hurtful and harmful for so many reasons and for everyone ! why does anyone want that straight bar right where the jumblies are !

8. i cut my own hair . but if rather have a woman do it . total stereotype here , but i think they do a better job .

9. i ' m talking about people who aren ' t being harmful to anyone at pride . the man pictured above is just trying to participate in pride like a normal human being . whatever his job is shouldn ' t matterunless it was meant to cause harm , which it isn ' t . he just wants to have fun and celebrate pride month with his fellow gays . by commenting this it seems like you want to keep this gay man from being happy , and that is homophobic . good day .

10. why ? because all men must be manly ? again , it  s because you don  t like it that it is a problem . not a problem for the guy wearing the make up because he likes it . also , i don  t count restaurant staff as role models for my children . i am their role model , and i will explain to them time and time again that people can express who they are , even if we don  t find it  normal  or  cool  .

11. tending to attract attention    doing it for attention . i  m saying you are wrong because you are unilaterally defining motives for a large group of individuals without actually providing evidence other than  well i can  t think of another reason  . you are the one who made the claim that all flamboyance is for attention , you need to defend it . also , your definition of flamboyance doesn  t even serve your point . nowhere there does it talk about loudly talking about their sexual encounters . my reason for pushing he idea that is that , because you seem to be ignoring the fact that straight people literally do just as much as  flamboyant  gay guys . if your issue with it isn  t that they are gay , you need to have an issue with anyone talking about their sex lives loudly which again , straight people do not just people who are flamboyant . my point is , if people  s private conversations bother you , no matter how loud they are , don  t listen to it . whether they  re gay or straight , or male or female . it  s not a personal problem for all straight people , it  s an issue you personally seem to have . it  s also not really a double standard because loudly yelling about your sex life , regardless of sexual orientation , in a workplace is frowned upon . like i  ve said , you don  t seem to have an issue with the fact that , whether you care to admit it or not , straight people do the same thing as well , so yea , right now it does sound like your issue is with gay people .

12. why do you feel like you have to defend that activity ? you do understand that for most people , this looks strange , right ?
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

13. when a guy let  s a girl dress him up and put make up on him to impress a girl . if it  s who you are , ok more power to you . but if you let someone change who you are just to impress them , wack .
