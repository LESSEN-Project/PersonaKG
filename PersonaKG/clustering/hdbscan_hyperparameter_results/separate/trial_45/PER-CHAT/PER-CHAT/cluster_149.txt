4. a lot of girls and guys have their  list  of celebrities they would sleep with . most people know it  s never going to happen , so it seems harmless enough . she was trying to get you to play the game too , so it doesn  t sound like she meant to hurt you . if it  s something that really bothers you , tell her about it . i think it  s admirable that you want to be the best version of yourself for her . maybe use it as an opportunity to ask her what characteristics make her attracted to those people and whether she would like it if you had those characteristics . she  ll likely say no because it sounds like she loves you exactly the way you are and you should never feel pressured to change for anyone .

5. why do you need to tell her he is trans ? just say they are your boyfriend . you don ' t need to " out " him to her , even with permission . its unnecessary in this circumstance additional information , and if you want your grandmother to fund your education , it seems like you should just either not say anything or just not disclose that unnecessary detail .

6. just so i understand  you  re gay but have a girlfriend and this isn  t enough to keep up your charade . you need to make the guys you hang out with jealous by making this girl dress to show off her body . then you  re going to introduce this girl to your family and want her to dress like this again for them . what  s the plan here ? you seem like you don  t know what you want . in another thread , you say you  re coming out to your mother because you don  t have any money . you  re all over the place . any way you could just be your authentic self ? or if you  re going to remain closeted to some in your family , why march this girl around having her partake in your lie ? you could just be single .
