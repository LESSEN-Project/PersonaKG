4. we as humans like to apply black and white labels to everything . there is nothing wrong with emotions . there are things wrong with what people do with them or how we feed them

5. deserving something means they ' re worthy of it . i personally don ' t think anybody is worthy of leading an entirely bad life . sure , we make mistakes that can negatively impact our lives for a period of time . however , i believe people are trying to have a good life to the best of their ability . their best may not be seen as such  for example , people who intentionally inflict harm on others . there ' s some pain they feel that is relieved by doing so . of course there are other outlets yet they don ' t know that . i also should clarify that i don ' t agree with using harm to heal personal wounds  there ' s very few i downright despise . maybe i ' m just too nice though

6. so every mistake you ever made in your entire life was a conscious choice of yours and you have absolutely no right to complain about any of the consequences , just because you should have known better ?

7. i didn ' t imply that , you inferred that very incorrectly i might add . all i said was they matter , and you twisted my statement around to make it something it ' s not . you really don ' t know how mental illness works , do you ? tell a suicidal person to just buck up and see what happens . most likely , it ' s not gonna do a damn thing for them .

8. this hits too close to home . i hope you ' ll find your peace with it . we all deserve the best we can get . more times than not what we want is the best we can get . why life takes exactly that , is a question that will remain unanswerd .
   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

9. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .
