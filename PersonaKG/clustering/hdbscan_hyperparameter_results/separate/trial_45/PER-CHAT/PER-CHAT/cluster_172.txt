1. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

2. if you have low self confidence it ' s probably because there are things about you that you don ' t like . if having a girlfriend is the only thing about you that you don ' t like and you expect another person to love you without loving yourself , than you ' re going to have an unhealthy relationship . find out what you need to do to love yourself before looking for someone else and when you succeed the right person will come around . and if she doesn ' t , it doesn ' t matter , because you ' re happy .

3. i think your problem begins when you state " i would be a good boyfriend , " and proceed to list off all these other reasons why you ' re supposedly " amazing . " i ' d say you ' re your own worst enemy here .

4. my opinion , go out more . not to a bar or club more like a social event at the park find someone whose doing something similar to something you feel passionate about . ex girl jogging in the park go join her keep her company ask like how long have you been jogging here ? then improvise from there obviously ask her for her name just dont make it the first question so you seem interested at her hobby aswell as herself . next try to get into the friend area yes i know you don ' t want to be here but this stage is where youll learn the most truthful information about her . next start sharing life moments you wouldnt tell most people just think before you say it so it doesn ' t sound like extra baggage for the person . eventually youll know when to ask her on a date

5. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .

6. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them

7. the dating climate sucks these days but dont settle . im saying this with a totally jaded perspective where i should be like , " ill take what i can get " but dont settle for " what you can get "  own your value , and quality men will appreciate your confidence in knowing you ' re more valuable than a backup girl and will treat you much better than this jabroni .
