1. it ' s confusing . long story short . if you have the capability to fall in love with a person , that says so much about how powerful your capacity to love is . people have all of these rules to let them feel emotions . we forget that we don ' t always need to wait for company to have fun , for money to feel rich , for gains to feel strong , or for a partner to feel love . we can feel these emotions really whenever . when you give yourself permission to love someone , you are actually just exercising your very talent of being able to generate love , and you subconsciously let the feeling override other programs in your brain . it is a practice that you are actually doing with yourself and all by yourself , you just think that you are having that experience because someone else is there . similar to how hateful people deep down truly hate themselves , people who are loving people deep down truly love themselves . this isn ' t toxic at all , it ' s just a dynamic that what you project onto the world is a result of how your feel inside . if you can go so far as to fall in love with someone , you must perhaps underneath many layers truly and genuinely love yourself .

2. they have a strict " we don ' t do that " policy listed on their website . also , in past experiences , when i told the suicide hotline that i was suicidal they pretty much just say " okay , why tho ? " like , the only time they would call the cops is it you were at the edge of a building or had a gun in your hand . just general " i am suicidal and want to die " is what they are there for . also , pro tip  if you don ' t like the person you ' re talking to , hang up and call again . it takes about digit mins for them to get back on the line , so you ' ll get someone new . i ' ve had to do that before once or twice .

3. i think that those who say they ' re going to kill themselves are either trying to guilt trip someone like you said , maybe some people might do it for attention but i think the other main reason is because they need help with a lot of shit that ' s going on in their life

4. i wonder why that is . it couldn ' t possibly be because men are conditioned to keep their emotions all bottled up and also that they ' re conditioned to be more violent than women so when they do act out they tend choose more violent means of suicide the fact that women attempt suicide more than men kind of proves this  if we attempt suicide more often than men , why do we actually die in fewer numbers ? hmm it sure is a conundrum .

5. in their minds though , they ' ve convinced themselves it has nothing to do with love .

6. it takes over literally every aspect of your life . everything . it gets to a point where you literally have to put yourself before anything else . it can seem narcissistic to people who don  t know what you  re going through , but when it comes between wanting to blow your brains out and everything else , it  s an easy choice . hopefully
