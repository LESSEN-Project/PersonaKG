6. no problem . hopefully there are more like you in the world . fair play to you for wanting to brighten up a strangers day . another thing would be leaving post  its on mirrors in public toilets telling the next person how great they look  have a lovely smile  fabulous hair . or if you are out to dinner and it ' s really good , specifically ask to see the chef and give them a tip . i don ' t think they get them very often .
