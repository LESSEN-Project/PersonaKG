1. that ' s why i decided to go into computer science . it ' s basically a sure thing . there are corporations out there who need programmers and the skill shortage isn ' t threatening to go away any time soon , so it ' s a good industry to go into . however , i ' ve always loved telling stories , which is why i love to write . i ' d probably write superhero stories and horror stories . they ' re my favorite genres as well as two things the public never seems to tire of . thanks for responding .
