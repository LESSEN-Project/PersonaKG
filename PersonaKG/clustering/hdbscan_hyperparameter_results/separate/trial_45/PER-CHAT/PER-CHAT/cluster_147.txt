1. the connections you make can be more important than the things you learn in the classroom . so if there are clubs and internships related to the job you want do them . look for jobs that have skills related to what you want to do , or can at least sell to your future employer . the worst ? you find out you hate what you are going into but can change to something else before you are too invested ! the best ? valuable connections that will help you get where you want to go . remember , its not what you know its who you know .

2. you ' re probably better off talking to a career counselor , or going to a job centre for this kind of thing . you can also check out the book , " what color is your parachute " , for general career advice .
