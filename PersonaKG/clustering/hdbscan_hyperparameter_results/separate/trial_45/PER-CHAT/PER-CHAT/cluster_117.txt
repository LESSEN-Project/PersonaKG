1. it  s been like that for awhile , the god given rights for guns and there wasn  t a lot of gun crime until like the 1980s
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

2. people are raised in a certain way and if everyone around you thinks that way throughout your time living there it  s really hard to be critical of that way of thinking because you  d be going against everything everyone you know believes , in short , peer pressure on a larger scale
   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

3. probably because they can . some countries you dont get the right of freedom of religion , so in the us people can express themselves with it .
   (ID: 3ad18913fe75fd4a63c4ae0d0255c37d90fd7144)

4. . let people do what they want to do unless they are not really harming others . i do not think most of the christians spread hate against the other people . what do you gain if you deny god ?
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

5. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

6. i feel the exact same way about people of color that constantly shit on white people and make blanket statements about them . you don ' t like it when people do that to you , so why would you do that somebody else ?
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

7. insular people have always done this to protect their own worldview . races , religions , ethnicities , classes , etc . they  ve all been scapegoated and hated for no solid reason because one group feels threatened . i dislike religion because of the use of dogma to legitimize cruelty , but worst of all is hypocrisy . conservatives want to claim to be about individual liberty , unless they feel so inclined to limit any particular group on a whim . christians want to claim to be a bastion of love and patience , but only for a small subset of people who personally serve their agendas . it  s not a difference in opinion that separates you from most of them , it  s iq points !
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)

8. because we leave the freedoms to the individual . some people are retarded and make poor decisions ie not paying attention in school , have kids at digit years old , or joining gangs instead of filling their time with more productive means
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

9. i draw the line up to where someone tells another person to harm another . example   go out and cause x harm  or  go harass x  and the logical call to actions like saying there  s a fire in a movie theater when there really isn  t . other than that it  s fair game no matter how hateful the words are .
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

10. i agree that hubris is one of our species ' flaws . i myself am a religious christian , and i while i do think we are special compared to animals , i believe in scientific proof , before dogma . accordingly , i believe in evolution and climate change , too . there is all the evidence in the world , that gays are normal , and not to be hated . the church says many things i disagree with , so i choose only to follow the stuff that lifts us as human creatures . you know what i mean , right ? don ' t steal . don ' t hump anyone else ' s wife , or your sister . do help people out whenever you can . be honest . be fair . call out liars . etc . basically , if it improves the quality of life , i ' m in . if it tells me to harm someone   like , " let ' s go hate gays ! "   i ' m out .

11. it ' s not wrong , but it ' s sad . you should strive to have more self control and let people have less power over you . is it wrong to call someone a racial slur ? of course . do people do it anyway ? of course . should a car hit you when you ' re crossing the street ? no . do you look both ways before your cross anyway ? hopefully . you know there are going to be people who will say things to intentionally upset you . the best weapon you have against that is not letting it bother you .
   (ID: 74058c90ada3aae7a59703064acbf3ced38f3681)

12. yta let people be the people they are and for the times they do things that you don ' t agree with let that shit go and just have fun with them .
