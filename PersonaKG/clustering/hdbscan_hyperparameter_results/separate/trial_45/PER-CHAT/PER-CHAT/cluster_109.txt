3. i  m way better at talking online and stuff than in person cause i get time to edit my thoughts and refine them somewhat but when you  re in person there  s no deleting a sentence or rephrasing , it  s like pen vs pencil and i  ve always absolutely predicted pencils especially when i try to do art

4. dude , i think the main part of social skills is knowing different social clues  hints people give . for example  someone on their phone  they are busy and find it rude when people try to interrupt them someone looks really happy and approachable  most likely would be willing to talk to you someone is responding in few words , doesn ' t sound very engaged  probably not interested and sometimes , these social ques can help you determine how well the conversation is going , and maybe signal that you ' re doing something wrong

6. i found an article about it on the web  and another in psychology today  the trick is , with a few polite questions and comments , to start a more meaningful conversation , but stick to appropriate topics such as  the weather . the person that you want to talk to . talk very little about yourself . people love to talk about them selves . once they are talking , ask questions like  what do you like to do for fun  or  for a living  also , study non  verbal cues , like facial expressions , and body language . if someone points their face or feet away from you , they may not want to talk . another thing to remember is that it  s just for enjoyment , and to try to get to know someone . don  t put too much pressure on yourself to get it right every time , nobody does . this includes neuro  typicals . it  s difficult for many people , not just autistic people . i think , however , as an autistic individual , that if you approach the matter analytically , that you may have great success at it .

9. haha ! so we are quite the opposite ! i always wear jogging pants and stupid ass t  shirts that say something like nanana boo boo stick your head in doo  doo . i try to go for the slavic style so i can blend in with all the polish and russian people in my area . hell even my car when i hit the throttle it will have diesel fumes in the entire street . i try to give more gas when i see mom ' s with strollers so the diesel will inject their bodies with microparticles . i dislike my family and will never go to " social occasions " but to really give an answer on your question . don ' t get caught in the first place ! watch every law and order episode . and one day you think to yourself he this is pretty easy .
