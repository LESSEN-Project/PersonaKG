4. maybe . maybe . maybe . i can  t art but i sure can write ! so i guess i  ll just describe the dress then ? it would be really poofy but not so much that it doesn  t disguise his body from the neck down . it would be white with gold highlights running along it , with translucent gold shoulder pads with the askr insigniasymbol ? inside them . the veil would be white with touches of purple to match who he  s marryingits bruno . and also a gold bow on the back . i think that  s a detailed enough description incase anybody wants to draw it ! just credit me for the design please !
