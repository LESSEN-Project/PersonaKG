4. fucking london man . i am a cyclist back in my little town but they cyclists here are unforgiveable . no wonder they get such a bad wrap from people like clarkson . doesn ' t matter if it ' s your right of way , if you ' re on foot , they will charge you down . they terrorise any cross walks and , on mixed used footpaths , go waaay faster than is safe with dogs and kids about . yes i have seen some taxis pull out or across them but you can see the situations develop easily they just try their luck . just crazy stupid . so far , in three days i have nearly been hit by digit motorised vehicles and about digit bikes not stopping at lights
