1. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .

4. none are droid leaders . and to throw jawas in there like it  s a solution is laughable . i get what you saying though but all of those choices barring the laughable jawas and my man lobot are better with their actual factions .

5. the thing is , phoenix aren ' t meta . they just help a lot early in the game as their tags allow you to unlock ep , thrawn and chimaera . it saves you time and makes you pretty competitive early on in arena .
