2. that ' s horrible ! law should protect people no matter what , not allowing to hurt them legally . i ' m from poland . my physics teacher is roasting and disrespecting whole lgbt  and other minorities all the time . he ' d better teach us physics but noooo . he ' s been teaching in this school for years and it seems nobody ever complained about him to the headteachers , or they did but it had no effect . i guess there are multiple teachers like him here . even wort ones

   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

5. ahh , now you ' re playing stupid , huh ? way to show intellectual honesty . really . well done . thanks again for displaying what fucking liars you all are . way to show , again , that you have to lie through your teeth just to feel like you aren ' t a bunch of fucking rats . seriously . thank you .

6. i am following the rules of this sub , and spreading out my posts . none of my posts have had the same core point nor were they copy and pasted versions with each one being written completely originally and from scratch so i am not spamming . i am providing detailed arguments of the lore , and discussing those arguments with others here . and in the process i have remained respectful to those who disagree with me , despite several trying use insults to make me back down . an echo chamber is not healthy for the community . and if you want me to leave the subreddit completely simply because you disagree with an opinion on the lore , that is exactly what you are promoting .

7. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

8. ever country shows certain degree of hypocrisy . when there are so many people in a single country , long term rational decisions are tough to take as humans tend to give more weightage to short term experiences while making decisions . also in democracy leader who want to come to power again , it ' s easier to take actions which seems sweet for short term . that migrant worker construction  worker most probably , isn ' t gonna vote .

9. lol , ok ok . i ' ll stop . dude , for you own sanity . realise that this is a shitpost . my account is a shitpost account . you are arguing with me on a heavily down voted thread that almost no one will ever see . look in the mirror , remind yourself that you are a human being that doesn ' t need to get upset about idiots on the internet that are clearly doing stuff to get a rise out others . cause dude . it ' s not ever gonna stop . get used to it .

10. do you realize what day and age this is ? did you just get from , like , digit years in the future , where it ' s some utopia , and you ' re surprised that this sort of thing doesn ' t get the attention and reform it deserves , or something ? yes . we call the future europe .  if you disagree , we ' re literally going to have to break down the semantics of " intent " so that you can understand . yes , i do disagree . let ' s break down the semantics of intent . according to the oxford dictionary , " intent " means intention or purpose . purpose in turn is " a particular requirement or consideration , typically one that is temporary or restricted in scope or extent  " i think that fits rather well .

11. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .

12. you have a perceived notion on the us government ' should ' run . which you literally just proved my point . you don ' t understand how they actually work .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

13. lol ad hominems are a sign that you ' re triggered . calm down and see it for what it is , humor . if you cannot i certainly can ' t help you . i ' m not going to respond to you after this reply you ' ll just have to stew in your misguided anger . have a great day smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

14. first off bud , i  ve played since alpha . secondly i didn  t say anything was over powered , you do know how to read don  t you ? they asked what we thought was the best character offensively , it  s an opinionated post , the  competitive  aspect of the subreddit has nothing to do with options or thoughts . your assumptions and negative responses are the exact reason this game is dying .
   (ID: ef2135d90df57b27df5e96791848d8d9201afd29)

15. you ' re ridiculous and making your whole movement look bad . do you want to know why vegans are seen as a joke to so many people ? because of the ones like you that are outspoken but can ' t form a proper thought .
   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

16. i dont see how my attitude is hateful . ive never said that i hate all incels or thought of them less than anyone else . ive only said that they sometimes have radical ideas . how could you possibly know what i want ?
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

17. im not taking everything so seriously , but if you read your respond on my answer it can only go over wrong .
   (ID: 4beccb79954eaf4ba6b69b6ac31b148b48f4f579)

18. that hs nothing to do with it . nice try though . the game had no real progression . it felt like a waste of time to me . hey look everybody ! someone who is a crybaby because someone has an opinion on reddit !
   (ID: 3dfcdf92c717ed4c117768210afcbbaf9a2ca8a9)

19. i like facts and reason . why do you use words you don ' t understand ?
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

20. yes i  m fully aware , but through consistent elaboration then maybe i could help at least one person learn the truth and show them the difference . as long as just one person learns from me , then my efforts are all worth it
