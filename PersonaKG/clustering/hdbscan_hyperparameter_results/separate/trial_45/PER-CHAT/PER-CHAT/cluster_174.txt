SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 40

1. i don ' t think the issue here is that you asked for his last name . maybe you should just take his words at face value  that it ' s taken so long to actually meet up , that he ' s lost interest . but to answer your question  i personally don ' t usually like to give out my full name to someone before meeting them because of social media stalking . i mean it ' d be pretty hard for anyone to stalk me anyways because i don ' t use my full name anywhere besides facebook and my setting for that is pretty restricted , but still . also why did you feel the need to know his full name anyways ?

2. absolutely speak to your therapist . you trust them . they will help you . you need to get yourself out of that relationship for your safety , physical and psychological . this is not a one  off occurrence .

3. are you dating my ex ? he was the same , completely unhelpful despite me laying out the best way to support me through my bad days . now i  m with a guy who actually listens to me and the difference is night and day . my mental health and productivity has skyrocketed . nta for breaking up with a guy that gets you down because he thinks he knows what you need better than you do . there  s nothing wrong with breaking up over text , either , especially when communication is an issue .

4. honestly be i  d not say anything , ignorance is bliss but nta tbh if you told him although i  d rather live in bliss and not know it  s over all better to be told hurt and move on just be direct about it but be kind if you get me

5. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .

6. you ' re taking the cowards way out by ghosting him after saying you ' d give him a second chance . you should practice saying what you mean and meaning what you say . people might like you more
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

7. most people have some form of guilt built up especially if it ' s a recent occurrence . if you raised the concerns and genuinely wanted to unfold the truth and try to fix things i can ' t see a reason he would continue the affair .   x200b  if you ' re that concerned once you ' re together , get him in a quiet space where you both have timesomething like a car and ask if you can take a look at his phone . straight up , no gimmicks , just say " may i go through your phone to make sure we ' re both on the same page . you should be able to tell right away if he has something to hide .   x200b  however , be careful because this could stir something up that wasn ' t there in the first place . this brings us back to the main point , that being straight forward is always better than snooping . no questions asked if i was dating a girl and she snooped through any of my personal effects the relationship would be done .

8. well heres my opinion , the guys probably very paranoid of you cheating on him , im not saying you would but thats what it looks like . heres what you need to do , if you want to stay with him id explain how hes the one and hes over reacting . tell him that you need some breathing room to do whatever you want but that youll always come back home to him . you should only unblock the guy when he understands to give you space . if you feel like things arent working out anymore because of trust then youd definitely be in the right to break up with him . thats what id do atleast
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

9. don ' t talk to that guy any more dating is hard
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

10. that ' s understandable , i ' m sure the pain and study are more than hard enough to deal with without him making matters worse for you . i hope you can see someone helpful soon !
   (ID: 8b7590cb8502d6abd38b320b842aa7642186b6d8)

11. digit you don  t have to meet him if you don  t want to . lots of people never really get closure , and that sucks , but really what is the goal here anyways ? you could easily exchange longer messages over email or something and give him closure that way . digit why are you so concerned about the image he has of you ? are you hoping that something will be rekindled ? otherwise i feel shattering that image that he has of you will probably just help him move on and you won  t have to hear from the ex again . digit even if you do meet up , you don  t actually have to reveal any information about yourself that you don  t want to . just keep it vague . there  s nothing wrong with just broadly answering  i  m taking out some time to figure out my life , i  ve grown out of x interest  etc . if the subject of what you  re doing these days comes up .
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

12. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .
   (ID: 6f13975ce6a8747ec3d0e2207b9ef86d80a28713)

13. communicate , communicate , communicate talk to him . tell him what you like . tell him what you want . tell him what you don ' t like . tell him what you don ' t want . ask him what his wants and likes are .
   (ID: d06e7949138d7c04b968c15f3dd6f37d07c5a670)

14. that ' s where i need to be . in a space in my head where i can ignore it or walk away from it . i ' m hung up on being angry that he gets to treat people however he wants without consequence . i honestly don ' t know how you didn ' t react with your father behaving like that ! i ' d have been terrified ! it ' s nice of you to still help him with his medical treatment even though he certainly doesn ' t sound grateful . i can see that having boundaries is important . i guess i need to know what mine are and stick to them at all times . i don ' t know if having cptsd is what makes my emotions take over when he does these things . something to talk to my psych about i suppose ! thank you so much reginaagnon , your kind words help more than you know ! red  heart
   (ID: 8b7590cb8502d6abd38b320b842aa7642186b6d8)

15. this sounds like you need to talk to your so , you need to make it clear to him the way you feel and how you want to live your live .
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

16. i mean you could just ask if he wants to hang out just the two of you , and if je suggests more friends to bring take it as a hint he doesn ' t like you like that .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

17. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart
   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

18. that ' s fair , one year is a pretty common tipping point in a relationship in my experience anyway . if you feel you have truely put in the effort to address this and seen no improvement , than i think you know what to do . let him know you ' re unhappy and that you want to be with him , but his lack of attention is hurting you . if he still does not put forth the effort than it ' s time to move on .
   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

19. i mean tell him you feel like you ' re going back to the person you was . tell him your side of the story ! how you believe the fight was unnecessary . that you feel such a similar pain . who knows , maybe he understands and talking about it will grow the two of you closer together . perhaps there is a good friend who is willing to give you another perspective ?
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

20. you need to be assertive about this . the template for an assertive statement is " i feel  when you do   , and i wish you would    " in this situation you could say " i feel sad or maybe uncherished , neglected , abandoned , or lonely ? when you don ' t get to know my family , and i would like you to come to thanksgiving dinner and talk to them " please learn this and use it . it must be said calmly and conversationally without expectation of changing his behavior . you are clearly stating your emotions and the behaviour of your ideal mate . if he still refuses to change his behavior , then you should decide if you can visit your family without him for the rest of your life .
