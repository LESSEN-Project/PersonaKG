2. i agree digit  people who are like ' god helped me study and pass my exams ' or ' god saved me from a car accident ' are so brainwashed . once people realise it ' s themselves that are in charge of their destiny , they decide their own morals , actions etc and not some invisible sky daddy , the better we will all be .

3. everything might just be a creation of man . man put god into a book , man creates more men to be slaves to work for him . and the whole world is ruled by men who control these slaves that believe in a god that was created by another man ? does it make sense ? i  ve had a beer or so , and it  s about a beer before bed , so that  s what time it is

6. if a rubber ball filled with helium is placed on the incline , it will not roll . if a ball of glue is placed on the incline , it will not roll . almost nothing ever has a single cause . most things have their entire light as their cause , and it ' s usually nonsensical to consider something to be a one true cause of an event . this is the first flaw i see in your definition of " cause . another flaw i see is  nowhere in the naive definition does it say everything must have a cause . yet your argument hinges on this .

7. no , that ' s it . i ' ve heard that line of reasoning in a thousand ways . the only way evangelicals can explain bad things happening under the watch of a supposedly benevolent and all  powerful god is that we don ' t always know what his ' plan ' is , but there ' s always good in it somewhere .

8. is it possible for a god to do something so crazy even they son ' t understand what they did ?
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

10. why would someone doubt this ?
   (ID: aa8abed66c32a0519ab922c1a606563d97de28fc)

11. hmm . i never thought about it like that . it seems as though i ' ve been out scienced again . i guess this is what they mean when they say " scientist will admit when they ' re wrong " .
