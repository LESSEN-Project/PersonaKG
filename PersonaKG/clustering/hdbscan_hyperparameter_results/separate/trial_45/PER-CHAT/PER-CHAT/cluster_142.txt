1. wait . this isn ' t obvious ? it ' s a pretty clear metaphor for " the other world " we live in through all of the screens . phones , computers , tv ' s , etc .
   (ID: ecc98de1e575d7e863a2124b364b8ed586778ba5)

2. i would like to think that certain future events could be dreamt about occasionally . but that ' s a different story . i think that this time it is more likely subconscious thing . there is stuff bothering me . either that or i was visited by an evil entity at least i go to heaven ? lol .

3. i think death is a state which alters our consciousness to the same form of life in an other parallel universe . so that we can live better and evolve . inspired from time is a flat circle !

4. you get to be a ghost for a while , then its lights out . but i only believe this because i find it comforting to believe there ' s something non  permanent after death .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

5. it ' s the end of the world as we know it .
   (ID: d8b92be4e0b1e639cde4ac3fc3f079b296813fc5)

6. after personally experiencing dmt , i am very convinced that there is an afterlife . when you are at this place , you have memories of before you were a human . try to take back those memories with you is like forgetting a dream .
   (ID: 4a5a9ac8eab027b38804427b3c8c5e19c8991de3)

7. i always thought it would be crazy if we are just like aliens taking a hit of some crazy drug and when we die we wake up next another alien and we ' re like " shit did you see that "
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

8. those " alternate life  dimension  reality " dreams always just feel like the " regular life " , but . enhanced . let ' s say everything smells and sounds more accurate , more intense . no unusual sounds or smells whatsoever . on another note , i can ' t recall what specifically happened in them , but i do remember they ' re some sort of " alternate dimensions " , where i made different choices or some things directly concerning me went a different way . e . g i ' m a drug dealer in some slums . when i wake up from them , i don ' t feel my body at all  i don ' t feel anything , i just see . i slowly open my eyes , and i ' m unable to recognize where i am , feeling like i ' ve been moved somewhere else , while it ' s just my regular , real  life bedroom . it takes me a good couple of minutes to realize i ' m conscious and awake in reality . what intrigues me the most about this is that maybe death is just a transition to another reality . i don ' t know . sorry for the poor grammar . it ' s pretty difficult to put this in words .
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

9. everyone gets super powers and half of the people who get powers contract rabies . essentially extreme chaos .
   (ID: f2cec4af782c7d455288420e90648dc9c6d12538)

10. yeah , i ' m waiting for my legs and arms to rot off , the cancer to spread , and my life to be completely be disassembled by people who i never meant ill  will for . even my family is going to be killed . strict . i just want to be father to my kid and have him have someone to look up to by living well with the short  trip i was given . maybe , too late .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

11. remember how it was before you were born ? me neither . and that ' s the way it will be when we are gone . same exact state . there are many questions we will never know the answer to but it ' s best to concentrate on what we know and what we have  enjoy your life and be good to your fellow humans .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

12. it ' s you and whatever you can ' t see in a state where nothing can be seen
   (ID: 2db14c004e6ef125f85aa3678978a5718eebd11a)

13. this song imo is about descending into dark woods , down through its levels , trying to find your dog , but there are other dogs chasing you , so don ' t get too distracted by the fairy lights and the magic foliage , keep moving .
   (ID: a3c37892d1eb5776c9a4299ce29fc6200c20dd34)

14. maybe you ' re starting to have flashbacks . that , or aliens . only thing i can think of
   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

15. surely there ' s comfort in knowing there ' s absolutely nothing you can do about the eventual heat death of the universe . it ' s out of your control so just let it be . you don ' t know that this universe doesn ' t collapse down to a single point and birth anew with another big bang . either way i ' ll be long dead so it matters not
   (ID: e982e025c0604997a6e2072eb87b9bb01bed38ae)

16. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !
   (ID: 498ec9e13eaa203d64a9b79260e2285867993564)

17. what is the otherworldly feeling like , if you describe it better for us ?
   (ID: e871625874733300de2a83384cee8c72546d3ec6)

18. honestly , i don ' t know . i ' m agnostic myself so i believe that there ' s just no way we can be sure of anything one way or the other . i wish i could suspend my sense of reality enough to fully believe in a heaven . i would seriously love to just know for sure i was going to see my grandma again one day .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

19. i get stuck in a place with no dimensions , it  s just darkness around me . i can see things , but can  t tell how far away they are because i have no frame of reference for their size . it  s really hard to explain . it  s almost like floating , but i have a feeling of being heavy , almost weighed down by something . i guess the best way to explain it would be emptiness , with an occasional object in the distance ?
   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

20. because we live here , this universe . still so much unknown .
   (ID: d42f47f147cdc8e97117f0e4963e2c1309d1dcd8)
