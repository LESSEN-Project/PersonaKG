1. i know it  s a bad idea to spoof on a primary account , but when i have the time to snipe a pokemon i usually make sure i catch it , close the game , delete the game and wait a few hours and install the regular game . i  ve gotten small short time bans but i haven  t been shadow banned yet

2. i mean , either you let them do that in some server of their own , or they will hack in casual and ruin both gamemodes

3. i nearly did this to a player , not out of spite but by mistake . two accounts would go around our area , take all of the gyms and golden razz spam anyone who tried to retake them . they ' d just monopolize the area twice a week . asked around , no one knew who they were , so based on the behavior i figured it was a multi  account spoofer with a bot set up to berry feed . nearly reported it , but then i found out from someone at a raid that it was actually just a couple from the next town over who drove around and played super aggressively . would have felt really bad if i ' d reported then although niantic doesn ' t do anything about those reports anyway .

4. there is . you wont really know who is spectatin you or wheter he is spectating your team . it ' s like having random guys on teamspeak  mumble who can listen to your conversations even thought you dont know someone is there .
