3. i feel the same about reyn , i like riki he acts like you would expect from a nopon but reyn has just as much out of place lines as riki if not more . i know he is the best friend and everything but how can he be so stupid considering who he hangs out with . reyn and riki are both comic relief characters but i think riki has more depth . and i think riki would be far less hated if reyn had just kept his big mouth shut in riki ' s early cutscenes . reyn also has the least interesting heart to hearts with a few exceptions while riki has some of the most heartwarming . his voice might be a little grating to listen to but that is just the best any western could have done sounding ' childish ' without having an actual child or a woman doing it .
