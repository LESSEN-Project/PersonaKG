6. nah man , even if you put the scenes in chronological order it still has no plot . i  ve tried to appreciate the movie , but nothing happens . compared to other tarantino movies , even ones light on story like kill bill , it doesn  t hold up .

8. it is not movie but series . i would change end of dexter so that he would move to argentina . what they did with him was pathetic .

9. the title would probably be called , " slice of light . " the plot o my movie would probably just be the story of my life , focusing on minor issues with my life like failing a test . i would probably be narrating over different parts of the story , similar to tfs ' story of trunks . it would probably have some parts very brief , the parts that i dont remember very well , and the vivid memories would be very detailed and exaggerated . an example of this would be when my parents told me that we were bnb going to move . it would end with the present  me on winter break with my family , in the eighth grade .

10. i never stated as to it being the best , it is just a well written piece , as was batman noel and a death in the family . it is all about perspective
   (ID: b5153b16e61f6bc5e4bf4d8db479b7093df1ae26)

11. itd have about digit seasons consisting of how i fuck up my life day by day while ruining everyone elses around me . side characters wud be the victims everyone whos life i ruined . the end would be when i commit suicide
   (ID: e87275c4c3cfea671e40cbeff9a12d5fc1372f97)

12. i think everybody should see it one time . one of those movies you wouldn ' t be able to guess the ending in a million years .
   (ID: 7bbefe3c73b49467552610b8dad9354ce8c09cde)

13. it has significantly more edm than the first two albums but i still like it better than infamous . i ' m not sure this band will ever get back to the levels of geeving , maybe if they get a better screamer because angelo sounds pretty bad , but i can hope right ?
