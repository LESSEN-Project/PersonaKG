1. you might notice that regardless of income it has done nothing but gone down for the past digit years , so don ' t really know what you ' re talking about . as for that ramble you gave , what the fuck is wrong with you ? why would you not want the place you live to be nice ?

2. no free healthcare ? that is crazy ! why would anyone oppose free healthcare ? healthcare that nobody has to pay for ? who could possibly be opposed to free healthcare ?

3. woohoo ! 90c per hour pay increase from mcdonalds . wow , you certainly argued that well .  it ' s worth noting though that the wages at walmart and mcdonald ' s remain very far from the  digit level many advocates and government officials are pushing for . now , if you read what i said , i meant an across the board sweeping change . upping minimum wage by digit  would be a bad thing for business . i am going to be the bigger man here and bring about this embarrassment of an argument you are trying to present . you have not acknowledged a single thing that a real business owner has told you about how his busniess works . you have tried to give me old mate ' s opinion as fact because he wrote a book never owned a minimum wage paying company in his life and you haven ' t brought a single example of when a digit  jump in minimum wage was ever worked . you have not convinced me of anything because nothing you have said has brought me evidence of when this happened in a country before and worked . i am not going to convince you because you are so stuck on being right that you can ' t accept what happens in real life when massive economical changes are made .

4. because you were obviously born here , have an excellent command of english and you ' re an aussie reddit user , so i ' d imagine reasonably well informed and educated and likely , left leaning . i ' m making assumptions here just as you make assumptions about these people and their situation . i ' m assuming you aren ' t working because you ' re picky about what you ' ll do to earn a dollar , consider yourself above physical labour and simply working hard , seeking opportunities where you can find them . or the most likely assumption is that you ' re just damn lazy .

6. not a great living but definitely a lot better . you do realize that mose of europe believes in a livable wage , not a minimum at least in the uk i know they do . i believe you are the one with a skewed perception . you grow up hearing " america number digit " so much that you believe it . since you like to throw your own heat , allow me to retort . from your post history i ' d assume you lack a level of empathy considering you told one person they are in america because nobody else would hire them , and your first comment ever is able not being able to love your own child because it ' s disabled . if you want to continue to sling mud at my heritage and mentality go ahead . i ' m not the one who got offended about a simple joke .

7. your argument is therefore  " there is one candy in the shop . i have a penny . some guy comes along , and tells the shopkeeper he ' ll pay a dollar for that candy . shopkeeper sells it for a dollar . " so , i can complain about why should i not get candy just because some rich people decided it ' s worth a dollar ? that ' s called socialism . the real question then is , if the city is getting richer and more propserous , why are these poor people still poor ? something wrong with wealth distribution here .

8. we are literally destroying this world with consumerism . choosing quantity over quality . releasing carbon emissions into the air . and i wasn ' t talking about the u . s . i was refer to us human beings as a race . not everything is political .
