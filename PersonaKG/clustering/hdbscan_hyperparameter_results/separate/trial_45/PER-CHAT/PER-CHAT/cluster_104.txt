1. my wife and i were both virgins when we married at digit . we are now digit . we both waited for religious reasons and couldn ' t be happier . it is nice knowing we aren ' t being compared to someone else and we don ' t feel we missed out sowing oats earlier . we have digit kids so our sex life certainly has challenges , but it is very good e . g . experimentation , some kink , lots outdoors , lunch breaks in the minivan , etc . we are certainly not prudes or how many people would classify those who wait .

3. i arrived at this conclusion when i was about digit  i was in a health class at school and they showed us a video of a woman going through pregnancy , labor , and the aftermath . and that was enough for me to nope out entirely . up until that point i was on the fence about the whole thing , i figured i ' d probably have kids someday but not anytime soon  but the video showed me how invasive for lack of a better word the whole process of giving birth is , and i already dislike going to the doctor  so nope . not for me . oh btw  i was married digit years he died a few years back and he was completely fine with us not having any kids . secondly , the old folks home is full of people who either outlived their kids or whose kids abandoned them there  so much for them taking care of you in your old age .

4. i ' m sorry to hear that . that can ' t be a good feeling to live with your entire life . i know it ' s a bit harsh but yes , there should be some personal responsibility directed towards not having kids if you don ' t intend to care for them or raise them . but i also feel like the kids are not at fault and it ' s not fair to punish them for it either .

5. my mother was an only child , she said it was very lonely growing up as an only child and she always wanted a big family . i have digit siblings , after seeing how expensive it is raising a child and all the other drama that goes with having digit kids , i think it is insane ! i personally would like to have two kids . maybe three .
