8. thank you ! this is the comment i was looking for . i didn ' t know goggles had a dvr feature . i own a 3d printer so i was just going to fab up a mount . but , at any rate , the foxeer seems like the way to go . i ' ll ditch the pdb , and get a better vtx and transmitter . investing in some good goggles makes sense to me since they will likely outlast the drone . looks like i have some more research to do .

9. really glad i spent over  digit on this , haha , nah i still don ' t regret it , wish i could afford an index . so just regular velcro tape or should i get like gorilla tape ? would gorilla tape possibly ruin the plastic ?
