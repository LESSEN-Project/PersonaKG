1. only problem is i don ' t live with or near him hes constantly telling me about how they ' re just being extremely nasty to him and things like that . i ' m trying to find more info about him now i ' ve got most of it i was mostly just curious if it was a fruitless endeavor thanks !

2. to be fair , i doubt most of us would be here if we didn ' t trust him , but i don ' t think any of us can make up your mind for you . read about him , watch videos of him and decide for yourself if he deserves your trust .

3. but he ' s an addict and i believe he was molested by his mother as a kid . he has done some nice things for his kid . he always apologizes or at least does something to get on their goodside . and honestly i think he did the right thing by telling fiona that sean still used .

4. i  m pretty sure my neighbor is into some hardcore drugs as the cops have stopped by quite a few times . weirdest thing is seeing home move next door and being this completely normal dude to now being a crazy drug addict . i remember the first time i met him he was really nice and we talked about music for a while while i was cleaning my car . fast forward to a year or so later , i got home from work late and he was walking by and he tried to shake my hand and wouldn  t let it go as he told me that he was a nymphomaniac .
