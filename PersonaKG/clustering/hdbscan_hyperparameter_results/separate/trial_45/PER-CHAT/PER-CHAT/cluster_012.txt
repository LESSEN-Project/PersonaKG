SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 8

1. i ' m not trying to saying that any of them are particularly thick well apparently from that scouse lass but what has he said or done the entire show that would make him seem smarter than any of the others ?
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

2. why is this the first thing they talk about ? like how about you tell us about him as a player ?
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

3. how are you expected to play knowing that you got traded ? i don  t think it has to do with deliberately underperforming and more to do with just being generally out of it .

4. the issue was that he jungled non  stop regardless of . well , anything whilst also coming up with a terrible gpm . of course jungling and farming is a high priority for am but you want to be pushing waves more than hitting neutrals .

5. specialist batsmen ? i heard he was playing as an all  rounder .
   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

6. i neither said he has progressed or regressed . what i was trying to say is oli is the best answer to the question at hand because he is one of the more polarizing and well  known vocalists in the genre and people tend to feel strongly one way or the other .
   (ID: 50e37e2011f73f739f76098c3c746e27b8422fd7)

7. so what does he do ? what he does best  run !
   (ID: b721d508c3e10f143c9836626787b26136faa266)

8. loool how can imad say that his batting was up to the mark and that he was very happy what ! even inzy ' s interviews made more sense
