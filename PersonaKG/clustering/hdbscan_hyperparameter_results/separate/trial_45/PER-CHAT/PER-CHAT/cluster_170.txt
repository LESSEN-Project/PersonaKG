1. there ' s nothing you can realistically do about this apart from get a hold of yourself and learnt to move past it . remind yourself that you have no reason to be angry about it and make sure you never treat your girlfriend poorly because of it

2. stop arguing with your brother , and have a calm conversation with your mom . listen closely to her , without interruption and without formulating any rebuttals . try to understand her views , and verify you understand by repeating her exact words back to her . when you think both of you feel like you understand her point of view , then ask her questions . an example  if you could dictate your children ' s futures , what would they look like ? do your current actions help put that in place ? what do you think dad would say about this ? how can i help to alleviate your worries or whatever negative emotion she shares . next step , request a certain amount of time for you and her , but don ' t say that to think about what was discussed , and schedule when you can meet privately again . do the same process as above , but allow her to change her stance without confronting her about the change . just make sure you both understand how she feels and why she feels that way . now you can share with her your feelings and opinions , just keep it calm . i bet you two are not as far apart as you think .

3. tricky one this . i suppose if you went for a girl with those tendencies in the first place , or if that  s what first attracted you , then it would be hypocritical to ask her to change . if it  s that your partner has become sexually suggestive online recently , i would assume that there  s an underlying reason for that perhaps . not saying it  s necessarily a sign that they  re unhappy in the relationship , but some people need more flattery or attention than others . i  ve seen the huge amount of likes girls get on instagram for these types of pictures and it must be quite tempting  addictive .

4. yta . she  s allowed have a best friend . and you bought digit tickets . would you rather the other two go to waste ? i can kind of understand why you want her to spend more time with you instead of lucy but not allowing lucy and her husband to go when you already have the tickets is a little silly

5. i know someone said this already but i ' m saying it again because it got lost and i couldn ' t second it  if your parents ditch your wedding and your own father leaves you to walk down the aisle alone never speak to them again . never let them meet your children . ever ! all the other advice about talking to your parents ahead of time is good but what comes after they make their decision is just as important . i wish you the best of luck in this and the best on your wedding day , which should be solely about you and your fiance . how many days in your whole life are solely about you ? this one day . you absolutely deserve to have everything be just the way you want on your day .

6. i get the feeling from what you  ve written that she  s saying this to make you jealous . i think you need to tell her that you  ve been thinking about it and it  s bothering you that she seems so hung up on her and talk about where you want to go from there . do you want her to stop seeing this girl ? do you want the communication to stop ? i think you need to decide what your ideal situation would be in regard to their current relationship . make sure she knows why you feel like this and how it makes you feel when she responds so quickly . if you guys are hanging out together why does she need to be constantly texting this other girl she used to date ? it  s not like they were only friends  you said she was in love with her and it  s inappropriate for her to still be this involved with her . i don  t know if this is useful advice but it  s what i  d do if i were in your situation . best of luck .

7. just ask her  random question . if i asked you if you  d date me , would you ?  or something like that . don  t make it seem like you want to date her , just like a funny question .
   (ID: f491028c794855d1611365b07d4525f7b98173ae)

8. tale a day . sit down and talk . spend all the time finding something easy to talk about . don  t let her leave . if she gets mad tell her why , explain very clearly why you  re sitting her down and just talking all day . let her know that you are just worried . this isn  t her problem alone , it  s very much about both of you and you need to make her understand that the main reason you get in a relationship is to help each other and be happy . take all the time you can without hurting your own mental health and spend it with her . i hope you and your so will get past this and go forward even happier than ever .

9. sounds like a rough situation , if s is really obsessed i guess not doing anything don  t help , so you got to take action . i would suggest telling s you don  t like her , and hope for the best .

10. should i tell her ?
   (ID: 6212c082850f067a67618ad2a3b9f8ed336590f4)

11. yeah if you have a gut feeling you won ' t like dating her then don ' t . i mean if she wants to just be fwb that would be cool though lol .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

12. you wont she ' ll most likely tell you she just wants to be friends and then if she was ever worth it at all will follow through with that .
   (ID: 0501bf1e5cd313190bb4590a1c677057b15a6e47)

13. honestly i think you should go get a makeover and try focusing on your own beauty . i could see how that  s irritating and tbh i don  t even know how you would begin to deal with that but maybe ask her to tone it down with talking with you or maybe find another outlet for support ? idk if i felt this way i  d get my hair done and go shopping maybe get laser hair removal just feel good for yourself .

14. nta . as a lesbian and as a human being with good communication in a good relationship , i see no issue with what you did . your other doesnt trust you and is very insecure . i ' d talk to her and if it didnt resolve , i ' d get a new girlfriend that trusts me enough to not cheat .

15. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .

16. then tell her that . in a nice way . it could start as simply as ,  do you mind asking me before you plan to invite your mom to stay over ?  she may also benefit from getting a more substantial friend group in your new area .

17. you know , i  ve been at that point in my life where i wondered why i had so many failed relationships . but then i realized all of them had one thing in common . me . there  s a reason why we pick the partners we do . go to counseling because you want to be the best you that you can be , not because she made the call . go for you . i hope you do it .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

18. i ' m sort . of in the same boat . except mine doesn ' t go as far as telling me about new guys ! in my opinion that almost seems like she ' s trying to see if you get jealous .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

19. usually i hate when someone goes through other peoples phones , but when you have that gut feeling you have every right to do it . unfortunately for you , you found something very bad . she blows you off all the time and yet has great convos with other men ? pictures ? compliments ? seems to me this is very much cheating . run .

20. he will find his own way . my sister still has a relationship with them but i am nc with my parents . it  s weird sometimes . but that  s what works for her and this is what works for me , and that  s ok . just give him hugs , and be there for him , because we have to choose our family very carefully  we were given such crappy ones ! sounds like you both are on the same page . and don  t ever give your ssn to anyone who asks . god , so many horror stories of nparents stealing their children  s identities and ruining their lives ! aack ! protect yourself !
