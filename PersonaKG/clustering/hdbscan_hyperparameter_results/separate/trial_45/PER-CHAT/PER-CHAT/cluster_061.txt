3. does that include someone shooting heroin ? correct , i would not report someone to the police for shooting heroin .  you wouldn  t report that person for their own well being ? sending them to prison is not good for their well being . so again , i would not report them .  what do you define as a victimless crime ? a legal offense to which all parties consent and no party is injured .  instead of getting all defensive like a little soyboy you could have answered my sincere question . um . okay ?

5. i think it is folly to claim religion or faith are at issue here . you think that without religion this person would not have done this ? the issue is humans are animals and they do some nasty shit . i watched someone set digit people on fire the other day , watched the police shoot a guy in the back and watch him bleed out , watched kids killing insects with glee while their parents watch on , seen soldiers throw puppies off cliff along with many other acts with degrees of nastyness . i don ' t think in most cases these were performed acting as gods right arm or with any religious intent . people do shit because they want to and would probably find an excuse or reasoning to justify their actions . that guy kills because of god , others kill because they play too many video games , others kill because it makes them horny . we are all missing the point . humans are nasty , disgusting pieces of shit and are all capable of horiffic things . its just some people do it where the rest of us don ' t religion or not

6. bet you anything he " didn ' t see the sign " and " didn ' t hear the warnings . its a wonder some people can stumble through life like this .

7. ok i have a query , because something isn ' t right here and before everyone gets all got under the collar , no , i am not a holocaust denier , so keep your poison to yourselves please  why did this guy decide in digit to break into auschwitz to report on events there , when killings didn ' t begin there to any meaningful extent until at least the following year , and the wannsee conference without which auschwitz wouldn ' t have become what it did wasn ' t until digit ? either the dates in the historical record need revisiting or someone is bullshitting us about something . edit  in case i haven ' t made myself clear  the title of this thread mentions " atrocities " but at the time this man is said to have decided to get admitted to auschwitz the atrocities for which the camp later became infamous were still quite some time in the future . so why would he feel the need to do what he did ?

8. exactly . he won ' t make it out this time , i ' m afraid . they know what they are doing to him and it ' s what they want .
   (ID: 0d5c70b45072ef9ffc8fb257e4775e8302391e3c)

9. this is how players get hurt . having to think to much and letting up , not doing what you would naturally do . this is more of a problem than the refs . they should just play digit  hand touch and qbs should wear red jerseys the whole year if this is how it  s gonna be . i understand the league trying to protect the qb , but this is just absolutely ridiculous now .

10. seriously . this is nuts . the article says that prosecutors will seek the maximum penalty for the guy involved . how can they look themselves in the mirror and believe this is the right thing to do ? it is barbaric . sure , he is clearly no angel . but that doesn ' t make this anything other than a travesty of justice .
