2. thank you gunther  w for chiming in . i like the design concept of the coils but i kinda figured they might be " too good to be true " i ' m not sorry i tried them , but i really like the starre with their stock coils more .

3. i have had very similar experiences with edgepark though i never ended up ordering from them . just the short list   i only mentioned interest in the omnipod . digit weeks later , received approval letter from my insurance . they had requested rx from a doctor my pcp , not endo without my consent .  misquoted my benefit level to the point of not believing my insurance company about how to code the rx  tried to tell me that they don ' t like to fill the omnipod rx without also filling dexcom  when i cancelled the order after both me and my insurance company yelling at them , the order magically appeared again digit weeks later . went to byram , no issues , very pleased .

4. your best resource would be to go to car forums for chargers  dodge . there you ' ll find actual owners and what they ' ve dealt with . also realize that a lot of places like jd poweothers use flawed data to get their results . if someone says " i really think my ac should be colder " or " i hate where the button to my cruise control is " , they report that as a reliability issue even if there is no actual problem .

5. the bailout that has happened for all three of the " big digit ? what about it ? also jd power also gets their information from owners . now go look up what qualifies as a defect and you ' ll know why those reports are horse shit . you thinking a knob should be bigger or your ac should be colder is considered a defect . so anything , including properly functioning systems are therefore " defective .

6. personal preference  rest . there is no reason for you to swap if you really dont want to but you might aswell try and see if you like others more . a different crosshair literaly changes the whole way the guns feel . starting with a simple dot to weird crosshairsettings . fool around , copy others and see what suits you best . as for me . coming from digit . digit i really need someone similar to that .

7. i dont have the subox but i do have some kanger tanks and i really like these  digit delrin tips from . i have bought several and they are all great . the tapered long black one might be just the ticket for you .
