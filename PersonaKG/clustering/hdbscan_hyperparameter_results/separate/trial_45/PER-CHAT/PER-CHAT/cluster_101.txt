4. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?

5. duuuuuuuude . now seriously  this is impressive for a first release . sure , they ' ve been working on it for some time , but it already has features that are still missing from opera and people are complaining about  digit versions after the abandonment of presto . everything is looking good , it even works on , although a bit sluggish on the machine i ' ll be using for some more months . i noticed it has some gestures , but it seems they are neither documented nor customizable for now  e . g . down  right closes the current tab .

10. it really makes customer support queries much faster . i find it way more useful than some of the banking apps i use , because all the text and information is automatically saved . you don  t have to go back and forth with different systems and phone numbers and juggle all the information as it  s all there .

12. you sir are a golden god . i can ' t tell you how many times i ' ve tried to pause a video at an exact moment and failed . thanks for the tip .

13. ok that  s actually pretty great the , means they  re integrating more and more sources . i hope they will enable linking up of various national transports to make cross border trips much easier too . maybe they feel they  ve already covered the majority of the terrain they needed to ? i  d say there  s also the issue with some transit providers simply not having any api integration . on another note , have you seen anyone take advantage of the maps extensions much yet ? i know uber was there and then they removed themselves and opentable can book tables with yelp having some integration too .

14. ignore these naysayers , rainbow six siege is a sandbox , make it work in your favour . and yes it is possible

15. i think there are a couple , softwares and stuff you can use through pc . but this is the only  vanilla  way of doing it off the top of my head
