1. i know im late to this post but , you ' re still trying , even if you relapse it ' s a part of recovery , and i believe that you can do it , just try to stay strong

2. you do need to take steps to improve your life , but a big part of cbt is just thinking positively . recognizing the way you ' re thinking now is irrational , that your problems aren ' t insurmountable , and that you have reason to be hopeful for the future . it ' s annoying that people expect you to be better instantly , but thinking positively is the cure .

3. it ' s clear you ' ve never had depression . my mind wants to do something but my body just won ' t move no matter how motivated i am . i try convicing myself to do something but subconsciously my body knows i hate my life and dont want to do it . it ' s like falling into a deep hole you can ' t climb out of without someone getting you out .

4. look at the long term effects . sometimes it gives you the necessary motivation .

5. thank you for your comment , you  ve made a lot of sense to me . it  s like a switch gets flipped whenever i begin to think about doing something for me . study , art , meditation , even my last therapy session i struggled to keep myself present and awake . having been in therapy for a year now , my therapist has only recently begun talking about dealing with my cptsd so i  ve got a long way to go . hopefully i can begin unpacking my terrible coping mechanisms soon because they really are disabling in so many ways .

6. yeah i ' m really sorry dude . this is often how it happens with something prescribed . it works really well to treat a symptom , but then it turns recreational . the only way i can put this is that you have to allow yourself to suffer . i ' m not sure if you have to be absolutely miserable during your break while your throat is healing but you have to give yourself permission to feel worse before you start feeling good again . as with lots of medicines that treat the symptom well , ironically they don ' t tackle the cause . without alcohol , do whatever you can to knock yourself out . use valerian , or make a pot cookie . do whatever you can to sedate yourself and don ' t use uppers . then , when you are all healed you can use recreationally without such a large concern for your health . you do need to stop though , strep is horrendous . you have to get out of your own way .

7. do extreme steps to stop yourself from gambling . that ' s the only way now . if you really have the mindset to change , go way way extreme . ban yourself from casinos , websites , or anything . cut your internet . find a therapist . call addiction hotlines . ask a friend , family for help . this will only get better if you make moves . i suggest do it now while your in the ' zone ' of making a change in your life .

8. a nicotine craving only lasts for min at the time , after that you feel normal again . always remember that you just have to resist for digit min as soon as the craving beginns . and also try to avoid areas where you typically smoked or your friends do .

9. i feel like im at edge because i honestly thought i had real willpower to stop and now here i am failing multiple times . constantly persuading myself to give in and juat have a drink and now i cant even last longer then digit days without a drink . its heart breaking and im afriad about how this has come to be . i juat dont know anymore

10. good luck . if you get a craving , just do something different . for instance , if i get one in the car , i ' ll change the channel and listen to something else that distracts me . on chantix , the cravings pass pretty quickly , if you have any at all .

11. yea i think that  s what it all comes down to at the the end of the day . i  m always looking for a quick fix or an escape or the easy way out , i need to just confront my problems . i know exactly who i wanna be , i  m just too lazy or scared to get out my comfort zone and just do it . but nobody can make the decision but me . no therapy , distractions , drugs are gonna do it for me . sorry if this is all rambling and incoherent , i  m still pretty blazed . but i think i  m starting to understand . you don  t know how much this means to me man , thanks

12. sounds like you are unmotivated , depressed , or a pestimest . i enjoy my life . if you really try to enjoy every single minute , you will . i hope you see that soon , living like what you described sucks .

13. well done ! remind yourself everyday of who you want to be . it ' s not that sorry mess who woke up in custody . it ' s you on the rails , in control , making smart decisions and enjoying life booze free ! keep going

14. once i fully realized i was an alcoholic and couldn  t control myself like i had been desperately trying to do , i was like  fuck it , what can i do to make this downward spiral faster !  . eventually , i had a moment of being willing to try something different , even though i didn  t know how or what to do . six years ago , i went to a crappy rehab , where we couldn  t even have coffee and i didn  t always want to be there , but , i  ve stayed sober every day since . i  m totally not extraordinary in any way , i just decided to give doing something different a chance and be open to not  knowing  what was gonna happen . i hope you find some comfort , regardless of your next move or circumstances .

15. i don ' t feel like my perception of reality is very off it is that i am way more critical of myself than i would be months ago and some weeks are worse than others to the point i don ' t want to get out of bed . i also don ' t feel like anything triggered it really it just sort of stuck it ' s head out of the blue , i don ' t really know how else to discribe it .
