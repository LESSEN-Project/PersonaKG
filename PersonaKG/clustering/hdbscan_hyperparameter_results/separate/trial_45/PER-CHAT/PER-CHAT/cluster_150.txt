1. they may feel like that but many of them are ignoring the immense amount of time that went into the other requirements and at the same time vastly overestimating the value of castle wars . i ' ve found it pretty funny the reaction many people have had  when people who set up castle wars boosting fc ' s specifically to cheat games with alts , not the totally legitimate afk fc ' s are complaining about devaluation , and people who called themselves trimmers but hadn ' t finished the breeding log or salty etc are complaining about devaluation , i find it all pretty memeworthy . ontop of that , why weren ' t all these true trimmers pissed when 5k games as diminished ? surely you ' re not really a trimmer if you don ' t have 5k then ? or when people boosted games ? or when people account shared ? i ' ve seen so many twitter posts of people who blatantly cheated their cwar games acting outraged that i just can ' t take it seriously . i ' m someone who trimmed immediately after the rework , and to see people behave like my trim is worthless or that i didn ' t earn it is so gross . i ' ve been trim sans cwars for coming up on digit years . i put in as much effort as anyone else  i refused to cwars on principle for a variety of reasons , primarily because i believed it was a flawed decision from the start , and because of the rampant cheating that went on in the early years of comp that still goes on to this day , not because i couldn ' t be bothered but because it wasn ' t content , and it wasn ' t fair .

2. ikr , all of these youtubers talking about tryhards are in a way tryhards themselves or just too weak to fight them

3. of course my argument makes sense so long as you think about it properly . the effective skill of your team lowers when someone is simply feeding , or their focus blinded by anger . getting tilted and becoming unable to play your best handicaps you and your team , effectively lowering the skill of that player .  and you can ' t control soccer or football in that regard because people who throw in those games get permanently banned from the league yeah , and the exact same thing happens in professional dota digit . another similarity between dota digit and football  soccer is that you don ' t get permanently banned from throwing games just by playing casual matches with randoms .

4. crap , i like playing support characters because i am not too great at gw2 when it comes to playing against people as it is my first mmo and i don ' t even know if my builds are any good . the server i play on is henge of denravi , when i play , there is hardly ever anybody on because of the time difference . over the past month i have not been playing gw2 as much because i have hit a wall . i do love jumping into a zerg as a sup gaurd or just tailing a small group i don ' t enjoy pve much since i have run all the dungeon paths multiple times , farmed the crap out of world bosses and getting my ass handed to me in pvp over and over isn ' t appealing . the only thing that has got me coming back is my guildies and doing living world because my so likes living world stuff so we do that together . i have the nbn where i am so latency is not an issue for me tbh , but i spent most of my time playing on an adsl1 connection with an average digit . 5mb speed , latency was a killer . but now the only issue i have with being able to play the game is the constant drops in connection , it ' s not my pc or internet connection either , if my so is playing at the same time she usually drops a few seconds after me . have run a tracert on the hod ip address , it always seems to time out around the 40th  43rd hop so there is nothing i can do about it . because of the drops i can hardly play let alone compete lol .

5. thanks , good to know i ' m not alone . i think the problem comes from how people take the word " noob " to mean . most people here think not being a noob is just able being able to win or get high ranks , so if you win or have a high rank then you ' re not a noob . for me not being a noob means being able to aim well , win fights and just having good general fps skills , as well as all the br skills survival , camping , etc . lots of people who win are terrible at fps stuff and they don ' t even realise it . i see it often when spectate .

6. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .

7. i was playing earlier today , and i myself an garbage at the game so i hopped into some casual and it  s all recruits who don  t know what they are doing . half of them dont seem to know that friendly fire exists .

8. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .

9. you complaining about free rewards ? it  ll get better and more competitive as you grow within the game . i assume your still very new at swgoh and are clumped with people who are probably not that into it the same way you are .

10. but what you dont understand is the reward that epic gives for you for the grind . were not selfish and clearly youre angry that you cant play as much . but youre not gonna play digit hrs a week to get omega after digit weeks . thats not how it works . you need to put time into the battle pass . say , you go to work , part time whatever . you dont enjoy the work you do , but at the end of the month you get a paycheck . its the same with fortnite .
