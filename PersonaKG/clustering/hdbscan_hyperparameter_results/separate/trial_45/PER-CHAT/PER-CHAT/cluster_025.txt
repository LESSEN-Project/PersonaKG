4. nope , never wondered . my dad installed a pair which i think he acquired when working for ge , designing train engines . i don ' t kinow whether he put them in earlier cars but i know he put them in his digit new yorker , soon as he got it . i was digit at the time so i don ' t know too many details . until he got around to getting a compressor and building an engine mount for it , he just had a good size air tank under the hood . oh , the horns were also mounted in the engine bay  those old chryslers were huge . it was fun to stop for gas on vacation trips and dad would ask for air . after giving the " what is this screwball doing " look as dad lifted the hood , the attendant invariably said " holy shit " then , of course , had to hear them .
