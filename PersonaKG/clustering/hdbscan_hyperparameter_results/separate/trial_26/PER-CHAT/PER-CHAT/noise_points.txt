3. so , assuming this is some kind of special ed thing , surely it would be easier for you and  or your parents to request someone different be assigned to you , or be assessed as to whether or not you still need this person at all ? you should probably also look into some anger management , because whatever this conflict is caused by , you don ' t seem to be dealing with it in a healthy way .

4. but i ' m sure you can win people over . i ' m not a politician , i couldn ' t care even less what other people think , nor do i have such responsibility to do so . what ' s best isn ' t the same thing as what most people think .

5. id use google translate to speak mandarin so that a larger amount of people could hear me first and say " hey insert random name here stop doing that " and walk away with a smug look of success knowing that someone with that name just got pranked .

6. the explanation to a cooling and warming planet is a natural cycle . in the digit ' s it was " global cooling . more recently it was " global warming . since neither of those bogey men ever materialized it is just called the vague " climate change . also , a large amount of environmentalists point their fingers at the united states as the bad guy . imagine that . i say start with china and then get back to me . how certain does one have to be you ask ? digit  or no deal . i am all for a clean world for all living things . no one likes pollution and unhealthy practices . however , i consider it the height of human arrogance to believe we can actually influence the environment to the degree many claim . i dismiss the attitude of " it might be happening so we must do something . i find this to be absurd thinking . it looks like you and i shall respectfully agree to disagree .

7. nta . you would be the ahole if you keep leading her in . just be honest with her . it will suck for a little bit , but she ' ll get over it

8. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?

9. well i seem to be somewhat unique in that i can ' t honestly say i relate to any of them , at least certainty not on the level of a lot of other people on this sub . i am very lucky to have never personally experienced any of the problems portrayed in the game . that said i do definitely sympathize with them quite a lot . i ' d say i sympathize the most with sayori probably because my sister suffers from depression , followed by natsuki . then yuri , then monika . i love natsuki the most though .

11. this just shows that if you get digit  worse every day it ' s not as big a deal

12. plenty of the extra stuff is from tolkien ' s works , and is actually why i support the existence of at least a second movie . lord of the rings is actually digit novel , divided into digit books , often published in digit parts , and erroneously called a trilogy because the movie adaptations are . book digit  the shire   rivendell . book digit  rivendell   amon hen . book digit  aragorn , gimli , legolas , gandalf , merry , and pippin ' s parts of two towers . book digit  frodo and sam ' s parts . book digit  the first group ' s parts of return of the king . book digit  frodo and sam ' s parts and the denouement . i mention this , because i compared page counts . the copy of the hobbit i own is about digit pages , and the copy of lotr takes about digit pages for each book , but at a larger page size . back to the hobbit , it ' s comparable to any of book digit  digit of lotr , in that it follows the actions of one group . but , like two towers , there ' s a whole second side of the story you won ' t hear if you just read one of books digit and digit . so if you take gandalf ' s adventures with the white council into account , you already have material comparable to any of the lotr movies . except it ' s not quite that simple . sure , by a page count , the hobbit with gandalf and the white council is comparable to any volume of lotr . but they have different writing styles . if you ' ve read both works , you ' ve probably realized that the hobbit moves much more quickly . for instance , in the writing style of lotr , i could imagine their stay at rivendell taking multiple chapters . or especially with some of the events like anything happening in mirkwood or at erebor . so yes , a lot of the " extra " material is from tolkien ' s other works . it ' s just expounding on what was happening with gandalf while he kept disappearing , drawing from other sources where tolkien explained that . and , to me , it ' s enough to justify at least the second movie .

14. dis  trac  tion  dstrakshn  submit noun digit . a thing that prevents someone from giving full attention to something else . you can google it and see a timeline of their friendship , along with pictures . it really speaks to the american spirit that they have become as good of friends as they have , and have been spotted together , just hanging out a lot of times . as far as the ratio of drugs stopped , the percentage stopped is much higher at legal points of entry because they don  t catch what goes around them at all . the percentages  ratios that are presented to you are deceptive , because there is no way of even knowing how much gets in around the wall . they only have numbers for what they actually catch . do you get it now ?

15. well . what i ' m trying to say is , niantic could of done something really cool for everyone that showed up and surprised them with something special like a shiny nidoking . next time they have another event advertised for a sticker . no one may show up .

16. i mean , that ' s possible . if you ' d regret not asking her out then just ask . worst that happens is that she ' s not interested and you ' re at no different a spot than you already are . try not to think too much about how things could go in the future , because you ' re not there yet . one step at a time .

17. haha true indeed ! but for me , my nc and bis could do it , it ' d just get tiresome . i might finish the first task and get the supercontainers just to say i did it ! i ' m sure you ' ll get it all done very quickly ! share what you get with the next containers !

18. that ' s nice then , i can get behind the working with some buddies to complete the challenges and it makes it a lot easier for most people . i ' ve been waiting to get home to play , but i thought it was a constant thing , i hadn ' t seen that it had to be activated to use .

19. you look great . tbh , either way looks good , neither of the lengths are bad . i think the shorter looks better in these pics because it ' s easier to style .

20. they ' ll probably give he a promotion and pay raise for this , and for all the young minds she ' s warped . the b  tch needs time in prison .
