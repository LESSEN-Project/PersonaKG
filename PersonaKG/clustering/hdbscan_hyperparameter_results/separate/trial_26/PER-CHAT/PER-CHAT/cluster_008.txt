17. is there a difference between transgender and transsexual ? is transsexual considered to be an insult ? i ' m genuinely curious . all this gender talk frustrates me sometimes , there ' s so many genders and no one talks about sex  what ' s in your pants , or whether its there naturally or artificially . that ' s the thing i care the most about when it comes to romance and sex as a gay guy .

18. people should stop feeling so entitled because they have been " loyal " if such thing can be sayed , to a company , in the end is a buy  sell you only have the right over the thing you buy , not the creative decissions , or strategic ones . i agree with you .
