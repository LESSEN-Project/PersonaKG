3. it ' s not just that . this used to be a major spoiler , but since the recent update had a comic depicting it , i guess it ' s safe to just talk about it . during the process of creating a cephalon out of an individual , the orokin had a way of " leaving out " certain emotions or traits . usually this missing piece imbalances the cephalon ' s personality , resulting in the flaws we see now .

10. well , it ' s still embarassing . i was a very skinny little kid , and once climbed a tall sapling until it bent over and slowly lowered me to the ground . i had an audience , so i kept holding on and jumped . that sapling catapulted me over and behind my audience , and i was no longer the superboy of the neighborhood , but just a very sore little boy .

11. portkeys are a fairly common spawn if you have inventory space , just walk around a bit and they will come . as for the map , what you see is what you get . depending on how active local players are , there may be a discord group where you guys can get organized and share nest locations , ideal grinding spots , etc .
