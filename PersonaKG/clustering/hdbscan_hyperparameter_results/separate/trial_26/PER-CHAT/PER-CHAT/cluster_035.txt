8. they why has the whole logo changed at the top of box changed ? marvel bobble heads do not change like this . for example , you have the punisher funko pop . there are a few different versions . the marvel logo remains the same , but they just put the different version in in brackets by the name . ie ' the punisher thunderbolts '

16. ah yes , the worldwide  feared british nukes would totally scare russia into submission , it ' s not like russia has c  300s that are proven to be capable of stopping nato ' s balistic missiles or anything like that . also , if russia were to produce just one more tsar bomba  class nuke and drop it on top of the british isles , the uk is gone and so is ireland , the northern part of france , the benelux and possibly parts of nothwestern germany .

19. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets
