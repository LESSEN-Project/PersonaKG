1. went to their show in minneapolis and would agree , fanbase makeup is dominated by white men in their 20s  30s . very few poc and women , age distribution was also very alarming . my partner found them to be very off  putting when i play them in the car . she feels like they don ' t make an effort to make space for women and other voices and therefore can ' t relate to them in any meaningful sense . this coupled with the recurrent themes of misogyny makes them peak bro  socialism at best and reactionary at worst . conversely , when i play revleft in the car , my partner loves hearing brett ' s voice and whoever he has on . he makes an effort to have diverse voices on his pod and thereby practices what he preaches . brett seems to have evolved politically as well since the start of his show , but i can ' t say the same for cth albeit , except for matt . it ' s the same bro  socialist  libdem  socdem rhetoric today as when they started . they do admit though that digit they are dirtbags , and digit their entire shtick is to follow the antics and theater of the ruling elites and ruling institutions . i appreciate those combatting the liberalism within their sub and friends irl who won ' t shut up about cth .

2. i ' m not arguing over whether or not it ' s started  i ' m saying that people who have had the dignity of hard work taken away from them represent a powder keg . is that inevitable ? i don ' t know . there are plenty of well  connected individuals with good ideas  bill gates said something about taxing robots , others say universal basic income . my dad says we teach people to become technicians . but i can guess it won ' t be a digit  digit ratio of human technician to robot anyways .

5. strange one alright . i think the general idea behind it is that gender is no longer a biological thing but rather a state of mind . fuck it though , all i really know is that is has zero effect on me and we are best off just letting people be whoever they want lol

7. it feels like home . you have another person who makes you feel safe , calm , and like you have a purpose . sure , they can still piss you off and annoy you , but at the end of the day you know it ' s ride or die and that you two would still do anything for each other . even if you lose everything else , you ' ll still have that person , and that makes everything okay again .

15. on desktop all right let me rotate my screen to see the biggest conspiracy of all time that doesn ' t give anything to anyone and costs billions of dollars but fits my absolutely crazy worldview in which government is incompetent enough to leave major flaws in their models which don ' t exist if you look closely but i looked from far enough to see them !

16. interesting take . don ' t have cls . running the squad with thrawn currently . i ' m assuming the removal of thrawn and r2 and the addition of hy and ezra will benefit the overall synergy . you don ' t really need too many damage dealers as dn removes two per battle anyways . it ' s digit v digit basically and gk never dies when i play ai .

18. " the future is now , old man .
