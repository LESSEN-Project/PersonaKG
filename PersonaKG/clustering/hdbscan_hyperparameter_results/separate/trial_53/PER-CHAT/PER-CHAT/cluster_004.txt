1. well , i doubt even rockstar knows what it will be about , but your idea is quite great . however , i really have a heart for the specific part of redemption , so i would like to see another character whose path to redemption we get to see , and dutch or hosea we already know they don ' t exactly do .

4. i think everybody should see it one time . one of those movies you wouldn ' t be able to guess the ending in a million years .

5. i think they should make it epic and legendary , keep it the same in all the other ways

6. i feel like it wouldn  t be so good honestly . i know i shouldn  t judge a book by its cover but the movie  s plot seems too bizarre to me .

7. i  d be most excited for a full f4 team  doc doom , and not technically new champs but i feel like some mcu versions of characters like sw , drax , gamora , and others would be cool .

8. nah man , even if you put the scenes in chronological order it still has no plot . i  ve tried to appreciate the movie , but nothing happens . compared to other tarantino movies , even ones light on story like kill bill , it doesn  t hold up .

9. i haven ' t even fucking seen it , but if it doesn ' t end with a lot of dragons , they ' re doing something wrong .

10. is that actually what ends up happening , or is that just the idea ? i still haven ' t watched those movies , haven ' t figured out a legal way to do so cheaply so i can ' t speak at all to what goes on in iw .

11. it is . we even get a scene during the time travel sequence where the future captain america fights the past captain america . the captain america from the past says " i can do this all day " and the future captain america says " i know " .

13. i mean there having the original cast of zombieland for the sequel , so that does seem possible .
   (ID: cc3d4f2be41112acacb92d09090db0e1f8d7e387)

14. true , but if joji does play frank one last time for this , he can  t do the voice for long since his throat got damaged from doing it for a long time , he also won  t do comedy since he said he was done with franks comedy

15. i definitely agree with that boss and the kotor characters . seems like a good time to implement them since no movies are coming out so they could be filler characters .

16. i feel you . that  s the juiciest part of your theory for me . i  d just personally hate to see them turn osiris into some mega asshole lol . that  s set  s job .

17. i think that they could ' ve done a couple releases with both versions . the original plan was much more interesting not to mention realistic but they had to make a kids movie

18. that feels like lazy writing to me . things on got are rarely black and white , so to have this mysterious storyline that ' s been developing for the entire series only to end abruptly with no explanation other than some stupid superhero movie villain arc destroy all of mankind mwahaha is a disservice to the entire show .
