1. nah without knowing the details of the argument but generally if you want your aunt there , you should invite her . not inviting her will be mean and make it seem to her that you are taking everyone else ' s side . i wouldnt reccomend appeasment as your method of life , id reccomend talking to everyone involved and everyone that feels bad and talk with them about this whole situation and whether or not they can be adults and get over it for a day . i think if you like your aunt , would want to spend the birthday with her , the argument wasn ' t her fault and you proceed to not invite her you would be the asshole without a doubt . otherwise try talking to everyone involved

3. it will be ok and just imagine the relief when it ' s all over and in the past ! your doctor will not scold you for holding off on appointments , she will be happy you came in ! even if you have the worst case scenario , you will be in the right place , plus most cervical cancers are treatable when caught in time .

4. ywbta here ' s the thing , you aren ' t looking for her because you dislike her . if you liked her you would do what your mother trusted you to do . you are letting your feelings get in the way of your mother ' s dying wishes . come on man .

5. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .

6. i have been in a similar situation . you just got paroled my friend . look at it this way . you can be happy now . that relationship ? that was never going to happen and your attachment was just going to make you more miserable as time went on . now you finally have the opportunity to find someone who will make you happy . you  re like truman burbank stepping out of the studio and into the real world .

7. girls really don ' t have to try too hard . guys already like us . and since you ' re a girl , i bet you look way better than you think you do . get out of your own head and go for it !

8. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .

9. if someone doesn ' t wanna be in a relationship the worst thing you can do is try to talk them into staying .

10. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

11. basically at the end of this year it is as if the whole world shattered for me and i had the possibility to start again . during the summer i got the chance to create some new great friendships , i joined the scouts and most of my current friends all come from that group and i finally built memories i want to remember . it is something i never felt because i ' ve always been classified as weird and i rarely met people really interested in me . so when i met this girl circa four years ago and she made me believe we were friends , she became my world if it makes sense . she manipulated me very easily and then she left me roughly once i started questioning her ways . now i can see through her crap and the only reason i don ' t want to see her anymore is that i feel like everything has changed and i don ' t want to get back to that world of rumors and fake friendships .

12. you ' re feeling this way because he looks like stability  something you ' re clearly lacking right now . to get your mind off of it , focus on improving your life and becoming independent . don ' t have a job , get one . have a job ? get a better one or go to school at night to expand to a new field . with new interest and confidence from self  sufficiency , you ' ll have clarity . it will help you get him out of your head and give you a foothold into success at the same time . good luck .

13. i hope you find the love you deserve . you ' re definitely more aware of the fact that fast moving relationships , are enticing at first but maybe not the most rewarding . here ' s to the opportunity for a better chance next time . everything happens for a reason
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

14. im sorry they are making you feel this way man i hear you . i can relate and it fucking sucks when your own family treats you like this . how old are you ? maybe save up and move out as quickly as you can . its not permanent , youll get through it !
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

15. if you have low self confidence it ' s probably because there are things about you that you don ' t like . if having a girlfriend is the only thing about you that you don ' t like and you expect another person to love you without loving yourself , than you ' re going to have an unhealthy relationship . find out what you need to do to love yourself before looking for someone else and when you succeed the right person will come around . and if she doesn ' t , it doesn ' t matter , because you ' re happy .

16. i ' m not going to give any more flak as i believe you have received more than enough . please just let your husband go . he deserves better . if you truly love him as you claim in your post , you would do so . holding onto him like this is just disgustingly selfish .
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

17. you sound a lot like me , it ' s borderline creepy . i don ' t have dyslexia though , but i have a lot of other stuff so it ' s all good . my sister is even four year older than me . it sounds like it ' s your parents fault for having an impact like this on your upbringing , it ' s definitely affected your life . you should focus on your writing if that ' s what makes you happy and keeps you occupied . one of the best ways to help with depression is to find a hobby , it could be anything from skydiving to working out to writing , anything that distracts you and keeps you entertained is great . as for the girl thing , maybe just keep trying to get her to speak to you . i ' m not exactly an expert on relationships so i don ' t know . and you speak better english than digit  of english people , so well done there .
   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

18. you deserve attention and love and happiness . you sound dedicated and committed and that ' s amazing . however , and i don ' t mean to sound rude , maybe family is not something to invest your efforts in . you matter . other ppl don ' t . don ' t be a devoted wife  mothehousewife if it makes you feel like you ' re just spread thin . maybe it ' s time to re  shift the paradigms so to speak . have you addressed the issue in your family ? stressed how underappreciated you feel ? if the ppl around you don ' t give anything back to you they are the wrong ppl . family isn ' t everything . marriage is a common cause of depression and self  loathing in women . while you ' re waiting for the current ppl on your life to show you that you matter you could easily replace them with others who really do care about you . eventually you might find that the greatest love you can ever experience is the love of you for yourself . find what makes you so unhappy . then iliminate it .

19. i hope you  re doing okay . i am now in your shoes , and it sucks . one of my best friends killed himself digit days ago . when all of our friends are together it isn  t so bad , but when i  m alone all i can do is look at pictures of him and think about it .
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

20. i went through a brief period of this , but i got lucky . i just hope you ' re near the age of moving out or at least on to college to do your own thing or something . anything to get out from under that shit
