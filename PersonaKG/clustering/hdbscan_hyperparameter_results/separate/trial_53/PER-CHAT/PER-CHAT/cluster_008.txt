1. i was wondering why i was having trouble downloading with bit torrent , explained how i ' m technologically handicapped my friend taught me how to download stuff . guess my buddy showed me a bad way , the few responses i got said i got what i deserved and was being an asshat for torrenting the way i did . laptop shit out on me a few months later , so it wasn ' t a big deal .

2. yeah , it ' s a real problem . everyday i hear the same thing , " we should segregate blacks because they are naturally more violant " , and " if you really think about it hitler wasn ' t even a bad person " every fucking day , why can ' t we be a better nation like china that cares about all of it ' s citizens .  s

3. democrats always say the right only likes children up till there born but doesn ' t care for them after that like how retarded are they . maybe instead of making laws to fund murder you make laws funding children then

4. i ' m not going to downvote anything you say because i ' m open to anything you have to say . the question wasn ' t asking for evidence . the question was asking about what makes each individual believe in god . and you don ' t , so you kinda wasted your time by coming in here and generally just trying to start an argument . when you say there is no evidence , you are only approaching reality through what you see and feel from your own perspective , which is all any of us can really do . thing is , everyone has a different view of reality . that in itself is mind boggling . we are a collective consciousness trying to make sense of this whole thing . even me and you right now are like synapses firing in a huge brain right now trying to imagine two sides of this coin . but yeah whatever man , blow jobs and garbage , everything is nothing , and we may as well just fuck the earth to death because it ' s gonna happen eventually , right ?

5. why are you victimizing them ? why are you generalizing ?

6. fuck me ! i really hope he was actually doing something else in the video to warrant this . either way it ' s definitely a political thing trying to look good to the muslim community . bet you after awhile they will drop charges while under the radar .

7. silence mere surfer . your country lost a war to birds . america is clearly the superior country .
   (ID: b7ca8beb99c98a46de3704213b38cdcc44dbb728)

8. says who ? who gives a shit about ' forms of charity ' when the end product is the same ? you should remember who these are really for . people in need . not our own morality .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

9. people are giving you shit because of your attitude . you ' ve came across as someone that thinks they know better than the fbi because you ' ve done a little course on profiling . you have also mentioned several times that it doesn ' t matter if you ' re wrong . well it does . like i said in a previous comment , what if one of your students makes up scandalous lies with absolutely no evidence about another student hen goes and tells the whole school . would you just let it fly because ' they were wrong ' like you said , these comments ' don ' t hurt anyone ' and your comment about having to treat him as a pedophile even though he ' s been cleared because of your job is insane . every teacher or person in charge of children across the world treats michael jackson as a pedophile ? come on .

10. dude , the media doesn ' t need the democrats to tell them what kinds of headlines they should be chasing . perhaps if he ' d stop tweeting nonsense , stop behaving like an entitled spoiled brat , and take the high road for once in his life , he wouldn ' t be on the news digit  digit . he makes it too easy with his attention  craving antics . it ' s not just the democrats who hate trump and everything he stands for . he just makes it way too easy to root against him .

11. omg u guys are so dumb obviously no one has ever said this to you so stop making  memes  and go get a real job like go on tumblr or something that  s a good website guys it  s obviously a joke . edit

12. like how you assumed i have a side not religious at all i don ' t care about abortion , i ' m simply pointing out the double standard of " it ' s my body " until the kid is out and then it ' s " but you helped make this kid , so pay up " even if the father doesn ' t want to or can ' t .

13. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?

14. what the hell are you thinking ? i ' m amazed you were able to fit iamverysmart and iamverybadass into one post .
   (ID: 3e1762624e55cdfb0929da3e1a1c438675e0c217)

15. i couldn  t back a source on one thing which was actually quite unrelated . how about you back a reliable source that states the refugees are going to rape and kill us all . is hitler your trigger word or something ?

16. liberals are never actually on our side , no matter the issue . even if they agree on the outcome , they disagree on the process , and feel the need to inject government solutions into everything . if you ' re for bigger government , you aren ' t on my side of anything , ever .
   (ID: 695c696deb58364c4f03bf78d7d406b01f2254e6)

17. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .

18. surely there are other avenues to take this information . you reported it to the police department of which luke murray is assigned ? nothing seems to have been done ? take it to another department , go get legal advice , take it to a lawyer , any of these options are better than posting it on reddit , and if this turns out to be a false report then you are committing an act of defamation . i ' m not doubting your honesty , just think you should find another means of having the law look at this accusation .

19. really , i have to thank you for the exchange we ' ve had . i intend to share it with as many people as i can . my friends all over the internet , my peers at work , and all the folks i have contact with on social media . i plan to share it with strangers at every opportunity . and you know what , those folks will share it with their friends and acquaintances . it will go far and wide . on and on . all over the country . look back at the lengths you ' ve stretched to bend reality because of your obsession with guns . the facts you ' ve attempted to dismiss because they don ' t square in a gun nuts head . the reality that americans kill eachother with guns more than any other developed nation . that america leads the world in mass shootings . keep hunting your hogs as the world looks back at you with disgust and pity . i should feel sorry for you but i don ' t . i have common sense and you do not . this is the last time i ' ll be responding to the nonsense you post . just know that you ' ve provided me with enough evidence to convince all those that have yet to be subjected to the garbage you and your ilk spew to reject it on a logical and factual basis . sleep on that . like i said earlier . thank you . your posts are nonsensical and increasingly bizarre . you have confirmed to me and to all that i intend to share this exchange with lol , which is a hell of a lot that gun nuts are real and are preposterous . so in love with the ability to create death that the essence of living is total lost to them . thank you . you have gone beyond proving any point i wished to make . once more . the gun control lobby have nothing to fear from you and will soon see their advocacy pay dividends because of crusading sophists like you leading the charge .

20. i haven ' t told what you can and can ' t find funny , i ' ve told you what is innapropriate to say , there ' s a difference . when i said it was a joke , you said this  " no , it ' s not . jokes are meant to be funny to more people than just you . " sure you might not be saying that i didn ' t find it funny , but you were saying that no one else finds it funny . which is wrong . you are wrong .  my actions here were mostlt for the benefit of the op . you ' re words most likely bothered them in a big way , and as well as wanting to stand up to someone behaving like you did , i also wanted to show the op that someone would stand up for them and hopefully counter how you made them feel . a person on the internet who is mature enough will understand that most people will be sarcastic when given the chance . especially since he didn ' t put a " serious " tag on his post . my comment was very much clearly a joke , made obvious by the exclamation point . the fact that you got so triggered by it just highlights your immaturity and inability to recognise jokes on the internet . you might find that this flaw , this cluelessness to social cues , is one of the reasons you were bullied .  think what you want of my actions , i feel like i did the right thing . you didn ' t do anything wrong . you are just acting like a stuck up bitch . you ' re like that one person that always takes a joke seriously , gets offended because it isn ' t a " clean joke " and complains about it while other people just laugh .  and well done for admitting you made a dick move , most people don ' t have the balls to go back and admit a mistake . no need to congratulate me on something everyone like me will do , this is just showing how naive you are . there is no mistake , there never was a single mistake . i am a dick . people like me will always admit to acting like a dick . why do you think i do the things i do ? i ' m not oblivious like you .
