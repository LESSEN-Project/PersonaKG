1. i don ' t see anything disappointing about this , i think it ' s awesome !
   (ID: 9d9222851792c0966d644b25f98a14486f3509b3)

2. i think london would be too urbanised if that makes sense ? american cities , at least the massive ones work on a grid structure , making them a bit easier . london is , comparatively , a fucking mess , not to mention huge . so unless they dropped a nuke incredibly close , it would be a nightmare to build a game world . maybe with the power of future consoles but i don ' t think it would be that feasible

4. " don ' t be afraid to be truly bored or alone with your thoughts . " i can ' t remember the situation , but the general idea was to not be afraid of having nothing to do . your mind can create some interesting ideas , given the opportunity . boredom can be a gateway to discovering yourself or a new creative outlet you can use to express yourself . the counter to that tends to be that your mind can also create some rather worrying ideas too , but i don ' t think that was really the goal of the idea .

   (ID: 4dd03f320502247ea725348e21fe67168d7cf5f1)

9. what is their to argue about ? it  s pretty opinion based . i don  t think any scientific arguments will change someone  s perspective who truly believes it is murder
