10. well it  s not a mean nickname so she  s not making fun of you so possibly she likes you or someone dared her to call you that , maybe she  s just being playful  goofing around or sending obvious hints that she digs you , its hard to tell since i haven  t met her . she could also just want to be your friend

11. splitting north america into two servers would be a disaster . where would they put it ? in the east of canada ? then a lot of eastern americans would want to play there for lower pings . you will end up with two not so full servers . it ' s best to just group the entire area into one .

   (ID: 20df0a5d067cacea6779a80dde1ebd27e05274f0)

14. most burglars do not want to see anyone , let alone harm them . they just want to get in , get the stuff , and get out . so . would " undocumented shopper " be more appropriate ?
   (ID: d02dbb1cf70aa95df2b9f1bbd0a0c5bf0a966933)

15. just last week a girl at my job would always want to chat with me , she ' d even wait for me to get to break so i could sit with her . i thought it was weird and couldn ' t figure out if she was being friendly or not so i ignored it i suck at reading signals now she doesn ' t bother . oh well

16. some woman supposedly .  i  m not saying this didn  t happen but fuck me . you won  t listen to the fucking fbi but this is a credible source for you ? at what point will you realize that you just hear what you want to hear .
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

17. nsfw ! this post is definitely nsfw , just want to give everyone a heads up ! i just have to write a bunch of cramp so that the automate raptor doesn ' t just kill my comment because all i wrote was " nsfw . so , again  risky click at work , folks .

19. what do you want ? answer that first even just to yourself and then it will be clearer what you should do . i want hugh jackman to come over to my house and rub me with oil and roger me senseless . i can want all i want  nothing wrong with wanting . it is just that what we want is not always going to happen .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

20. this sometimes just happens due to human error . they will want the money back , it  ll be obvious when they do their review prior to figuring out how much to collect back from the other driver . you can come forward now or wait for them to call you . my company often lets our customers simply pay us back over the phone with a credit card , or send in a check . and no , we cannot just add it onto the insurance renewal bill . thank you for noticing ! we all love honesty !
