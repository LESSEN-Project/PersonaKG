3. i know but still there will always be that part of you that feels obligated we had a fight and i said i needed so time off , she responded by using pentobarbital . i had to endure her mother threaten to sue me because of that and her friends trying to psychically harmed me even months after the incident . and yet what worries me is that this great human being could leave this dimension because of something she can not control .

5. i haven  t watched in some time now , but there was a time , where i used to watch every single episode . why ? you ask . for the same reason i tell idiots who claim it  s fake . we all know it  s scripted , but the answer is in its description  sports entertainment  it  s fine if you aren  t entertained by it , but why ruin it for the rest of us that are entertained by it ?

12. from what i understood is that you ' re wife is basically boycotting you in bed for weeks at a time . you should know that according to the hadith , the angels curse her until dawn for that and she is constantly sinning . your ' fantasy ' about getting a second wife is not haram . allah has made it halal for a reason , and if you can fulfill the requirements , go for it ! otherwise , this can be reasonable grounds for divorce . allahu ' alam .

15. because the heat of the sun , and the amount of water and salt and all the time that it ' s been there . there is more water and more area affected by that than in your glass of water . although maybe it ' s an interesting experiment if you put lot of salt in a small container , you heat it up and when you ' re gonna smell it , you cover you head and the container with a towel . if you try it , let me know what happens .
