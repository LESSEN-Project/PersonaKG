18. i love when people completely change the subject considering it has nothing to do with the original post about the difference between being black and voting for obama and being white and voting trump . i never said voting for trump makes you racist i just explained why his supporters have been labeled . i didn  t vote for either one . the huffpost is a leftist news source . however , this particular article was just compilation proven occurrences . they didn  t makes these stories up from thin air .
