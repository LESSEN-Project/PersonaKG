1. i understand . i  m just not much of a lebron fan , so it  s hard for me . also don  t think he  s even close to the goat . best of this era ? sure .
   (ID: f90b0d899acf3c82adaa55fb250d0c7ea9eaeaf3)

2. for me a coincidence is the just that . a coincidence . i personally don ' t think they mean anything although they can be kinda neat .
   (ID: 3eef66654202ad187ad73806fb9c9788d0119cbf)

3. so just because you disagree with it , you think it should be okay to censor it ? don ' t you see how slippery of a slope this is ?
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)

4. i guess i just don ' t see where this is going ? i don ' t think a single person has agreed with you . maybe you should try it and post your results .
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

5. i don ' t think others are wrong , per se , mine just works for me . the whole " faith " thing .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

6. how are you expected to play knowing that you got traded ? i don  t think it has to do with deliberately underperforming and more to do with just being generally out of it .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

7. but in reality we are all the same race . society has just got super hung up on the pigment of your skin color . to become racist must be either influanced by somone , or having a super negitive experince with someone of that race . i don ' t think someone is born racist .
   (ID: deba8ecfaebf274b29e06c16c3deb13a42c9726d)

8. sorry mate , i don ' t think your theory will find any traction . it ' s just not as funny as the prof . grinding them into candy
   (ID: 63d10997998d584afaae51f9374109eb470c1495)

9. if you think about it the world does . you just have boogers in your nose so you ' re used to the smell and don ' t notice .
   (ID: b4d61ff0c23f7ce5512ee9f64d1bea0f938f262a)

10. the game is too big to die . with all those mods , you can even play just terraria for your entire life . maybe the hype might die and player base will be lower but i don  t think it will die .
   (ID: a0849f7d6d0829c8bb5f820aa9bf63584c7471df)

11. not a jab at you op . i just don  t think it  s a fat shaming movie . more anti  costco  amazon  lazy  consumerism  idiocracy
   (ID: dd0e84182036131d3b7cbc9bcb07384502b3c1a8)

12. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

13. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

14. i just hope we won ' t get any problems next summer with the ffp as i don ' t think conte would come if he doesn ' t get his signings
   (ID: 5743909dfc8d4789250ad63c644a076260aa5bf2)

15. you don ' t . you just think you do .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

16. not sure if you ' re being sarcastic or not , but it was just a question . i searched around and couldn ' t find much except what has already been mentioned . i figured i would ask the reddit community for their input . also i play on console , i don ' t think there are too many hacks out there to increase my magicka , but thank you for your suggestion .
   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

17. i don ' t think so . i remember hating it as a kid , but i just watched the trailer and will definitely watch it as soon as i can . it seems interesting now ahah buuut . no , it ' s not what i ' m looking for . thanks tho
   (ID: ed64cc6cb03b04b61be795ff15e6ac799bfe42b1)

18. probably similar to chyna with just the   opening   mlk day so maybe not opening the show graphic . i don ' t think there would be too much backlash with the whole innocent until proven guilty thing .
   (ID: c08743855177b68f06df5b7637db6f3e62f0baff)

19. i don ' t think looks matter that much   they aren ' t hiring you to be the hostess . if you go to one upscale place and get a test  try to remember the questions so that you can have answers for them at the next place . once you get the job , it is just a matter of memorizing the menu selections . stay upbeat   you can do this ! there is great money to be made .
   (ID: b59db07693bd6d890ec094bc28cb98d1e322c549)

20. homosexuals are still able to pass along their genes , just not in the ' traditional ' sense . i think it was , but i don ' t think it is any more .
