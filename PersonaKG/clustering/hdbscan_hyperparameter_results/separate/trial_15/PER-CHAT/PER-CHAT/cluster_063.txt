15. look up ygopro  devpro online and download it . it is a virtual version of the game , and i believe the percy client has an ai mode that you can test decks against . then i would lurk around the sub a little to see what people are playing , pick something that piques your interest , and start from there . warning  cardboard crack is an expensive and addicting habit , and devpro has cost me a fair bit of sleep after discovering it

18. if you show up unannounced to someone ' s residence , or their business , talking to people is considered solicitation . and even taking that into consideration , so what ? do i not have the right to be an entrepreneurial business person and take it upon myself to go out and make money , as long as i am not selling anything illegal ?
   (ID: 4d69affb6415148eda5d5103b282ce15476169d5)

19. it  s the connection to those people that matter . a person can have sex with a loooot of people , but often times they end up alone , cause there is no real connection with anyone
   (ID: de8b276379fa225b91599769b7a71d751e208315)

20. are these people and their one sided twitter beefs a joke or something ? this phd person has to be satire . then there  s the troll who keeps trying to stir up stuff with rackets for attention i guess ? maddox needs better foot soldiers on social media , the cringe is unreal .
