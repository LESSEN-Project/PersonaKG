3. why do you believe in your god above any other ? they all have an equal weight towards maybe existing , so really it ' s more practical to just be a good person and not believe in something that is beyond comprehension .

13. ooh good point . just because something or someone has left you , there is still the emotional trauma left behind . i have no idea what that trauma would amount to when it comes to an extra sliver of someone else ' s evil soul inside another .

14. that i just applied for a  10k  loan that will be looming over me for the foreseeable future in hopes of not washing out of college and getting a job good enough to pay of for the loan plus interest in an extremely competitive society that is only growing more cutthroat by the day . college is fun .
   (ID: 97a098bef8517b2080cad8aa73f738b95e795b18)

15. what i basically mean is that i have a sim card but the mobile data is too expensive . is there perhaps some way to get mobile data roaming ? for cheap or just any good alternatives ? i ' m willing to pay for a service that works
   (ID: 4a904b3db5017f5069f27886874bdeee777d5c06)

16. have you listened to early takes volume i ? i can just keep it on repeat . it ' s so , so good . his voice is so expressive .
   (ID: b59db07693bd6d890ec094bc28cb98d1e322c549)

17. good explanation , thanks . i agree . manhood can  t be measured , as that plays into the concept toxic masculinity . then the belief of manhood being measured should instead be just considered how macho someone is ? not in a negative sense for example , if you see a strong , burly man with a beard and place him next to george constanza , considered the former with higher manhood is wrong , but instead maybe more macho  stereotypically masculine characteristics ?

18. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !

19. thanks ! and yes i was talking about the night vision . since now i  m assuming the night vision won  t give any real details in the character all you need to do is just a fix up and you are good to go . but i  m just a casual gamer who is giving a really , uninformed opinion . again good luck to you !
   (ID: f270f54ee5a501d23ceae23084513e682d0cfd32)

20. good idea . could be really cool thread . i was also thinking it just be cool to see more on  diy
