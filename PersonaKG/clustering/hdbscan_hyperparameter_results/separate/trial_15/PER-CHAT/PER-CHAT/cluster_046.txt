1. is there a cheat ? like an easier way . i have to sinf at the same time i ' m playing so my brain is like omg so much thinking .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

2. it is my favorite stealth game of all time too . i have actually played it through many times because i love the story , voices , language and sound effects . stephen russell , who voiced garrett , has also done a ton of voices in elder scrolls  fallout games . i always look for similar stealth games but only a few come close . i do like the two styx games and the dishonored series . wish something new like it would come out !

3. fucking up happens . its okay  if you learn something from it . why not try drawing on yourself instead any time you feel like that ? keep drawing even if it takes up a whole leg or arm . i recommend crayola .

4. can ' t downvote you as i experience this all the time turning into my driveway . it bears back to the right and is steep . i can ' t count the times a driver behind me has to lock up or act irate that i am coming almost to a standstill . it is like they are driving in the world that they wish existed , rather than the one that does .

5. my mint pods have been coming like this recently i get them from the same place every time . usually they are pretty clear . is it a bad batch ?
   (ID: 2baa313af7d70181dc367dbd0e46b168cf35df26)

6. yes . but very . very , like so long you could fathom the amount of time it ' s take . but yes . you could .
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

7. haven ' t done a double take like that in a long time ! can you get a close up of the list of cities ? it looks legit from here but there are so many repros now it is hard to tell . also pics of the back too .
   (ID: 5113c05943fba6375b98d11869c59878a6764855)

8. hmm , try it like this  " i ' m not racist , but why can  t black students shut the fuck up and learn like everybody else ? " it help ' s identifying you as you are early in the sentenceand doesn ' t waste someone ' s time reading racist bullshit
   (ID: a7d8ba86187ae0cea463dd4ff85d67fa2b786dc7)

9. it blows my mind that the first time is " riot " games . like of all the names .
   (ID: 9dc417f749a0d20a48d0b30f64c5a229fedc1176)

10. there was still gas in the car when you returned the second time right ? sounds like you have a small parasitic draw that is staying on when everything should be  asleep  .
   (ID: 16cc03bb1052e5442b86d0b28065d4fb03b556a2)

11. i wouldn ' t mind it , but the captaincy is such a poisoned chalice that expectations will be raised unrealistically high for him and it pretty much guarantees he ' ll be the scapegoat next time we exit a tournament . i quite like him so i ' d rather the media doesn ' t destroy him .
   (ID: c08743855177b68f06df5b7637db6f3e62f0baff)

12. with a face like that it  s no wonder you  d wanna be high all the time
   (ID: f23956d7a437d91e64a9d94dcd8eaae6945fa691)

13. as someone who spent enough time on 4chan to be on an nsa watchlist , dicks can go way beyond weird . i still remember a guy posting his dick that looked like a fucking flat top mushroom .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

14. o shoot that sounds like an absolute blast . you can always make weird faces at kids , then pretend you weren ' t even looking that direction to pass the time ?
   (ID: 5f43a3019d69696064ac659bf6dd25b51f1e5bb6)

15. first of all , get help second , distract yourself . it can be hard now but find something you like to do . it worked for me one day at a time
   (ID: e216f2a1e0d7d814b7ad58452ce6ac21e0b763fc)

16. hey , would you like to go out some time ?
   (ID: ce0130e0736ec79181ef08a51b107514a8021d5c)

17. " you ' re getting a little grumpy . sounds like it ' s bed time to me young man " vs " i ' m finally done ! i can sleep "
   (ID: 98f9b074f3fba12c7403be7000f77b6a560c5a02)

18. it depends , me , being judged for a long time , needs the extra assurance . but there is a fine line between being like that naturally and being like that do to circumstances
   (ID: 72b6366221d77b2fc8bc314dd4ba65436ee466f1)

19. been there and it wasn  t worth the time . the impact it has on you when you like and are not  liked  back is really negative . save your own time and feeling and withdraw .
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

20. congratulations ! imho stories like this are more of a . threat to the borg than anything on youtube . it proves that if you are not giving them all . of your time , energy and financial support  you can have a happy life !
