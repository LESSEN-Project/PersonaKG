16. everything that you said is absolutely true . the most aggravating thing about the focus tree is the middle tree especially . oh you have to take digit focuses to get on with the tree ? ok . oh digit days wasn ' t enough ? how about digit different sub  trees that take another digit days to start . the war is almost long over by the time you get the claims on neighbors .

20. my area put up a stink about this because they put in an old time clock that barely works . we all manage to get clocked in before 5am but it ' s tough some days when it ' s malfunctioning . the supervisor has been nice enough to forgive a tardy so long that you were in line at digit  digit .
