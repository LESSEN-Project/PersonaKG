1. when i discovered that there are a lot , and i mean a lot , of people out there that think the government can , and should , fix all their problems . craziness .
   (ID: 7f3ed7262bf05d9d101b2b917869b90e43710a7a)

2. or it ' s a bullshit made up story , hoping that they will be one of the first to receive it . reminds me if some guy who demanded to receive his kickstarter shit faster than other people because of some condition . think it was shiftware .
   (ID: b25bdf3935142c93d642393810cba283ec3b801f)

3. it breaks my heart so bad . the torture it had to go through , the amount of stress , the horrid human to do this . reminds me of how my cat got run over and we think someone sped up to run it over , people are horrible to cats but they  re lovely creatures of treated right and with respect .

4. in my culture , if your ears are warm it means someone either mentioned you or someone ' s talking about you . when my ears suddenly inexplicably get warm , i think people are talking about me that exact moment .

5. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .

6. yeah i think people may find my emblem of a crackpipe and ' meth  man ' disagreeable
   (ID: dc1a6ca8b7ce3327dec097f0883d72c2689870fc)

7. i think that people shouldn  t have to lie about their beliefs . i think their religious beliefs shouldn  t be mentioned at all
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

8. works best if you ignore people so they think you ' re in deep thought and focused
   (ID: f17c5192b8fcf82d4857fe8b8d226705db4093e3)

9. really now . i have worked on ocean prediction models that are needed for better weather forecasts , especially hurricane intensity , and how to find people lost at sea . i can give you hundreds of examples off of the top of my head on why i think your first statement is wrong .
   (ID: 836c1cf8e9db34147646e1dcba5b0a94c666d831)

10. my uncle said all pot smokers smoke menthol cigarettes . he also blames poor modern family dynamics are because of pot . my grandma said pot smokers are bad people , lazy , and can  t believe we  re all able to vote about it now . so i asked them what went wrong when they tried it . neither of them have ever tried it so i told them anything they think is invalid and it started this huge fiasco
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

11. i think most people miss the problem with her name . the problem is stupid parents naming kids stupid names . that is the real problem .
   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

12. i also care . think of all the people he ' ll be having a conversation with whose eyes will lock on , realize what they ' re seeing , and wish it were a boob . those are precious microseconds of their lives that none of these suckers will get back .
   (ID: dc123ff47fa4f2e85bbecd444342fe7d8fcb7db5)

13. i wanna day superspeed but the toggle part makes me think you mean i  ll be super fast at all times and can  t move normally to interact with people anymore
   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

14. i think it ' s perfectly fine to call people out on their shitty spelling and grammar . now everyone knows what our opinions are . hooray !
   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

15. i think your smart but kind of a downer on people . this isn ' t a king book . is jj abrahms king ? if you hold too rigidly to the notion everything has to go by king canon i feel you will be disappointed . remember star wars . yeah
   (ID: 0a15902c79d7d4948a8af045ef06f2692cdeb23f)

16. being happy and being usefull for other people . for me if you think you shouldn ' t be happy you are living wrong and if you think it ' s fine being a useless piece of shit you are living wrong as well .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

17. so you think people should not be vocal about their opinions ? i should not share my opinion because it is vulgar ? i  m not trying to be directly rude to you here , but if you were a random stranger i would tell you to fuck off . what do you do then ?
   (ID: 2f90bc4ddc8ea7b4aa70e550371ca36c812f636f)

18. do you have any proof for who is bot ? you people keep saying that reddit is full of russian trolla and bots , yet you dont shoe any proof whatsoever . i think the collusion story has really left a mark on some people to the point of that they see russians and collusion everywhere
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

19. the course correction for lucasfilm is to stop the box office numbers from going down on their movies , that  s pretty much it . if episode ix does not deliver a box office up turn i think they will wipe the floor with the company and put new people in and start over .
   (ID: b623a4ee614c63cb06ab2b6fd7c1ce893866e0d9)

20. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .
