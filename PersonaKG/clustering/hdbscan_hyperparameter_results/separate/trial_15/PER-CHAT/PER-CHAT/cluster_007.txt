12. i didn ' t get the hype as well . i simply think because we both expected to be hyped , we expected something extraordinary . whereas if we had no expectations going into the episode for the first time , it might have been profound .   x200b  i hope this made sense

14. i was a little to young at the time to appreciate michael jackson but i can still remember exactly where i heard of his passing , who i was with and what i was doing at that precise time etc also chester from linkin park . their music was a big part of my teens and it  s sad to think that he  s now gone

15. i think it ' s the sort of thing that the court might order in the event that the kids weren ' t being treated well . otherwise , i think it should be left up to the mother how the money gets spent . kids cost a lot of time and money . i don ' t begrudge the ex for the child support money when the kids are being taken care of . i ' m more likely to begrudge the unfair distribution of time with the kids than the dollars spent on them . love my kids . my ex sucks but i seriously doubt she ' d short them on dinner or new shoes . she might screw the pizza delivery driver , but the kids would be fed well .

18. hero labs has all of the encounters pre built for 25ish dollars i think . it really save a lot of time in prep . roll20 has all the maps , lightning , characters ect . i didn ' t use the product , but if i were to do it again i would use this .
