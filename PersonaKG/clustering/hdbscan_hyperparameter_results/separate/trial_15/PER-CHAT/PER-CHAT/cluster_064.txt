Total from this dataset: 82

1. i see your point in a sense . it ' s not that they ' re being confrontational , it ' s that people come up to the camera . there are plenty of   boring   videos where nothing happens . there are also videos where people learn their rights . there are auditors i disagree with and auditors who react well to the public better than others . suspicious activity is only suspicious to the person who doesn ' t understand what ' s going on . i suggest watching a bunch of different auditors and see which ones you like best , or none at all . i really like the boring ones where nothing happens because it shows that they ' re not out there to harass people .

4. robin william ' s was definitely the most shocking . it felt like my childhood died along with him and mortality came crashing to the forefront of my mind . it was especially hard knowing he took his own life , he seemed so happy . how could someone that makes people laugh for a living be so incredibly sad ?

8. that clears up an awful lot right there . you ' re a notch on his belt and many people men included get really attached to their first lay due to the dopamine and the oxytocin . it is literally like trying to quit a strong drug such as heroin . it ' s withdrawal as far as can ' t eat , can ' t sleep , and so on .
