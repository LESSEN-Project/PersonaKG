1. if he is doing what you voted for then he is a good president if he isn ' t then hes not . you voted so he would do what he would said he would do to make you happy , but as a person it could be argued differently . i kinda like what he has done but as a person i hate him he makes a fool himself in which makes america look like a joke he gets involved in petty arguments and is fueled by his high ego and is very narcissistic . along with other things that could fill a list buy same can be made out for other presidents etc .

3. the real question here is , what does dick mean ? a variety of terms may circulate when constructed in a conversation such as here . perhaps it meant your friendly next door rapists who ' s name is coincidentally named dick . short for richard . could it be , the moderately growing business dicks sporting goods ? good lads really , gave me all the balls i could ask for . or is it , finally , a tool used by men to inject seamen into a women ' s ovaries to travel to the womb to make a child which by definition making it blatant that we must pass on our current knowledge to the next generation in hopes they do the same . its a marvelous idea developed my mother  nature but alas , it thus means that no human can live forever . reproduction is the pinnacle of mortality which no human has yet to discover a way to break it . this concludes todays lecture on how to make people think you are a intellectual when you are just some guy ranting on something that doesn ' t even make since . next class , memes !

6. jdoe74 has a point honestly . if you like doing what you do cut the middleman and slightly undercut the business you currently work for and you ' ll definitely make more than they are paying you .

7. yeah i would steer clear unless you ' re super comfortable with them . i always find it hard to understand how the people i ' m with are feeling if they are sober and i am tripping . like they could just be having a normal conversation with each other but i will think they are mad at each other and about to start fighting . it ' s also hard for me to speak in sentences that make sense when i ' m reaching the peak of my trip . i will start a sentence and then be unable to finish it cause i cannot figure out how to . sorry i realize i didn ' t give you any tips but that ' s because i don ' t really have any haha . if your with cool people then just enjoy the trip and you don ' t need to worry about talking to them or not

17. in a car like yours you could probably keep gas below  digit , food might run you around  digit if you stop for fast food only , the hotel rooms could be around  digit or up to  digit depending on where you decide to stay , tolls should be less than  digit  with most being between philly and chicago . my friend and i went from charleston , sc to california in digit days but that is with two people driving . if you wanted to do any sightseeing it would be a little ways off the highway . after chicago there isn  t really much to see until denver .

19. its been digit sessions and ive thrown worse at them . my world isn ' t exactly known for its equality if you look at my post history . i felt i was doing a bad job conveying prejudice so i asked for help to make it more convincing and he took it well i dont know why this particular event set him off .

20. alright i  m gonna be brutally honest . quit lying and bullshitting to your self , and be you . i looked at your history and read this post idk what you did or what you want , but the biggest thing to success will be accepting everything and not lying to cope . afterwards it  s a easy path of going out of your comfort zone and changing lifestyles . if that  s not possible then you need to live so your happy . you can live in the wilderness in alaska alone for example if you hate humanity so much . personally i would love to do this but i still have other goals that require me around humanity
