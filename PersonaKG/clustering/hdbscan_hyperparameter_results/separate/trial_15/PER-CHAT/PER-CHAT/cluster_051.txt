Total from this dataset: 64

1. i find that pre thinking does me a lot of good in that type of situation . having a course of action plotted , like " go for a walk " for when my brain reverts to purely reptillian type responses is invaluable .

2. seems like you got a pretty good routine already dude which is great . what wax are you using ? you may have to use something stronger to get styling your hair a bit easier and act more effective , you have thicker hairwhich is a positive .

4. omg u guys are so dumb obviously no one has ever said this to you so stop making  memes  and go get a real job like go on tumblr or something that  s a good website guys it  s obviously a joke . edit

5. that actually sounds like a good idea . the only problem i see possible is where do they go for work afterwards ?

6. what ever happened to good old comments like " leeeeroooooyyyy mmmmjenkiinnnnssss "
   (ID: 4e0e1b1d59812fd3ecd969ef8b16f44b8070a134)

7. that probably makes sense , and i sort of feared that . like any good developer , i ' m a little lazy , so i was hoping there was an easier way

8. was king kong any good ? my parents would like to see it next year on my birthday because of that universal studios ride , but i  m kind of skeptical of watching a musical starring a giant puppet
   (ID: ded51a42964a203363b0abca3e5be0d03ef95ffa)

9. i used my generic gem on void and he is a god , so good for longer fights like mini bosses or bosses in aw .
   (ID: 11e562551d8ce916c649db9948355e07c68fed96)

10. omg i wanna see like a little conspiracy pig . with a monacle and it ' s pulling those forensic strings across the room and making connections . it could be a show , " conspiracy pig , " but naw , i mean on the real rgb is probably really sick  injured still and it ' s not good optics  she might have to give up her seat soon . so obviously the longer that can be postponed the better for the dems . i get that .
   (ID: 083a84f0eb291e73c134e99357339803c4deba58)

11. i like how the stars on the boats represents how many seasons they played . good job !
   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

12. you proved my point . you have no reason to hate america  americans . we have good terms with nz and you haven  t lived here , meaning you have no clue what it is like .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

13. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .
   (ID: 46f455b780faca36116964131a4d0622c465bf7f)

14. out of curiosity , what was it you didn ' t like about his lantern ? good job on the conversation .
   (ID: e0b2bbb4356ddf39fcc470890c2e5a2473be34ff)

15. they look like freesias . do they smell good ?
   (ID: d3491a90d756046acac8c3053e9e99c3e6c231f9)

16. looks like a good phone . why do you have both lite apps ? i guess you might not be using them so much .
   (ID: 4dd03f320502247ea725348e21fe67168d7cf5f1)

17. unrelated , sort of , but i guess loving sob songs and victory fanfares gives me a good reason to like you will be found and disappear .
   (ID: 3d7247a42a25189aa8f6dea6f337591039d8677f)

18. i only super like the really really hot girls and usually they super like back so it ' s all good
   (ID: 5743909dfc8d4789250ad63c644a076260aa5bf2)

19. seems like a good plan but the ammo depot and arms rooms aren ' t one in the same . also . that ' s alot of camo zombies .
   (ID: 5d850afd337787a97ade9b037c2a04f0cf830e83)

20. if you choose to do cookies for your goodies , i ' d suggest you keep it super simple and classic   like good old fashioned chocolate chip .
