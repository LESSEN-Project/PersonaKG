4. i think this gets buried under the memes but this is what a great relationship is about . for me specially . you meet her . you get to know her . you fell in love . you find your thing and thats special . cheris that thing you have incommon .

5. as someone who works with young children with autism , what are some suggestions that might have helped you to get that door unlocked ? i know it ' s not even remotely the same for all individuals , but having a few extra tools in my toolkit of things to try would i think be helpful . i ' m not the kind to give up easily without trying everything i can to reach and help any kiddo , spectrum or otherwise .

6. in what way ? wanting to know what specific thing you think makes it shitty .

7. there is that one great occurence in tes skyrim . if you somehow managed to quicksave shortly before dying without any option of saving yourself , you will die over and over and over again . you will see your character flying into the sky in the most hilarious ways . i think you guys already know that lol .

8. come on now , you know what you " should " think , you ' re on the atheist site for goodness sake .

9. i think i know the guy in the far right of this pic . does anyone know where it was taken ?
   (ID: 42a8780a6a35c7b2e85acf575fc8cb2ff3c5a6f3)

10. i know more than one because my kids drug me through it . i still think it ' s a kid thing .
   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

11. in my honest opinion , i know it ' s loosely based on real history but i think they killed off ragnar way too early . and floki ' s story is getting stale really quick . ivar and his brothers are acting stupid . and lagertha needs to pull her head out her ass . this show turn a turn for the worse . not to mention the stupid way they set up their season numbering .

12. i think now we will see the fighting . germa has been around for so long and we dont know shit about them and about big mom past i think we may see another short flashback at the end of the arc , also mother caramel maybe is alive inside bigmom or as a homie .

13. i still think it ' s pretty impressive for how long they survived considering that basically every single brit was hunting them down . the bismarck wasn ' t only about sea superiority , but it was also a psychological weapon . the big bad wolf , the bogeyman under europe ' s bed . i know it ' s easy to lose a ship at sea but it still amazes me .
   (ID: ad95cb68c3ea444630fedc23f3d4596fafc60464)

14. i think the utopian society to which you are referring could exist with robots who do all the hard labor . i know that in a sci fi movie this ends badly , but still .

15. ineresting . i suppose you have a point there . completing weeks and weeks without accomplishing anything can lead to hopelessness , i know that feeling too . it ' s possible that a tighter schedule would be worth it . however , i think the specifics are wrong . if it were me in his shoes , none of those things would help . i turned to school and developed a plan to be self  employed to help me . whatever the case , he has to find some form of self motivation again . i think it ' s up to op , whether or not she thinks this will help , and how to use it .

16. i know what they mean . he  s saying it  s genuine  i . e . not sped up  because of the effort in the guy  s face . i can well believe it , oriental chefs have mind  blowing knife skills , especially the japanese remember much of what the japs consider delicacies will kill you if not prepared properly . i agree , i think this is genuine .

17. i think i may try fighting him again tomorrow . i got close though today . atleast i know he isnt impossible
   (ID: a628583ff555e7d9de55ab5077667a07a90a201e)

18. i think you should . you never know , it may bring you closer together .
   (ID: 920ba0628cbea5588ecca4c8ba7f80b411ff70ef)

19. i mean there ' s no way to know for sure , but the fact shane went out and sold an f5 instead of sandbagging or trying to escape makes me think it ' s likely a work .
   (ID: c08743855177b68f06df5b7637db6f3e62f0baff)

20. i know . i  m asking dangerous questions . you  re right . i should pretend i never stumbled upon this paradox . do you think there are any new cat videos out there today ?
