5. okay , you are a part of a rare few that does not connect those , my bad . but what do you say to the educated brexiters that had their reasons for leaving ? usually saying that they are ignorant or stupid is simply just rejecting their opinion and saying your own is superior

8. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .

18. yes , i do . i absolutely do , and i say that as someone who is waiting to get a teacher job . you are not their parent and they are students rather than " kids " , but your duty is to defend them against dangers , even if the danger is their own parent . and she is just looking at the other side . while he beats the kid , not giving a slap , but beat in sadistic manner , without control of his actions . he could have broken her nose or teeth . what if that was a gunman , rapist or similar ? she would have just looked at her computer ? this is cowardice , unless she knew there is a video tape and let him do thar so there is an evidence .
   (ID: a7aa6341e1b57ce267a054932c0fecc933562532)

19. i am using the word can as a verb the second definition of being permitted to do something . now i was using it in the way to ask someone to allow me to do something and not the first definition of can . so please read a dictionary and come back to me when you have educated yourself . or just say , " you ' re an idiot "
