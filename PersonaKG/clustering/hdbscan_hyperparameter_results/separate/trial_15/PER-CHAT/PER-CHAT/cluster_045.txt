12. i especially sympathize with the difficulty of researching black genealogy . one time i was browsing an old southern newspaper from the 1850s . i saw an ad posted by someone asking for help in capturing his runaway slave . the man gave a description of the slave , and his own name and address . on a whim , i used a few online resources and in half an hour i tracked down a living descendant and emailed him a screen shot of the ad . he was amazed and delighted , as anyone would be , at having a relic of an ancestor . but the runaway slave herself ? so far as my research skills are concerned , she ' s gone forever .
