2. i was not . my parents were presbyterian on paper , and i think at least my mother did does ? believe . i was taught almost nothing of religion , and only have the vaguest of memories of ever going to church . i think we went a handful of times when i was very young . maybe that ' s what allowed me to gloss over the religious context when i read the books as a kid .

3. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .

4. i was trolling some goth chick and she started yelling at me her boyfriend a friend of mine had to hold her back but thats not the scary the scary part is every once and a while she would legit try to scope me out whenever she did find me she would tell me to leave her friend alone long story but yeah i would always think she would falcon punch my ass

10. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?

11. i think you made the right choice . did you ever have a conversation with her , telling her you were cutting her off or was the distance enough of a reason ?

14. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

17. perhaps , but as i said in a previous post , " inform , " not preach . as i said , sometimes problems are caused . i can think of at least one thing that is worse  living with yourself when you saw a wrong and did nothing , knowing a child would suffer .
