3. oh , clearly we are done . that much was obvious once you , in your arrogance , started your condescending name calling and telling me what my own opinions are and then saying they are wrong . as soon as you did that , i knew that i had no interest in discussing the topic with you further . so , i just left it the quite accurate , " opinions vary "

19. either way . in my experience , if you broke up with someone for anything other than just " not feeling the spark " friendships are strained at best . one of you always has feelings for the one who did the dumping , there ' s always that twinge of jealousy and bitterness when that person dates someone else . it ' s toxic . in the rare instance where it was a mutal break up , ok . but other than that , it ' s usually asking for trouble .

20. why did you delete your post ? why are you doing the exact same thing you just called the op out for ?
