1. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .

2. this boy is not worth your time . just dump him now and move on to someone that ' s not going to shame you repeatedly .

3. trust me , next time , just go for the kill . i learned the hard way that messing around can often get you killed . at lease , that how it is for me .

4. haha i can ' t take credit for this theory , somebody explained it to me a long time ago with a lot more detail and they somehow tied it all in with the prince that was promised , dany possibly being the reincarnation of azor ahaii , jon becoming the night ' s king and somehow bringing peace to all of this . they also said some shit about white walkers not actually being evil just completely misunderstood , and there ' s a legend that the wall is just the icy remains of a massive ice dragon much larger than balerion the black . by the time they were done explaining i was just like woah keanu reeves voice

5. i ' m not sure how much it has to do with the time and how much it has to do with who your parents are . kids around me were doing plenty , i just had an overly controlling parental situation .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

6. is the stoning for adultery pertaining to both genders ? because every time that i do read or hear about it , it ' s always the punishment for women . what if the man commits adultery ? not trying to toss gender  equality into an already cans  of  worm belief . just genuinely curious .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

7. due to the blatant disregard to what happened . why risk your job after working there a year and lose the reference for future jobs ? why choose a place that would inevitably get you caught and fired ? the fact that he couldn ' t stop laughing after he was busted . he could have easily been an asshole who just doesn ' t care , but he never really gave that impression during the time i knew him .

8. even in this sub . last time some dude stole a pic with the oops tag on it the entire sub ripped on that dude so bad . all memes should have a mark somewhere imo just to give credit where credit is due .

9. every time i get used it ' s just another masturbatory story to me . who ' s next ?
   (ID: 917dfa16e92ce1db67ec3f88bc07b87b70a36c95)

10. it  s true that it is kinda a waste of time anyway , the problem is that instead of having fun wasting my time i just get depressed
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

11. thanks . this actually makes sense to me . we actually leave ours out all the time and it just confused me why if we never wrap the chord up it gets messy
   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

12. i hear you everyone  s different , to an extent , but yh probably was psychosis but you was young at the time so it was probably just that
   (ID: 7dfa169bdfe2df7e214baa35fc2f2b73cbb10c46)

13. thanks for the offer but after everything i just downloaded an old driver the tablet and that seemed to resolve the problem . sorry for wasting your hard earned time . have a lovely day !
   (ID: e706d8e3e66a8d84fc15d33a176d542752613604)

14. nothing fancy honestly . whatever ' s handy at the time . just regular glue works fine if you use the correct amount .
   (ID: db2795e3479f3abf3fd16c22a2bea9450ad82357)

15. same here . if i could just take the courses i need for my major and minor , everything would be fine . unfortunately , i have to take a bunch of courses that aren ' t worth my time and money .
   (ID: 8dc7a300c762f2c528a6f2993d152d50f9fcc702)

16. not nerd passion , just it cynicism that the netcode will take time to fix , so no need to bring it up in every suggestion .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

17. that isn  t just a football thing , it means greatest of all time so it can be applied to anything
   (ID: bef3bdf131cc9dbe9d33343a3b9988680236cf9d)

18. if it was more than one , every moment with my dad when i was little . if it was just one , it would be meeting my s . o for the first time .
   (ID: 8e04d9ff8cb4775dcd9beaa83d8499ec17c7bc83)

19. mist raven also works if you time it right just when the snake attacks you .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

20. the thing is , phoenix aren ' t meta . they just help a lot early in the game as their tags allow you to unlock ep , thrawn and chimaera . it saves you time and makes you pretty competitive early on in arena .
