8. i think it should have been a general election again as this is the second pm to be voted in by the tory parties and they only want him because he said he  d get us through brexit deal or no deal and yes they should have another vote on the idea on brexit , it going to be a shit show .

9. this is a very difficult subject . has she ever been molested ? i was molested by my father , starting at the age of digit . because of this , i ' m fairly certain your attraction would be a deal breaker for me . however , you are clearly an honorable man , and i want to thank you . i can only imagine how difficult this must be for you . i think your best bet would be to start the therapy if that ' s the road you want to take , and have her join you . i think hearing a professional ' s opinion , and understanding what you are dealing with will help her and the inevitable confusion that i ' m sure will come .
   (ID: 854fece503b60c994d3291263ce8495e5048d976)

11. well , at least until they write a game . then they love copyright laws . property laws are as strict as they are because we ' re primates and when we want something we ' ll try to take it if we think we can get away with it .
   (ID: 73d786325287f5272402debb72ec4f3b02223193)

12. i pretty take all social media posts with a grain of salt . no one ' s life is perfect every single day but they want you to think it is .
   (ID: 7f3ed7262bf05d9d101b2b917869b90e43710a7a)

13. burke doesnt exist in this canon i think . its strictly adhering to the ridley scott film not james cameron ' s . in this canon , the developers can do what they want with amanda and her life because ridley never addressed what happens to amanda in the film . this is purely a title addressed in the first alien film ' s ' sub  universe ' . hence why there is zero plot information tied in from the second film .
   (ID: a39c39d63361f823757ee249874af7f92e6f4569)

14. from what i can tell you ' re smart , but you want everyone else to think you ' re an idiot
