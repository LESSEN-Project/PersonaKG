1. i heard people at my school talking about how someone might be gay and i heard one say to the other  if he comes at as gay , tell me so i can roast him about it  and the other responds  if he does i  m probably going to stop being friends with him

2. how crazy do people get around the holidays ? i  m assuming it  s a lot busier , but if you had to say  are they more or less courteous to you ? has anyone done anything that you witnessed  for you that restored your faith in humanity ?

3. well i seem to be somewhat unique in that i can ' t honestly say i relate to any of them , at least certainty not on the level of a lot of other people on this sub . i am very lucky to have never personally experienced any of the problems portrayed in the game . that said i do definitely sympathize with them quite a lot . i ' d say i sympathize the most with sayori probably because my sister suffers from depression , followed by natsuki . then yuri , then monika . i love natsuki the most though .

5. it ' s this really mean term people say to describe black people who are poor and collect welfare while tending to sit on the porch , i guess
   (ID: 6cb8904cf2faf74f712ddb1c620007fe43bf46df)

6. plenty of people can act hardcore and say " yeah dude i hope the night king kills everyone " but nobody really wants that , it would be a lot more boring then it sounds .
   (ID: e84ec39cf97c9609b6feb31cbaab5faf551f372d)

   (ID: c916f127f4f3e275b37bb32e4a156325cab84540)

8. i ' m sick of ignorant people not knowing what the hell they are talking about . it ' s simply a tool in the hands of whoever uses it , for whatever their purpose , no  matter what the liberals say .
   (ID: 243f3366e8b9e63d947443cb96d82f8d4de706fe)

9. i post pictures of my cat and people say he  s cute so it makes me and him happy
   (ID: c5e877ff3be5d3571f5fe899f55887a6f608ee98)

10. i ' d say retail in general . but consider the experience the people you are asking have . most likely they are minimum wage employees who were placed in a department they have rudimentary knowledge of . if they have a vast knowledge of construction  plumbing  electrical  electronics , they wouldn ' t be working a minimum wage job unless something shitty happened to them .

11. i hate when people say bring incorrectly .  shall we bring our hammers to school tomorrow ?  it  s take face  with  rolling  eyes

12. yes poor hr people do exist and sometimes something does fall through the cracks but i would say it is very rare . i certainly wouldn ' t hang my hat on this happening
   (ID: 7b0648239b5cd94aef470ea9d27994697141137f)

13. the older you get , the less people look at you when you say you ' re . it drinking .
   (ID: 6b04f3448a053338b902c242d1883da1e90dc7bb)

14. all i  m trying to say is , if their goal is to include everyone , why exclude white people ? yes we have done horrible things in the past , but we changed
   (ID: 021c01b3e15fb3077444bd9abdbc0d7c390239b0)

15. i suggest it yes . i use malwarebytes premium too along with avast av free . despite what some people say , they both detect different things the other does not .
   (ID: 3e510494aac4d4cfd98d8ee4e7b04dffd5534bee)

16. it is not the same because as white people we have not been the victim of systematic oppression and fetishism and our worldview does not allow us to understand the experiences of people of colour because we are in a privileged position where we have not dealt with the obstacles faced by poc , so who are we to invalidate what this girl has to say ?
   (ID: c0cbd0e097375f98ad98ec291f836a39d55e02c1)

17. if i make plans then sometimes she asks if it  s ok to invite other people along . sometimes i say yes , sometimes no . if i say no she strops and hangs out with them instead .
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

18. i ' d say these people deserve to be assaulted but that is probably what the money hungry cockroaches wanted to happen .
   (ID: 4d1c53b18fd4290c31e857fc9f9572542fef4fd5)

19. i will judge people on their past , what else should i judge them on ? their future plans , what they say ? no , this man is either an idiot or a thief , either way he isn ' t to be trusted .
   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)
