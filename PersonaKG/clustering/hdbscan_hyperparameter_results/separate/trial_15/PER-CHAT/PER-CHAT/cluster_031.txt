1. out of curiosity , how much of that is old people ? i could understand if they have a hard time actually reading the signs . otherwise , yeah , that is pretty weird . totally separate question . do you find the job draining on your writing , because it is annoying ? or are you actually more free to write than you would be if you were doing something academic ?

3. " fuck off " thank you for your input . when you ' re on the clock you ' re expected to at least meet corporate and customer expectations . if you can do neither then any job that relates to working with people is not for you . when you ' re off the clock and on your time you can do whatever pleases you .

4. i ' d slip everyone some laxatives around a particular area so they all get the shits , then watch them try to explain it as an outbreak . then gradually , each day , do it to more people . over time , they will be a new " pandemic " but with no discoverable pathogen !

6. premature outrage much ? abrams is announced as making this and people are worried it may be " whitewashed " when it is made in the future ? who are all these people with all that kind of time ?

7. regardless , everyone , blind people excluded , can adjust the focus of their vision at any time . this is not unusual .
   (ID: 8b9c4341d896783998a7c3485fa949b3c63cbd73)

8. i get so damn annoyed when people criticize me for looking up everything . " you are taking all of the mystery and wonder out of life " gods dammit , no ! if you are wondering about mysteries that humanity has already solved , you ' re doing it wrong . when you look up information and can ' t an answer to your question , that is what you should spend your time wondering about .

9. one time i told this homophobic kid for someone who hates gay people , you sure talk about them a lot .

   (ID: 0ee053db27d57ee2347f7cad65eabf774a189b30)

12. i will never forget this lesson that i learned on oprah when i was a little kid . " people will always show you who they really are . believe them  the first time . " iyanla ? maya angelou ?

13. it makes sense though , if i were an immortal time traveler i ' d mess with people by doing that too .
   (ID: f2eafcb4d8e0b098ec90234d0bc310dcc0e2a189)

14. fair . i can see why bringing penicillin to medieval europe is a tempting answer . however , i have to consider that the further back in time you go , and the more broad your cure , the more you risk causing more human birth and an alternate timeline in which war , starvation , or drug  immune diseases wipe out more people that would have died had you not tried . by sticking to a smaller number of people and a more recent event with fewer possible ramifications , you ' re more likely to come out saving more lives than endangering .

15. i dont get it . normal people ? of reddit ? how do you look in both eyes at the same time ? wat

   (ID: af7909c19fea28cadcabd2f3b93c831e3c684dad)

18. i still use " merry solstice ! " since half the people on the planet haven ' t a clue what the word means , they look at me as if i said something in greek . makes me smile every time , and i ' m never really wrong .
   (ID: 5ee4d4a98d2da62835d0e63abf8fe5bbfa95111b)

19. i ' m in grad school now but i had a gap year after undergrad . it was very different . i had less on my plate than before because i worked full  time during undergrad . i lost a lot of friends that year because many people moved away .
   (ID: 24d2489761902de9148fe06d43ec8d7e34c8e35b)

20. my bad if i was being cruel , this is a book that ' s near and dear to me . i was worried by you saying ' giant waste of time ' , people unfamiliar with the book would visualize a war and piece  sized commitment and disregard ever looking into it . agreed about too many books though .
