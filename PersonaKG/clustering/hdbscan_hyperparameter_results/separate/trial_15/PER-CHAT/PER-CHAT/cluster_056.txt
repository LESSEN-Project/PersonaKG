5. it was on reddit and someone said to some innocuous comment i wrote ,  i hope you die .  i could not see anything offensive or rude or even that opinionated in my comment . so i didn  t care . if anything it helped me . that comment reminded me that i shouldn  t take anything online to heart . if i offended or upset someone i would not like that  and i would apologise but if someone just wants to be a rude little fucker it has no impact on me .

14. stumbling through the club , the lights strobing so i can ' t see where my feet are planted and it feels like my body is being chopped up into different sections , and this songhttps    just blaring . finally unable to keep my balance , i accidentally pitch forward , i fall down . and someone turns up the music .
   (ID: a3c37892d1eb5776c9a4299ce29fc6200c20dd34)

16. i get them a fair amount a month and i just wake up and feel like i can  t move or breath and i have to imagine in my head me violently making a jerk movement and i shake out of it and wake up
   (ID: 7dfa169bdfe2df7e214baa35fc2f2b73cbb10c46)

17. can you specify what  s weird ? lol . everyone is dressing up and i  m just like idk what to wear
   (ID: 7c0a90108389e898ab80f1c7af44e170b85c6d76)

18. real are worse than atleti at the moment . even on paper , atleti seems stronger . real just has many players who peaked a couple seasons back like kroos , modric , marcelo , ramos and carvajal , and have become very inconsistent now . add to that permanently inconsistent players like isco , vazquez , etc . and compare them to atleti ' s squad .

19. just an idea but maybe write him a letter in the form of an invitation to hog warts and list the series as his school books ? you could expand it and add other " supplies " and take him to hogsmeade in the wizarding world to get the stuff like a stuffed owl or something although that part sounds like a much pricier ordeal
   (ID: 239eded9e37fe1b7388561d1e82993d15dd4fc15)

20. i take it that the crew are a comedy group ? is " crew funny " highlights of their " skits " or just some bonus behind the scenes of their creative process ? in any case , eating donuts purchased for someone else isn ' t funny or quirky , it just makes you look like a self  absorbed asshole especially in the jerk  like way amanda phrased it . p . s . i ' m also the last person to complain , but that is the wrong there in your sentence will .
