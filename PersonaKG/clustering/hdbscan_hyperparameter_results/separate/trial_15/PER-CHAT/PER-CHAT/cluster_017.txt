1. that ' s tough to answer . i ' d say it ' s probably not " quite masculine , " but rather balanced between rose and oud . i do think it ' s definitely a unisex fragrance . i definitely get both notes very clearly in this , so it may be a little more rose  y than what you ' re looking for .

2. personally i would say that altair and edward would be the last ones standing . kenway , being a pirate would be prone to fighting dirty and altair was trained from the moment he could walk , if my memory serves pun totally fucking intended , would , and should absolutely kick ass . personally i think that altair takes the cake but it would be a pretty close call .

3. you might think we ' re done . but no matter what you say , we will complete this dungeon . if rocks fall and yolnaak dies , so be it .

4. i ' m not sure honestly . i have to say the chances of getting hired with no license and no driving experience is frankly , pretty slim . can you get a license ? do you think you can drive safely ?

5. lol what are you going to say ? just straight up ask  what are your views on feminism ?  you think a guy that wants to have sex with you is going to say  oh i hate women  ?

6. which capital do you think he wants ? i say let him have washington . he can ' t do any worse . he is god after all , so do you think one capital is enough ? maybe we should offer him two .

7. thank you . i think i needed someone to say that to break the feedback loop of doubt that i sometimes get stuck in .

8. i can ' t say for sure , but i ' m conjuring up scenes in my head of jedi force  pushing multiple droids over at once ? i think that happened . no idea why there would be an issue focusing on multiple things , although as many as the number of grains of sand in a tornado might be too difficult .

9. bars are places to pick up , to make friends i would say go to another forum . perhaps church or some association . as a man i would think you either is looking to be hitted on or waiting for your friends if i see lonely womman browsing around .

10. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .

11. apparently it ' s a right to carry a gun in church , but gathering to say you think this is wrong is a privelage .
   (ID: f76420437c1e4fb2e8ba8a9e9b0e116c7fc513ab)

12. i think that  s a healthy approach . i would say if you meet a girl you click with make the most of it . enjoy being young !

13. i think as comments flow , you ' ll realise this may not be so much of an unpopular opinion . nevertheless i must say you articulate yourself well . a  from this stranger .

14. its the same as when you ' re in a really bad mood you think fuck everyone and everything sucks . when you ' re on m everything ' s bliss ans you love everything . of course nobody means everything they say , they are extremely conditioned under the influence or the drug
   (ID: af764f37d4a75bdb762464b079f842d6af0847b7)

15. to say that nationalist is more dangerous than muslims that bomb , rape and pillage regular civilians then yes i would say you are far left and you obviously is not very smart if you think that it ' s dumb
   (ID: 957c35ca46ff982635ab97d95c02e9219287f916)

16. i ' d say no . but i think a lot of it is personal bias or what one would prefer to watch .

17. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

18. i think you meant to say ,  would you be harder than dark souls if this were a game ?  . yes , yes i would be .

19. i think given the fact that she sat with him all day on the weekend , no . i would say there were circumstances beyond her control making it necessary for her to continue working .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

20. that ' s funny you say that , i was say the same thing . i think it ' s because of the genetics . nyc has more straight up caribbean and west african folks .
