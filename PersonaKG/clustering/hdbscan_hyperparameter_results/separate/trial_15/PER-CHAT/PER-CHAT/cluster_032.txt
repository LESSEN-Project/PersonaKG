1. i ' m not sure if this post belongs on this subreddit but i ' ll answer your question anyway .   x200b  it is very common for employers and clients to do a background check . if it is a security company , government , or you ' re considered to do a very important task , they ' ll likely do a background check on you . if they find this however , they shouldn ' t think much about it . depending on how they work and it seems though .   x200b  it they search you and just see a message saying " xxx has an arrest record  alert " they might disregard you immediately . if it also says that you have been arrested just for a speeding ticket however , they likely won ' t think too bad of you .   x200b   is there a way to remove it without paying them  or giving more information  ? maybe hire a lawyer and sue them ? idk . can ' t think of anything else .

2. i think hinata cared enough about naruto to not lie to him and if u have seen boruto , she doesn  t always just agree with naruto and do whatever he wants . i agree that sakura was closer to naruto but she let her love for sasuke ignore the treasure in front of her . also sakura in the original shownot shippuden was a totally useless weak and annoying character . she had her moments in shippuden but was still just a basic abusive tsundere

3. to answer you directly . i think no . just get gifted the money and you do the paying of debt .

4. basically everything you think is the motive  reason  outcome isn  t . it just takes an open mind to get past politics and personal attacks .

5. if you  re four months into the relationship , i think they  d be happy to hear  i love you .  that  s just me and my partner , though . best way to do it is  hey , person  s name ? they respond  yeah  or  what  etc i love you .

6. i think i do am missing the point if the whole point of the game is actually just to survive rather than having fun !

7. heres an idea . if any of you guys hate suzanne vega or leonard cohen ' s music , just be honest , my feelings won ' t be hurt if you think they suck monkey balls !

8. i just watched the movie a couple days ago after reading the book , also titled " unbroken . the book provides more detail , and even though the movie might help to visualize a little more , i think the book is a great read .

9. i loved the musical numbers . although i think billy crystal ' s opening montages were hilarious , the theme for this year ' s oscars was a tribute to musical theater so it just made sense to have that opening and the dance sequence .

10. so what if they ' re not the highest quality ? op is proud of them and i think they look nice , so just stop being a dick about it

12. and i think to myself , what a wonderful world . it ' s just so perfect .

13. that ' s just statistics at work . if you have ever even glanced at the numbers to see how many planets are around how many stars around how many galaxies then the idea of any single phenomenon occurring once and only once becomes so unlikely it ' s borderline insane not to think there is life out there .

14. i remember there was a video of a guy raping a person he just murdered . been so long since i saw it but i think the dude had schizophrenia and the dude might have been asian . gloomy world sometimes .

15. ok , because you think it ' s irritating i ' ll delete the other hundred instances of this copypasta that i put on new posts just for u

16. imo , it is a fallacy to think that drawing attention to kony means that one thinks he is the worst out there . even if he is the worst , no rational person would think that he is the only one . drawing attention to one of these lunatics just helps to put a face on the problem as a whole . also , cutting the heads off the hydra is part of what eventually killed it . one just has to remember that there is more to be done .

17. i think it  s pushing your luck not to get two fish . often they stop eating and just lie there and give up on life if they are all alone . my piggiest boy went on a hunger strike for a week when he was in his own for his friend had to go to the fishy vet tank .

18. if there ' s nothing i can do , i just think .

20. i think you just clearly stated the concept of a ' starter home ' that you and your spouse are doing right now . as your family and income grows , you may find that house too small and if you are able to buy a larger home , you may do so .
