1. tracing words repetitively . if i get a series of words that sticks in my brain wether i am having a conversation or watching tv  i trace the words on my right leg , and can do it for hours just impulsively . it honestly feels so stupid when you see a mazda commercial and get the tag line ' zoom zoom ' stuck in your head for a period of time and you ' re just like , why ? it ' s funny , and since it ' s one of my harmless rituals i have , it ' s not a big deal in my everyday life lol .

5. simply ask ,  hey , do you wanna go out ?  guys don  t wanna make assumptions about your intentions and look bad , especially in a society where a guy can be criminalized for being interested in a woman . a shy guy will absolutely not take that risk , so if you  re interested , you should let him know .

9. as to people noticing if you see them often they are less likely to unless they actually pay attention not so common . friends you ' ve not seen for awhile are the best bet ! quitting smoking was what made me start dieting in the first place , heh . i figure once you do one really " hard " thing like lose a lot of weight or give up an addiction the others you have suddenly seem pretty doable

10. so here ' s the point  we are dealing with an overreaction . closing all canadians starbucks shops for a " feeling training " because of a non  serious accident in a foreign country can ' t be described otherwise . the one thing i have learned about overreaction , it tends to be contagious . so i safely assume that the line " don ' t antagonize anyone with high  melaninsed skin " will be the rule of the day . another thing  corporations love money . what cost less ? millions of bad press or the inside of the cash register ? i let you think about it .

16. you seem to have a sense of " wiki  knowledge " you like to point out stuff that happens which is based directly on the comics , yet fail to see it is an adaptation , not a direct translation . you ' re coming across as a hipster douchebag " wah wah wah they didn ' t do what i wanted . how am i gonna look smart in front of my girlfriend " that said affleck ' s track record as a director coupled with the fact he ' s been a fan of the character forever man . he ' s stated he did daredevil because he thought they would never let an actor like him near batman . he may very well give us the definitive batman for all time . so quit whining and be a man already , you couldn ' t pin point every reference because they gave us a film that blended multiple eras of dc history . it ' s whiny little dicks like you that homogenize everything into fucking cookie cutter movies " i want it like marvel , telegraph everything to me . p . s . kevin and ben aren ' t really besties anymore .
