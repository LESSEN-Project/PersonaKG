1. you should try anything and everything you can to get well . leaving is something you can only do once and it will have devastating effects on the people around you . get help from wherever you can get it , therapy , medication , anything that may help .

2. yes she is very close to her stepmother . you asked about our relationship , we have been in a de facto relationship for about digit . digit years now . i have been doing what i can to comfort her and be there for her . i took her out to lunch today i actually wrote this post on the drive home to take her mind off of things and get out of the house . at the moment she is ok then bursts into tears at random times so all i can do is hug her , tell her i love her and let her cry it out . when she was told she cried and then asked to be left alone for a while so if she needs some space i think she will tell me . thank you for the advice , there is a lot there to take in so i will have to read it a few times . her stepmother still might pull through and beat it , but all we can do at this stage is hope for the best . thank you again for helping me understand and giving me pointers on how to approach this .

3. i think you ' re trying to learn but i would not say that a lot of guys are bordering on aspergers . plenty enough are smooth . plenty have empathy . sales principles help build armor . approach anyone you find attractive or seems like a nice person and strike up a conversation particularly if you are shy . this will help you learn to read people as well as show people you are friendly and respectful . when people don ' t wish to engage move on asap . analyze it shortly thereafter but you ' ll getter sense of when to approach people any gender for any reason . and since they won ' t all be romantic interests you won ' t get the shot down feeling if someone doesn ' t want to chat each time . make some female friends who are only friends even if they are blood relatives . they can play wing for you and perhaps accelerate your learning .

4. its not your foult . if she just dumped you like that becouse of your mental health than she is a bitch and doesnt deserve you . try to find a woman that actually cares about you . there are many fish in the sea so dont loose hope . i hope the for best for you . sorry for bad english

5. i  m sorry this is happening to you . i know how this feels and i can tell you it  s never good to have a crush on your best friend . i hope things work out for you .

6. im gonna tell you , mate , taking your life only hurts the people around you . not one single person is thinking life would be better without you . high school is no determination factor anyway , life changes after high school and you can make life what you want it . you can start and entirely new life for yourself , you ' re moving on to how you want to impact the world . i know talking to someone isnt at the top of everyones lists when it comes to mental health but from experience , it really helps . reddit is a really good place to get your emotions out mate . there are lots of people on here with the same problems you ' re going through and we ' re trying to overcome it together . we ' re here for you , mate .

7. if i were to stay with her , i would try my best to give her attention back and be the best boyfriend i could be . that  s not how i could see myself as an asshole . the way i could , would be me losing my patience and leaving in two months .

8. i think it ' s super cool when people come up with things like this , props to you for putting in the effort !

9. i mean tell him you feel like you ' re going back to the person you was . tell him your side of the story ! how you believe the fight was unnecessary . that you feel such a similar pain . who knows , maybe he understands and talking about it will grow the two of you closer together . perhaps there is a good friend who is willing to give you another perspective ?

10. thank you . i don ' t blame myself in a way that isn ' t realistic . i blame myself for not being aware of the warning signs of what happened to me . that ' s about the extent . i don ' t harbor any unhealthy emotions and though i suffer mildly from ptsd i am conscious enough to work on my issues . with that being said . yes , i am still with my boyfriend . the truth of the matter is that he simply isn ' t emotionally mature enough to understand the depths of what had happened . i did threaten to break up with him . the first couple of times he said it to me i didn ' t stand up for myself . i don ' t know why . but the last time he said it i really stuck it to him . i realized that if he thinks this way i can ' t possibly marry someone who will think like that and i told him that . i also told him i will happily leave because i know i wouldn ' t be suffering a loss if that ' s the way he is thinking . for the first time in all the time i have known him he stopped and gave me a very heart felt apology taking accountability for his lack of sympathy and understanding . quite frankly , a lot of other things were said . but it was true and i know he meant it . this is still a red flag for me . if i am suffering from something in the future , am i going to have to be the one to walk him through it too ? just because i am more emotionally equipped to handle ? he ' s not a horrible person . but he is selfish in his thinking . and he is emotionally sheltered . after digit years i am starting to wonder if i want to be the one who does all of the picking up .

11. do it ! who knows , maybe you ' ll fall into another career path you love even more ! i took off several years after college before taking the pre  reqs . i learned a ton , had some great experiences and some not  so  great experiences , and am pretty happy with my decision i guess we ' ll see how my cycle goes . i actually think you ' re very mature  you ' ve figured out what might be best for you !
   (ID: f179711c18514780c1b0257643d893ef1cf5a081)

12. sounds like you are unmotivated , depressed , or a pestimest . i enjoy my life . if you really try to enjoy every single minute , you will . i hope you see that soon , living like what you described sucks .
   (ID: ba841e2486d1df5b5baefde5ead0636c7c03c79c)

13. yeah that ' s ridiculous . you ' ve been dating for less than a month and she constantly pesters you ! like jeez when did she start , week digit ? you ' re nta in this situation , i think a sit down discussion about it is definitely needed tho
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

14. it is not a petty reason at all to be angry at this . you said it yourself you guys had a rough childhood and you still have struggles . you are allowed to feel like this no emotion is invalid . im sorry you are going through this , you seem like a really strong person . focus on your school . i believe in you .
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

15. we all go through this . what eats us up the most is not knowing something but when we do get the chance to find out the truth it always makes us more sad and miserable . so it  s the force that protects us from self harm . yeah of course we want to know the truth so we feel better about ourselves but i . the end it just sets us back and we are left there with the knowledge that our ex did not find us up to their par anymore . really who gives a shit ? they left you , time for you to prove that you are better then them and live your life . live the life you always wanted to . fuck that bitch haha . go have fun and do you .

16. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .
   (ID: 6f13975ce6a8747ec3d0e2207b9ef86d80a28713)

17. hon , you need to think about yourself here . i know that can be hard , especially if you ' re a giver by nature , but it ' s true . if you don ' t feel safe , comfortable , and respected in your relationship , you won ' t be truly happy . and that may not seem like the end of the world now , but it will in time . eventually , bitterness and resentment can start to grow and you ' ll find yourself hating the person you once loved . if you don ' t think you can be happy dealing with his bipolar disorder , it ' s ok to move on . it ' s better that both of you find partners you can truly be fulfilled and happy with , even if it means going through some pain first .
   (ID: 87dcb06b0e31b35730fe93ce7dcbef85e6078b40)

18. i don ' t really see how you weren ' t supportive of her . she seemed to make her mind up on plenty of issues without you and you ' ve tried to approach them all in a logical way . also she purposeful tries to do things that hurt you ? that ' s unsupportive . you might have to let her go . i think it ' ll be better for both of you .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

19. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .
