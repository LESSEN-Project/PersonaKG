1. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

2. just recently i was on my school  s subreddit and commented on a post concerning the strike that  s on right now . the post was a rant from an anonymous ta that was full of anger and hatred toward their students . they complained that the school treated them like shit which is why they  re on strike . okay , fine , maybe that  s the case . but then they proceeded to swear at and belittle their own students which makes me want to see their side less . so i posted a comment asking how exactly they were treated poorly and what the whole thing was . i also told them that they should at least try to understand that the strike is financially killing us . i also said that i know it isn  t that simple , but if it  s so bad and it has been for a while , just quit your job . even if it  s hard to find a new one , it  s not worth it . then i got a reply from the same person who posted the rant , under a different account seeing as their old one was deleted , and they threw a whole slew of insults my way . such as  you probably still live with your parents you fucking retard . you don  t understand shit , maybe see the bigger picture before you run your dumbass mouth .  sorry what ? i literally just asked how they were treating you poorly . and i wasn  t even rude . i  m sorry ? i then told them that , i do in fact not live with my parents and if i did so what ? i  m really young . then i asked for them to explain to me , please what exactly is going on with them in terms of how they  re treated so i can understand them better . but instead i got  you  re young so that explains why you  re talking out of your ass . stop rambling on about this fucking shit , you don  t know what you  re talking about .  the fuck ? thankfully people stuck up for me and the ta got downvoted to oblivion . but they had a rebuttal for almost everything and avoided answering any questions in regards to clarifying their rant . the post was then locked due to fear of rising conflict . why does this ta not understand that insulting me makes me want to help and understand them less ? if they had explained themselves it would have been much easier

3. and you ' re the type of person who thinks so highly of themselves they can ' t even understand a simple joke . get your head out of your ass .

4. i ' m not making excuses . if trump did somthing then he should be impeached . bottom line . but they better start enforcing the law straight across the board . i want to see equal justice . kareem hunt , a football player , was just ousted from the nfl for domestic violence . keith ellison , dnc chair , just won an election in mn while also having been accused of domestic violence . that is not equal justice . they pick and choose who the law applies to . one day it may be you somebody is going after un justly . as a foreigner here in our country you should expect the best we can offer . you should expect to live the dream . what is going on now with trump is a dangerous path down a dark road . for everyone . and it ' s unfair to you in perticular because it does not showcase america as the light of the world . it ' s shows us petty and bitter . willing to ruin people ' s lives for political gain .

6. you have only proven that you do not know what you are saying regarding this subject . may you never know what it  s like to be forced to fight a war or be put in a cage . are you a brit ? still mad about the american revolution ? imperialist twat , how funny .

7. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .

8. my my , you do a fine job of " discussing . you screech some hate , you lie and insult me . you sound like every other fox  addled right wing fascist the question is , if you live up to the stereotype , then why shouldn ' t i think badly of you ?

9. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .

10. lol , ok ok . i ' ll stop . dude , for you own sanity . realise that this is a shitpost . my account is a shitpost account . you are arguing with me on a heavily down voted thread that almost no one will ever see . look in the mirror , remind yourself that you are a human being that doesn ' t need to get upset about idiots on the internet that are clearly doing stuff to get a rise out others . cause dude . it ' s not ever gonna stop . get used to it .

11. you probably don ' t have a clue what it entails . calling one out for stupidity while the biggotry and sjw ethics almost drips down your comment . not knowing what mgtow entails , but still judging upon it . do you get triggered by your own stupidity too ? or only when you think you can respond to it . i didn ' t call you sjw , though your reasoning and choice of words indicate you are , a raging one at that . so , if you wanna argue about these topics , start to learn how to read and understand . idiot . you know these subs are regularly vacated by raging sjw ' s that can ' t accept that people disagree right ? pretty much what you are doing .

12. people are less defensive when they don ' t feel attacked . true . nepene ' s above comment addresses this quite nicely . i ' m curious what you mean regarding socialism   it ' s a catchy turn of phrase , but i don ' t think i completely follow .

13. you asked my opinion based on the reply i presented which in fact mentioned gender . i also explained in detail why i conflate men wearing makeup and homosexuality . so if you want answers dealing with my opinion based on my reply that you commented on we are in fact talking about gender . what you want is irrelevant i have no idea who you think you ' re talking to that i would simply do what you want . i ' m not the beta males you may be used to dealing with . i do what i want . i gave you my answer , if you don ' t like it i could actually care less .

14. how do you know that you are coming at me without facts
   (ID: 23df46bdba3eb265d08b02c9ec5f365cf45ae5fd)

15. you know what , you ' re absolutely right , it ' s mean for me to point out your errors  especially on a forum like idle heroes . i don ' t intend to discourage you or make you feel like you need to justify yourself . you ' ve taught me a lesson today and in the future , i ' ll know that pointing out someones minor mistakes , is not worth the effort and only upsets people . thank you for taking the time for the back and forth . peace .

16. are you just downvoting people not conforming to your sensitivities ! we are the people you asked for " help . i was right
   (ID: cd0b72d117bf74908c3edaaf3947b089a9dafc0c)

17. i haven ' t told what you can and can ' t find funny , i ' ve told you what is innapropriate to say , there ' s a difference . when i said it was a joke , you said this  " no , it ' s not . jokes are meant to be funny to more people than just you . " sure you might not be saying that i didn ' t find it funny , but you were saying that no one else finds it funny . which is wrong . you are wrong .  my actions here were mostlt for the benefit of the op . you ' re words most likely bothered them in a big way , and as well as wanting to stand up to someone behaving like you did , i also wanted to show the op that someone would stand up for them and hopefully counter how you made them feel . a person on the internet who is mature enough will understand that most people will be sarcastic when given the chance . especially since he didn ' t put a " serious " tag on his post . my comment was very much clearly a joke , made obvious by the exclamation point . the fact that you got so triggered by it just highlights your immaturity and inability to recognise jokes on the internet . you might find that this flaw , this cluelessness to social cues , is one of the reasons you were bullied .  think what you want of my actions , i feel like i did the right thing . you didn ' t do anything wrong . you are just acting like a stuck up bitch . you ' re like that one person that always takes a joke seriously , gets offended because it isn ' t a " clean joke " and complains about it while other people just laugh .  and well done for admitting you made a dick move , most people don ' t have the balls to go back and admit a mistake . no need to congratulate me on something everyone like me will do , this is just showing how naive you are . there is no mistake , there never was a single mistake . i am a dick . people like me will always admit to acting like a dick . why do you think i do the things i do ? i ' m not oblivious like you .

18. if they understand everything else i said , then they understand the last part too , they ' re just in denial .

19. your first respons had little to nothing to do with my original post . you just tossed out your own idea . you then mentioned how it would remove the pvp aspect . i responded by explaining why pvp can ' t work in this . when you mentioned that games succeed or fail based on numerous things , i pointed out that dbd devs can focus on those numerous things that could boost the quality to oblivion , if they start using controllable ai . i ' ve stayed on topic . you haven ' t . you ' re a pathtic hypocrite .
   (ID: f67f4ffc3afd37a9ece4ede606682407c9b920b1)

20. yep , you ' re totally just ignoring this . you didn ' t make a comment about how you were unsubscribing or respond to my comment . i can see how you just mind your own business and ignore things . you ' re totally not acting like a whiny snowflake at all .
