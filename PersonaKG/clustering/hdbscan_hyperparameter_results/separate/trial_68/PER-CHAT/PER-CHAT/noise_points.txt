1. i ' ve been lucky enough to snag a position as digital media director at the radio station . have my own staff and stuff , but i guess i don ' t know what proper internships to look for because i ' m in the journalism field . i don ' t know where to start lol to even find something i could be interested in that i even have the skill for .

2. not getting the desired results from your expensive oils ? you just need this new expensive product we sell to make the first ones effective !

3. but isn ' t this the natural thing to do ? didn ' t evolution say the " hotter " girls are the ones to survive ? just as the more tough , brute force boys are to attract the girls ? denying this almost seems the same to me as trying to convince gay people they should be straight . i ' m all in favor of promoting intelligence , but then we end up with kids that sit behind computers or grow up and sit behind desks all day at work and slowly fatten and waste away . why can ' t we promote kids to be both good looking and smart ? self  esteem is important , both in your personal hygiene  grooming habits , and in your intelligence . i agree super  model only mentality is wrong , but we need a healthy balance , not a swing shift to the other extreme of how we talk to little girls . tell them they look good and they ' re smart .

4. after reading some of the comments ive come to realise people find some of the magic eyes difficult . i assumed you could either see them or you couldn ' t . although this image is quite shallow in depth it resolves itself just as easily as any other . not entirely sure what point i ' m trying to make only that it was an eye opener so to speak

7. some teachers in my school make fun of those victims as well or even chose their own victims . yeah , pretty fucked up . i go to one of the top public highschool in my country .

10. there ' s a reason " corporate drone " is a saying . eyes forward , yes sir . just shut off everything but your brain ' s section that stops you from telling people what you really think of them .

11. those areas are sensitive and unprotected by bone . there ' s an episode of sawbones that goes into ticklishness far better than i can explain in a text post , i suggest you check it out for a full explanation . for me personally i hate being touched there because i was raised with a sibling who saw my body as a toy and didn ' t care how many times i said " no " or " stop . she bullied me for my weight all through childhood even though i spent a year on a " medicinal diet " that starved me , and digit years ago tried to cut my face open with a kitchen knife , which is why i ' m flinchy about my face being touched .

12. you know what ' s even worse ? their many , many readers will find that shit hilarious , and if you tell them why you think that shallow playground humour is insipid , they ' ll just dismiss you as being part of the " pc brigade .

13. right , i can see why you would make that decision . i was thinking about the dark base too but i wasn ' t really sure about it . is it any good ? what can i expect from a case like that ?

14. you  re right they aren  t the same thing at all , of course they wouldn  t come back the same . like religious texts are treated as truths , many people disagree and tweak them . same thing has happened in history texts , you can  t be digit  certain that it happened in the past . someone may have messed with the records . what separates history and religion is the faith you must have to believe in it .

15. i think the proper analogy would be  a person who does not post  leave home won ' t get banned  mugged . the more often you ' re outside  you post , the more chances there are that you will be considered a mark  offend a mod . the more often you go to dark alleys  sb and sv , there more you risk , as the muggers  mods are more vicious there . one can give the mugger his valuables when confronted  be civil , follow the rules , and take his lumps when he and the mods don ' t agree , and then he probably wont be beaten up  banned .   x200b  see ? i too can make up loaded analogies .   x200b  i insist that " zoat asshole , zoat hissy fit " is a childishly simplistic view of the situation . to me it looks like  zoat is more active , so is at higher risk of ban all else being equal  zoat is a bit abrasive , so this also contributes to conflicts that may occur  sv and sb mods are power tripping , sb mods more than sv ones  you seem to think zoat is in the wrong and behaves childishly , completely disregarding that mods can also power trip and behave childishly .   x200b  also , at which odds are you ready to take a bet that zoat will receive next ban before eaglejarl does ? digit  digit ? digit  digit ?

16. i would say make it so that the readers know why he ' s doing it . what ' s driving him ? for relatable . but personally , i would love to read about a character on their way to their first victory . so yeah i ' d say that ' s brilliant .

17. you guys get a schedule ? damn lol . at the dc everything is word of mouth and if somebody didn ' t let you know that we are supposed to come in an extra day , you ' re fucked . make sure you have friends here lol

18. i get it , honestly i do because i ' m the same way . this might sting but it ' s the truth . you ' re lazy . you want instant gratification . i get it , i do too ! i ' m lazy as well , but i don ' t like that about me and so i grab that feeling with both hands and i squeeze it down and say " fuck you quitter , i ' m going to learn how to play  do this " . my dad used to tell me this and i hold it close to this day , " toughen up buttercup " . you have to fight for what you want , even against yourself .

20. yes . maybe a weekly post where those who are comfortable can post a success story for the week ? we would all know where to find it if we need to . my most recent achievement was just yesterday . i was able to go to the mcdonald ' s drive thru and order my daughter a happy meal .
