1. because the heat of the sun , and the amount of water and salt and all the time that it ' s been there . there is more water and more area affected by that than in your glass of water . although maybe it ' s an interesting experiment if you put lot of salt in a small container , you heat it up and when you ' re gonna smell it , you cover you head and the container with a towel . if you try it , let me know what happens .

2. i like this . here is my take  professor hulk uses starks version of the infinity gauntlet to bring everyone back , captain america uses mjolnir to fight thanos , captain america finally says avengers assemble , and the combined avengers defeat thanos and his army . also , stark hugs peter when he sees him alive for the first time and peter says " huh , this is nice " . we even get a scene during the time travel sequence where the future captain america fights the past captain america . the captain america from the past says " i can do this all day " and the future captain america says " i know " . also , spoilers .

7. from what i understood is that you ' re wife is basically boycotting you in bed for weeks at a time . you should know that according to the hadith , the angels curse her until dawn for that and she is constantly sinning . your ' fantasy ' about getting a second wife is not haram . allah has made it halal for a reason , and if you can fulfill the requirements , go for it ! otherwise , this can be reasonable grounds for divorce . allahu ' alam .
