5. that ' s me too . just add being super depressed and fat . i agree with most of the things in the article but what terrifies me even more is that if things go well you realize oh shit eventually i ' ll have to meet most of their friends and family which will likely bring about parties , get togethers , holidays , etc . you then start wondering how many you can skip or how many excuses you can make up and it always ends up becoming a vicious cycle and you figure fuck it , it ' s much easier being alone . that ' s until you start feeling lonely again and you think oh it can ' t be that bad .
