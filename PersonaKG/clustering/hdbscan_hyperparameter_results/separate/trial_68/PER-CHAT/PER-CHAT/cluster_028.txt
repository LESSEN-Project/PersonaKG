1. we have a certain sense of accomplishment to make up for it . think about it  we ' re mundane folk who figured out how to alter reality on our own . no bloodline , god or otherworldly being helped us .

8. to be fair , i doubt most of us would be here if we didn ' t trust him , but i don ' t think any of us can make up your mind for you . read about him , watch videos of him and decide for yourself if he deserves your trust .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

9. do you think you are human , or anything else ? digit . are you happy ? what else can i do that would make you happy ?

10. i think they should make it epic and legendary , keep it the same in all the other ways
   (ID: 52e0e376c09b4862d8eea84ae547c3466a2aac4b)

11. yeah , kraus make some weird stuff . if you think theyre neat , check out some old altmans faucets . i think altmans closed the buisness though , so they ' re not made anymore .

12. wouldn  t the accounts receivable of banks be completely thrown off though ? the banks would simply be wrecked financially and the federal reserve requirement eventually . someone would make money off of the hedging the risk but i would think that ultimately banks would lose millions if not billions in accounts receivable . hell if it actually happened i don  t think the us would have serious consequences . i think it could happen if everyone started to default on there loans alone .
