3. i ' m a christian . i believe that jesus preached for us to do things like love , be compassionate , generous , and honest . as such  i believe in evolution and human  caused climate change , because the proof is overwhelming . i believe that being gay is neither evil , nor a choice . god created gay people , just as he created me . he loves them , too . i refuse to believe that god would be so cruel , as to set gay people up for failure . i believe that money and religion cannot mix . either you serve god , or you serve your greed for money . not both . there is no such thing as a racist christian . there are plenty of racists , though , who call themselves christian . if you truly love christ , you love your fellow human , no matter the ethnicity . i sincerely wish that the many cinos christian in name only in the world would recognize their own hypocrisy , and denounce dogma , when it clearly causes suffering , inflames hatred , or requires hefty lying to oneself .

6. oh totally , lust at first sight is common . in fact , it ' s probably what leads to the ' love at first sight ' myth . when you have that kind of animal attraction to someone , it can help keep a relationship strong .

14. most of your critiques  praises are based off the film ticking  not ticking your agenda . bisexual warrior queen ? lol mmkay . people love valkyrie because shes an awesome character , period . not because of her briefly hinted sexuality from a deleted scene .

15. yeah i agree , i kinda expected more of a  hows the internets work  kinda stuff , not  let  s laugh at conservatives who were laughing at liberals .  i get it  in the us a lot of grandmas are proper , god fearing conservatives and their email forwards and facebook tags would reflect that . but my grandma still sends me  satan thinks you won  t forward this to three people you love , jesus has faith folded  hands in you  type shit .
