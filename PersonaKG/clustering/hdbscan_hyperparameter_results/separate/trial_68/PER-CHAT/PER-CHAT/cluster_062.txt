3. people seem to hate seeing other people talk about themselves on all social media platforms these days . mentioning your own projects  streams  blog posts  youtube videos on your own god  damn profile is now seen as extremely spammy by a lot of people . i have no idea why there has been such a shift in what is now appropriate to post about on one ' s own profile . i say , it ' s your profile , talk about whatever you want to talk about . promote she shit out of yourself , and give the people who want to bitch about it , a giant middle finger .
