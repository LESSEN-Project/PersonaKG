6. people should stop feeling so entitled because they have been " loyal " if such thing can be sayed , to a company , in the end is a buy  sell you only have the right over the thing you buy , not the creative decissions , or strategic ones . i agree with you .
   (ID: f388f39a9ea47e429d419a3a30153fba53fa1033)

7. i . had no idea this was a thing . i am digit  a cat person . is this why some people are so aggressively proud of liking dogs more than cats ? i always used to wonder why people are so keen to shove that in my face .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

8. yeah . help is one thing we lack here . most people can ' t understand the whole thing . and the ones who do , doesn ' t know how to help . and the organisations there to help aren ' t very effective either . it ' s nightmare to have depression here . speaking of which , can you describe what made you get out of it ? i ' m kinnda looking for answers myself .
   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

11. because there are people who write that kind of thing .
   (ID: 0b52265db13bf8bc27ad36aad94e870706eb6689)

12. pride is a place for people to be celebrated and excepted , not excluded . if people were excluded from pride , pride would become the very thing it battled to destroy .
   (ID: b5e15026c378d181e66e2b38bfc245705510a727)

13. they think they are doing the right thing . when you aren  t one of the othered , it  s hard to empathize . i  m sorry for your experience !
   (ID: f90b0d899acf3c82adaa55fb250d0c7ea9eaeaf3)

14. i think you ' re doing the right thing . i hope the kid understands your decision as soon as he is old enough to get the story .
   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

15. yeah i ' m with you . it ' s hard to imagine that ' s what bernie ' d do with it . i guess if i can trust him to be president i can trust him to do the right thing with a few thousand bucks or whatever though .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

16. if done right , a collection of vignettes can be incredibly engaging . suttree by cormac mccarthy is a prime example of this , or steinbeck ' s cannery row . one of the things that makes it doable is how the vignettes tap into the reader ' s humanity  there is something they can connect with . i think it ' s a cool idea . who cares if it ' s the in thing right now .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

17. yeah i checked his post history . kinda a attention whore but sometimes attention attracts people who will help . i had the same thing happen , depression is not fun . but i eventually got help and here i am . i can see your point but sometimes getting people upset just adds fuel to the fire .
