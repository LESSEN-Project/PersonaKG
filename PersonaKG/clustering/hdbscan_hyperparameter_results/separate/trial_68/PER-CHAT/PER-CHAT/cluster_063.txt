3. it  s actually insane to me how ppl call tat waiter a creep and suggest op should report him to the restaurant . with the given info the waiter really might have just tried to be as friendly as possible  maybe just really likes kids  has grandchildren himself . he even gave her a desert for free , jesus . just to be stigmatized for being a pedophile , potentially being fired ? op , yta .

6. nothing really . i was allowed to watch just about whatever and even if i was told not to , i would watch it anyway . i understood things a lot sooner than most kids as a result .

7. my eyes are bleeding . even if all these emojis are a part of the joke which just makes no sense in this case , it ' s still really painful to see

9. if you found them because you were also using the app , then you can ' t really be mad , but you should definitely talk , discuss being open , or just break up . if someone else found them and showed you , just break up .

10. not really , it ' s not all that uncommon in the lesbian community if you ' re in a relationship . which she is , just definitely not with me . we each have a wife at home .
