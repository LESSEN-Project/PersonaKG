1. depends on how random the words are that i ' ll forget . if they ' re ones i can learn again , i ' ll take it . if they ' re names and identities of people i know , no . also i ' m cracking up thinking of a scenario where a person tries to use this in an interview to one up the interviewer .

2. certainly not a bad idea to let at least someone know where you are especially when you  re a female . if you do go missing , someone can call the cops as soon as they notice you  re gone and it  s much more likely that you  ll be found .
