2. that ' s really interesting thank you ! in my mind i always believe that businesses would seek vc but it ' s really interesting that they proactively seek you out , which kind of makes sense because if i had a shed load of cash to invest i wouldn ' t be sat around waiting for the golden goose . good luck in your business , it ' s a fantastic idea !
