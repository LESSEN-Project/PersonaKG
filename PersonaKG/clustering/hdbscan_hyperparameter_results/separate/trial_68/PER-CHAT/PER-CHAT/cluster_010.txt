3. it sounds to me like you should be talking to a lawyer instead of asking the internet . you make one google about a cough and before you know it google says you have aids . don  t expect any different . at least i gave you ideal advice .

5. shmukatelli would do well to get to know someone with genuine gender dysphoria , and shmukatelli might learn some compassion for those with the condition . getting a sex change is not something one goes through on a whim . neither i , nor anyone in my family is like this that i know of but if my children ever came forward as such , i would support whatever decision they might make .

6. but you ' re expecting the outcome of making fire and trying to achieve it . if you had no concept of what it was or where it came from , why would you believe you could make it , or try to ? you know it can be made by friction and other sources . they apparently only know it comes from lightening . and they can ' t make that , so they have no reason to try rubbing sticks together .

7. i know it  s a little weird but i honestly walk around talking to myself acting out fantasies that are in my head . they are usually happy and help me forget about my worries and focus on things and ideas that make me truly happy .

8. my best friend . i know it sounds cheesy , but he ' s the only person that can make me laugh myself to death and forget all my worries .
