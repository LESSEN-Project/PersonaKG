2. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !

3. do dreads kind of make your hair thicker ? because i always see people go from buzz cut to dreads and i cannot understand how they possibly had that much hair on their head . if i tried to dread my hair i ' d look like lil yachty but not braids , they ' d just be dreads lol

4. for the most part . the problem as i see is that the investgation was long and publicised . its been at the forefront of the news cycle for almost two years . people are burnt out on it and tired of the far left and far right . its like listening to two children argue and fight with each other . at some point everyone just wants the politicians and judiciary to shut up and run the country .

5. i like  agree with what he ' s saying . he just isn ' t most people ' s idea of " a wordsmith . how much can you really fault him for that ?
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

6. i totally agree with you . but there comes a point where people like me who like trump or just getting so f   pissed off that we ' re going to do anything and everything we can to get him re  elected no matter what .
   (ID: 331ee7d55ed61dd31719ad2346a40aaa6c969f22)

7. guess my point is , there ' s always a lot of hate towards white people and slurs , but it ' s kinda just shrugged off like nothing . it ' s like most see it as okay .
   (ID: 65b64663fe8890c471866a25cf075ff50d852dbf)

8. this is one of those people new to tf2 who thought they would like to share a video with u , so lower those pitchforks , or just a kid who wants karma , in that case , shower him in downvotes
   (ID: 5a485308ca6e36eb17d7b0fc321fcf7695f3af53)

9. people like that never seem to realise how unoriginal and unfunny their jokes are . it ' s just painful to watch at this stage .
   (ID: f114f40c03e5812464be61882b264a0abe2a545e)

10. by the simplest and most accurate definition , it ' s a particular act that you personally sexualise more than just about anything else . it doesn ' t have to be innately sexual . just like sexualities and , closer in relation , fetishes , nobody knows why fantasies exist . but there is speculation that the reason they remain fantasies is because people rarely see themselves participating in real life .

11. how do people not just sit back and be like . this is ridiculous !
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

12. the guy is just bad at grammar and making coherent sentences , yet some people still believe that he will actually go and admit things like that to public .
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

13. i see it and i see people in the comments like " omg there ' s no way your dads so cray cray " and it ' s just sad to see some people are that gullible .
   (ID: a73b0dda35d389b4f74e47db6574e0f71738b683)

14. someone called me some bad stuff and admitted that the intent was to harm me . took me almost a year to figure out that bad people just exist and can fit in with society like everyone else .
   (ID: c9b1e924c86788c982ec59df3d5704354a2a4ae1)

15. it ' s just a matter of what people find attractive . myself , i like all parts of the chicken !
   (ID: 128346fc1e56ccadd25a4b200ecae44637d48f5f)

16. " detoxing " it ' s actually really bad for your system huge lack of protein and lipids and is basically just a massive scam to trick people into buying products that otherwise would never sell like who the fuck would drink beet juice on a regular basis
   (ID: 569832646eef001c1724d2ecdb8abedbbfd927ab)

17. god i hated bobobo  bo bo  bobo it really wasn  t for me but it was for some just like how a lot of people didn  t like . hack   sign i loved it though
   (ID: 9057da1059e9ffba54ce02d4a15e2aac2b3ceabb)

18. yeah , sucks to see bitlife get more buzz like articles and youtube videos . i remember even seeing people saying how original is their logo , knowing they just got it from instlife
   (ID: 2f03a8d589defb9434044b9ef9bfffc676e2b49a)

19. its negative because the people who feel like they are treated unequally would end up wanting to be treated better than equal . its just like the some of the lgbtq people who call themselves a million different genders . it makes no sense , and it ' s just unreasonable .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

20. he could be , and i can see where you are coming from . or he could just be a lonely old man who wants to be friendly and you ' re the only one who ' s actually engaged him in conversation when he ' s tried . maybe he sits alone in front of the tv by himself every night , hoping his kids will call and they never do . eats lunch alone because he doesn ' t get along with the other professors , etc . maybe you ' re like the one person who has been actually friendly and not just professional with him and he looks forward to it each day , which leads him to go a little overboard . like a stay at home parent who talks nonstop the minute another adult is around not being there to see his interactions with other people , it ' s hard to tell . i like to give people the benefit of the doubt .
