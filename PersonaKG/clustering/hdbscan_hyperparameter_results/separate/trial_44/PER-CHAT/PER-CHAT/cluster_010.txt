10. i hate when people doesn ' t understand that an elementi has not the same properties in every molecule he ' s in . shouldn ' t otherwise your mouth explode when you put salt on food because of the sodium ? or oxygenated water be good to drink ? this is simply pure ignorance , even middle school teaches you this

16. choose your poison that ' s a nice test to give to people that are literally incapable of telling good from evil , because you made them in such a way . doesn ' t sound very flattering about god ' s character , is it ?  christianity at least imho is a soothing white lie i prefer calling it opiate of the masses . it helps one notice both great utility as a painkiller and horrible side effects .   x200b

17. true good people are the best . but . you can trust your love with a pet . very reciprocal . walk a gorgeous doggy and see who you meet at a dog park . generally speaking those are some lovely people . best of luck to you .

18. steven moffat is a good writer , but seasons six and seven were still bad and annoying . the long game is good , you people are just mean . same goes for in the forest of the night . mel is actually really endearing . the only truly bad seven story is dragonfire  silver nemesis is fun and delta is a good concept with a bad execution . amy and rory leaving was more of a relief than anything . i liked them , but by the end they ' d been fully subsumed into the aforementioned annoyingness .   x200b

19. the judeo  christian god is an absolute of everything we consider desirable , to the extent that it is unattainable and conflicting , all powerful , all knowing , and all loving sound good on paper , but conflict with the presence of evil polytheistic religions tend to have gods that celebrate human characteristics and imperfections . unfortunately , gods that celebrate human characteristics like partying , drinking , war , and sex aren ' t good for " controlling people " everything good is attributed to one god , everything bad attributed to our humanity .
