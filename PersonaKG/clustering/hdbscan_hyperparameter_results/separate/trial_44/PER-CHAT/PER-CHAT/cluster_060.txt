Total from this dataset: 44

1. i think it ' s more like when you go to pick up your kid from school but you forgot his name .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

2. i like the way you think
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

3. kerfuffle . is it a word ? im not sure . have i hear it being used ? i think so . do i like how it sounds ? certainly .
   (ID: 20e44d996799f8bb3fe89546818050bf021f4be9)

4. i constantly try and constantly fail to explain the meaning of " arrombado " to non  brazilians . the closest meaning i can think of is " what you would call someone who drives one of those trucks with testicles hanging , changes lanes without signaling , almost hits you and acts like you are the wrong one .

5. i think everyone pronounces their ts like ds if its in the middle of a word
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

6. watch it again . its after he turns and runs . listen to them talk about it , as well . not even close . and if he had called it and thats what caused kozma to break off , why do him and holiday look at each other like a couple of bumbling idiots immediately after ? regardless of how you think of that particular call , instant replay would be of huge benefit to all teams in the mlb .

7. he was trying to wife you i bet . also out of curiosity . how old are you and what ' s your " number " if you had to guess . i ' d like to guage what you think is more than your fair share compared to mine
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

8. i think its ok if it advances the plot along . like if a character is sleeping with someone to get information or something . otherwise yeah it seems kinda dumb .
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)

9. there ' s a film i think it ' s called cannibal family or something like that . it ' s a pretty ok film for its budget . but if i ' m not mistaken someone who was involved in someway with the original . and i think they called it and " unofficial " remake . i could be totally wrong and please call me out if i am . but it might be worth a watch
   (ID: 4ffb044c26007ae2bade7d602b40fcd747aae147)

10. again . it ' s unlikely you ' ll ever like the way it sounds , because it ' s not what you ' re used to hearing of your voice . but others may like it more than you think .
   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

11. that  s wild , she  s either a sweaty girl or that bra hasn  t been washed in like literal months . op should be like  hey i  m gonna do a load of laundry , wanna toss your clothes in ?  . on that note i still think this is shp .
   (ID: 5b21cc135fb593212a5256d44f50dc5eda5d9947)

12. i used to be like that too , not anymore though . but i ' m afraid i will at some point think about it again so i like to make jokes because it makes something i ' m scared of a little less scary .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

13. " hey mike , you ever think that shock therapy stuff could work on an incestuous fuck like me ? fire it up ! "
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

14. i think i found it ! something called " captain blasto . this article says that one of his lines is " honey i ' m home "  here ' s a gameplay video , though it looks ps1 instead of n64 . but this is definitely your guy , in space with a blaster with the wisecracks very much like the gex game i remembered
   (ID: abbe051c76bbb939d8594349cac549cb5435920d)

15. i like that . i think the origin of " god bless you " was the belief that when you sneeze some of your soul escapes .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

16. i think the question is asking what industries you ' d like to kill off , i think you ' re taking it as an insult
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

17. more importantly , what do i think of myself for getting into someone ' s personal life like that .
   (ID: 23a788cf7874353f54f4163f0e2c16e6043d04a1)

18. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

19. do you think they would still be missing parts of the brain ? it looked like the nodes would cover an inch diameter so there would definitely be blind spots .
   (ID: 7f5ac4f6e5058de85fb427076fffe8f6aa7ba618)

20. do girls think of boys the way we think of them ? like if a girl hears someone on reddit is boy checks for photo posts or tried to imagine  what they look like .
