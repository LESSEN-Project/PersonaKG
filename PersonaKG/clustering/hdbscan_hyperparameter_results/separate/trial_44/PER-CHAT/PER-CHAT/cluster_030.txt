1. when i discovered that there are a lot , and i mean a lot , of people out there that think the government can , and should , fix all their problems . craziness .
   (ID: 7f3ed7262bf05d9d101b2b917869b90e43710a7a)

2. sometimes i gather up a bunch of binders and folders and walk quickly around the office building with a worried expression on my face to make people think i ' m working hard

4. sure it would be creepy if the guys were random strangers . but op hasn ' t specified that . it could just be people she knows . in view that , i think it ' s alright . quick to jump to conclusions aren ' t we !

5. i just think that people who get mad at trees and reindeer on government buildings are just getting mad at a part of christmas that pretty much the entire country celebrates , and isn ' t even remotely christian . gotcha . as a us citizen i pretty sure you ' re aware of our world champion status at getting butthurt . nothing official or otherwise will keep grumblers from grumbling . officially removing its religious status whatever that looks like would just provoke an even bigger response as i see it .  yeah , i ' m not trying to . i ' m starting to think i should have made my frame a little more concise as to what i meant by christmas being ' not christian ' . ya , this is the reason i think people are kind of lighting this idea up . it ' s what made me think the reasoning had an emotional basis   as stated it ' s a bit off  balanced .

6. i  m pretty sure one off exposure doesn  t do a lot i think it  s when people are exposed to it daily that is the real danger . not certain though
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

7. if you use treat as rewards , try not to let other people just give treats for no reason . i can ' t use small treats with training anymore becuase my roommate was an idiot and would give them to my dog regardless of outcome . had to switch to a new reward system , which isnt fun with corgis because they tend to think they are smarter then us owners .
   (ID: 31d924f098e0871341a799d7a5777fb635f53b34)

8. it ' s always a thought . like  what would happen ? what would people think ?
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

9. but i ' m sure you can win people over . i ' m not a politician , i couldn ' t care even less what other people think , nor do i have such responsibility to do so . what ' s best isn ' t the same thing as what most people think .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

10. it honestly not that . i think it  s smugness coming from people who think they are more important than they are .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

11. i think you are an upstanding member of a higher functioning society . i agree with you on all points . and i greatly appreciate that you have replied to people disagreeing with you . it ' s just a shame that none seems open minded to it .
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

12. if you hold people to impossible standards , you ' re going to be disappointed . what if the perfect man for you isn ' t exactly " hollywood handsome ? " you ' re excluding a lot of people because you ' re too picky . also , you might not be as great as you think . if you ' re so great and you ' re still single , there might be a reason . maybe your personality .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

13. i think it ' s perfectly fine to call people out on their shitty spelling and grammar . now everyone knows what our opinions are . hooray !
   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

14. agreed , i think this list shows how far reddit has its head up its ass . people joke about the hivemind but this list really shows it
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

15. i also care . think of all the people he ' ll be having a conversation with whose eyes will lock on , realize what they ' re seeing , and wish it were a boob . those are precious microseconds of their lives that none of these suckers will get back .
   (ID: dc123ff47fa4f2e85bbecd444342fe7d8fcb7db5)

16. yeah i think people may find my emblem of a crackpipe and ' meth  man ' disagreeable
   (ID: dc1a6ca8b7ce3327dec097f0883d72c2689870fc)

17. being happy and being usefull for other people . for me if you think you shouldn ' t be happy you are living wrong and if you think it ' s fine being a useless piece of shit you are living wrong as well .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

18. not being preachy but maybe look at potential partners other aspects mental  spiritual , lifestyle choices etc . and see if those are healthy  attractive . people can change but if you are dating someone in a rut , it will be ten times harder for them to better themselves once dating and that ' s the real ugly side of relationships . if you think you are shallow about appearances then you might be using it as an excuse to not address other flags from that person . unfortunately it is so easy to rate people based on image so it ' s just a constant effort to remind yourself .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

19. the photos are photos of my kid and the boyfriend eg my kid going down a slide on his lap etc . i can see why she values the photos  but i think it is unnecessary to share them in this context as the only people in this group chat who these photos are of any relevance to is herself . nobody else in the group chat even knows the bloke except my in laws who have met him once or twice .
   (ID: c0cbd0e097375f98ad98ec291f836a39d55e02c1)

20. no you weren  t raped and it  s sad that people think what happened to you is the same as getting attacked . forget gender , you were in your house with your girlfriend , and the only reason people think is because you were tired . get real kid . your not a victim , you just need a nap .
