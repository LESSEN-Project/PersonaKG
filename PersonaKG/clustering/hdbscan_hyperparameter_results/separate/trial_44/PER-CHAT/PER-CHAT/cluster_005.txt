8. all depends on your background and motives . empathy of someone is a must . for me , as a nice guy trust me please . you need this one thing , secret tip . you need to process that every person , even at worse has had a different situation to you in the past and you do not know where , or how they became who they are . you look at yourself , and your traits and be thankful , postives overcome negatives if you think that .

9. one sure  fire way , in any larger city , go to mlk boulevard , find a hooker , she will know where to get the crack . you are going to think she will be trying to rip you off , she will be thinking the same thing , you have to maneuver a way to meet in the middle somehow . lol , you can do it !

10. i still think it ' s pretty impressive for how long they survived considering that basically every single brit was hunting them down . the bismarck wasn ' t only about sea superiority , but it was also a psychological weapon . the big bad wolf , the bogeyman under europe ' s bed . i know it ' s easy to lose a ship at sea but it still amazes me .

11. i know this may seem crazy and scary but rehab may be something to look into . you seem super smart and aware , and with this kind of drug use , that will eventually disappear and you will be powerless . think about it and best of luck to you !
   (ID: e8fea87ced4a86b7ba9c50ae33cf5b3dda99af88)

   (ID: 6260fdfdc8a5feec78502a823b8de04ee318e260)

14. i do get laid , and i dont think you even know how to please one . however i am an enviro9enthusiast and care about all animals and ecosystems , which you so clearly dont give a damn about . bust since you are all high and mighty . can you tell me where the clit is ?

   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

18. i  m sorry , i have to ask . i know image is everything , but why do all these rappers follow through on being a thug ? you  d think especially after they make it , they  d break ties with that whole world that makes it super likely to get shot over nothing
   (ID: a428ebec68dc8bb1dccfb778bb32844c5677e265)

20. me and my husband do anal fairly regularly and this happens every once in awhile . he always says  i know where i  m putting it , i know what can happen  and i think that  s the best response anyone can have . i try to make sure i  m cleaned out but sometimes uhh . shit happens . hope your dude figures that out . oh , and to answer your question , find a mature boyfriend
