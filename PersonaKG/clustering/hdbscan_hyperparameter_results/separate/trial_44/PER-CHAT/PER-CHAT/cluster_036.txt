1. it ' s been pretty good . i think i ' m about to head to bed soon though . how has yours been ?
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

2. i think it ' s a nice app . new vocab is presented in a way that is easy to learn and backed up by flashcards , pictures and matching . this is the same way i learnt greek . the interface of the app honestly feels cluttered and out of place imho . it ' s a bit laggy as well . i think it would be nice if the app could be designed around the materiel design or a similar flat design . overall , it ' s a good app and i look forward to using it .

3. no i honestly think it ' s a good idea ! how am i so off base on this ? yes power banks exist , yes solar chargers exist but if you dont have any other options in the moment this could be a super convenient thing to be able to go and buy . jesus by all the downvotes and sassy comments i ' m getting your think i ' m advocating the clubbing of baby seals or something

4. thank you for the reassuring words . you think abstinence is a good idea ? won ' t i orgasm too soon if i keep hard anyways ?

5. i ' m glad that they moved away from that . i think the floating words thing is used way too much in tv now . the first two examples that come to mind are sherlock and the good doctor .

6. very good point , didn ' t think about that aspect . but the fact that op started with " being in la " makes me think it ' s for social media purposes .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

7. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

8. the button may be sticking it could be something underneath that ' s causing it . if you think it could be this , check out some youtube videos on how to take it a part . i had a trigger that kept sticking and once i took it a part and cleaned it , it was as good as new .

9. i think they screwed up with the character daario naharis in game of thrones . maybe not the worst casting decision , as huisman does a good job . but they turned what was supposed to be a blue hair gold toothed barbarian into a pretty boy heart throb . come on hbo .
   (ID: faebbe18abd4d1c69e3bb9106178f797255444c5)

10. my first attempt with these two characters i  ll gladly link you to when i get to my computer , it  s not nearly as good as this one i think but i  m glad you appreciated it ! bob and ervin are pretty much gonna be regulars around here now !

11. i think my wife would help me , or laugh and smile . both are good
   (ID: 7c444bdb5e40b14c80aedd1bf794f5902bb7133e)

12. i think the amount of toxicity a person experiences can and will be different from someone else , so asking how toxic the game is won ' t give you a good answer .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

13. you look great . tbh , either way looks good , neither of the lengths are bad . i think the shorter looks better in these pics because it ' s easier to style .
   (ID: 5c7a23731c46d9c75722023d6108cb45a421fb75)

14. i can draw pretty good i ' m my hand , so if i draw other stuff do you think they ' ll pass it off as one of my weird drawings ?

15. fast . ai will be a good place to start . deeplearning . ai by andrew ng is also an option . both use a bit different approach . andrew ng starts from basics . fast . ai goes top to bottomi think .

16. let ' s think nope . nothing good has ever happened .
   (ID: 0def2b70456d7a000d0e2b3611ac80cd2990e21c)

17. i think it ' s a really useful device and it has two uses three if you count getting mew so it ' s a good buy imo
   (ID: 315ad21e3ce098f09bec23f9b7509d07540912c7)

18. i felt the same way in the past . but maybe the fact there is no objective point is a good think ! you can choose to do something or absolutely nothing .
