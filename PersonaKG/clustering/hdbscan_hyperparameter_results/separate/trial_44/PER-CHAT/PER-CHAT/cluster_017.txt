1. like how you assumed i have a side not religious at all i don ' t care about abortion , i ' m simply pointing out the double standard of " it ' s my body " until the kid is out and then it ' s " but you helped make this kid , so pay up " even if the father doesn ' t want to or can ' t .

2. no . what i  m saying is check it if you do have intercourse . it  d be even better to not have intercourse if you don  t want kids or cannot afford the expenses , that makes sense . if you cannot afford kids yet get pregnant , you knew the risks and took them , you should have no right to kill the baby .

3. if this as a issue for you , then tell your gm that you don ' t want to work at that store and explain your experiences if necessary .

4. it seems rather unlikely that a full  scale war will happen . no one knows for sure of course , but north korea ' s ultimate goal is state survival beyond anything else . the us will respond to any attack with the destruction of the regime , which is something they don ' t want to deal with . the concern is that if the us strikes thousands will die , and we will be left with a major refugee crisis .

5. no . if i wanted to have sex with others i wouldn ' t be a bitch about it . be direct . i ' m not feeling it , or i want something fun or different . or better yet if your not happy , leave . don ' t fuck with trust .
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

6. why are you assuming that it ' s fear that keeps guys from popping the question ? some guys just don ' t want what you have .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

7. when i realised when my religion sins you for believing in another religion . why should be faith be the one qualifies whether i go to hell or not . i can ' t rely just only faith . i want to believe and i need proof or facts because i don ' t want to go to hell for something all are unsure about
   (ID: 0b3478daa0c3ecb398dde7764084e605d476d0ad)

   (ID: dadc9911849239b0d3b98ea480d7a3be43208f42)

9. look , i want to sleep . i don ' t understand why you and the other human need to bounce on the bed or whatever it is you do to make it shake .
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

10. granted . but when you can have a conversation with something , you don ' t really want to eat it anymore , and now you can have a conversation with anything , so you starve to death
   (ID: c6cc92fb6dee5f65446e9383372864b9e25f1d60)

11. this is a combination of many different insults . i prepared it in case of emergency years ago . " this is usually where i ' d tell you to suck my dick , but i don ' t want the disease ridden void that you call a mouth anywhere near me . so could you do me a favor and go fuck yourself "
   (ID: d54a04c3eba52404f5dd7abb0e459a949dbc7f93)

12. as long as you don ' t mind the possibility of your code being terminated . it ' s virtually the same as doing what you want if you don ' t mind the possibility of death . if you can ' t tell it ' s a simulation is it any different ? you still don ' t have total control either way . and what if they place you in virtual hell afterwards ?
   (ID: 25ac51284c94eb6c58e189bbefc7f2bb9bb9e1b5)

13. if you want it , sure , i don ' t see why not .
   (ID: 080eedcfaabe8f67b2c0a8da33a3a401906822f2)

14. it was a franchise about killing greek gods . then we kind of slid in the viking world which made little to no sense . i don ' t want a white greek going around killing chinese god ' s too . that just doesn ' t fit . you can make his kid do it for all i care . but not kratos

   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

   (ID: a85910e837bd841373d8a7b2a84f1bff22807d9e)

   (ID: a5976f282a96c036f5e4d14957305323c9a5776d)

19. its why i hate the term " trans phobia " . if i don ' t want to fuck someone who is not a biological woman , so fucking what ?
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)
