1. if you  re four months into the relationship , i think they  d be happy to hear  i love you .  that  s just me and my partner , though . best way to do it is  hey , person  s name ? they respond  yeah  or  what  etc i love you .

2. so you think it ' s ok to just go around and steal memes that someone worked for hours on ?
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

3. actually i just realized op  s would still be wrong because the apostrophe shows ownership so i think it would just be ops . my bad

4. that ' s just statistics at work . if you have ever even glanced at the numbers to see how many planets are around how many stars around how many galaxies then the idea of any single phenomenon occurring once and only once becomes so unlikely it ' s borderline insane not to think there is life out there .

5. i just think  what do i have to lose
   (ID: 4e784da799782c45d8883de53e87a533129a3b8e)

6. your reply made me think about it more . in another example , i guess if someone wanted to change their clothes for free at a gilded wardrobe they would just go to another person ' s house party . it ' s lazy , but effective i guess . i think i ' ll just visit a poh and get someone to make flatpacks for me there .

7. thanks for telling me what i think . there just wouldn ' t be tangible proof . the end .
   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

8. every reply you make to one of my comments , you just keep getting more and more unintelligible . i think you should be less focused on this kid ' s schooling and more on your own .
   (ID: 3158d7c63f10e871a80f147fb47725c8714163c7)

9. i think this is so amusing just because it doesn  t require physical exertion . actually having to do it isn  t entertaining whatsoever .
   (ID: 5b59b30ecdf3a93e4634d1600b3020fd8e9dc7e2)

10. you really think someone would do that ?               just             go             on             the             internet             and             tell             lies ?

11. damn , i guess i ' d never thought about that side of things . do you think that the subreddits that took their place are poor imitations , or maybe that the old community forums just relocated ? disclaimer  i wasn ' t never involved in any community forums before reddit so it ' s a genuine question
   (ID: f114f40c03e5812464be61882b264a0abe2a545e)

12. no judgement here . i just posted my experience with an adverse med reaction and basically had the same line of thinking you ' re describing . it ' s unsettling has hell knowing your brain can actually think of things that you normally never would . best of luck moving forward !

13. i ' m actually still just on the side of liking it , but it ' s getting tougher . gaping plot holes , uninteresting storylines , painful characters , terrible dialogue , such poor consistency of any in  universe tech that i have to call most of the sci  fi elements one big continuity error . and that ' s not limited to the newer films . just started watching the original trilogy after tlj , and think i have to accept they ' re just sci  fi films for kids . i think they have some really great core concepts to work with , but then the actual stories that are told in the setting get ruined by the issues above .
   (ID: 1b160a23109a802786ef06d0b2abff0841f4eb37)

14. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

15. go , why the hell not ? just be smart and have a plan to gtfo if everything goes south midway through . i think you should tell someone you ' re going , a friend an adviser or someone you can count on if it goes to shit . you will regret not going .
   (ID: f4e4929bb0bef09e7eb72aaccf20c2d9454729c7)

16. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

17. just when you think it ' s gone you hear the eeeeeee .
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

18. it ' s both if you ask me . he clearly can ' t just forget it , but i think he also makes a choice not to .
   (ID: 9c2d2fde31927b8cc3bc419049de8844ca720cb9)

19. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .

20. oh hell yes . just the problem was that i was bad at swimming so i didn ' t really think about participating there not that i had a possibility tho
