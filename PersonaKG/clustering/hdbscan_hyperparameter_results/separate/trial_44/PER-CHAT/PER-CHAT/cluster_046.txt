2. i was once dog sitting at a neighbors house the dog is the nicest and most affectionate black lab ever and i made the mistake of sitting in a lawn chair next to the very edge of the porch . the big sweety climbed up into my chair , wanting pets , and before i could get off the chair i was falling . i actually did a back flip in the process and thankfully landed without injury . as i got up the dog was just sitting there , making sure i was okay .
