1. anti  intellectualism is great to see on what is meant to be a university community . big words , small words , what ' s the difference ? i ' m not posturing . i use the terms that i think best express my ideas . i didn ' t present a counter  argument because isanybodylisten didn ' t present any points that could be refuted in a meaningful way . it was very much , " i see you as being    " . i could say that i ' m not those things , but those are equally weak statements . in what class could you get away with making an assertion without justification ? none . if you ' re comfortable with drawing all of your conclusions about someone from the way they conduct themselves on reddit , maybe you ' re pretentious .

2. thank you . i think i needed someone to say that to break the feedback loop of doubt that i sometimes get stuck in .

3. i ' m pretty sure it ' s before , because in lore it says that doomfist was defeated by winston and put in prison . saying that the fight scene ends with doomfist and winston about to clash i think it ' s pretty safe to say it ' s before prison . i might be wrong though , because the doomfist mentioned in the original cinematic could be a different one .

4. i ' d say no . but i think a lot of it is personal bias or what one would prefer to watch .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

5. i can ' t say for sure , but i ' m conjuring up scenes in my head of jedi force  pushing multiple droids over at once ? i think that happened . no idea why there would be an issue focusing on multiple things , although as many as the number of grains of sand in a tornado might be too difficult .

6. as a girl , i ' d say all my " firsts " , i think i should have waited for the right guy

7. i think as comments flow , you ' ll realise this may not be so much of an unpopular opinion . nevertheless i must say you articulate yourself well . a  from this stranger .

8. i have lived in canada my whole life . never had to say a pledge of allegiance . as someone who has never done it , i don ' t think it ' s weird . the usa is a great country and typically they ' re very patriotic . you ' re swearing to the ideals of the country , not the leader itself  that would be messed .

9. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .

10. its the same as when you ' re in a really bad mood you think fuck everyone and everything sucks . when you ' re on m everything ' s bliss ans you love everything . of course nobody means everything they say , they are extremely conditioned under the influence or the drug

11. personally i would say that altair and edward would be the last ones standing . kenway , being a pirate would be prone to fighting dirty and altair was trained from the moment he could walk , if my memory serves pun totally fucking intended , would , and should absolutely kick ass . personally i think that altair takes the cake but it would be a pretty close call .

12. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

13. there ' s a whole wikipedia page on the controversies of using that word . shame because it ' s a great word and i think it deserves a resurgence , so i say use it .
   (ID: 0fbaeef283f7b2090f763028c227ed73724f3e6c)

14. i wouldn  t say your original post came off as humble . i didn  t think it was arrogant though . all i have to say is , if the women that you  re talking to desire you more when you  re being a jerk , they must have no self  esteem .
   (ID: 256407c5e6c8d9342d8aabf5c9c392fc179ba9f3)

15. i wouldn ' t say i have a big ass . it ' s not flat either , i think it ' s nice and i always check myself out in the mirror , but i would only say it ' s a little above average . i don ' t think ass size has anything to do with it though .

16. i think given the fact that she sat with him all day on the weekend , no . i would say there were circumstances beyond her control making it necessary for her to continue working .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

17. how do you say you ' re pretty well sized and in the next sentence say how it has been problematic for you but my lizard brain still manages to ignore that and think  " damn , having a huge dong sounds great . " it ' s so ingrained .
   (ID: d7b75c00237dc445cdc3ebc380fbcb79a40b1a5f)

18. bars are places to pick up , to make friends i would say go to another forum . perhaps church or some association . as a man i would think you either is looking to be hitted on or waiting for your friends if i see lonely womman browsing around .
   (ID: 3c4a38138d39bd51556bd7f8a05ba48bf283c7e6)

19. i was here to say sushi , now i have to think of something else . its definitely not going to be brussel sprouts . i still hate those
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

20. apparently it ' s a right to carry a gun in church , but gathering to say you think this is wrong is a privelage .
