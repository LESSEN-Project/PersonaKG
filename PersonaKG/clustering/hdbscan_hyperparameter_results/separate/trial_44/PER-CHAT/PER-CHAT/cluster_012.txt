6. have to be honest , if i saw you in passing i ' d assume you are a " queen " who has all her stuff together and plenty of suitors . i guess this is a reminder to me that i can ' t assume anything , even if someone looks perfect to me  i just never know how they are feeling inside . thank you for sharing !

7. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else
