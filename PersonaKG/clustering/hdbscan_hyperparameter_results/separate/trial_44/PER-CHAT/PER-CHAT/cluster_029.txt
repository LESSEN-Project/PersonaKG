Total from this dataset: 23

1. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .

2. no one is saying anything other than the footage was creepy . i don ' t understand what the deal is . are people not allowed to think it was creepy ?
   (ID: 88c35221745da41b29ff5b9f921026de5ccbb6c0)

3. i think a lot of people who are at that point don ' t think anybody cares to listen to them , and they have thought that for so long , that it is very hard to reach out to anybody

4. when you use contraception that is " terminating something living " , i . e . , millions of sperm . of course you don ' t think that those lives are important , and certainly not as important as your convenience . it ' s very easy to decide what sacrifices other people should make .
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

5. i think it changes for each person , which is why i don ' t think it makes sense when people talk about not " crossing the line " .
   (ID: a98df1d16d4e1204ace7856449444a3afbb80743)

6. oh my goddddddd ! i feeeel your pain ! i  m sorry your mum put you through that ! but isn  t it so annoying when you  re out with friends and while they can wear anything and not look provocative , you need to be careful so people don  t think things weary  face

7. i went to one and while i do agree that it can stunt social growth when it comes to interacting with women the only reason it affected me is because no one asked me to hang out with them on weekends . all my friends hung out with girls outside of school , there was an all girls school next door . most people here seem to think that social opportunities don ' t exist outside the school gates but as long as my kids do then i can ' t see any reason not to send them to one .

8. i think i  m a nice person , but i don  t let people take advantage of me nor the people i love . i become a lion if anyone hurts or is disrespectful to my loved ones
   (ID: d95d3548a9506e48c5310c85f3b2994820405e0d)

9. not if your education sucks and youre on internet to try and make others think a big penis does the job . lmao don ' t worry , most people saying this are arrogant or uneducated .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

10. " fair game ? why do you think you ' re entitled to other people ' s stuff ? it ' s not yours , don ' t touch it !
   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

11. lol . not on the topic of coltee ' s shirt , but larissa is extra annoying this episode with these cosmetic procedures . coltee ' s annoying me too . and jay and ashley . i don ' t think any of these people don ' t annoy me any more . maybe pedro .

12. i ' m not the guy begging for karma tho , besides , you don ' t have to be a jerk about it , also , i think not even half the people here give a fuck about your 10k karma
   (ID: 4b127841179d58078b4fbc1377158cb136f3156f)

13. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

14. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

15. i think people that use no true scotsman fallacy to distance themselves from " extremist muslims " will generally have no problem using it again with " stupid muslims " , so don ' t expect instant deconversions from people you intend to debate . still , it may help with people on the fence , go for it .
   (ID: fae28587bce17296589bf92d656ad68ee32601d6)

16. what the fuck ? i wonder if these kinds of people ever take a step back to question their insanity and then go ahead and do the crazy shit anyway . or if they do question themselves , what sort of stuff do they think is too crazy and don ' t follow through .
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

17. these people are the definition of selfish . they don ' t think anything about their grandchildren , because they don ' t give a shit about them . they care purely for themselves .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

18. i wouldn  t call him an asshole in the situation if i knew the guy and could talk to him personally . this is the sub amitheasshole ? not amithepersonwhodidntthinkitthrough . i don  t think proposing is an asshole thing to do . but it was insensitive , poorly thought out , irresponsible , and a laundry list of other things that point towards  yta  which is what people request on this thread .
   (ID: f18b19a52bbf1505af84d01563a51626d4ae363f)

19. after reading a lot of mmo forums and seeing a lot of crazy things yes , i do believe he was serious . if you think people don ' t have that viewpoint , you should put aside your own bias .
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

20. i disagree with this article . i think " thank you " and " i ' m sorry " are sometime necessary acknowledgements of the fact that someone else exists   a person who has their own thoughts and feelings and things to do . i don ' t expect my kid to feel some kind of heartfelt gratitude for me getting them a glass of milk but i do expect my actions to be acknowledged with a polite " thank you " . i ' m in favor of politeness as a social norm . by telling a kid that this is a situation requiring a polite action you help instill the fact that other people matter .
