1. depends on what your needs are . if you just want a hole to dump cum in , then yeah , a sex doll will work okay . if you want anything else , then probably not .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

2. im not a sjw or a feminist , but being transsexual just means you changed your sex , so yes it is very much real however biologically impossible . i do agree that all that pronouns shit . its ridiculous and pathetic really . the best argument against it really is that its a violation of freedom of speech , which just proves that they only want change when it benefits them .

3. does conspiracy track dropouts ? the app takes their reliability down , but that ' s it .  is it possible to report players for signing up and immediately resigning ? nope . you cannot do it anywhere that i am aware of actually . most places including conspiracy rely on a reliability system to make things civil . whether your system works is another story .  why bother signing up ? conspiracy ' s wonderful quality in being shiny , sleek and easy to use means there is an extra horde of curious onlookers who just want to install the app , hit play , and then . spend weeks rather than minutes playing a game . lots of folks can ' t understand that or care about reading the rules , so they just uninstall the app and disappear .

4. fuck all this relationship shit , i just want a switch tbh .
   (ID: 064b68f55fd83de76c3cbc4f130670e6435e42a4)

5. no , not just free stuff . you want to force the wealthy to work for free for you .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

6. forget about how you ' re supposed to act to be a man . just be you . for example , you ' re about to be of legal drinking age . you want a sherly temple at the bar while everyone else is doing shots and chugging beer ? fuck them . get your sherly temple and drink it with pride . trust me , it ' ll work out .

7. just looking at that makes me want to shit my pants
   (ID: 59c651a5c06af5a1be40c3866fad09e7ac4c78f2)

   (ID: 20fef7b83cf9ae51924e5491cac2f90901d833e0)

9. what you really want to do is find out what exactly is the source of your back pain . it could be a rib out of place , a rotated hip , twisted tailbone , bulging disc , etc . then you can start exercises to target those . if it ' s just generic sore muscles , then you would benefit from strength training to keep those muscles in shape .

10. i guess you ' re right . the only issue is that when i get along with a guy have a lot in common , instant click , share similar goals  values  etc there comes a point where he tells me just doesn ' t want a relationship . after a month or so he ' s dating someone this has happened three times now , hence why i believe i ' m the reason

11. well it  s not a mean nickname so she  s not making fun of you so possibly she likes you or someone dared her to call you that , maybe she  s just being playful  goofing around or sending obvious hints that she digs you , its hard to tell since i haven  t met her . she could also just want to be your friend

12. your labia is beautiful as it is . i ' m not a fan of the pussy jewelry , but it ' s also not my pussy , so you go girl  do what makes you feel sexy ! but from me to you , i just want those lips . no need to dress them up for me !
   (ID: f709eec52cd0c0cff5afc1f9f3e0caa4a2797782)

13. for the most part , you have the freedom to go or do whatever you want . whereas , in a relationship , you have not just yourself but your so to consider . as far as what ' s the worst thing in relationships ? that ' s more or so subjective . everyone will tell you something different .

14. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .

15. this post is too much for me . i can relate in this shit and want to post some original shit that i just created . these seals holds me back from taking over the world of memes .
   (ID: 6b8a83db666de3b1a44e69862b384efc9e8eaad7)

16. nsfw ! this post is definitely nsfw , just want to give everyone a heads up ! i just have to write a bunch of cramp so that the automate raptor doesn ' t just kill my comment because all i wrote was " nsfw . so , again  risky click at work , folks .
   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

17. so you pointing out that it ' s about race and gender implying that you want it to be true just because she is a woman and an african please provide a valid counter argument or fuck off with your faminazi sentimentality .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

18. what ' s the code then if i really just want an extra pillow .
   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

19. if it was easy op wouldn ' t ask for a quality of life change qol suggestions aren ' t limited to being difficult , in fact most of them i see are purely because the current version is annoying . stop trying to argue against qol suggestion with skill cap complaints , literally everything in the game can be considered part of the skill cap . e . g . why show a number for gold when you can just see if there ' s a gold rim around the item you want , why show health  mana numbers when you can just look at the bar , why show health  mana at all when you can just calculate how much health your hero has at each level with each item then calculate mathematically the damage after reductions of each enemy spells as they happen . my point is that skill complaints are nonconstructive criticism and just plainly bad arguments .

20. just kiddin ' . you can get a hefty variety around here for sure , and chile versions of basically anything you want i love it when family visit from out of town  i show off that you can get the stuff at freakin ' mcdonald ' s and pizza joints .
