1. conspiracy theories . it ' s not as much a new trend , as one that has been blown up by every lunatic with a stray thought having ready access to millions of other lunatics . it ' s been my experience that two people can ' t keep a secret about where they ' re going that evening , much less god knows how many people keeping a secret like a fake moon landing , or wtc , or sandy hook , or all the other idiocies that abound .

18. seems like he has a lot of baggage going on . he ' s sexuality interested in other people and is likely cheating , or going to cheat outside of the rules . if you have rules like you do , you shouldn ' t be together . it ' s gonna get ugly if you stay .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)
