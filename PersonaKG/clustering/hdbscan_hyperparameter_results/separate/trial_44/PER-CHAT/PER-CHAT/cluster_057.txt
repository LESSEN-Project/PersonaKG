1. my friend got back together with her toxic ex this weekend . it was good for me because he has someone else to talk to than just me .

2. that just leaves the rule of thirds , it may also help to do a quick google for photography rules and  or tips . honestly , i was just trying to find a suggestion for you because you asked , the picture looks good

3. they were trying to get rid of child porn on their site , but doing a blind generic sweep of just nsfw content with a weak bot didn  t do them any good . porn bits are still around , countless nsfw blogs , and i  m sure there are still pedos lurking on that site . i heard if they had been deleted off tumblr that they migrated to twitter

4. good luck . if you get a craving , just do something different . for instance , if i get one in the car , i ' ll change the channel and listen to something else that distracts me . on chantix , the cravings pass pretty quickly , if you have any at all .

6. that ' s good you seem to be pretty open and receptive to your players and it never hurts to throw a challenge at them they can ' t overcome just to show them they are mortal . good luck !

7. wicked is definitely not bad is just that i hate gold , if they could at least have changed the sigil to another colour , i would definitely buy it . but so far i will just wait for a good leblanc skin to come .

8. good god , that sounds horrible , my respect for adcs just grew even more .
   (ID: 41b9459dbd87b475322566af693bf5fe2a47086d)

9. not an answer but atlas is not that good maybe just the puch , just team up and go farm him . i ' d suggest look in recruit for casuals every now and then to get it eventually . so you

10. my first crush , one of my favourite movies . just read the book he wrote about the making of the princess bride . it ' s really good too .  sigh crush still going strong
   (ID: 5d5b1d6dc4106ea3828986093f78b562f2a75587)

11. thanks ! and yes i was talking about the night vision . since now i  m assuming the night vision won  t give any real details in the character all you need to do is just a fix up and you are good to go . but i  m just a casual gamer who is giving a really , uninformed opinion . again good luck to you !

12. i should of known that the prices for these pokemon ones were too good to be true . they are quite hard to get hold of here in the uk , so fraudsters have filled the gap in the market by flogging these fake ones . ebay will be on your side to and help you and get you a refund if you receive a fake , it is just a lot of hassle that is probably best avoided !

13. sorry my dude the situation here is just not what it was . at first i thought i was gonna get to break the geneva convention for christmas but the state is doing a good job to calm everyone down sadly enough
   (ID: 569832646eef001c1724d2ecdb8abedbbfd927ab)

14. you can ' t just ignore the good that ' s happening .
   (ID: ce7a661d87e9157748595ef19b5ea913ea96198f)

15. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .

16. quick question instead of posting a new thread  for you toy collectors , is there a particular set  line of sw toys that is sought after or preferred ? or do you guys just collect figures that looks good
   (ID: b4fb8e20516a28baa38075931e9715db2375a956)

17. i wish you could meet my cat , buuuut . learn more about them and what their body language means . understanding them helps a lot . and just keep an open mind over all , good luck !

18. if you send me pc vods i can still analyze them and give you coaching tips or just discuss strategy via discord , but i cant join games on pc . good luck finding a coach though !

19. just change your definition of ' instant ' and you are good to go !
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

20. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .
