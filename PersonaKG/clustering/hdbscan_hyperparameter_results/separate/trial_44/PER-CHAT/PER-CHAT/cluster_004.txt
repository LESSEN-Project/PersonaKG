10. our desire for things in this world cannot exceed our desire for god . it is a christian belief that who we are and the good we do stay with us in to the next life . you are still you and thus the good things that you liked in life are still part of you . if the creating of beauty through music , art , etc . is a good thing it will exist still in heaven . how we will enjoy it then , i do not know . the book of job is problematic on many levels . first of all it is a marriage of a folktale the prose beginning and ending with the work of a first rate hebrew poet who inspired by the folktale creates the bulk of the middle . the essence of the folktale is that god tests our faith . the essence of the poetry that suffering that we endure has a purpose even if we cannot understand or know what that purpose is . very small children may believe the rules and restrictions placed up them by their parents cause unnecessary pain and suffering , but parents often know it is for their good .

13. first of all bitch i  m willing to kill millions if that deserve it if he was a nazi he would take away guns so he couldn  t be overthrown we elected him not because he was good but because everyone else was absolutely terrible we know he won  t make us rich because that  s not what he said he was going to do

14. my art . i know that i am a good artist but i cannot physically boast about my art . i feel awkward doing it and it feels even worse when my parents used to boast for me . they would always add in " you can do better than    "
   (ID: d2e08e506c32ac85c9dc9c537b36b64fbe497359)

18. tell him and see his reaction . if he is such a great man that wants to be with you , he should have no problem sticking up for you and making sure his family understands that that behavior will cease . if he reacts in their defense and does nothing , you know it  s not worth pursuing . mommas boys are a serious no  no for me , good luck .

20. i will feel a great wave of sadness over the level of stupidity in this country . then i will go about my day as normal unless something directely affects me or someone i know . the only good thing will be the great material that all the comics will come up with while he is in office .
