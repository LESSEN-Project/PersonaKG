1. in disneyland a random person asked me , what time is the digit  digit parade . i am a teenager . i clearly don ' t work at disneyland . and common sense is if you ask someone what time an event is and you say the name as the time , they are stupid

2. One of my favorite things is character growth in comedy series.

3. don  t do it man , there  s better things to life that you just haven  t discovered yet . on a side note , imagine how confused and upset your dog would be if one day you didn  t come home , or you went into the bathroom and they never seen you again .

4. be there for your friend , love him , and stay strong with him . as conversation continues , youll find out the severity of the incident , but if you ask him something and he seems confused or doesnt remember , dont fight it or ask any further . see if he knows your name and go from there . the last thing you want to do is frustrate him with things he cant yet remember . i say " can ' t yet " because you are going to remain positive and with that positivity , over the course of time , his memory may slowly come back . god works his magic in ways that could move mountains my friend . ill keep you in my thoughts through this time .

5. i would definitely say for you to go for it , however i would try something other than minecraft at first . minecrafts popularity on yt has gone way down and it would be better off to start with something else that is a bit more popular . like beamng or something . but it is your call on what you want to start out with .

6. they aren  t all bffs . not sure why you got that impression , but it isn  t accurate . characters from different houses don  t know each other unless you recruit them and even characters in the same house sometimes don  t like each other . most of the fighting occurs between your chosen house and brigands  thieves  plot relevant bad guys , not other houses . you do fight the other houses , but going into more detail would be a spoiler , so i won  t . however , i will say that it doesn  t feel like a cliche high school anime . the most cliche part about the game is the mary sue protagonist imo , but i  ve seen differing opinions . it  s a good game .

7. thanks for the clarification . so you ' re not too worried about the two friendly results this week ? how do you feel about your digit world cup group ?

9. what part of the game is this or is this an edit ?

10. possibly it  s that then , i didn  t think i had particularly strong features , just a  standard  face if such a thing exists . quite possibly my personality has something to do with it as i  ve always been mature for my age .

11. i would recommend advice for this , but i ' ll try to help as well anyway i think you ' re just friends by convenience . you ' re on the same team , you live near each other and give each other lifts , but beyond that , he has better friends and you don ' t . i ' ve been in that situation , there ' s not much you can do except to to find other , better friends , and accept that that ' s where your relationship is at . if you ' re scared to do things around him , find other friends and don ' t value his opinion of you so highly , that way if he does judge you , who cares ? as a rule , if a friend makes you feel uncomfortable in some way when you ' re around them , get out , find a better person to spend your time with   x200b    x200b

12. because being a parent somehow makes you an all  knowing pseudo  god .

13. it ' s definitely him . he ' s an alcoholic . looks like he ' s struggling with trying to control it , but he should probably not drink at all anymore . probably a hard thing for you to do , but you should tell him to get help or you ' re going to leave . it ' s only going to get worse if he continues to drink

14. i ' m not sure i see how this is gatekeeping .

15. will you be my gbf ? no bitch i wont . if you only value me because you somehow think my sexuality will get you some perks then i don ' t want to even associate with you , let alone be your bestie .
   (ID: bfbfd4c4caa6b137f79275a24c99808ba3d2305b)

16. what ? edit  ah i get it , let me fix that for you . " it ' s new . things change . you ' re not the first , or the last , one to do anything pretty much ever "

17. we can ' t all make top quality memes , from studios like bethesda who stuff up massive franchises from fallout digit , to the ranza plaza killing digit  people killing people due to architectural problems . we strive to improve , and get better . that time will happen where i will improve on memes . but i will have downfalls , but i will prevail . you can hate , you can discriminate but karma will get you . rather it be reddit karma , or real life karma . just be aware of the situation that surrounds us .

18. i got one for you , too  what about a god who created everything which includes sin , if he created everything , who had his own son killed to get forgiveness . he could  ve just forgiven us , because it  s him that is the forgiver . if you argued he didn  t create sin , he could actually do an innumerable list of things that would help more than killing your own kid .

19. when i ask my mum a question with two different options and she says yes . me  mum , so do i add the water or milk ? mum  yes my mind  excuse me what

20. congrats on your progress . i should do more sports myself , but i absolutely dislike jogging , i imagine people staring at me and judging me , how did you get yourself to actually do it ? also why do you dislike jewish velociraptors ?
