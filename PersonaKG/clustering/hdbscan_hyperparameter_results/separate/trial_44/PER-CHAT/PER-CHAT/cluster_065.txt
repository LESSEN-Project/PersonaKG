7. is the stoning for adultery pertaining to both genders ? because every time that i do read or hear about it , it ' s always the punishment for women . what if the man commits adultery ? not trying to toss gender  equality into an already cans  of  worm belief . just genuinely curious .

10. thanks . this actually makes sense to me . we actually leave ours out all the time and it just confused me why if we never wrap the chord up it gets messy
   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

11. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .
   (ID: 7c96bac704435347f721cc9a3056b8d7be16cc06)

12. my gf and i tend to devolve common phrases and words over time to more just nonsense noises . we can have almost whole conversations with bizarre words and noises . we often ponder that to anyone on the outside it might seem we were both handicapped in some way
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

13. the left is never happy and is relentless . this is exactly why if we let them take away ar15s they ' ll just come after shotguns  handguns next .
   (ID: 0d5c70b45072ef9ffc8fb257e4775e8302391e3c)

14. my summoner in this situation  can i get you something ? ice cream ? a blanket ? some alone time ? i  m here for you and all the other heroes so if you need something just ask ! tl  dr he just tries to be a nice and helpful person
   (ID: 6f88a57b804dffb05f07ee78e02223947d9055aa)

15. i believe it gives you a little bit more time as you still have enough time to walk under them before your timer is up and you can log out , and they would have to pathfind to you which takes longer than someone standing beside you . although i guess you could just barrage them and run while logging , i dunno .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

16. i ' m not sure how much it has to do with the time and how much it has to do with who your parents are . kids around me were doing plenty , i just had an overly controlling parental situation .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

17. this boy is not worth your time . just dump him now and move on to someone that ' s not going to shame you repeatedly .
   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

19. they are not quite playmates since they are pretty much ignoring each other . i am just happy i can have them in the same room and can spend more time with each of them . condescending karens are everywhere lol
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

20. it will be ok and just imagine the relief when it ' s all over and in the past ! your doctor will not scold you for holding off on appointments , she will be happy you came in ! even if you have the worst case scenario , you will be in the right place , plus most cervical cancers are treatable when caught in time .
