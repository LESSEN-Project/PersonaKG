1. i think bethesda will react quicker as soon as they realize is atomic shop items being duped , and they losing revenue . as of now i don  t think they give a damn . never said anything bad about game or studio before . until today . i  ll upvote this  cause i agree to the degree .

2. i honestly don ' t think he needs any rework , if you are looking for a counter , hold still during the duration of his drone . it ' s that simple . if you get rushed and have to move then that was probably the point of the activation of the done .

3. i think london would be too urbanised if that makes sense ? american cities , at least the massive ones work on a grid structure , making them a bit easier . london is , comparatively , a fucking mess , not to mention huge . so unless they dropped a nuke incredibly close , it would be a nightmare to build a game world . maybe with the power of future consoles but i don ' t think it would be that feasible

5. yeah . i see why some women don ' t but i think it ' s an important thing to at least attempt . lets print of cards and be weird together !

6. i don ' t think that ' s true at all .

7. thank you ! i didn ' t even think of vintage . even if i don ' t buy one , it would be a great way to learn about some of them . the vintage omega constellations are unbelievably beautiful imo .

8. i think i saw a video on youtube with a theory that seemed pretty convincing . don  t remember its name though .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

9. i don ' t think that you have never seen a razor in your life , and certainly not any light source that wasn ' t your computer screen

10. i don  t think you can find yourself that way . it takes deep thought .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

11. why do you think i automatically support it because i don ' t smoke it ?

12. i used meditation about a year ago to help cope with stress and my night terrors , i stopped over the summer , and now that classes have started up again , my night terrors have come with them . i don ' t think meditation is bullshit , but i can understand why you would .

13. speaking spanish in public so no one knows what i ' m saying is so fun . i do this in the mostly white neighborhoods i go to . i don ' t think everyone likes it tho lol

14. the lyrics are literally " this one ' s a contradiction because of how happy it sounds , but the lyrics are so down " i don ' t think it counts , it ' s too obvious . some other twenty one pilots songs would probably fit better .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

15. i don ' t think it ' s possible . i have always heard of plasma as ionized gas . maybe it ' s possible , but i don ' t think so .
   (ID: 2c5816cbbee60e3c348eb04900ea7453604cff82)

16. unfortunately this sort of thing is already happening . i think that ' s why lots of american cops are pretty jumpy and don ' t hesitate when using a gun .
   (ID: a90f01f580b7cc08038958d5c1f659fd492b1f2c)

17. it ' s so common that i don ' t think they ' d ever make a law about " spreading it . "

18. then i guess it ' s not gonna happen at all which is okay too . don ' t ruin your work environment . those are some bridges that shouldn ' t be burned . you can control your emotions . only you chose what you think and feel for a person .
   (ID: f042043ff04e1f2bd28d7c34b7937eb8bf31c76e)

19. jumping in front of trains , doing double  backflips off of buildings , and other not  so  fun demises . the stuff i keep to myself is way worse , and i don ' t think the medication is working  but they tell me it does .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

20. " don ' t be afraid to be truly bored or alone with your thoughts . " i can ' t remember the situation , but the general idea was to not be afraid of having nothing to do . your mind can create some interesting ideas , given the opportunity . boredom can be a gateway to discovering yourself or a new creative outlet you can use to express yourself . the counter to that tends to be that your mind can also create some rather worrying ideas too , but i don ' t think that was really the goal of the idea .
