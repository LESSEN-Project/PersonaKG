1. i guess i just don ' t see where this is going ? i don ' t think a single person has agreed with you . maybe you should try it and post your results .
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

2. the game is too big to die . with all those mods , you can even play just terraria for your entire life . maybe the hype might die and player base will be lower but i don  t think it will die .

3. i don ' t think others are wrong , per se , mine just works for me . the whole " faith " thing .

4. losing partial  full control of myself is a scary concept that i don  t think is just limited to me . you do you tho

5. for me a coincidence is the just that . a coincidence . i personally don ' t think they mean anything although they can be kinda neat .

6. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?

7. there is the other side to this . which is there used to be no other problems but the db is such a big problem that they don ' t think about the rest of it . when your so says , i love you i am sure your automatic response is , i love you too . but do you , have you actually thought about it or are you just saying it out of habit .

8. not sure if you ' re being sarcastic or not , but it was just a question . i searched around and couldn ' t find much except what has already been mentioned . i figured i would ask the reddit community for their input . also i play on console , i don ' t think there are too many hacks out there to increase my magicka , but thank you for your suggestion .

9. don ' t think that ' s the case . this mentions nothing about an injury here , just the marine ' s takedown and then how he was restrained . the robber was put in handcuffs , with no mention of needing medical attention .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

10. i just think these videos don ' t need a story line , i don ' t care about the eggs or anything else apart from the bit we all came to see .
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

11. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

12. homosexuals are still able to pass along their genes , just not in the ' traditional ' sense . i think it was , but i don ' t think it is any more .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

13. i understand . i  m just not much of a lebron fan , so it  s hard for me . also don  t think he  s even close to the goat . best of this era ? sure .
   (ID: f90b0d899acf3c82adaa55fb250d0c7ea9eaeaf3)

14. so just because you disagree with it , you think it should be okay to censor it ? don ' t you see how slippery of a slope this is ?
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)

15. not a jab at you op . i just don  t think it  s a fat shaming movie . more anti  costco  amazon  lazy  consumerism  idiocracy
   (ID: dd0e84182036131d3b7cbc9bcb07384502b3c1a8)

16. how are you expected to play knowing that you got traded ? i don  t think it has to do with deliberately underperforming and more to do with just being generally out of it .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

17. you don ' t . you just think you do .
