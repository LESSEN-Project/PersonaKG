1. no it ' s better for pc players not for the entire market . stop crying where was all the crying with all the ps4 exclusives ? only seems like this games gets cried over don ' t pretend to be some beacon for the industry when you ' re just a child throwing a tantrum .

2. thats extremely true . it doesn ' t mean you don ' t like the girl . even the most thunderingly beautiful , intelligent and witty girl ' s names are still just tiny pieces of information bobbing on the oily swirl that is the short  term memory of a preoccupied inebriate .

3. being able to just disappear without any reason needed . nowadays , if you don ' t reply to someone ' s text  like their picture on instagram  acknowledge their every fart immediately it ' s a problem .

4. lol her coming to take him away from the horror and casually asking him if he wants to talk about it even their first sex is unnatural , although at this point it is just becoming boring . i agree the development of their relationship is necessary for the show , but don ' t like the way it is done

5. he will find his own way . my sister still has a relationship with them but i am nc with my parents . it  s weird sometimes . but that  s what works for her and this is what works for me , and that  s ok . just give him hugs , and be there for him , because we have to choose our family very carefully  we were given such crappy ones ! sounds like you both are on the same page . and don  t ever give your ssn to anyone who asks . god , so many horror stories of nparents stealing their children  s identities and ruining their lives ! aack ! protect yourself !

   (ID: 7a36b5607ec030b33a99723097f6d67b04c38d99)

11. i can see why you  re getting downvoted but honestly , i had a similar fear . i just thought  oh shit , please don  t let this sub become one of those thinly veiled hate subreddits .  maybe reddit and the internet have made me too sensitive to this stuff but this is the first piece on this subreddit that i can  t enjoy and i don  t feel like it has a place here .
   (ID: d7b75c00237dc445cdc3ebc380fbcb79a40b1a5f)

14. whatever camera you have right now , even if it ' s just on your phone ! see if you enjoy doing it , and if you do decide to upgrade , just ask yourself " what don ' t i like about my photos " and research what gear will allow you to counter those flaws in your work .

16. ego is a structure that is erected by a neurotic individual who is a member of a neurotic culture against the facts of the matter . and culture , which we put on like an overcoat , is the collectivized consensus about what sort of neurotic behaviors are acceptable .   terence mckenna fucks laws , just don  t hurt others and do as you please
