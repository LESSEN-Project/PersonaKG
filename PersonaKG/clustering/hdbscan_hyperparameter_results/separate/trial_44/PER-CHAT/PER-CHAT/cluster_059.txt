1. you do need to take steps to improve your life , but a big part of cbt is just thinking positively . recognizing the way you ' re thinking now is irrational , that your problems aren ' t insurmountable , and that you have reason to be hopeful for the future . it ' s annoying that people expect you to be better instantly , but thinking positively is the cure .

2. sex trafficker because most king pins have standards a lot of people have mom ' s that they ' d die for , but a sex trafficker is one cold motherfucker . just the fact that he  she could be manipulating you and you not knowing is unsettling .

3. i ' m just a normal person who waits for this article to be in front page so i can see some weird christian fetishes that people have

5. when people touch your stuff . it happens too often that people just pick up my backpack and throw it on my lab instead of asking to free the seat next to me . and for some reason its always women who do that , guys always ask

6. your argument is therefore  " there is one candy in the shop . i have a penny . some guy comes along , and tells the shopkeeper he ' ll pay a dollar for that candy . shopkeeper sells it for a dollar . " so , i can complain about why should i not get candy just because some rich people decided it ' s worth a dollar ? that ' s called socialism . the real question then is , if the city is getting richer and more propserous , why are these poor people still poor ? something wrong with wealth distribution here .

7. retro mattes are beautiful on other people , just not me . it ' s sad , but not a life ruined .

8. it probably is fake . there  s thousands of people on this app . he  s claiming something that is pretty extraordinary . if e can  t provide even a piece of evidence or a hint then i won  t give him the benefit of the doubt . that  s just me though

9. obviously , this argument doesn ' t hold and it  s simply a case of people being irked that non  whites are finally being represented in a larger way . i surely hope you aren ' t assuming that just because somebody is unhappy with one specific historically  incorrect aspect that they do not care about the others . just because somebody isn ' t actively advocating against every historical inaccuracy at any given point doesn ' t mean they ' re using it as a front to deny non  white involvement  most people do acknowledge the participation of smaller groups in the war , but simply find the representation to be statistically inaccurate . i would ask these individuals what they consider of other historical inaccuracies in the game before framing them with what is implied to be a racist undertone .

10. i ' m just a little sleep deprived . you ' re right speeding is a crime . i never cross the speeding limit but i ' m saying there ' s a lot of silly reasons cops pull people over for and the first instinct and innocent civilian would get it is to flee after seeing those i timidating lights . that ' s my point of argument .

11. my problem with quidditch is that as a sport it makes no sense , because catching the snitch is worth too many points . nothing the other players do is likely to matter . as a plot device in a book so that the main character can be special , it works fine , as an actual sport , it ' s retarded . it would probably be fun to watch the first couple times just for the novelty factor of a sport people play while flying , but after that i ' m guessing it would get old .

12. nothing is being stirred up for the sake of trolling . some people just do not agree with ye .

13. hell yeah ! preach ! just one correction tho  transgenderism isn ' t the right word . it ' s just " being transgender " . the term has a lot of baggage from people using it as a slur so for the most part we avoid using it unless joking about people being dick .

14. yeah , true . there are so many worse companies . just the first thing i thought of . it ' s great for talking to my friends and family all over the world as well as promoting myself , but i hate to see how people are addicted to it and over use it as well as whatever privacy stuff they violate .

15. lmao what the heck dont let people tell u what to do this is reddit , this place is filled to the brim of people who just wanna start dhit because theyve been bullied their whole lives .
   (ID: afdf67bb8f008481f179013844deeffa5b1b9a03)

16. i might just be more used to being around people of my own , not that i specifically dislike another
   (ID: dc000fb877b86a0bbd3d65fe6040b512b4f5b042)

17. yeah , if you ' re curious you can find out more about the person via messaging or whatever means you decide to use . but you shouldn ' t just meet with random people just because they told you to .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

18. weirdly , giving compliments to the people around you even if it  s just in your head sometimes . it makes you realize that pretty much everyone is beautiful in some way and that you are a part of everyone .
   (ID: a815d9b5c98aef3203b8f4f74528072fb989f0b1)

19. i read it already . if people ' s dogs are getting out to do that , it is not the fault of the dog . it is the fault of the owner for failing to look after the dog properly . for that reason , why should i have to put my dog through such an unnecessary procedure ? it is selfish and irresponsible to put an animal through that just because it makes you more comfortable .

20. if you are not bi , then your choice decreases bh half . and then if you are not a pedo and not into old people , that will also limit your choices . then i guess , it ' s not really your mistake , there are just not enough people .
