   (ID: e059f82a0624202d909920e56dd76f76efa711d2)

4. i think they did a reality show about that . a homeless man was given a lot of money . can ' t remember how much , but apparently he didn ' t really use it well . but we should try again and again .

6. must be all the beauty products she made him bring home last season . i kid , she looks great . i did kind of think it was funny when she called chantel ' s family image conscious or materialistic or whatever , considering the whole tv , laptop , entire suitcase full of beauty products , etc she demanded pedro bring to her . look , no one hates the family chantel more than i do , but you aren ' t perfect , lady !

7. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .

9. it may be a little unclear now that i think about it , but if you look at the timecodes , i also won the first lost run i did ever .

11. well you seem to be correct about the cities there and i realize i failed to account for population growth earlier however the industrial revolution happened and that likely led to a large decline however the brits did do a lot of harm however india might have not developed as quickly . oh and btw the british raj was not a collony untill the 1850s so yeah that kinda changes the argument by a lot . now i have to make it clear tho i don ' t think what the brits did was moral meerely that it may have had possitive consequences .

12. i was trolling some goth chick and she started yelling at me her boyfriend a friend of mine had to hold her back but thats not the scary the scary part is every once and a while she would legit try to scope me out whenever she did find me she would tell me to leave her friend alone long story but yeah i would always think she would falcon punch my ass

13. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

14. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

15. in the long run , constant complaining may cost you more than you think . heyooooo . see what i did there ?

16. you  re right . the mother was upset that she was feeding it to her kid everyday , and the kid was gaining weight and was in poor health . you fed your kid chocolate everyday . what the hell did you think would happen
   (ID: 70b19763b4597d93e9d9e1e7dca07379fdb19dfa)

18. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

19. lol me and my friends did something similar when a group of us were watching nightmare on elm street . i think it was the third one .
