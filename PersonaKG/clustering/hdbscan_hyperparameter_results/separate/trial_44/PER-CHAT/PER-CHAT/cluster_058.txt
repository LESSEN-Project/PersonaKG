4. i kinda like the idea of being a guy ' s first because they ' ll remember me forever . but sex with someone who ' s inexperienced can be a bit awkward . it ' s a turn on when a guy knows what he ' s doing . you ' re still young though , and you still have plenty of time to learn . i ' m sure lots of girls are fine with virgins .

6. hmm , try it like this  " i ' m not racist , but why can  t black students shut the fuck up and learn like everybody else ? " it help ' s identifying you as you are early in the sentenceand doesn ' t waste someone ' s time reading racist bullshit

7. o shoot that sounds like an absolute blast . you can always make weird faces at kids , then pretend you weren ' t even looking that direction to pass the time ?
   (ID: 5f43a3019d69696064ac659bf6dd25b51f1e5bb6)

8. i wonder if it is that when we are waiting for something we measure time against itself . in other words , when one checks the time it is like a reset  like the time before doesn ' t matter . the increments get smaller , yet feel longer . on the other hand big one , little one , take your pick when we are engaged or entertained we are not paying attention to the passage of time .

17. for me , when i  m having issues i try and distract myself . i like to listen to music a lot , so i  ll listen to music and sing along with it and that calms down most of the time . when i can  t listen to music , i start reciting songs in my head and that works too .
