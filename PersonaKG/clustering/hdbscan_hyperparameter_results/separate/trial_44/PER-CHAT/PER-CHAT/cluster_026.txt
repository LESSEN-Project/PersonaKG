16. info depends on how your relationship with your friend is like if this happend with me and my friends , i wouldn ' t feel guilt . it ' d be hilarious because that ' s the kind of relationship me have . we fuck with each other . it ' s playful but if you ' re having doubts , you probably don ' t have that kind of relationship with her and might be the asshole

17. it takes me a few minutes to really focus on my text book , so it helps when i ' m in a quiet place , maybe with a candle or something that calms me down . for some reason studying scares me  like i won ' t be able to comprehend the material , or i ' m reading the wrong things , so anything that helps me relax i try . for that reason i don ' t like studying in a public place . music helps too but sometimes i get distracted by the words .
