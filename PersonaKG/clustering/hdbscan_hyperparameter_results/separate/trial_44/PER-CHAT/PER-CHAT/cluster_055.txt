10. don ' t build circles , bridge them . from a career and personal standpoint , linking several social groups gives you more influence and resources , rather than hand picking and attempting to manipulate people . basically be the friend , be fair , and do your job as best you can and people will help you because they respect you . it ' s not right away or even in equal effort but they will help you when you need it . it beats cutting people down , dividing groups , and possibly being ousted from a group .

15. i definitely agree with you , and this book isn  t all  no one goes to hell if you believe in mercy  type stuff , it  s the direct word of jesus and there is stuff in there saying if you don  t do what  s right you will go to hell . but i understand your point , and agree that we also need people to realise that if we don  t act on the graces god gives us ourselves , we will go to hell .
