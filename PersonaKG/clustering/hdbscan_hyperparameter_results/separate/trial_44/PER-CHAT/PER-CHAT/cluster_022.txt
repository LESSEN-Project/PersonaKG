Total from this dataset: 60

1. if they already know everything about you how could it hurt ? i thought they were the feds who else has this power ? the first step to getting help is proving the problem exists . you ' ll notice that black people are starting to get help with police violence now that they ' re able to film the police . do you have everything to gain and nothing to lose but your delusions .

2. depends on how random the words are that i ' ll forget . if they ' re ones i can learn again , i ' ll take it . if they ' re names and identities of people i know , no . also i ' m cracking up thinking of a scenario where a person tries to use this in an interview to one up the interviewer .

5. lol . who ' s trying to save face . my original post was not meant to be taken seriously . other people understood that , or were less inclined to jump into a discussion with the " i know something about something obvious to anyone with a high school education   so let me ' correct ' you " vibe we all love so much around here . you also clearly didn ' t read the thread .

6. you know you doin wrong reddit ? " something you know yowe  people are doing wrong " in a german grammar nazi voice

7. i know i ' ll be down voted for this , but what is the un even going to do about this ? jump up and down , waving their fist ? my mother came to australia as an invited immigrant . she and her family didn ' t get even half the things handed to these refugees . hell , she had to eat black potatoes . her family had to find their own feet , no support apart from the christian mission people . where were the hand wringers then ? why didn ' t they get human rights lawyers wringing their hands over every stubbed toe and missing xbox ? my point here is a matter of perspective . yes , the refugees are detained . yes , conditions aren ' t the best . but you also have to be aware of the spin applied by the human vultures known as human rights lawyers  activists . it could be a hell of a lot worse . a lot of these people go right past other countries that could take them in . has anyone ever questioned why they choose to beeline for australia ? might it be because they know they can tug heart strings and create controversy ? either way . my two cents . let the bawwing begin .

8. once people on reddit can tell that you are a shill you know you hit rock bottom .
   (ID: 53aa6c267ff5eccf891e178786d41ca5df80a5de)

9. oh i do . i let people know right away that they are dumb for asking a question when we both know they already know the answer . why would you want to force a conversation with someone ? do you enjoy bothering people ?
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

10. if it  s a photo with their spouse or children then that  s perfectly normal . but i do have friends  know of people whose lock screen is a photo of their selfie or body pic . all these people i know are extremely arrogant and quite narcissistic . most of them have cheated on their spouses . your call op .
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

11. we won ' t know till we try . sending people into space in glorified soda cans is probably not the smartest idea we have ever had but it gets the job done .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

12. true but are people really going to frequently check for the miniscule chance of someone you know being there ?
   (ID: 9d412b0236e1db384766edb9df245de053d643ad)

13. 1m ? you know , there are rats with that much bounty in about every belt . you ' ll have to put a few zeros on it , to get people interested .
   (ID: 699195a280fce86200065786c40a00e3096406da)

14. dishes is the most straightforward one , few people talk to youunless you need to wash something , zero experience needed , and if you dont know how to wash dishes .
   (ID: e9829c29404a911421b2b39c7ea7309cbcf3329e)

15. i only know what happens to me when people tell me what happens because i black out .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

16. true , i know some people that had troubles with it so i thought might as well see if anyone on here needs it .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

17. i find no distinction in gender here . if they were raised crap , they will be annoying little shits . if they were raised well , they will be fine people to know .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

18. the last of the mohicans . an interesting thing about scores is , i know so many people who dislike classical music yet they watch a movie little realizing there is an orchestra in the background adding to the moment .
   (ID: 0f3da013abe745c83b2d4eb042abb7fd28f5e872)

19. i ' m gonna be serious for a minute though , i lean towards against high driving . i know a few seasoned tokers who can handle it , but most people can ' t really drive high very well . there are exceptions though , and i would include myself in that . it ' s important to note though , that knowing your limits plays a part .
   (ID: 5c9dd67e95ee5403b2bd9a6848c017674d46396b)

20. all of those statements are wildly different from taking children to a circus . i ' m not condoning what happens to animals at circuses , but a kitten slaughterhouse is not something that was organized and operated for the entertainment of the common people . i know that you probably feel strongly about this , but you ' re being ridiculous .
