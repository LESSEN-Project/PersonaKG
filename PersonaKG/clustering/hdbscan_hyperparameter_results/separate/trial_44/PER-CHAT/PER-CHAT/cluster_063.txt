1. just an idea but maybe write him a letter in the form of an invitation to hog warts and list the series as his school books ? you could expand it and add other " supplies " and take him to hogsmeade in the wizarding world to get the stuff like a stuffed owl or something although that part sounds like a much pricier ordeal

2. got my left side  ribs done and it was surprisingly not that bad . it just feels like something scratching you over and over . line work is less painful than shading , in my opinion . i actually kind of like how tattoos feel but . i ' m a weirdo .

3. yeah i get that aspect and he was going by the thread . just damn though , like hardcore entitlement action going on and it sounded like he was the virgin killer of california .

6. i ' m not going to give any more flak as i believe you have received more than enough . please just let your husband go . he deserves better . if you truly love him as you claim in your post , you would do so . holding onto him like this is just disgustingly selfish .

7. damn , i just imagined what he felt when doing this . it should have felt nice , like putting a dildo out of the anus .  . i hope someone will hate my comment now haha

9. mate is very popular in chile , and it ' s getting more popular in the states . in seattle you can get yerba minus the actual mate just like you can tea at coffee shops , you can even get a latte version . not sure if they put milk in it in uruguay , but in chile it is popular to drink with lots of sugar and milk .

10. i can ' t remember anyone complaining when the fbi was taking down a whole lot of websites with al  qaeda shit on them , but now it ' s white supremacist stuff the yanks are all crying " muh free speech " like the world is going to end . guess they ' re just showing their true colours .

11. dang that sounds like a tricky situation . i also have a shitty sister but she ' s not on drugs . just a serial bad attitude to everything , causes dramas because that ' s what she lives for . makes life tougher than it needs to be .
