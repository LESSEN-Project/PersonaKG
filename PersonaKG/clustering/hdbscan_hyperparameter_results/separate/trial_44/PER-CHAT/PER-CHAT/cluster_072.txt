10. because if you ' re older it ' ll determine how pointless this whole argument is . older people are more likely to argue vehemently than younger people .

14. my opinion on the subject tends to piss people off to begin with  i hate it that any single group has been indoctrinated by judeo  christian hegemony and then adopts it as if it  s their own bias . african , afro  caribbean , and african americans are the unfortunate prime example , but it also extends to native and aboriginal peoples across the world . the british , spanish , dutch and french came in , installed  buggery  and  sodomy  laws which criminalized homosexuality . the european dominion of the overseas territories brought with it puritanical religion which became deeply entrenched and persisted  in most cases still persists to this day . i wouldn  t blame these communities for a second , most of them had third genders and  or never had a prohibition on homosexuality until white people told them to . and the rest is history .

15. most of these people do that and then wonder why nobody cares about them anymore a few months later as a test of your loyalty
   (ID: 009af0be6850d8d1ff9d388a3c7f39f0f7727594)

16. no one has to tolerate speech that attempts to invalidate , ostracize , or incite harm . if it  s a  witch hunt  , the very nature of the statement implies that something is untrue . if that  s truly the case , the person in question has the ability to force an injunction and charge in a civil court for the tort of defamation . if the statement is true , then yes , absolutely , no one has any obligation to engage with a person who has demonstrated antisocial , inegalitarian behaviour . also , you need to actually reply to people  s posts directly . replying to your own post doesn  t give specific people a notification .

17. says the person victimizing fat people .
   (ID: fe56409176d2a6089f323227d5b07061f851d63b)

18. league schedules and tradition of being a " summer festival " are trivial issues compared to real world problems . i ' m not saying qatar will be a disaster , i ' m saying the construction projects are shady . thousands of people have died , worker conditions are horrible , safety standards are poor . people are sacrificing their lives and enduring brutal labor to build the stadiums . they should host the world cup somewhere thay either has stadiums already , or at least has ethical labor laws .
   (ID: 0264eec5f9f9a43d83f3a82c46341e90961fa3b8)

19. because in every religion there are certain people that make huge mistakes that result in wars
   (ID: e059f82a0624202d909920e56dd76f76efa711d2)

20. get the cheap table . pools pool . sure it wont play great , but at least it will play . if thats all you have to spend i would stay in budget especially if you are planning on moving . even more so if you are alone and dont have other people to play with . from experience it is something that could be used a lot if you have people that also enjoy the game . i cant dedicate myself enough to run drills so unfortunately i do not play alone too often .
