3. i ' m aware of the risks of budget builds , but i ' ve got a   digit affinity deck that ' s pretty fun to play , even if not the most competitive . it started out as a  digit build given the dirt cheapness of the basics of the deck , and it ' s gotten about digit bucks of upgrades , and that ' s still a really fun deck to play .

12. i ' ve personally witnessed over digit baofengs being tested by fcc specs , the only ones that fail were the fake models sold by amcrest  foscam , and one seriously abused legit model . that means the legit models have a digit . digit  pass rate . it doesn ' t fail because your ignorant opinion says so . oh some doucenozzle completely screwed up the testing in his " lab " with equipment not certified to spec , no commercial verification , a quarter mile from a tower with commercial repeaters , and somehow the radio is what fails ? sorry i ' ve seen all those so called " spurious emission " pictures and videos , every single one that " fails " these baofengs do so because the tester is a complete moron running the test in a way to make them purposely fail , or only tests the worst of the fake models they bought for  digit from foscam  amcrest or some unknown model uv  5xyz from a no name seller . go troll somewhere else kiddo .
