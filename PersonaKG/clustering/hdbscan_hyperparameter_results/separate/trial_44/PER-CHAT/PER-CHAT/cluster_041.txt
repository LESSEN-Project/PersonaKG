1. some dogs don  t like people with hats on . might just be something they aren  t used to . or a bad experience .

2. um , no the odds of him having a child are the odds of anyone else having a child . you either do or you don  t . and he could use a surrogate like plenty of straight people do too .

4. well , as harsh as it might sound , there might be people in your life who have slept with everyone but you and they still don ' t owe it to you to sleep with you . that said , i guess it ' s one ' s own choice whether one wants to hang around with a person like that , not out of spite , but out of being annoyed by being regaled with all the fine details which might be tmi .

5. don ' t complain to the people in the same situation as you , and don ' t complain to your subordinates . if you have an issue , take it higher and work towards resolving it . sitting around talking to your coworkers about how much your job sucks just makes you look like a whiney , entitled prick

6. i get why some people don ' t like the casting choices but why not give them a chance and at least watch some of their performances which by the way i can ' t find much for anya
   (ID: a5976f282a96c036f5e4d14957305323c9a5776d)

7. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

8. i don  t get the hate . i hang out on video gaming board . it  s just people wanting to have fun like me and you
   (ID: 726c36ce13fa631676ed5053f62b0f5f7b61eb5e)

9. it ' s your choice , and everyone has their reasons . i sometimes feel like people who don ' t drink can be a little judgmental of people who do , but i grew up around baptists so maybe thats why .

10. religious bigotry is why people like you don ' t get respect . you offer nothing but hate
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

11. why are you asking this ? like other people said there ' s nothing wrong with it , they don ' t hurt anyone for me as long as they don ' t convince others to be gay i ' m ok with it , they ' re humans just like you and me
   (ID: 2a3d0cc7409627207d71d58affd421983020efbe)

12. how to make small talk with people you don ' t like
   (ID: 2b53241b2b7d7e4ce58f4e39589b18bda4d0d5d2)

13. " being gay just means you like guys , so if you are a girl that likes guys you ' re gay . i don ' t see why people make a big deal out of being gay "
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

14. i have to ask you why you don ' t look this up yourself ? you have to be on the internet to type and submit your comment so why not just do a quick google search ? one of the biggest problems in this country is that a lot of people do not research anything themselves . they simply wait for someone to present information to them . when they don ' t like the information they hear , even if it is true , they dismiss it and when they hear information they do like they accept it even if it is false . it ' s absolutely ridiculous how easily manipulated people can be .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

15. i have the mentality of " well i don ' t like myself so why would other people like me . this just makes me push people away . the few people that i feel comfortable talking to always remain aquaintances .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

16. this is not entirely true . it is in my case . but for the majority of people , they decide to screw around for fun and suddenly become addicted . i don ' t even have an addictive personality , i just like how drugs feel .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

17. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

18. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .
   (ID: 45bf5c8227b94451beff1dce1059d0d2c683c40c)

19. couldn  t agree with you more . yes it wasn  t a perfect remake but it was pretty damn close in my books . if people don  t like remakes , i get that . but i can  t understand why people on reddit hate on this movie otherwise . i  m not sure what people who didn  t like it would have changed . the video said jungle book was better ? how ? they were almost the same in turns of animation . i liked it . my friends liked it . like you said the original will always be number one in my heart . but this was a damn fine movie in its own right .
