1. i completely disagree . how can you rank something for this event when you know nothing ? you can rank best omegas , sure . but not the best ones for the event . the only reasonable thing to recommend is stockpile omegas and use whenever necessary for the event .

3. by your argument , you are saying that the mechanics should reflect the theme of being dark and broody and introspective , and with mechanics supporting that , you cannot easily create a game that revolves around other things . it ' s just like how people say d  d is a wargame and at the end of the day , it ' ll play like a wargame because it ' s difficult to get it to not do that . if you design a game meant to make the players feel like they ' re monstrous assholes , they ' ll feel like that even if the theme is different . and that ' s true , but this is criticizing the core book , and by core book , they made everything more expensive and even more of a headache . yes , it does require you become evil , you have to fucking murder people in order to slake your hunger . that is a core mechanic . yes , you can kill criminals , but it ' s also just fucking stupid . at a certain point , you just need to murder as a general rule . what you are presenting is a way to circumvent that , it ' s completely unnecessary , i could that on my own as a low  gen vampire simply wanting to drain somebody to refill a chunk of my blood pool , but not everyone wants to murder , what if i want to swear off murder , i should be penalized for that ?  you are a monster who has monstrous urges they cannot control that is worth emulating in game . that is your view , not a default . your suggestions are entirely artificial , it is far more terrifying to know that somebody has nothing forcing them to be a terrible person , no reason , no mechanical penalty . they ' re just terrible because they chose to be , or because they valued power more than morality . everything you said was contradictory you ' re just trying to be clever .  so you ' re left with a tonal mismatch in a game you were never really playing correctly to begin with and you ' re annoyed by that ? like ive said digit times it ' s cool you had fun playing the game the way you did but you did so in spite of the tone of the game from the get go and now the new system was designed with that tone in mind . your tone . your perspective . your style of play . i did not go against anything , i simply played the game my way with my perspective , you are a narcissist if you genuinely believe the game is meant to be played the way you play it . v5 ? yes , it is meant to have that tone , the entire point of my complaints is that it is baked into the system when previously , it was not and allowed for more styles of play . no style is " right " and no style is ' wrong ' , i played my way , and now v5 won ' t let me do that so i consider it bad , on top of everything else i listed off .

4. the problem with the horror games these days is that at the age of digit , it is really hard to be scared of something on a screen . is it just me ?

10. dude , seriously , get over yourself ! i  m so sorry that i didn  t phrase my original comment to be  this specific man is really something else . just this one ! all the rest of em are ok !  like fuck off , men do stuff like this all . the . time . so stop caring about being generalized and go actually try for some positive change since youre not one of those guys .

13. you don ' t have to ask for legal advice but you can ask if you have a case and that if you do have a case ask them if they have a lawyer in mind that handles that sort of shit . believe me if you were an electrician , a plumber or contractor a lawyer would ask you for advice too .

16. and make youtube the platform everyone wants it to be . twitch thots will no longer be a thing . and everyone gets monetized no matter what unless you ' re extremely racist

17. overkill , probably . i ' m conservative with money and like low prices as much as the next person , but not to a crazy extent and would be too embarrassed to pull out coupons . i don ' t know if the quality of what they buy and their quality of life is any different , but i doubt it ' s really worth it unless they ' re really tight on money . they can do what they want , though , although when it inconveniences others , it may be a bit much . just pay normally for stuff .

20. most of your critiques  praises are based off the film ticking  not ticking your agenda . bisexual warrior queen ? lol mmkay . people love valkyrie because shes an awesome character , period . not because of her briefly hinted sexuality from a deleted scene .
