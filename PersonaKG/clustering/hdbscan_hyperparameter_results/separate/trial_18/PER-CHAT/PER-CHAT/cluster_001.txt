1. i don  t understand this aversion to violence that you have . take electrical cars for instance , they  ve been around for decades and the only reason their use is not widespread is because of the influence of the car , oil , and car maintenance lobbies . cars cause , what , digit , digit  digit , digit deaths in the us yearly . is this not structural violence on a mass scale ? and how about if we were to apply this to big farming . syngenta , conagra , cargill , and monsanto now run all pretty much digit  of food production in the us . this has wreaked havoc on small family run farming operations as thousands of families have had to close their farms . is this not another example of structural violence ? there is no way to achieve the things you want  democratically  or without violence . the only way to achieve the things you want is to brutally and violently repress the ruling class , namely the purveyors of capital formation and accumulation within the transnational corporations . the transnational corporations will never relinquish their power and wealth willingly . to believe so amounts to liberal idealism .

2. lol . who ' s trying to save face . my original post was not meant to be taken seriously . other people understood that , or were less inclined to jump into a discussion with the " i know something about something obvious to anyone with a high school education   so let me ' correct ' you " vibe we all love so much around here . you also clearly didn ' t read the thread .

3. no , only sticking to " the evidence " at the exclusion of personal experience is where things go awry , you limit yourself and others , and science becomes your master god instead of science being your tool . look , the reason we keep demanding evidence is based on one simple premise .   x200b  people can be wrong .   x200b  do you disagree with that ? you can be wrong . i can be wrong . preachers can be wrong , science teachers can be wrong . anyone can be wrong at any time about anything . everyone  is  wrong about  something  at any given time . i ' m probably wrong about lots of things .   x200b  which is why   verifiable evidence   is the superior method of figuring out what is true , instead of personal anecdote . evidence that can be verified by anyone , and everyone can draw the same conclusion from . that is part of the scientific process known as peer review , where your work is scrutinized and quested by your peers to find out where you are wrong .   x200b  no one single persons anecdotal experience determines truth . nobodys . not mine , not yours , not anyones . only what can be verified to be true via demonstrable evidence can be considered " true . i don ' t claim to have the whole truth . i don ' t claim anyone has the whole truth because nobody does . but we can figure out what is true by doubt , scrutiny , and skepticism . that ' s why we are able to plug our electronics in to our walls and power our devices . it ' s why we have gps , and medicine and vaccines . our entire modern world was built on doubt , skepticism , and science .   x200b  science gave us literally every aspect of our modern world . it is demonstrably true . and i would accept that as a " god " though i would never call it a god , because thats stupid , rather than some ancient fables , or someone ' s lsd trip .

4. yep , you ' re totally just ignoring this . you didn ' t make a comment about how you were unsubscribing or respond to my comment . i can see how you just mind your own business and ignore things . you ' re totally not acting like a whiny snowflake at all .

5. it ' s just that you refused to address my points or say anything but lol you are stupid , since you are so far beneath me and you lack the intellectual capacity for rational discussion i have moved on to doing something better with my time . you know it as well as i do that socialism will when you ' re watching it happen on tv every day and you ' re burned up with impotent rage . i don ' t give a shit what you say about me because i have people in my life who actually love me and care about me unlike trump supporters who are disowned by their own children do to how awful they are .

6. i should have written my comment more carefully . that ' s not what i meant at all . i don ' t think my point came across . i hate microtransactions just as much as anyone else . and i ' m sure game devs do too . my point is game designers don ' t deserve to be harassed on social media when it ' s the suits at the top who make these business decisions . game designers are employees just like anyone else and it ' s not their fault that the game has microtransactions .

7. okay , we get it . you want to change the subject now that you ' ve been called out .
   (ID: 8bc3c38873da8df8d450deb17fd3c4a602037c65)

8. people are less defensive when they don ' t feel attacked . true . nepene ' s above comment addresses this quite nicely . i ' m curious what you mean regarding socialism   it ' s a catchy turn of phrase , but i don ' t think i completely follow .

9. read  watch the fucking news . you sound like a total fucking idiot when you don ' t know what the fuck is going on around you and you make so many fucking stupid political statements when you don ' t fucking know what ' s fucking happening . don ' t correct me on something that you don ' t have a fucking clue about . fucking damnit .

11. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !

12. so tell me child . how much joy do you get out of this ? and it seems as though you ' ve forgotten there is a world outside of america . where left and right wings protest peacefully , intellectually an through many generations . you seem , perspectively through your comments on this thread alone . like nothing more than an imbecile , a child , an idiot . i hope you come to learn one day that there are benefits to all sides of the political compass . and if your narrow . you ' ll only lead to a narrow mid which in all cases . is simply , useless . good day

13. you ' re an idiot who clearly hasn ' t lived in very many countries . welfare is not what builds the nice parts of town or the transport channels to get a coke into the hand of any person in earth . rich people do , for their own benefit and the benefit of those who work for them . just because a few assholes kill the farm and pocket a tax break instead of giving you personally a job on a micro level doesn ' t mean trickle down economics doesn ' t elevate everyone on a macro level . i repeat , go live somewhere not built by the rich if you disagree .

14. lets take a moment to appreciate how much you assumed i implied from my accusations of your implications . have fun with your lesson in reading into things
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

15. you proved my point . you have no reason to hate america  americans . we have good terms with nz and you haven  t lived here , meaning you have no clue what it is like .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

16. what ? i just said that " you ' re telling me what i should share or not " god you ' re taking things out of context yknow what i ' m just gonna ignore this it ' s getting nowhere
   (ID: 339d06087e421a1cf86d695af2a2088546f9dc91)

17. how am i ridiculing incels ? i only asked a question . nothing about this post was meant to be derogatory .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

18. okay , you ' re trolling . you got me . i give up .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

20. im not taking everything so seriously , but if you read your respond on my answer it can only go over wrong .
