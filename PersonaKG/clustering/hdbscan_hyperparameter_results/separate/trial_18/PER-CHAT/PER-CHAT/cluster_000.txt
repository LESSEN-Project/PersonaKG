1. well , have you ever considered that your past experience and current lifestyle is what ' s shaping your outlook right now ? i won ' t claim to be an expert but perhaps the lack of " desperate " struggling has raised your level of contentment beyond what even you would consider " normal " perhaps ? my mother came from a 3rd world country we live in the west and my dad is british and i always felt like a piece of trash whenever i visited my relatives and the little nitpicks creep into my mind . but i noticed that despite their struggles , they seem infinitely happier and more comfortable with themselves than i can honestly admit .

2. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers

3. sounds like you need to go on a journey to find yourself . if money is tight go to your local jazz cafe or something and do some poetry . remember , you are only human so let out what you are feeling

4. love is a crazy thing , it ' s really hard for other people to give insight . don ' t let yourself be walked all over and remember that just because someone has bad experiences does not excuse bad behaviour . be careful

5. esh leaning on nta provided you used protection . anyway you can send him a message and tell him whatever you want if you think it  ll make you feel better but i doubt it  ll have any affect on his behaviour what so ever .

6. you ' ll find someone i ' m sure . there ' s someone out there for everyone . infact no scratch that because we hear that too much . just do as you please .

7. thank you so much ! really appreciate it !

8. i can ' t tell you how long it will last , but i can tell you that most likely you will not get burned like that again because you won ' t love unconditionally like that again . at least i didn ' t . it is actually kind of refreshing to know that i am now the one that is emotionally in control of my relationships now .

9. what she is doing does not seem particularly troublesome . i mean it just seems like she is changing in ways that are really freaking you out . from what you have said i would let it slide as long as he isn ' t violent , extorting money or raping her . i mean as long as she is happy and not getting hurt right ?

10. i know im late to this post but , you ' re still trying , even if you relapse it ' s a part of recovery , and i believe that you can do it , just try to stay strong
   (ID: feb4a6aeed8e7e14b0592329bd91d7933a93217e)

11. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .

12. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .

13. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .

14. fuck that man . you are a human and you need to feel wanted . bang slime women dudes . i get where you are at , so was i . bottom line one thing is ending and another thing is starting , have fun , have sex , party , just love how you always wanted to .

15. how do i tell a guy who thinks things are going well that i just want to be friends without hurting their feelings or making them hate me ? " hey , x , i ' m only interested in being friends " that ' s all you have to do . if a dude doesn ' t respect that and back off , or if they start resenting you , they were never your friend to begin with and you ' re better off without them . " leading them on " implies you ' re doing that intentionally to get something out of it . obviously that ' s not the case , so you really aren ' t doing anything wrong here . you ' re not obligated to give people a chance romantically , and if you aren ' t into them , it ' s arguably worse to tell them you ' re interested in them romantically when you aren ' t . if you aren ' t compatible and you know you ' re not interested , don ' t go down that path . however they react is on them , and if they get shitty with you for saying that you ' d rather be friends , they were a shit friend because they never actually intended to be your friend .   x200b

16. she  s taking my advice and basically just dropping subtle hints to see if she is bi or gay . asking her outright could go multiple ways and , like you , doesn  t wanna risk her friendship but is contemplating if it  s worth the risk since if she is bi or gay they might end up in a relationship . so it  s a difficult scenario . see what kinda friends she hangs out with since gays tend to congregate in my experience and find out what her previous relationships were like if she  s had any . so far it  s going pretty well and hannah is pretty sure she  s bi but still needs to find out more before she moves forward with it . oh yeah i actually had a situation similar to that with my partner , neither of us knew if the other was gay or straight or not . i  m pan so and i  ve dated girls and guys in the past , they  ve dated only one girl and regretted the relationship . after i found out they were pan too because i noticed a lot of their friends were gay , they had an even amount of girl to guy friends , they never denied being gay , etc so i asked them out and apparently they liked me for months on end . now we  re in an almost three year relationship . i hope all goes well for you smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

17. i was just reading an article about how digit  digit of young people feel lonely . it made me reflect on why . i am older than you and still suffer from those negative thoughts . i have friends , family , kids , a great job , and yet i have those negative thoughts . two things , these thoughts are not gods thoughts about you but it is the enemy  s . reject those things and dwell on what is good and on heavenly things . it  ll be a constant battle for life because the enemy dwells here looking to devour . lastly , get involved in the church and serve others . you will find meaningful friendships and find fulfillment when you serve people volunteer , missionary work , evangelize , etc . i know that there is a ministry for you to join and a regular bible study . i  ll pray for you . i know what you  re feeling and i know it  s a struggle but we are strong through christ who strengthens us .

18. this is a beautiful piece . i could see that pattern be used in such serious tones but you made it into something truly lively and playful .

19. hey , first off , i wanna thank you for being real with how you feel . and congrats to losing 90lbs , that ' s absolutley insane ! the first thing i thought of was the concept of " stinkin thinkin " and how our mind sometimes plays sick games on us by saying we are " not good enough " in reference to tinder , , , anyone can make a profile so why would you deny yourself the opportunity to have one if you want one and try it . you may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome . but it starts with you making one and knowing that if others can have it , you can too . also youre so young that you can bounce outta this mindset . first i would take your chance on the girl you want . ask her to the gym or something , and if that doesnt work , go in on the tinder and try what have you got to lose ? nothin , but a mindset that needs updated . im sorry if thats harsh because i do empathize feeling that way , because ive been there but ive found the way out too by putting one foot in front of the other and takin that chance with a girl . i believe in you bruddah

20. you did the right thing for you . your ex sounds immature and there is a good chance he has cheated plenty himself and that ' s why he is so nonchalant about it . his friend is the one who did something wrong . it isn ' t on you to keep his secrets . if you were in that situation you would want to be told , i ' m sure . let him buy you a ticket home . call your people and let them know you are coming back . this just saved you from a miserable life with a selfish jerk .
