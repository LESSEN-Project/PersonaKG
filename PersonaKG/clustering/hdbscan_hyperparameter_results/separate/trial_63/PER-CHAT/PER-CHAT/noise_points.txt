1. hey man , we ' re just digit random usernames who ' ll probably never interact , meet , or even remember later today but don ' t do it . it ' s a bit hypocritical since i ' ve felt exactly the same way a lot especially this year and a lot of what you say resounds a lot feeling lost , no direction , etc and i hate when people do this shit too but now it ' s my turn i guess . at least i ' m not sending you a generic you can make it wholesome meme . plus you got a nice smile and you seem kind . small gesture eh ?

4. making cute comments about parenting . or the men i know who are currently trying to pursue me , always talk about how much they love kids , want kids , want me and my child in their life . its like music to my ears but unfortunately for them , i ' m just not wanting a relationship at the moment .

5. ive watched the whole video and i am not sure if you read my post . my main argument is not autism . it is other minor damages caused from vaccines

6. oh i miss what unpopular opinion was chocked full of this juice . though i seriously gotta side with you . some men and women simply are attracted to children . having those thoughts alone does no hurt expect , potentially to the thinker but it ' s only when actions are sought that justice is needed . for example i guarantee there have been multiple times you ' ve thought of killing someone . isn ' t that just as bad if not worse than rape ? so why isn ' t that condemned

10. touch would be different than emotion . i wouldn ' t really like to know what is behind the dead eyed look .

11. i think honestly you ' re probably in the middle . your hairs not really that fine but its not like very thick either . a good compromise lmao . i ' ve tried the nivea actually , i liked it but the hold wasnt the best . id recommend trying american crew fiber or hanz de fuko claymation . both pretty good products but ultimately everyones hair responds differently to different products . id say try a few ones out you like and stick to one you get the best results .

12. coming from a girl who everyone assumed my whole life as " rich " sometimes it ' s not actual individuals that hold money , it ' s the family . my family has money , but they don ' t pay my bills . the only expensive jewelry i ever have received family bought  gifts  which is just likes purses , scarfs , etc . so she may be struggling just as hard as you are , her struggle just may look a lot more stylish thanks to her family . just a thought ! btw  i dont date " rich guys " because digit  are jerks so she could also feel that way !

13. i would actually like to play this scenario . but , the thing is , everyone would just camp their wool the whole game and there wouldn ' t be too much pvp . also , i think popular people ' s wool would get target too much . but overall , great scenario !

15. let him sit and watch tv all day . ask him what he likes . tell him stories about the two of you and your favorite show  time together . listen to any of his stories , even if they are ridiculous . don ' t expect anything from him , so when he does remember it will be a gift . rotate caregivers frequently to avoid burnout . check out local care facilities , cost , and requirements . join a support group .

17. just curious , is there some sort of " vesting " in the canadian system , to prevent folks from moving to canada and getting benefits from others paying into the system ? for instance do you have to live there for a period before receiving benefits ? it may be something you need to consider .

19. i found it when i became independent . everyone has their own way of finding their self worth that correlates with their personality , soul , etc . i don  t usually like to think that way , i like to think more like   with all my flaws my ups and downs , it makes me who i am and i love myself for it .  some albums  love yourself  answer , love yourself  tear , and you never walk alone are some albums i highly recommend .

20. i do not think my comment indicates that i have a black  white perspective  just asked a question " if you settled with a powerful man then that was a smart decision " it ' s not just a " smart decision "  it is an opportunity that is given to you because you are attractive . so you ' d say everyone that settles for " poor men " makes foolish decisions ? i don ' t know , but you argue pretty " black  white " to me . it all depends what you value . if you value fame , power , money , . and the only way you can get this is by marrying someone who provides you with these things , sure go for it . if you can ' t achieve these things by yourself though , i think this is the opposite of " being smart . " a guy who is a genius but marries a gold digging whore is stupid " why ? couldn ' t you make the same argument as to why it ' s a smart decision for the " gold digging whore " to marry that guy , that it is a smart decision from the rich guy ' s perspective because he marries a beautiful sexual partner , potentially resulting into a more beneficial reproduction ?
