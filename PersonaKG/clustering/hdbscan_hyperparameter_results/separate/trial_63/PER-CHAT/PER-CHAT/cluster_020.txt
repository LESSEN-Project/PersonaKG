2. they are a bit more athletic than lions , its true but do you think being a king is always a matter of who beats who ? tigers dont have any instinct to rule others i suppose

10. oh i thought there was a different aspect too , where the more boxes you open he more likely you are to get a new brawler . i think that part applies to all rarities
   (ID: 26831d6557d17492ae3b0b54585b32e08055f834)

   (ID: 168d1161144e63a83a23f04ae4e64bd4b25684c0)

13. i dont think it works like that but ok
   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

14. i think this goes a little unappreciated and xbows only could be really enjoyable i think .
   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)

15. very good point , didn ' t think about that aspect . but the fact that op started with " being in la " makes me think it ' s for social media purposes .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

16. i read that as corned beef and nearly puked . i mainly eat irish beef , i guess it doesnt need to travel as far . meat in the us could probably spend a few days in transit and being moved around more . the more you think about it the more differences could contribute but i think youre probably right about personal  cultural taste .
   (ID: 37f1dd54cc7fbf9961db909e5dce33ca94dc5b82)

17. i think it ' s more like when you go to pick up your kid from school but you forgot his name .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

18. do we have to answer or can ' t you think of it yourself ?
   (ID: 080eedcfaabe8f67b2c0a8da33a3a401906822f2)

19. have you all heard the one about the bed ? i didn ' t think so  it hasn ' t been made yet . wanna hear a rope joke instead ? aw , skip it .
   (ID: 649605988d72e34fdcf0c170b6b9fa959a7d483e)

20. disagree  i think if there is profit to be made then digging in old landfills , dredging the ocean or mining asteroids in space  these elements will be recycled and re  purposed .
