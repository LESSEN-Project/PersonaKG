8. no , they are not flushable . if the box says so , they are lying to try to sell more tampons , though i ' ve ever seen that on a box . tampons are literally designed to plug and soak up liquids , so they do that in the pipes too . " flushable " wipes are not supposed to be flushed either , they do not break down .

20. hey guys , great place you ' ve got here . something struck me , and i decided i need to go ahead and grow out what i can and see where it goes . most times i ' ve had some degree of facial hair , but anything of beard caliber seemed a far off dream . then i figured , " why not " any tips ? also , and this may be an odd question . based on what you guys see here , could you link me to a picture of a beard that looks similar to how you ' d anticipate mine coming in ? just figuring since you ' ve guys seen many beards start off here , you can kind of read where it may go to a degree . edit  my plan is to let it grow at least one month , sept . 1st .
