1. i think it  s pretty obvious that they have grown to a point that they need to follow the money . you can  t blame them but for every single feature that doesn  t drive revenue requires capital . with plex pad not being essential for all users , they literally have a zero rmr driving product that said , you can  t expect endless resources to come from nowhere . the options are   people pay more for what they get to allow them to ease up on other methods of generating revenue  let them get some revenue driving streams so they can soon offer the features they likely need money to develop .  or digit , find something better . right now , they are not as customer hungry as they are capital hungry so they gotta do what they gotta do this is all simply my opinion on all the recent whining about not getting what people want . it  s still leaps and bounds ahead of anything out there

2. i ' m a short order cook . people think it ' s easy and that i ' m just flipping burgers but when it ' s busy and you ' ve got digit tickets on the wheel it ' s very physically draining and mentally straining to keep track of what needs to go on when to make sure that everything comes up when it ' s supposed to .

3. last time around it took digit minutes . but this is an outlier  usually you need to book your appointment first thing in the morning to be seen at some point in the day . i think it  s worth mentioning that we have private healthcare too . so if you have the cash or good insurance you don  t ever have to wait . london , uk .

4. it  s harder to find faithful guys than to find unfaithful guys . as a guy i see it all the time where the deepest secrets of my closest friends involve them cheating on their wives or girlfriends regardless of how deep in love they seem to be . i have a friend who loves his wife and daughter with his whole life , even a family man who you would never expect can have some dark dark secret that can only be told to digit or maybe digit of his bestest best friends over a beer and a campfire . every time , they try to justify it in their heads with some kind of nonsense like  were gonna die one day  or  i was drunk  or  how could i pass it up  it  s a scary world for women to try and find a man that they can even feel like they can trust

8. to be completely honest , i was terrified of painting this . this is actually my 3rd attempt of painting this mask the other digit times , i wasn  t super happy with it . the secret is taking your time and patience of course . it makes me really happy that i give you confidence , and just remember , if you don  t like the final product , you can always remove the paint and start again .

10. never said it was easy , maybe it ' s worth a short term struggle for long term fulfillment . then again there are way more opportunites in places like the usa and europe than there are in the majority of the world .
