11. actually i ' m really sad i thought of this . it ' s just awful . who would want to go through that with the cast of any typical movie ? no matter how attractive a given actor is , there ' s always that one scene where they visit their parents or something . i couldn ' t do it . limiting it to just human adults because , just because , the worst character cast to have to fuck would probably be the silence of the lambs .  shudders

13. you just created this acct for this post . not sure if you should be taken seriously . assuming you are for real , are you saying you just started queefing because this new guy has a large penis ? or that your vagina was already cavernous and the queefing has gotten worse ? why would you want to make your vagina bigger with the dragon dildo ? that only allows more air in leading to more queefing .

14. just looking at that makes me want to shit my pants
   (ID: 59c651a5c06af5a1be40c3866fad09e7ac4c78f2)

15. i guess you ' re right . the only issue is that when i get along with a guy have a lot in common , instant click , share similar goals  values  etc there comes a point where he tells me just doesn ' t want a relationship . after a month or so he ' s dating someone this has happened three times now , hence why i believe i ' m the reason

16. yta , sorry to burst your bubble , but you can ' t make someone do anything to you . if she doesn ' t want to have sex , she doesn ' t . and making her give you a bj just fucked it up even more .

17. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .

19. i actually want to hear from guys who have been married . since commitment in both marriage and with owning a vehicle go hand in hand . if your car doesn ' t work anymore , do you just get rid of it and find a newer one that works ? or do you stick with it and try to repair it ?
   (ID: 2e30252ab6ce4c1807bb315c6103be324b841909)

20. if some assholes come into your territory with bad intention what would you do ? if other country just want to conquer ur territory , what happens ?
