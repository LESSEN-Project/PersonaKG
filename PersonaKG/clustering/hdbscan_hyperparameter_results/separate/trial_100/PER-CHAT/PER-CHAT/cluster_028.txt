   (ID: 41b9459dbd87b475322566af693bf5fe2a47086d)

2. he will find his own way . my sister still has a relationship with them but i am nc with my parents . it  s weird sometimes . but that  s what works for her and this is what works for me , and that  s ok . just give him hugs , and be there for him , because we have to choose our family very carefully  we were given such crappy ones ! sounds like you both are on the same page . and don  t ever give your ssn to anyone who asks . god , so many horror stories of nparents stealing their children  s identities and ruining their lives ! aack ! protect yourself !

5. thats extremely true . it doesn ' t mean you don ' t like the girl . even the most thunderingly beautiful , intelligent and witty girl ' s names are still just tiny pieces of information bobbing on the oily swirl that is the short  term memory of a preoccupied inebriate .
   (ID: 54c02bf73569d6b7f5a88c3d841a214eee1a4d14)

6. i just really don  t like what you are implying . it is opening a whole new world of theories and it  s hurting me real deep .
   (ID: cc15a2c089fadf84b135f1f61f9666baac04a6e3)

   (ID: 7a36b5607ec030b33a99723097f6d67b04c38d99)

9. you can do it . mind over matter . don ' t like that evil plant control your life . everytime you get a craving ? light up a j . that ' s exactly why i never started smoking , just trees for me .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

10. just go to a pub together . if you like him you can take him home after and blame it on the alcohol the next day . if you don  t like him , alcohol will either make him more attractive or you dumber to meet his level .
   (ID: 5344621c1ec41719d7e9e7b0b20e03cbb602774a)

11. in a word  no . writing is tiring for me and the number of stories would push the thread well into tl  dr territory . i ' ll keep writing these and posting when i can and if you don ' t like it you can just not read them .
   (ID: 4d17a8a4d7907bba6d158e8a0b9c3504d69be003)

12. whatever camera you have right now , even if it ' s just on your phone ! see if you enjoy doing it , and if you do decide to upgrade , just ask yourself " what don ' t i like about my photos " and research what gear will allow you to counter those flaws in your work .
   (ID: 664b365f80ff1d51db95866fada8009f14d8e9b1)

13. lol her coming to take him away from the horror and casually asking him if he wants to talk about it even their first sex is unnatural , although at this point it is just becoming boring . i agree the development of their relationship is necessary for the show , but don ' t like the way it is done
   (ID: a7aa6341e1b57ce267a054932c0fecc933562532)

14. i like to pretend that everyone using a fusion rifle is just doing it to complete the thorn bounty . that way , i don ' t hate them .
   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

15. yeah i don  t see a problem with that . but like you said just don  t see his movies anymore . it  s a fair reaction
   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

16. i mean just a picture of her in that dress without anything else would get my upvotecos i ' m like that i don ' t hide it but this is just stupid
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

17. same here . i cherish every moment i get with someone , even those i don ' t particularly like . everyone is loved . i just hope in his final moments i was thought of . some things are unpreventable , so you have to clasp every moment .
   (ID: 54073428e1afecd7ce44872ad5cd42619b1da6ed)

18. you ' re free to enjoy whatever game you like . just don ' t see why you would post it here .
   (ID: 2f03a8d589defb9434044b9ef9bfffc676e2b49a)

19. be polite and act as the adult you are . don ' t act like a douche just because you can shield yourself behind the anonymity of the web .
   (ID: c7e5f1c7a94109955f94d7acd2417ffad0ba60db)

20. ego is a structure that is erected by a neurotic individual who is a member of a neurotic culture against the facts of the matter . and culture , which we put on like an overcoat , is the collectivized consensus about what sort of neurotic behaviors are acceptable .   terence mckenna fucks laws , just don  t hurt others and do as you please
