6. that sounds rather tricky , because ultimatley i would think your not going to want lots of male muscle in the long run , you ' ll need a certain amount of fat to your shape . at the moment im 176lb ' s with a fairly feminine frame but im working out a lot . im trying very hard not to build too much muscle and just tone up . i dont want my biceps or calfs to get any bigger for example . i could be totally wrong but i would think you need to gain some fat , but keep working out while putting the weight on to keep it under control . if you suddenly put on 20ib worth of muscle you going to look far more masculine .

7. i pretty take all social media posts with a grain of salt . no one ' s life is perfect every single day but they want you to think it is .

9. this is a very difficult subject . has she ever been molested ? i was molested by my father , starting at the age of digit . because of this , i ' m fairly certain your attraction would be a deal breaker for me . however , you are clearly an honorable man , and i want to thank you . i can only imagine how difficult this must be for you . i think your best bet would be to start the therapy if that ' s the road you want to take , and have her join you . i think hearing a professional ' s opinion , and understanding what you are dealing with will help her and the inevitable confusion that i ' m sure will come .

10. yes , i think you should if transitioning is what you want to do . your primary goal should be self preservation , and keeping your dad happy shouldn ' t come before that .

13. against  torture is a great way to get false information . inflict enough suffering on anyone and they ' ll tell you exactly what they think it is you want to here .
   (ID: e78c9eb3b69138ff8337dd896bc5bb1e02fc6559)

14. out of interest do you think you should be able to send anything you want to anyone else ? if not where do you draw the line ? i think almost everyone can agree that threats of violence should not be protected under freedom of speech . that said , thank you for offering your take on this , it was very informative .

16. what is responsible for the existence of our universe . i  m not talking about the big bang , rather i want an answer beyond that . i also wouldn  t accept anything involving a god of some kind . sadly i think this question is deemed to never be answered .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

17. try to think about how you want her to feel about your exes . that  s how you should handle it .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

18. i think that means she dosn ' t want simone else to steal you from her or something

19. i was going to think of a reply to you , but if you want my comeback you ' ll need to wash it out of your mom ' s hair .
   (ID: b863480affffa35b0ead5c7bc5daa4c4099c0cee)

20. nah without knowing the details of the argument but generally if you want your aunt there , you should invite her . not inviting her will be mean and make it seem to her that you are taking everyone else ' s side . i wouldnt reccomend appeasment as your method of life , id reccomend talking to everyone involved and everyone that feels bad and talk with them about this whole situation and whether or not they can be adults and get over it for a day . i think if you like your aunt , would want to spend the birthday with her , the argument wasn ' t her fault and you proceed to not invite her you would be the asshole without a doubt . otherwise try talking to everyone involved
