10. sorry , i ' m a glib responder , but well intentioned . when you say " nationality play duh " is that ' s because the aforementioned wanderlust contained that element ? i ' m gonna go look , but again , apologies i ' m in that " screw it , whatever " frame where i ' ll still ask just in case .

14. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

15. yes , i do . i absolutely do , and i say that as someone who is waiting to get a teacher job . you are not their parent and they are students rather than " kids " , but your duty is to defend them against dangers , even if the danger is their own parent . and she is just looking at the other side . while he beats the kid , not giving a slap , but beat in sadistic manner , without control of his actions . he could have broken her nose or teeth . what if that was a gunman , rapist or similar ? she would have just looked at her computer ? this is cowardice , unless she knew there is a video tape and let him do thar so there is an evidence .

   (ID: 0946cd78b677ef75393af1c79948027ca615f558)

19. i am using the word can as a verb the second definition of being permitted to do something . now i was using it in the way to ask someone to allow me to do something and not the first definition of can . so please read a dictionary and come back to me when you have educated yourself . or just say , " you ' re an idiot "
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

20. but i can say ' je ne sais quoi ' without feeling that way . damn loan words . edit  i just realized i only use that phrase satirically . i guess we should just leave other languages alone .
