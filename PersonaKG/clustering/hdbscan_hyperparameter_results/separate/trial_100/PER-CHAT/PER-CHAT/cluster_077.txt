13. i wonder if it is that when we are waiting for something we measure time against itself . in other words , when one checks the time it is like a reset  like the time before doesn ' t matter . the increments get smaller , yet feel longer . on the other hand big one , little one , take your pick when we are engaged or entertained we are not paying attention to the passage of time .

17. for me , when i  m having issues i try and distract myself . i like to listen to music a lot , so i  ll listen to music and sing along with it and that calms down most of the time . when i can  t listen to music , i start reciting songs in my head and that works too .

18. hmm , try it like this  " i ' m not racist , but why can  t black students shut the fuck up and learn like everybody else ? " it help ' s identifying you as you are early in the sentenceand doesn ' t waste someone ' s time reading racist bullshit

19. kid , expand your thinking . what would happen if everyone thought like you ? if banging chicks is the ultimate measure of success , we ' d probably go back to the time when sultans kept harems . women are humans , not trophies for you to ejaculate in .
