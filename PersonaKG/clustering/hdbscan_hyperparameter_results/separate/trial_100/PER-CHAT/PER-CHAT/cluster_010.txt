1. ah , well in this case i ' m not sure , sorry ! i guess what you want is a way of speeding up the responsiveness of actions , but unless you actually had a system to play with and test ideas i don ' t know how it would actually behave .

3. you don  t need to know characters sexuality to play a game . and it  s better that way because hell , they could be gay , you wouldn  t know , so you can believe what you want about them .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

6. don ' t you want to know the character you ' re writing about ? know what makes them tick ? what keeps them up at night ? the why behind the reasons for them doing what they do . someone doesn ' t masturbate with shit for pleasure because they had a normal childhood .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

7. it ' s hard enough to get them to help with recovering an account that all the info is known for . if you don ' t know the email address , password , or birthdate , their hands are kind of tied . there ' s no way to prove that it ' s actually your account . i mean , of course you can always try . are your pets the same ? do you remember any items you may have had , or avatar count ? maybe someone changed your info . seems unlikely that it can be recovered , but if you really want it , it can ' t hurt to see what tnt says .

8. because you don  t want to know what happens to craig in the last photo
   (ID: 4136a1b6da64b3c5f49dfe23761d1a0ec8925dba)

9. all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be  so i guess what i  m saying is breathe . enjoy each breath and take it for what it is . you  re not in the past and if you keep looking back you  ll never enjoy today . and life is a beautiful thing that you don  t want to let pass by . i don  t know if that will help but it  s the advice i can give . best of luck
   (ID: 6eb8259d7d6b7ae101dda44ceaaf3b9edaab4fad)

10. same . i know i ' m just doing it because i really want some sort of human interaction but given my current mood i don ' t want it to be with my real friends or , you know , anyone i might ever have to look in the eye again .
   (ID: 34de9309a5c02867b676757fa019c58a66bad300)

11. hey you i want you to know . i don ' t care and don ' t even remember it . get some sleep , sleep is important .
   (ID: 7ed1ff576cc7dc77750ed5f15461eb3ccdb52a7a)

   (ID: 8d5aac58a9c3a7e883f9e90df39dc5ab7c36de53)

13. really ? how about you bluepillbeta do some research before sprouting this nonsense . if you don ' t know what the foundation of mgtow is , why try to have a discussion . if you want a serious answer , read the sidebar and if you aren ' t too blind , you ' ll see why .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

14. that ' s the way i ' d go . if you don ' t want to do any of the things you already know , knowing more means options you might not have considered will open up .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

15. i don ' t know if i count but my ocd ruined my life to the point i had to be hospitalized multiple times . i can ' t control my thoughts and i want to be productive but my intrusive thoughts just get so bad . i want to go to college and eventually a job but these damn thoughts are ruining it for me .
   (ID: f9d3bf7ce779e854aa865f12a7dfaaee14a65cfa)

16. probably a matilda situation . in my experience , your parents don  t have to tell you that you were unwanted and they resent you for it . kids are pretty intuitive that way , and if he didn  t know before then he probably knows now based off of the fact that they want literally nothing to do with their grandchild . but i bet the maternal grandparents will have more than enough love to go around !
   (ID: b40d1d3ae1e77bcbdcb98e62deea24396d4b4d40)

17. because we know , for a fact , that pot is not as bad as the commercials want you to believe it is . meth is every bit as bad as they show , they don ' t even have to play things up .
   (ID: 9a13b21f54717da1499379b5cb0e991e82d4c90f)

18. sims is only boring if you don  t know what you want out of life . me ? i just go around and impregnate already married sims face  with  tears  of  joy

19. i don ' t care if you beat djt , i want to know what your policies are that will keep america great
   (ID: 0d5c70b45072ef9ffc8fb257e4775e8302391e3c)

20. i don ' t know who needs to hear this right now , but you can literally do anything you want in your house , it ' s not illegal unless you get caught .
