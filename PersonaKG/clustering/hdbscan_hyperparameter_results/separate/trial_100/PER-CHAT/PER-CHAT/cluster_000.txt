6. but reincarnation is a supernatural occurrence that ' s only based in religion . the closest to what you are describing is jainism . it ' s still a religion though . i ' m just busting your chops though . all great fictional stories use selective liberties with facts . don ' t let my nitpicking screw with your story ideas . if all authors did that nothing would get written .

10. i stand by my assessment . you gave the server money you otherwise wouldn ' t have , and your intent was to convince them to vote for a particular candidate . i understand your position that it was a symbolic gesture , but i don ' t believe you can separate that out from the fact that you did give them money . fortunately , it seems i ' m in the minority on this not unusual for me , so you should have nothing to worry about .
