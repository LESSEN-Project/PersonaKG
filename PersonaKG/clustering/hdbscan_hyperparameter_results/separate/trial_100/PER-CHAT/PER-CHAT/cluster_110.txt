   (ID: 5dc1e0203cb86a245c4ede5cb73923b295b1fdc8)

2. i ' ve heard it helps to start cleaning up something small , and then grow from that . even if it ' s just putting a fork into a drawer , it ' s important to start somewhere .

3. we ' ve been focusing on talking about prepping with friends , family and loved ones , especially because we ' re all going to be together in the run up to the festive season ! plus my partner wrote this awesome post on the sensible about how she used to grow food in just her dorm room . we ' ve now thankfully got a bit more space for our homestead than that .

4. it ' s a text message . if it was urgent , you should ' ve called , imo . we ' re all adults and we ' re busy living our lives . a text message just frankly isn ' t a priority .

5. atleast what i ' ve seen and tasted it is nowhere close to icing and it ' s a lot harder . i just used the word ' glue ' because i am not sure what is even being used in that .

7. i ' ve never tried to bust it as quick as i can tbh . there are times where i ' ve lost concentration and bust it earlier than i wanted , but as no orgasm was had i can just wipe off and keep going .

9. you  re right ! the movie would have been much better if they actually filled on location instead of just making it cgi . you  ve changed my opinion on this movie .

10. haha if you have not seen love death  robots on netflix this probably seems kinda crazy , but it ' s just a description of one of the episodes that i immediately thought of when reading the title .
