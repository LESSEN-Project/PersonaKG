   (ID: 8ea8e4a00c3f2a64096e00bdbba0247e580cdb17)

2. personally , i think the rise in popularity of documentaries has a lot to do with the general public being sick of crap network tv and actually wanting to learn something new .

3. yeah certainly , the troubles was what i was referring to , i think it would have been far worse with legal guns . london and glasgow have a very troublesome violent crime issue and they are other areas i believe would be worse with legalised guns . although this is sheer speculation , both cities have major knife crime issues , maybe it wouldn ' t be so bad if the other guy had a legal firearm . who knows ?

4. we have a certain sense of accomplishment to make up for it . think about it  we ' re mundane folk who figured out how to alter reality on our own . no bloodline , god or otherworldly being helped us .

   (ID: 448fa72755c2d77f67b820a9620d09e9d4573816)

   (ID: b7507045470edf901fe3b39ecbb382c66ea3405a)

   (ID: 5b8ed03bdff11aec4ed3a2ed4e122a505bf937dd)

14. i ' m hoping for contact lenses that would work as a cell phone . that would be cool i think and only you would ever be able to see what your doing on them
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

15. do you think it would help with any pain he ' s having though ?
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

16. are you against lying ? would you lie to save someone ' s life ? are you against murder ? do you accept that perhaps hitler should have been killed prior to his inauguration ? etc . contradiction is a completely regular aspect of human existence , embrace it or go insane i think . the implication of your comment would be to throw all morals and ethics out the window . i assume that ' s not your actual position , despite it being what you said .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

17. a brief look and i am guessing it is real . i can ' t take any more than a brief look as my liver is already in open rebellion and i think exposure to that site would probably prompt a few more organs to join it .
   (ID: 59ebeb8d8fee755bce043a6482743bde8a2a0bb1)

18. do you think it would replace the living room where we all used to watch tv ?
   (ID: 4e289af5e18133c4578deba659b7e1d2784a925d)

19. i think you should start writing everything about it first and write off memory , then take inspiration based on other scps or whatever , so your true idea doesn ' t get lost in translation
   (ID: 93e3d10c1d0bffae76c0adb5d9a96d6abf1aade9)
