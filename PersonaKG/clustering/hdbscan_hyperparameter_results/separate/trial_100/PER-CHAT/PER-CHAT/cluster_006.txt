10. our desire for things in this world cannot exceed our desire for god . it is a christian belief that who we are and the good we do stay with us in to the next life . you are still you and thus the good things that you liked in life are still part of you . if the creating of beauty through music , art , etc . is a good thing it will exist still in heaven . how we will enjoy it then , i do not know . the book of job is problematic on many levels . first of all it is a marriage of a folktale the prose beginning and ending with the work of a first rate hebrew poet who inspired by the folktale creates the bulk of the middle . the essence of the folktale is that god tests our faith . the essence of the poetry that suffering that we endure has a purpose even if we cannot understand or know what that purpose is . very small children may believe the rules and restrictions placed up them by their parents cause unnecessary pain and suffering , but parents often know it is for their good .

14. woodworking man . go pick up a stack of free pallets , and you can tear them down with an hour and a hammer . after that , you know you have free wood , so even if what you make is crap , it didn ' t cost a dime . make a shelf , box , whatever . if it ' s something you ' re into , it ' ll grow to making cool stuff . and if you ' re not into it , no harm no foul , didn ' t cost anything but a few basic tools if you don ' t have them hammer , drill and circular saw will handle most everything , and are cheap online  craigslist . good luck man ! hope it works out

20. that can ' t be healthy . yeah my friends are literally the reason i even know of furries because their the ones that told me about them in the first place . now of course it wasn ' t good stuff but i gradually started to like them from my one sided mind .
