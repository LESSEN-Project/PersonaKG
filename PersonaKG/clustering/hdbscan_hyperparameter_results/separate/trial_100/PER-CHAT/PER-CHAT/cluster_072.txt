7. imminent domain ? where the government can take your land if they feel it is for the good of the community ? example like a park or roadway .

13. you proved my point . you have no reason to hate america  americans . we have good terms with nz and you haven  t lived here , meaning you have no clue what it is like .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

14. that ' s pretty good , could it be a scanner colour matching issue then if you ' re able to correct it like that ?
   (ID: e2865528dd17e86320ca523d3db462efa29e7ca7)

15. hmmmm . what would be a good place ? get everyone to head out to a wheeling spot like hot springs ? i ' m not coming up with a good one between me and you .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

16. yeah you ' re good . if it ' s hitting high 80s use some software like afterburner to set a limit on it . you should be fine though .
   (ID: 1885b01dd0970230fea2a9c9ae9c4eaeaceb59a3)

17. doubt it . it  s hard to catch stocks at their bottom . and their track record seems to suggest they  ll keep making mistakes . if anthem takes off it could be a good bump for them though . there are better choices for undervalued stock out there , like baba

18. looks like a good phone . why do you have both lite apps ? i guess you might not be using them so much .
   (ID: 4dd03f320502247ea725348e21fe67168d7cf5f1)

19. good question . seems to me like they might be able to answer quite a few of the questions around this case by discreetly placing a camera to catch whoever is desecrating the grave .

20. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .
