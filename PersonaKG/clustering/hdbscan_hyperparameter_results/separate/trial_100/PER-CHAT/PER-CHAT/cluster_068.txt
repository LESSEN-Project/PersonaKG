1. i agree porn isn ' t the healthiest  most ethical of things . but i don ' t think anyone has ever used the pornhub app to kill a room full of people because his penis was feeling extra tiny that week . priorities .

2. i wouldn  t call him an asshole in the situation if i knew the guy and could talk to him personally . this is the sub amitheasshole ? not amithepersonwhodidntthinkitthrough . i don  t think proposing is an asshole thing to do . but it was insensitive , poorly thought out , irresponsible , and a laundry list of other things that point towards  yta  which is what people request on this thread .

3. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .

4. i ' m not the guy begging for karma tho , besides , you don ' t have to be a jerk about it , also , i think not even half the people here give a fuck about your 10k karma

5. " fair game ? why do you think you ' re entitled to other people ' s stuff ? it ' s not yours , don ' t touch it !
   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

6. i think it changes for each person , which is why i don ' t think it makes sense when people talk about not " crossing the line " .

7. lol . not on the topic of coltee ' s shirt , but larissa is extra annoying this episode with these cosmetic procedures . coltee ' s annoying me too . and jay and ashley . i don ' t think any of these people don ' t annoy me any more . maybe pedro .

8. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?

9. its more the " it ' s ok for me to have slept with a lot of people  have sex on the first date because i ' m a guy . but if a girl does it , she ' s a slut . " that ' s a problem imo . if you ' re not being hypocritical than i don ' t think it ' s an issue . i think there is some on the reverse too  " it ' s ok for me to have slept with someone of the same gender , i ' m a woman . but if a guy does it , he ' s gay . " basically  don ' t shame someone you wouldn ' t have them shame you for .

10. people are less defensive when they don ' t feel attacked . true . nepene ' s above comment addresses this quite nicely . i ' m curious what you mean regarding socialism   it ' s a catchy turn of phrase , but i don ' t think i completely follow .
   (ID: 17b8a304069d7530607e28f8e04d840e28be0d3e)

11. no one is saying anything other than the footage was creepy . i don ' t understand what the deal is . are people not allowed to think it was creepy ?
   (ID: 88c35221745da41b29ff5b9f921026de5ccbb6c0)

12. what the fuck ? i wonder if these kinds of people ever take a step back to question their insanity and then go ahead and do the crazy shit anyway . or if they do question themselves , what sort of stuff do they think is too crazy and don ' t follow through .
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

13. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .
