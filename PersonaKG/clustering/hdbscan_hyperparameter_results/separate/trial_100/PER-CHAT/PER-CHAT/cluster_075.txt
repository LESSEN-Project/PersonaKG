2. i read it already . if people ' s dogs are getting out to do that , it is not the fault of the dog . it is the fault of the owner for failing to look after the dog properly . for that reason , why should i have to put my dog through such an unnecessary procedure ? it is selfish and irresponsible to put an animal through that just because it makes you more comfortable .

3. i ' m not sure i see how that relates ? fat acceptance , in my understanding , is just accepting people for what they are and not judging them . there ' s no expectation at least no reasonable expectation that we should have to find fat women attractive . could you elaborate on what you mean ?

18. when people touch your stuff . it happens too often that people just pick up my backpack and throw it on my lab instead of asking to free the seat next to me . and for some reason its always women who do that , guys always ask

19. i  m not a bootlicker , i just have mad respect for the people that risk their lives to keep my county safe . i see the sacrifice that these people make for my country and i give them the recognition that they deserve . my grandfathers were in the military and they always told me to show respect to those who risked and gave their lives for my country , i guess it carries on
   (ID: 93c3b3d523de0afd404d3bcb4acdf023866f9281)

20. yeah , true . there are so many worse companies . just the first thing i thought of . it ' s great for talking to my friends and family all over the world as well as promoting myself , but i hate to see how people are addicted to it and over use it as well as whatever privacy stuff they violate .
