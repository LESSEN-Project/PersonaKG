3. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

4. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .

5. must be all the beauty products she made him bring home last season . i kid , she looks great . i did kind of think it was funny when she called chantel ' s family image conscious or materialistic or whatever , considering the whole tv , laptop , entire suitcase full of beauty products , etc she demanded pedro bring to her . look , no one hates the family chantel more than i do , but you aren ' t perfect , lady !

6. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?

8. i was trolling some goth chick and she started yelling at me her boyfriend a friend of mine had to hold her back but thats not the scary the scary part is every once and a while she would legit try to scope me out whenever she did find me she would tell me to leave her friend alone long story but yeah i would always think she would falcon punch my ass

9. i think they did a reality show about that . a homeless man was given a lot of money . can ' t remember how much , but apparently he didn ' t really use it well . but we should try again and again .

   (ID: e059f82a0624202d909920e56dd76f76efa711d2)

12. you  re right . the mother was upset that she was feeding it to her kid everyday , and the kid was gaining weight and was in poor health . you fed your kid chocolate everyday . what the hell did you think would happen
   (ID: 70b19763b4597d93e9d9e1e7dca07379fdb19dfa)

   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

14. i think we ' re in agreement ? or by ' yep ' did you mean you would stop loving your mother for money reasons ?
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

   (ID: 34de9309a5c02867b676757fa019c58a66bad300)

16. i can truly relate to the part where one day you love everyone and the next it all switched up . sometimes i think i have some form of narcissism . how did you find out about it ?
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

17. i was not . my parents were presbyterian on paper , and i think at least my mother did does ? believe . i was taught almost nothing of religion , and only have the vaguest of memories of ever going to church . i think we went a handful of times when i was very young . maybe that ' s what allowed me to gloss over the religious context when i read the books as a kid .

18. in the long run , constant complaining may cost you more than you think . heyooooo . see what i did there ?
   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

19. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)
