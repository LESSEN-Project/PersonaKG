14. used to love watching epic rap battles . i don ' t even really know what i ' m looking for . i just know there ' s a lot of channels out there that don ' t get much exposure but have epic content . that ' s kinda what i ' m looking for .
   (ID: 52a73bb08e8d0c340dad3146d5a3b7b25137dfae)

16. the main flaw i see with many answers is threefold . negotiating will be difficult when you don  t know the language . even shakespearean english could be a rough adjustment . depending on whom you are negotiating with , they may just take it . and , if you bring back something that appears too shocking , threatening or evil , you might meet your maker rather quickly .

17. honestly , i don ' t know . i ' m agnostic myself so i believe that there ' s just no way we can be sure of anything one way or the other . i wish i could suspend my sense of reality enough to fully believe in a heaven . i would seriously love to just know for sure i was going to see my grandma again one day .

18. i always have to drag the toolbastart menu thing over to the right side of my screen . i don ' t know why or when i started doing it , but having everything at the bottom just feels wrong .
   (ID: f0d30d31e879077978622dde48ddd9e0f254b33d)

19. i don ' t know really , however . i hope something happens , the thought of everything just ending is kind of depressing

20. i mean if it ' s installed properly it should be in there pretty well but if you pulled any out i would have it looked at just to be safe . you really don ' t know how well it was installed
