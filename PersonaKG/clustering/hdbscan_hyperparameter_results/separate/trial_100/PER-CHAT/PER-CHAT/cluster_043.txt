   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

2. i had philophobia . i don ' t know if i still have it . it ' s basically the fear of love . i have it because of my parents . i had to watch them constantly argue . their sick relationship and the fact that they hardly ever showed any signs they loved me , caused some brain damage to me and now i usually can ' t listen when somebody is talking about love , especially very traditional love . i hate family as a unit and i hope i will never have children . also i find newborn babies disgusting because they are kinda a " a fruit of love " .

5. that makes your opinion even more ignorant than it already was . or maybe your definition of abuse is different from mine . or maybe the abuse you suffered was insignificant . you obviously don ' t know what you ' re talking about becuase no woman who does would say any of the things you said here . nothing about this is funny . how dare you go online and perpetuate the idea to even one other woman that she could possibly deserve to be abused ? shame on you .
