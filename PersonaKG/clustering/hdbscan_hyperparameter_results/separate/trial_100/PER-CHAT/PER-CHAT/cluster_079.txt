1. yup , i think this is the reason and actually this was the first reason i wanted to meet her . i didnt intended in first place to " date " her . but now i kinda like her " but you are right . let ' s see what happens .
   (ID: 9425493e0ea7469367495f8e5947330e536cafa9)

2. true , but to me , i think it seems like a question they should be answering rather than asking . that ' s why i ask several questions about working conditions and technologies used , etc .

3. i think we can all admit we have no idea what is going to happen , but all the theorizing makes it fun to watch . i like the idea of gabriel , though .

4. i constantly try and constantly fail to explain the meaning of " arrombado " to non  brazilians . the closest meaning i can think of is " what you would call someone who drives one of those trucks with testicles hanging , changes lanes without signaling , almost hits you and acts like you are the wrong one .

5. it  s more like you return to home . i think it  s a pun on peter being a kid like spider man get back home ! or the chancla !

7. i like that . i think the origin of " god bless you " was the belief that when you sneeze some of your soul escapes .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

8. hopefully given a break . like , a few lifetimes waived or something . i think about this often .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

9. i like the way you think
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

10. guys his past posts are all like this , i think he is a creep
   (ID: d34dab0dded997c6aa6e6d2792ea9d8a26881a2b)

11. " dear death rows of reddit , what was your last meal ? " i think the question was like that
   (ID: 4b127841179d58078b4fbc1377158cb136f3156f)

12. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

13. again . it ' s unlikely you ' ll ever like the way it sounds , because it ' s not what you ' re used to hearing of your voice . but others may like it more than you think .
   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

14. " hey mike , you ever think that shock therapy stuff could work on an incestuous fuck like me ? fire it up ! "
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

15. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

16. do girls think of boys the way we think of them ? like if a girl hears someone on reddit is boy checks for photo posts or tried to imagine  what they look like .
   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

17. i think a lot of this comes down to the definitions of coercion and seduction . yes , in seduction the idea is to do your best to be enticing to someone . however , this should not be confused with a bending of their will or a manipulation . coercion is doing whatever is necessary to achieve a desired response from someone else , including putting extra pressures on them , which can be easily done if the coercing party is in a position of power , whether that is physical strength , employment , or status . seduction is like giving someone all green lights , coercion is like trying to take the steering wheel .

18. watch it again . its after he turns and runs . listen to them talk about it , as well . not even close . and if he had called it and thats what caused kozma to break off , why do him and holiday look at each other like a couple of bumbling idiots immediately after ? regardless of how you think of that particular call , instant replay would be of huge benefit to all teams in the mlb .

19. i think it ' s more like when you go to pick up your kid from school but you forgot his name .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

20. yeah true living in the moment sounds like it would do the trick since i think my issue is that i worry about the future . thank you
