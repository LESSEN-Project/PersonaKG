1. i still think it ' s pretty impressive for how long they survived considering that basically every single brit was hunting them down . the bismarck wasn ' t only about sea superiority , but it was also a psychological weapon . the big bad wolf , the bogeyman under europe ' s bed . i know it ' s easy to lose a ship at sea but it still amazes me .

8. all depends on your background and motives . empathy of someone is a must . for me , as a nice guy trust me please . you need this one thing , secret tip . you need to process that every person , even at worse has had a different situation to you in the past and you do not know where , or how they became who they are . you look at yourself , and your traits and be thankful , postives overcome negatives if you think that .

10. i think you misunderstood what i meant , i meant that gbay knows what every other veteran player already knows . so he knows what to tell us , because he is a veteran player he knows what we know . for example this , most veteran players already know these things , but because gbay is a veteran player he knows what information will be new to us . sorry , the way i worded this isn ' t the best .
