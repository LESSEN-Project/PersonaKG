2. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !

5. wicked is definitely not bad is just that i hate gold , if they could at least have changed the sigil to another colour , i would definitely buy it . but so far i will just wait for a good leblanc skin to come .

6. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !

10. i should of known that the prices for these pokemon ones were too good to be true . they are quite hard to get hold of here in the uk , so fraudsters have filled the gap in the market by flogging these fake ones . ebay will be on your side to and help you and get you a refund if you receive a fake , it is just a lot of hassle that is probably best avoided !

11. good explanation , thanks . i agree . manhood can  t be measured , as that plays into the concept toxic masculinity . then the belief of manhood being measured should instead be just considered how macho someone is ? not in a negative sense for example , if you see a strong , burly man with a beard and place him next to george constanza , considered the former with higher manhood is wrong , but instead maybe more macho  stereotypically masculine characteristics ?

12. if you send me pc vods i can still analyze them and give you coaching tips or just discuss strategy via discord , but i cant join games on pc . good luck finding a coach though !

13. i mean technically i use my hands for most of my day to day . so once i get my dick beaters on them id probs just choke em real good .
   (ID: d78765bdf49a3df577dd2523ce864393d4d0d2c9)

14. not sure what you meant by that ? i was just letting you dig your hole of assumptions until you finally called me a carnivore . felt good to throw that one back in your face .
   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

15. you can ' t just ignore the good that ' s happening .

16. my friend got back together with her toxic ex this weekend . it was good for me because he has someone else to talk to than just me .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

17. thanks ! and yes i was talking about the night vision . since now i  m assuming the night vision won  t give any real details in the character all you need to do is just a fix up and you are good to go . but i  m just a casual gamer who is giving a really , uninformed opinion . again good luck to you !

18. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .

19. i wish you could meet my cat , buuuut . learn more about them and what their body language means . understanding them helps a lot . and just keep an open mind over all , good luck !
