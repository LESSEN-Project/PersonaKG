1. " why did i just type this incoherent bullshit , and why can ' t i stop myself from posting it "
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

2. in the previous version of the app , if i clicked on a response in my inbox , it took me directly to that responsibility and showed the parent and grandparent comment . it did this regardless of whether or not the comment itself was hidden due to being nested too far . now if the comment is hidden it just takes me to the thread and it only highlights the comment if i open every hidden comment until i find it . edit  after further investigation i have found that i can no longer view the " community information " aka sidebar . this is an issue that needs dealt with because otherwise mobile users will have to rely on pinned posts to see the rules of the sub

4. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .

5. i just did a research paper in this . when you accept their terms of service , you agree to let them track other activity on the wifi source . at one point while facebook was active , you probably got a text or call allowing facebook to see your number and it  s activity while on the wifi

7. me and my friend did this , only problem was his clutch was totally different , i ' m used to hitting the friction point after barely releasing mine . his is almost all the way out . we swapped the light turned green , he stalled out a dozen times . i just dumbly sat there slowly inching the clutch out .

11. well here is where you went wrong . you jumped into water with sharks ! what else did you expect ? these arent dogs , cats , or any other animal human have domesticated . this shouldn ' t be news , just a reminder if you take a risk expect to get bit .

12. did anyone else read in their head the way i just did ?
   (ID: 7c7d6a809e77ab08fc65ee63a1ab44c11bd6ab7f)

13. i was once dog sitting at a neighbors house the dog is the nicest and most affectionate black lab ever and i made the mistake of sitting in a lawn chair next to the very edge of the porch . the big sweety climbed up into my chair , wanting pets , and before i could get off the chair i was falling . i actually did a back flip in the process and thankfully landed without injury . as i got up the dog was just sitting there , making sure i was okay .

14. this is enlightened . complaining is not the same as soliciting advice . so often a child ' s minor complaint about something gets a response telling them what they did wrong , just making the kid feel bad .

15. it isn  t . it is just showing the influx of marvel meme formats on this sub the past few days . did you see the above comment ? i chose a dc template because it  s ironic .
   (ID: 7424e4821daf78f7a38983c3e1a291ee7ce757d2)

   (ID: a4eb94a9fe8ebabb780c319cc7d3f552eb79625e)

18. those " weird looks " are just how wizards look at each other , jackass , which you would have known if you were a real wizard ! the important science question here is how did a fake wizard ever end up with a real princess ?
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

19. did this repeat or something or did you really just happen to be there ?
   (ID: 93133d3335d1543505dad3ffd44a8411e6be2ea9)

20. yeah but why tf did you decide to post this on here . i support the lgbtq community but jeez man , chill out and talk about that stuff someone else . it  s just a meme
