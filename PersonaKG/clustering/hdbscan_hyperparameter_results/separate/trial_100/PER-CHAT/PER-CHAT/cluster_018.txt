5. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !
