12. the lyrics are literally " this one ' s a contradiction because of how happy it sounds , but the lyrics are so down " i don ' t think it counts , it ' s too obvious . some other twenty one pilots songs would probably fit better .

   (ID: 274e8da1cefa1c3c6583ca4fb0ca85be567cde0e)

18. then i guess it ' s not gonna happen at all which is okay too . don ' t ruin your work environment . those are some bridges that shouldn ' t be burned . you can control your emotions . only you chose what you think and feel for a person .

19. " don ' t be afraid to be truly bored or alone with your thoughts . " i can ' t remember the situation , but the general idea was to not be afraid of having nothing to do . your mind can create some interesting ideas , given the opportunity . boredom can be a gateway to discovering yourself or a new creative outlet you can use to express yourself . the counter to that tends to be that your mind can also create some rather worrying ideas too , but i don ' t think that was really the goal of the idea .
   (ID: 42817db6a2880fe4df5d65636e25385c67c89bb1)

20. i don ' t think that i ' m above anyone or feel that others are less than me . i ' m not desperate , miserable , or ugly inside . whether i ' m with someone or not i will be happy no matter what , thank you .
