1. it ' s always a thought . like  what would happen ? what would people think ?
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

2. do you have any proof for who is bot ? you people keep saying that reddit is full of russian trolla and bots , yet you dont shoe any proof whatsoever . i think the collusion story has really left a mark on some people to the point of that they see russians and collusion everywhere
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

3. i wanna day superspeed but the toggle part makes me think you mean i  ll be super fast at all times and can  t move normally to interact with people anymore
   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

4. wth ? you are given that much power , and all you can think of is how to cause trouble ? what the hell is wrong with you ? use it for something that helps people , dammit . save some people . deliver medicine somewhere . bring a long lost relative to his dying grandfather . something , anything , that doesn ' t prove you are an immature prick .

5. oh okay , yeah i can see what you mean there but i think that there are more people then me that post stuff like this on here anyway . you never answered what makes me an attention seeking whore from this ?
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

6. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

7. agreed , i think this list shows how far reddit has its head up its ass . people joke about the hivemind but this list really shows it
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

8. i agree . do you think it ' s white people ' s fault that the number of black people in these fields is so small , like a lot of people think ?
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

9. sometimes i gather up a bunch of binders and folders and walk quickly around the office building with a worried expression on my face to make people think i ' m working hard
   (ID: 4f65e5402391c052d2d3e7a2a4d73b01ea1db203)

10. i also got a message from what i think is the same guy . the dude is probably on this sub , looking for people to harass . what a sad human being .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

11. there ' s someone for everyone  they ' re out they ' re waiting you and all other shitty variations to give people false hope . to me it ' s better to think " if it happens , it happens "
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

12. it honestly not that . i think it  s smugness coming from people who think they are more important than they are .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

13. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

14. but i ' m sure you can win people over . i ' m not a politician , i couldn ' t care even less what other people think , nor do i have such responsibility to do so . what ' s best isn ' t the same thing as what most people think .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

15. that most people seem to think the mandela effect is just misremembering the spelling of a word . not the bearstain bears thing i have no clue how to spell it as i never heard of it in the uk but like , people think dilemma " used to be " spelled dilemna and it ' s like . no , no it didn ' t
   (ID: 0c9ff5f9405b3c55ee8cd256b4c912a160643255)

16. i used to work as a gas agent , until medical meant i couldn ' t do it any more . one of the major aspects of my job was delivering 45kg bottles . this is less dangerous than most people think it is . i can even surmise , that the reason they are doing this , is that there is not enough pressure in the gas bottle for it to run . there are two ways to add pressure . direct heat . or compressed air . direct heat is the less likely to kill you option of those two . the real question is whether they have the taps open or not . if they dont , the pressure release valve will pop and then that gas will ignite and basically create a flamethrower .
   (ID: 8360c6d04ba11da7a727532482d78505e52a4150)

17. i think it ' s perfectly fine to call people out on their shitty spelling and grammar . now everyone knows what our opinions are . hooray !
   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

18. i didnt think other people would ask this ok thx
   (ID: 9542ea25b7618ef5330eb37b68c90158a5a6d387)

19. being happy and being usefull for other people . for me if you think you shouldn ' t be happy you are living wrong and if you think it ' s fine being a useless piece of shit you are living wrong as well .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

20. no . okay , think about it like this  people are made up of atoms , and when you die your atoms go off and become other things . this means that every girl would most likely be made up of atoms that were once in a dude , so if you bang her you are technically banging a dude , and that ' s fucking gay .
