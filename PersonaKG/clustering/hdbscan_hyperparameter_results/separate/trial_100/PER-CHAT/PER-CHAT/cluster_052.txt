1. religious bigotry is why people like you don ' t get respect . you offer nothing but hate
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

2. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .

3. i don  t get the hate . i hang out on video gaming board . it  s just people wanting to have fun like me and you

4. it ' s your choice , and everyone has their reasons . i sometimes feel like people who don ' t drink can be a little judgmental of people who do , but i grew up around baptists so maybe thats why .

5. some dogs don  t like people with hats on . might just be something they aren  t used to . or a bad experience .

6. why are you asking this ? like other people said there ' s nothing wrong with it , they don ' t hurt anyone for me as long as they don ' t convince others to be gay i ' m ok with it , they ' re humans just like you and me

7. um , no the odds of him having a child are the odds of anyone else having a child . you either do or you don  t . and he could use a surrogate like plenty of straight people do too .

8. i have to ask you why you don ' t look this up yourself ? you have to be on the internet to type and submit your comment so why not just do a quick google search ? one of the biggest problems in this country is that a lot of people do not research anything themselves . they simply wait for someone to present information to them . when they don ' t like the information they hear , even if it is true , they dismiss it and when they hear information they do like they accept it even if it is false . it ' s absolutely ridiculous how easily manipulated people can be .

9. i absolutely hate the threads that are deep  seated in woman hating . yet these people cry and moan about not having friends or a life outside of reddit . gee , i wonder why ? maybe if half the people on reddit stopped whining , stopped giving into the hivemind and show girls some respect . maybe , juuuuust maybe , she will like you . also , reddit is not a reliable source of dating advice ! when a single woman goes on a date with you , all your karma points don ' t mean shit . show her you ' re not an asshat and she ' ll like you .

10. well , as harsh as it might sound , there might be people in your life who have slept with everyone but you and they still don ' t owe it to you to sleep with you . that said , i guess it ' s one ' s own choice whether one wants to hang around with a person like that , not out of spite , but out of being annoyed by being regaled with all the fine details which might be tmi .

11. i get why some people don ' t like the casting choices but why not give them a chance and at least watch some of their performances which by the way i can ' t find much for anya
   (ID: a5976f282a96c036f5e4d14957305323c9a5776d)

12. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .

13. couldn  t agree with you more . yes it wasn  t a perfect remake but it was pretty damn close in my books . if people don  t like remakes , i get that . but i can  t understand why people on reddit hate on this movie otherwise . i  m not sure what people who didn  t like it would have changed . the video said jungle book was better ? how ? they were almost the same in turns of animation . i liked it . my friends liked it . like you said the original will always be number one in my heart . but this was a damn fine movie in its own right .
   (ID: bd951a475ac46323d867ac35ccf0cb4b3e756f83)

14. this is not entirely true . it is in my case . but for the majority of people , they decide to screw around for fun and suddenly become addicted . i don ' t even have an addictive personality , i just like how drugs feel .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

15. don ' t complain to the people in the same situation as you , and don ' t complain to your subordinates . if you have an issue , take it higher and work towards resolving it . sitting around talking to your coworkers about how much your job sucks just makes you look like a whiney , entitled prick
