7. it is not the same because as white people we have not been the victim of systematic oppression and fetishism and our worldview does not allow us to understand the experiences of people of colour because we are in a privileged position where we have not dealt with the obstacles faced by poc , so who are we to invalidate what this girl has to say ?

11. well i seem to be somewhat unique in that i can ' t honestly say i relate to any of them , at least certainty not on the level of a lot of other people on this sub . i am very lucky to have never personally experienced any of the problems portrayed in the game . that said i do definitely sympathize with them quite a lot . i ' d say i sympathize the most with sayori probably because my sister suffers from depression , followed by natsuki . then yuri , then monika . i love natsuki the most though .
