1. you think that , and its not easy ofc , but its really just a case of finding someone like you . my husband and i can do ' nothing ' all day . even a week if he ' s off work .

2. look up " romantic bpd relationships . not saying this is what she has , and not trying to shame anyone with this diagnosis . i just think this may give you some insight and useful strategies you seem like a lovely , thoughtful person

3. coincidentally just finished my latest rewatch last night before bed and this post made me chuckle . creed ' s appearances in the last few episodes , and the grass roots story , is pretty funny . i like to think that creed , out of all of the characters that use their real names , is most like himself in real life .

4. those kind of games have that " feature " but it ' s not what i meant . i think i just made some term up in my dreams or something like that . thanks for the answer though

5. oh boy , i do have a lot of ridiculous stories according to reddit . i didn ' t think i had really interesting or unbelievable stories but it seems like redditors just do nothing all day every day .

6. it could do although it isn ' t very likely i just can ' t really think of anything else that would click like that and freeze a pc

7. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

8. it just adds to the badass effect , i like to think of it as having my gun out passively but always ready for shit to hit the fan .

9. i agree with you for the most part , but some of the halloween items , like the templar ' s spirit for the medic and the squid ' s lid for the demo actually look pretty cool . i think they should just do away with the restriction .

10. timing when to buy a home is difficult since it will obviously be a long term investment . i think you should gauge where you are living to determine if you have confidence in your city and county first . if you do then go out and buy a home that you like and can afford at the best possible price for you . trying to timing the market for a home is just not worth it .

11. i like to think burps are just your mouth farting

12. " you can just speak plain language to yourself " if you speak words in your head , like think whole sentences , you can change your mindset .

13. i watch porn videos where they act like they love you gf roleplays . it ' s just an act but it warms my heart when they talk to me . i always think " that ' s how it feels when someone loves you .   x200b  it ' s pretty hot too

14. i  m a ftm , and the first bit of your comment sounded just like me lol . i have everything planned to a t . i read somewhere about ftms being more likely to get induced so for some reason in my head , me giving labor always starts with me being induced . i think i do this because if it  s induced it  ll be planned and i have a weird obsession with planning everything lol . reading this really made me stop and think it might not go how i plan for it to go , which is scary .

15. this guy is like herpes . just when you think it ' s gone it shows up again with a vengance to irritate the holy shit out of you .

17. off topic about this picture but on topic about the bikes do these bikes have better baskets ? like are the holes on the side of the basket huge because the baskets are useless if you wanna keep your phone or anything in there because they will just slide out . like today i used one in miramar and i had a can of iron bru import from scotland i think and it slid out the side of the basket and pierced a hole in the side causing it to squirt out this is one of the older bikes

18. alright kid if you think you can just insult alabama like that you got another thing coming
   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

19. i see where you ' re coming from . it makes sense . i just think that when ai starts to become more effective in it ' s uses we will move on to another thing . i like to use maslow ' s hierarchy of needs as a sort of comparison . once you fulfill your needs and for food and water you move to relationships and love . i think we ' ll just move to the next level of the pyramid

20. social studies . i can ' t stand sjw ' s that think everything is your fault just because you ' re a straight white middle class male . not everyone is like that , but there are enough to seriously rustle my jimmies .
