8. exactly , you ' re not here to entertain me , but this post was meant to entertain whether or not it ' s for easy karma is a different matter . this is the first time i saw this , and judging from all the up doots , i ' d say i ' m not the only one . nothing is original because someone is always going to say it first , all that matters is how and when you do it .

9. i was an idiotic teenager who would chase after guys that didn  t give two shits about me . the whole time i was oblivious to my best friends massive crush on me . that boy was there for me through all of my problems and it  s safe to say that he  d give me the world if he could .

12. go and be supportive . say nothing that would be upsetting to them . that ' s what friends do . a funeral is not the time or place for you to express your views . it ' s not about you in the least .
