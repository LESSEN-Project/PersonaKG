1. i like seeing other people progress , and its inspiring to some people . no hate towards you op , but please realise that not everyone thinks like you and just because you dont like it , doesnt mean everyone doesnt like it . thinking like this is how you get toxic people who shame anyone different not accusing you of this tho

2. he could be , and i can see where you are coming from . or he could just be a lonely old man who wants to be friendly and you ' re the only one who ' s actually engaged him in conversation when he ' s tried . maybe he sits alone in front of the tv by himself every night , hoping his kids will call and they never do . eats lunch alone because he doesn ' t get along with the other professors , etc . maybe you ' re like the one person who has been actually friendly and not just professional with him and he looks forward to it each day , which leads him to go a little overboard . like a stay at home parent who talks nonstop the minute another adult is around not being there to see his interactions with other people , it ' s hard to tell . i like to give people the benefit of the doubt .

3. i totally agree with you . but there comes a point where people like me who like trump or just getting so f   pissed off that we ' re going to do anything and everything we can to get him re  elected no matter what .

6. yeah that  s true , not as many people are getting third party tests for sarms like they do for gear . i just wish we had some sort of better system

7. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !

8. okay , so you  re asking for yourself ? sorry , i assumed you , like most people , were just curious . the biggest thing i had was to use my intellect instead of how i felt . i felt like shit and wanted to die , but i knew in my head i wasn  t and people loved me , i was also just curious , and i can  t find out what happens next if i  m dead . as for life itself being meaningless , so what ? just because no one will remember you in a hundred years doesn  t mean you  re pointless right now , you can have a very real impact on a lot of people in a lot of ways . when i felt like i didn  t matter because humans are expendable , i just had to realise that we are , but not to each other .

9. someone called me some bad stuff and admitted that the intent was to harm me . took me almost a year to figure out that bad people just exist and can fit in with society like everyone else .
   (ID: c9b1e924c86788c982ec59df3d5704354a2a4ae1)

10. guess my point is , there ' s always a lot of hate towards white people and slurs , but it ' s kinda just shrugged off like nothing . it ' s like most see it as okay .
   (ID: 65b64663fe8890c471866a25cf075ff50d852dbf)

11. this is one of those people new to tf2 who thought they would like to share a video with u , so lower those pitchforks , or just a kid who wants karma , in that case , shower him in downvotes
   (ID: 5a485308ca6e36eb17d7b0fc321fcf7695f3af53)

12. does foster actually exist ? i always thought it was just a joke we were playing on americans . kind of like asians selling feng shui to white people
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

13. its negative because the people who feel like they are treated unequally would end up wanting to be treated better than equal . its just like the some of the lgbtq people who call themselves a million different genders . it makes no sense , and it ' s just unreasonable .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

14. people like that never seem to realise how unoriginal and unfunny their jokes are . it ' s just painful to watch at this stage .
   (ID: f114f40c03e5812464be61882b264a0abe2a545e)

15. the guy is just bad at grammar and making coherent sentences , yet some people still believe that he will actually go and admit things like that to public .
