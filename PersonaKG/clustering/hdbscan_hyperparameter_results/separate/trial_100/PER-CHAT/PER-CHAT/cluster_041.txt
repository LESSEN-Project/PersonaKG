3. thanks for the links ! i will give it a good look .  157k is less than 773k or 249k digit your sample size is not exhaustive anyway . this is google scholar buddy . digit 157k mentions are a lot of mentions . you can also go for a more qualitative approach , and enter a library ' s medieval section . tell me what you find ! digit whoever mentions " byzantium " likely mentions " ere " too , for example . these numbers are interwoven .  you consider it to be popular it is , though you don ' t seem to know much about the subject matter to be so surprised with term . unless you don ' t speak english as your first language ? i know that in my mother languante we don ' t commonly " byzantium " nor " byzantine " . but in english it ' s commonplace . you know what , maybe you should go to askhistorians after all .
