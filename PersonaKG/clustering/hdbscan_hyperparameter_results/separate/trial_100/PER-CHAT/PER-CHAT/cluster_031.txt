6. i think maybe he ' s referring to the fact that in the rpg rules , sponsored magic is something you choose whether or not to use , and you take debt every time you do . in the novels , pretty much all of harry ' s spells were enhanced with hellfire involuntarily the whole time lash was in his head .

11. i wouldn ' t worry . even if something came back on you , it would come down to the prosecutor . does he think he could prosecute you in a charge , and would it be worth it ? it would be pretty easy to convince him that a jury would let you off all day long . guilt or innocence means very little at times . you wouldn ' t be worth their time . no offense .

12. maybe think more about how you title your posts next time . your title was misleading whether you think so or not

17. well it ' s about time this happened . it ' s probably going to push rents up but it needs to be done , australia ' s housing market is out of control , needs to burst already . honestly what idiot gets an interest only home loan in the first place ? dickheads who watch too may " flip a house " shows . think they can do that too then realise how expensive tradies are ? haha . fuck em . let them fall !

18. hero labs has all of the encounters pre built for 25ish dollars i think . it really save a lot of time in prep . roll20 has all the maps , lightning , characters ect . i didn ' t use the product , but if i were to do it again i would use this .
   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

19. i didn ' t get the hype as well . i simply think because we both expected to be hyped , we expected something extraordinary . whereas if we had no expectations going into the episode for the first time , it might have been profound .   x200b  i hope this made sense
