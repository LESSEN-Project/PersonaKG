1. you don ' t . you just think you do .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

2. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids

3. for me a coincidence is the just that . a coincidence . i personally don ' t think they mean anything although they can be kinda neat .

4. there is the other side to this . which is there used to be no other problems but the db is such a big problem that they don ' t think about the rest of it . when your so says , i love you i am sure your automatic response is , i love you too . but do you , have you actually thought about it or are you just saying it out of habit .

5. homosexuals are still able to pass along their genes , just not in the ' traditional ' sense . i think it was , but i don ' t think it is any more .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

6. it ' s clear that azan is her priority . i don ' t think you ' re too uptight . nickle is a horrible excuse for a mother . i mean she has her daughter calling azan " daddy " , and that ' s just the start of all her issues . i ' m sure nickle loves may , but she neglects her and uses her as a bargaining chip , and i won ' t even start with the " daddy " thing . smh .

7. i guess i just don ' t see where this is going ? i don ' t think a single person has agreed with you . maybe you should try it and post your results .
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

8. and if that small chance does happen . what are you going to do without a way to get help ? get yourself out ? what if you were just hiking in the forest and you find yourself lost , without a way home ? i don  t think the ability to pay taxes will help in that situation , imo .
   (ID: 93c3b3d523de0afd404d3bcb4acdf023866f9281)

9. yes it would be , he already feels lonely for not having a girlfriend . what do you think his friends leaving will do to him ? you might just push him to complete loneliness and sadness . i too have never had a girlfriend and my friends are my emotional support so i feel him . he needs you guys please don ' t leave

10. maybe it ' s just because i have a bad sense of smell due to allergies and other stuff , but from experience i think the tournament smelle memes are a lot more joke than truth . any group of human beings being together for several hours will have a smell . but it isn ' t that bad or anything . i think how bad it is at tournaments is quite overblown . then again i don ' t think gyms smell that bad either . it ' s just not something that bothers me i guess .

11. the game is too big to die . with all those mods , you can even play just terraria for your entire life . maybe the hype might die and player base will be lower but i don  t think it will die .
   (ID: a0849f7d6d0829c8bb5f820aa9bf63584c7471df)

12. i don  t think they are ugly , i just think it  s interesting to see something marked on someone and think what was the motive behind the tattoo and what  s the story .
   (ID: c5e877ff3be5d3571f5fe899f55887a6f608ee98)

13. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

14. how are you expected to play knowing that you got traded ? i don  t think it has to do with deliberately underperforming and more to do with just being generally out of it .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

15. not sure if you ' re being sarcastic or not , but it was just a question . i searched around and couldn ' t find much except what has already been mentioned . i figured i would ask the reddit community for their input . also i play on console , i don ' t think there are too many hacks out there to increase my magicka , but thank you for your suggestion .

16. i understand . i  m just not much of a lebron fan , so it  s hard for me . also don  t think he  s even close to the goat . best of this era ? sure .
   (ID: f90b0d899acf3c82adaa55fb250d0c7ea9eaeaf3)

17. losing partial  full control of myself is a scary concept that i don  t think is just limited to me . you do you tho
   (ID: 8ea8e4a00c3f2a64096e00bdbba0247e580cdb17)

18. so just because you disagree with it , you think it should be okay to censor it ? don ' t you see how slippery of a slope this is ?
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)

19. i don ' t think others are wrong , per se , mine just works for me . the whole " faith " thing .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

20. not a jab at you op . i just don  t think it  s a fat shaming movie . more anti  costco  amazon  lazy  consumerism  idiocracy
