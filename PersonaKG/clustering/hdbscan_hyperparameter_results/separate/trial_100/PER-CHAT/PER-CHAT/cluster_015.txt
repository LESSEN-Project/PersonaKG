1. you  ll go through about an hour or so of practicing the moves on the ground with the guys who will be strapped on to you , they never once talked about what to do if you wanted to back out , so the thought was never in your mind . when you get up in the plane , they  ll talk you through it while you reach altitude . when you reach altitude , you don  t have much time before they pretty much throw you out of the airplane . it was fun , i was excited to do it so i was never scared of it .

6. yeah it ' s annoying but over time it does get better . it will always be there but you get used to it . i don ' t worry about it much nowadays . if i ever get a flare up or more pain than usual i do the exercises over a week or two and it settles down again .

7. on desktop all right let me rotate my screen to see the biggest conspiracy of all time that doesn ' t give anything to anyone and costs billions of dollars but fits my absolutely crazy worldview in which government is incompetent enough to leave major flaws in their models which don ' t exist if you look closely but i looked from far enough to see them !
   (ID: e6e1db90a47dca83004beacbcc9004bec464c7d0)

8. if i have to go someplace new for some sort of obligation , i don ' t mind a long  ish drive . it gives me time to get mentally ready .

10. that  s because they  re in a different part of the world with their own war going on . they don  t have time to worry about northern gossip .

11. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .

12. let him sit and watch tv all day . ask him what he likes . tell him stories about the two of you and your favorite show  time together . listen to any of his stories , even if they are ridiculous . don ' t expect anything from him , so when he does remember it will be a gift . rotate caregivers frequently to avoid burnout . check out local care facilities , cost , and requirements . join a support group .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

13. yes that is very true . you are all cypriots , this side or that side . i ' m sure you guys are going to reunify at some point in time . thank you so much for offering to help me ! you don ' t have to if you can ' t i completely undestand and i appreciate it a lot . it ' s emu or dau .

14. apprenticeships ! you can work and get a degree at the same time . you do it with a company , you get a reduced salary , but it means you don ' t have to pay anything , and you get experience in the workplace . you do come out of it with a degree in whatever field your apprenticeship was in

15. the reason the different categories exist is because some pets they don ' t have the time or interest in making the necessary animations for them to overrides , every pet that they don ' t make the animations for become followers instead . i do wish they ' d stop releasing new pets as followers because they ' re universally ignored if they can ' t be used for overrides , but hey they ' re a lot cheaper to produce and pad out the content so jagex likes them .

16. try to waste their time as much as possible by pretending you don ' t understand what they are talking  asking about
   (ID: f4f004d4cf95fb0021d8bdc10767d5f3e74d3bc9)

17. my mom says ,  it  s because you  re on that game all the time .  while that  s partially a factor , i  m on the game so i don  t go into mental breakdowns every night
