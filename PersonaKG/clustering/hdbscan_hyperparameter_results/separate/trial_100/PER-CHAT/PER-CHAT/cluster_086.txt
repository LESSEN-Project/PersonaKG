   (ID: a8b3c82ca36eb4e48fd6b6674a642f96d401743e)

12. yes , this piece of you missing sounds like the social part you reserved for people who do not accept you . i am sorry to hear that but no you can seek out new social ties from people who accept you for who you are . i can  t promise it will be easy and you may always miss what you have lost but it will get better if you remain open to new relationships .

14. controversial . it all comes down to your reasons for not being attracted to those people . if it  s an overt , i won  t date her because she  s black , yea that  s rooted in racism . but if your physiology doesn  t attract you to that person then you  re fine . you shouldn  t be forced to be attracted to someone who doesn  t  do it for you .  like i couldn  t get an erection over a trans individual . is it because i hate them ? of course not . they deserve love and acceptance like everyone else on the planet . but the thought of a penis being there or ever hanging been there doesn  t turn me on .
