5. we won ' t know till we try . sending people into space in glorified soda cans is probably not the smartest idea we have ever had but it gets the job done .

7. people with no moral code , even mobsters and drug dealers have morals . but the sick fuck that would torture , rape , then murder people , you know the ones without a code , those are the worst type of people .
   (ID: 05338cf139796c93d123a19ed732a1222e642034)

8. true but are people really going to frequently check for the miniscule chance of someone you know being there ?
   (ID: 9d412b0236e1db384766edb9df245de053d643ad)

   (ID: 5173a1d5475490650d7365b2c2b2f2c579d33099)

13. all of those statements are wildly different from taking children to a circus . i ' m not condoning what happens to animals at circuses , but a kitten slaughterhouse is not something that was organized and operated for the entertainment of the common people . i know that you probably feel strongly about this , but you ' re being ridiculous .
   (ID: 40e7e4fcc325e808f67616071f736d382e20795c)

14. one metric that can be fun is how many different generations know about them . if you ' re someone that is recognizable by young , middle age and old people then you ' re pretty fucking famous .
   (ID: 4bb0a21212688dbc67fe64d6f42fca297fed4f4f)

15. anything related to anime  waifus , it ' s fun to see what  who people dislike and what  who people will defend to the death . seriously though as a weeb i know how violent some can get online .
   (ID: 0ff3db030062a58f30958a7a7b74373cf4f7cbd6)

16. i find no distinction in gender here . if they were raised crap , they will be annoying little shits . if they were raised well , they will be fine people to know .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

17. i googled peekers advantage csgo on google , that video and that beginners guide were the only things that really suggeted peekers advantage . in a few other pages some casual people were discussing whether it was a thing . the only argument was latency and interp . there was nothing else . that youtuber whose video you shared only has 70k subscribers . he is not even famous or something . you clearly dont know csgo . there are waaay more famous and way better people . if you knew what you were talking about you would have given a more reliable source . there are numerous youtubers with hundreds of thousands of subscribers as well as many csgo pros . none of them i have watched ever mentioned peekers advantage . i havent even heard once in all those streams i have watched . i didnt even know the term before playing r6s , as a person who followed many of those youtubers and pros . sorry buddy . peekers advantage is a cancer of r6b . we dont have it in csgo . its only theoretical and practically inexistent with all those low latencies and high framerates . judging by the ratings of the comments in our conversation , this r6s community must be so pathetic . csgo is notoriously ct  sided , which means if you hold your angles properly , the defender wins most of the times . dont talk about things you have no idea about .

18. true , i know some people that had troubles with it so i thought might as well see if anyone on here needs it .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

19. 1m ? you know , there are rats with that much bounty in about every belt . you ' ll have to put a few zeros on it , to get people interested .
   (ID: 699195a280fce86200065786c40a00e3096406da)

20. why do so many people in this thread know what the difference between a tiger and an iv is ?
