1. you find one snippet from one link and then you just ignore the rest of it . fantastic tactic , the story of the brown m  ms applies here .  i ' m sure lots of people think you ' re a genius now . we know democrats don ' t , but they thought hillary would be an excellent president and caused trump to win instead so their judgment really isn ' t that accurate now , is it ?  saying that i ' m incapable of critical thought doesn ' t make it true . you ' re right . my saying something doesn ' t many anything true . it being true is what makes it true . i ' d suggest you read up on how the banks were literally forced to make bad loans but you wouldn ' t do it , and would reject it all anyway using a summary blurb written by an amateur on wikipedia with no way of confirming bias to dismiss it .  it must be frustrating to know that you can ' t pass the blame on someone else for something that occurred because republicans wanted to help the rich get richer at the expense of the less fortunate . you see , this is an absolute , bald  faced lie on your part . republicans well , banksters , many of whom lean left absolutely want to get richer  no question about that . but they didn ' t want to lend to sub  prime borrowers because . guess what ! those are bad investments and they wouldn ' t get richer off of them ! gosh ! who woulda thunk it ? they were refusing to lend money to those demographics and along came the left that ' s your side , you know and they said " even if you think these loans are bad ideas you have to write them . are you honest enough to at least admit this much ? or are you going to ignore history ?  why do you care so much about what michelle obama wears i don ' t . never even mentioned it . you are confused about something .  how much income she gets why do you care about how much income republicans get ? especially elected ones ?  because the way you ' re speaking about her , as a " girl " you ' re definitely confused . i think you can ' t tell the difference between mo and ocasio . hint , they are two separate people .  and talking about how she was " putting out for barry " , and how she " shacked up with potus . ocasio to the best of my knowledge did neither of those things .  michelle obama is an inspiring woman you only think that because she is the wife of the d ex  president .  i won ' t complain if it happens with melania trump . that vapid piece of eye candy ? i would complain . she ' s never had an intelligent thought in her life . she scored a rich guy who bought her way into picking handbags for a career  she ' ll never be anything more than that .

5. which is exactly why j . j . is trying desperately to change the dumpster fire that last jedi was . the reception from the fans was so positive that solo was boycotted by tons of people . that ' s why all you hear is how great the last jedi was and how the star wars properties plans and movie outlays were drastically altered due to the huge positive response to it . you guys liked it sure but the idea that a small minority did not like it is ludicrous . the facts show that it damaged the whole series .

6. sounds like it wasn ' t actually a real problem . because if it were a real problem you should have informed someone of their ineptitude instead of wrote about it in your diary . if it was a real problem and you didn ' t address it thats even worse .

8. my humble opinion  if you are attracted to someone , then the person looks good . for you . and that all that counts . if that happens , go for it . and fuck the others .

9. motive always should be considered in a crime . if you killed someone because they raped your wife . , that ' s one kind of murder . if you killed someone to get your rocks off , that another more serious kind of murder . if you killed the president , that ' s treason . personally i think the people who killed matthew committed an even worse kind of murder . it took several of them to kill a poor defenseless gay guy . they tie him to a fence , beat him to death as he begged for his life , just to get a few bucks ? no . , because he was gay . what a bunch of cowards . hell will be too good a place for them .

11. for sure , it ' s always much easier said than done . it ' s the same for every person in the world that has an insecurity that can be seen by people . it ' s tough has hell , but trying to think " i ' ll never see that person again anyway " , really can help . as long as you have close friends and family who love and care for you , regardless of how you look or feel , that ' s all that really matters
