6. let me make it easier for you . the sku , and what you paid doesn  t matter . you bought an older model for  digit when that was a deal . with new prices on material and manufacturing methods , they can sell new ones for  digit . that  s including better updates parts . no one will give you  digit for yours . and i  m not here to shit all over your post . i  m here to inform you that if you really want to sell it , you  ll have to take more of a loss . i  m also here to make sure other people don  t over pay for things . and if someone pays  digit for this , they are over paying .
