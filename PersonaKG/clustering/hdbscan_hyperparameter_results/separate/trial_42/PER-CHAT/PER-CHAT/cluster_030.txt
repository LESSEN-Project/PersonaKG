5. so what if they actually don ' t like you ? does that make you worth any less as a person ? i don ' t think so . opinions are not real and this is why  if some stranger walked up to you and said  " you are such a shoelace " you ' d probably be indifferent and you wouldn ' t care that much because it just doesn ' t make sense , right ? so if you swap the word " shoelace " for " asshole " and you swap the word " stranger " with " friend " does that make any difference ? probably not because it ' s just a word . you are not obnoxious . somebody may think you are while somebody else thinks you ' re not . you may even be your own worst enemy because you call yourself obnoxious ! it ' s just in your head though , don ' t believe the demon that exists inside there solely to give you a hard time . it ' s not real .
