1. don ' t talk to that guy any more dating is hard
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

2. you  re so strong for making the decision you did though , just remember that . you  re worth so much more than the way he was treating you and you knew that  i hope you realise how amazing that is . so many people haven  t got as far as you have face  blowing  a  kiss

3. hey , i know there ' s a thousand other comments on here , but just wanted to say real quick that you didn ' t do anything wrong . dude sounds like a hassle to say the least , and anyone who is willing to flip on you and humiliate you online is not someone you should be wasting your time with . that ' s some immature , disrespectful , petty shit . it seems like you feel guilty to an extent , which i understand , but don ' t linger on the guilt . once it passes you ' ll realize you did yourself a favor by setting some standards of what you will and won ' t put up with . lots of people choose to stay unhappy in their relationships and that is an unhealthy way to live .

4. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path

5. this sounds like you need to talk to your so , you need to make it clear to him the way you feel and how you want to live your live .
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

6. you seem to have normalized his shitty behavior at this point . there is no reason why you should be working full time  still taking on the domestic role . if you weren ' t working , sure . but that ' s just so fucking ridiculous and selfish , " tradition " be damned . it sucks you have kids with this guy imo . i think you should leave him .
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

7. you sound like you are young with zero confidence . who gives a shit if he flips out . leaving him means you don  t have to deal with it . you really need to ask yourself why you love someone who treats you this way . if you really loved him , why are you posting for ways to make someone leave you ? it sounds like you don  t love him . you  re scared of him . you need to speak with a professional because a person who loves themselves don  t do things like this .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

8. most people have some form of guilt built up especially if it ' s a recent occurrence . if you raised the concerns and genuinely wanted to unfold the truth and try to fix things i can ' t see a reason he would continue the affair .   x200b  if you ' re that concerned once you ' re together , get him in a quiet space where you both have timesomething like a car and ask if you can take a look at his phone . straight up , no gimmicks , just say " may i go through your phone to make sure we ' re both on the same page . you should be able to tell right away if he has something to hide .   x200b  however , be careful because this could stir something up that wasn ' t there in the first place . this brings us back to the main point , that being straight forward is always better than snooping . no questions asked if i was dating a girl and she snooped through any of my personal effects the relationship would be done .
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

9. i mean you could just ask if he wants to hang out just the two of you , and if je suggests more friends to bring take it as a hint he doesn ' t like you like that .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

10. absolutely speak to your therapist . you trust them . they will help you . you need to get yourself out of that relationship for your safety , physical and psychological . this is not a one  off occurrence .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

11. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .
   (ID: 6f13975ce6a8747ec3d0e2207b9ef86d80a28713)

12. were you overreacting ? i feel like you didn  t react enough . if this shit was the other way around would he be cool with it ? the answer is hell no . so should you be alright with this ? hell nah . whatever feelings or reactions you have here , i say they are warranted and very much valid . i  m sorry this happened . at least you know what signs to pick up on next time some douche tries this bullshit .
   (ID: d28c94c02761dbceb7bd64e3288f28eeef3a75cf)

13. feels like a one side of the story . i could see how you weren ' t one that missed an opportunity to point out in the last digit . digit years to tell john he ' s a loser as often as he said you ' re a drone . i can ' t imagine someone would constantly harass you like that without anything coming back . but if he ' s truly the only " bad guy " in your stories , which i kinda doubt , then your reaction would be more justifiable . however , it was still incredibly childish and a dick move . just talk about the issue you have with him like an adult ffs . you guys are 27yo  is it so hard to talk about how you don ' t think it ' s productive to constantly harass each other ? what ' s the point ? and if he continues to be a child about then talk to your friends about it in a way  " look , i respect and want to support john in what he ' s doing and wish him all the success in the world  however he can ' t stop harassing me for what i am doing and is very insultive about my way of life  i don ' t see any other option than not interact with him anymore because he can ' t be an adult about the situation  then see what they have to say  might suggest . do that than rather making a fool out of yourself and completely escalate the situation in a childish way in front of your whole social circle .
   (ID: 93e9e943e9d5e6606a938961fd4d02312afb101b)

14. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

15. i  ve been in the same kind of situation , a couple of times . you did the right thing ignore him for a few weeks or even months until you feel like he  s learned from it . then unblock him and message him
   (ID: 0328413fb9fd5eff68cef63593bfc5537e85c2e8)

16. you should never give in to he demands of someone who asks you to choose your friends over him . i ' m sorry , but that is controlling , insecure behavior . you might " love " this guy but he ' s insecure and feels threatened by anyone who he doesn ' t directly control or have any influence over . think about that . do you really want to be with someone like that ? do you really love him that much ? what if this were your parents or your family who he objects to ? you seem like a nice person and if i were you i wouldn ' t give in to such egregious demands for anyone . you can do better . i hope that you do .
   (ID: ddd770a31dc9c8fa4ad153c94b4c0debc20cf026)

17. i don ' t really feel like he holds me back , but my life isn ' t the way i want it to be living with him . i ' m gonna say the same shit everyone else says , i do love him and i enjoy being with him . but lately it doesn ' t feel the same . he ' s a good person but i feel like i don ' t really like him anymore . maybe it ' s my mindset but i feel like we don ' t have fun or enjoy each other ' s company . but if i leave i know i ' ll miss him and be sad . i ' m not going to go jump on another guys dick .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

18. tell him and see his reaction . if he is such a great man that wants to be with you , he should have no problem sticking up for you and making sure his family understands that that behavior will cease . if he reacts in their defense and does nothing , you know it  s not worth pursuing . mommas boys are a serious no  no for me , good luck .
   (ID: f18b19a52bbf1505af84d01563a51626d4ae363f)

19. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

20. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart
