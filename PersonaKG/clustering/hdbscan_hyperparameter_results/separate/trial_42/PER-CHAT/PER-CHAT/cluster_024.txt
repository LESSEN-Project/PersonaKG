1. i can ' t really relate , i ' ve never had a guy do that , but dryness is never an issue for me , i ' ve only used lube with one person a couple of times and it wasn ' t very sexy .

2. unless your arm is as long as your leg or you can dislocate your should on command i don ' t think the thing you ' re attempting to do is possible . if you ' re feeling a barrier , you might still have some hymen left , but really , your vagina stretches . it can likely accommodate anything a dude has to offer . listen , there ' s no right way to finger yourself . the whole point is just to feel good and it sounds like you ' re freaking yourself out . either get a toy or wait until you have a person you trust enough to talk about this with and let them put their fingers up in you .

3. do you enjoy getting fingered or licked ? woman can do that , are you gay ? now that is a little atypical but assuming he likes to fuck you , he ' s not gay .

4. just take time talking with him . as a male , performance anxiety can certainly be tough . however , with the right support , it can be a great dynamic . tell him and show him that finishing early one of the main fears is perfectly normal and will take practice to control . nobody is born to be a pornstar in terms of performance right away ! for example , if he finishes early , i found the greatest confidence booster wasn  t necessarily my partner saying  it  s perfectly fine  rather showing me and reassuring me that she viewed it as me being so attracted to her that i couldn  t hold back . after we both took time to learn each other  s sexual preferences and finding the balance , the sex is great and i don  t have to worry about performance anymore the nervousness was simply caused by me thinking about societal  norms  and their implied notion of me having to perform perfectly or my woman would get bored and be unimpressed .

5. i  ve been doing it with my husband for almost digit years now and there  s still some discomfort when it sticks it in . keep it super wet . i  ve gotten to the point where i let that discomfort make me aggressive , if that makes sense . it makes it even hotter hahaha

6. i suggest offering to do it for him with a sock , and setting aside a  special sock drawer  . people have weird sex things , and you learn them as you get to know them better and better . if you  re honest , you probably have a few of your own weird  things  . a . m . i right ?

7. me and my husband do anal fairly regularly and this happens every once in awhile . he always says  i know where i  m putting it , i know what can happen  and i think that  s the best response anyone can have . i try to make sure i  m cleaned out but sometimes uhh . shit happens . hope your dude figures that out . oh , and to answer your question , find a mature boyfriend

8. i am sorry if thats completely wrong what i am gonna say , because i don ' t have experience . but wouldn ' t it be possible to stretch your skin slowly before engaging in penetrativ sex . maybe take some extra 10min before , where you stretch and work the skin back slowly with some lubricant . sure this may not be the most sexy thing to do in the middle of a heated moment with you so , but a serious partner should be supportive when it just during the waiting period . if this doesn ' t work , you can also find sexual pleasures without engaging in something like penetrativ sex , where a retracting foreskin is required . a oily handjob over the skin could probably make me come even without having direct contact to the penis glans . and if you are into butt stuff , this could be the time to explore some new ideas .

9. should i be having an awkward conversation with my partner then ? i figured it was just a thing that happened to guys with a foreskin . he showers daily and his hygiene is otherwise fine but i do notice it gets kinda . gooey under there

10. it can be super frustrating , because it makes us feel like we ' re not good enough . media always tells us that getting guys off is easy . so if we go at it for a while , and i finish and he doesn ' t , i feel like a failure  not sexy enough .
