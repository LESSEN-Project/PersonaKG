1. i definitely agree with that boss and the kotor characters . seems like a good time to implement them since no movies are coming out so they could be filler characters .

5. i ' m the only one who wants to see daegon and taven in mk11 . i don ' t know about others but i really found them interesting in mk armageddon and want to see them return along with onaga which i don ' t think any of these is possible looking at how the story is based on time travel

6. i would love to see a show similar to origin that explores amuro ' s experiences during the war in more detail . maybe a loose remake of digit ?

7. i  d be most excited for a full f4 team  doc doom , and not technically new champs but i feel like some mcu versions of characters like sw , drax , gamora , and others would be cool .
