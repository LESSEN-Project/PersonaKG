1. yta her relationship with him isn ' t your problem or issue . her relationship with you is . and it sounds like you damaged it , hard . can you imagine being raised by someone for digit years and counting and for them to not want to adopt you ? ouch .

2. heres what id do ask her out one more time , if she says she has things to do without giving you a time where shes available then yea you did kill your chance . other than that , im sure youll find more people youll have a shot with

3. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them

4. yeah if you have a gut feeling you won ' t like dating her then don ' t . i mean if she wants to just be fwb that would be cool though lol .

6. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .

7. its not your foult . if she just dumped you like that becouse of your mental health than she is a bitch and doesnt deserve you . try to find a woman that actually cares about you . there are many fish in the sea so dont loose hope . i hope the for best for you . sorry for bad english
   (ID: 2c1d97aa622f6ad7ec3a9aad9285dd4ec1e1f28d)

8. try to think about how you want her to feel about your exes . that  s how you should handle it .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

9. oof , as a woman i suggest you not to spoil women that much , some of us get used to get all we want and then it ' s really hard to get on track again . not my case , i made clear to my boyfriend we are equal and he can count on me as much as i can count on him . i suggest you to talk to her and give her an ultimatum , you should take care of her but she ' s abusing it and not thanking what you do for her . obviously you need to change this , and don ' t have any kids for now , neither more pets or expenses . that wouldn ' t be good for the kids or you .

10. i know this sounds like a standard answer giving to everyone , but i know that its the best way . i know that because i also was in that position when you have lost so many of your friends , that there is no place to start , to regain them . put yourself out there , and with out there i mean really into the world of the people you want to befriend . when i needed a friend to go to parties with , i needed to go out alone , to find those with similar interest . and is definitely not so hard when you start building up confidence to go up ro people . most people don ' t have a reason to approach you when already having their social circle , so there is no was around for you to just start randomly talking with people that think may be symphatic . nearly all of the people i started talking to reacted super positve on that behavior . some may find it strange at first , same stick to that attitude and evem some of them will become your friensy

11. sounds like she  s too shallow to understand your pov and what you  ve been through . personally , that trait alone could make or break a relationship for me .

12. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !

13. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .

14. you wont she ' ll most likely tell you she just wants to be friends and then if she was ever worth it at all will follow through with that .

15. oof . imma a lonely boy so i can  t give advice from experience , but i would say something along the lines of . i was already looking at another girl and blah blah blah . but you already fucked up so what you learn . take your time bruh . i mean if ur tryna smash and dash then try to  sexualize  yourself . but if u tryna get a relationship be honest and genuine . be like a anime girl right before she confesses ya know . or if your neither and it was  spur of the moment  just play it off like ,  natural boy reacting to your above average sized breasts  , good luck ! ur gonna need it .

16. hey we can go slap cows if u want . anything is better than making a permanent decision over a temporary feeling or circumstance . i don  t know why she  s being like that but she isn  t worth this kind of negative feeling . i know it doesn  t feel like anything else can help but sometimes it  s bc we are so invested and holding on so tight but when we let go it can be a big relief . just remember that her love isn  t what defines you so whether she loves you or not , your value is unchanged . people will love you the way you deserve , it just sucks we have to wait for it sometimes .

17. the unfortunate thing with being human is that despite our radical free will , we can only choose for ourselves  not others . i ' ve been through young love and know its inexplicable potency . however , first love won ' t necessarily be your best love . in situations like this , the more you try to force things , the worse they will become . a few words of encouragement about your sexuality  gay and lesbian relationships occur among many species of animals in the wild . there ' s nothing wrong with what you ' re feeling or who you ' re attracted to . i think what makes people uncomfortable about it is that it inherently presents a challenge to the privilege heterosexuals have and are generally unwilling to reflect critically about . although you don ' t want to break up , try to stay strong . the best thing you can do is let her know that you love her and are there for her if she needs you . i wish you both the best .

18. you aren ' t alone . at least in here . and i thought i was alone in my thoughts . you almost were talking about me . i ' ve never found anyone either . i wish i had a better answer . i ' ve been looking for years and i find no one really . i had one therapist who kept telling me my problems were mine and it ' s because i don ' t love enough . how do you love when you don ' t know what that is . other ' s have said to put others first . how do you do that when others don ' t even see you . so i feel for you in i ' ve never felt i could let go of everything except online and that ' s still behind a mask . if you need to vent , i ' ll listen . good luck my friend .

19. being single does suck . i ' ve been single my entire life m16 . i usually cope by hanging out with friends . i know i ain ' t the best looking , nor am i fit . but yeah . i get how you feel . life does suck that way . whenever i feel down about being alone , i usually think " i ' ll find that person eventually " some day you will . just continue doing what you like , and hang out with your friends
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

20. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .
