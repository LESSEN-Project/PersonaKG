1. stories like this infuriate me . i don ' t know what gets into these entitled , self  righteous people ' s minds that makes them treat wait staff like subhumans ? it ' s as though they don ' t understand that wait staff are not only fellow humans but also not responsible for pricing , food preparation , plating , store policies , or most of the things that happen in a restaurant . they ' re simply the middleman for every other department in the facility . they work their asses off trying to make a living and your experience pleasurable ! i have much respect for those servers that can maintain their composure when faced with people like this . tl  dr . fuck that bitch !

2. " fuck off " thank you for your input . when you ' re on the clock you ' re expected to at least meet corporate and customer expectations . if you can do neither then any job that relates to working with people is not for you . when you ' re off the clock and on your time you can do whatever pleases you .

3. try to get the ceo introuble , you earn respect amoung your peers in that way . working hours is just a suggestion , if you need to sleep just come in later or next day .

4. i usually have to wait in the human line because either the kids or the husband has already eaten some of whatever we are buying and if we go to self serve i ' ll have to call over the staff member anyway to amend the " incorrect item weight " error .

5. well you gotta remember they have a job to do , and something as simple as that seems pretty minuscule to you but is a big deal for the employee , boss , and establishment .

7. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
