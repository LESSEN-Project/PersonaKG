1. look at two people being able to civilly discuss a bit of a hot button issue on reddit ! while i agree about espn probably not wanting to put down too strong of a stance on an african  american for ranting about racism , she went beyond that with character attacks of someone specific just so happened to be our president in this case and seemingly contributing to an already boiling pot of emotions in the country . her hosting a sports show is debatable , i doubt many viewers are tuning into the digit for anything sports  related . that being said , espn has fired , demoted , or seriously disciplined sports analysts previously for less than what hill tweeted because they previously tried to portray an environment of " we are here for the sports , we don ' t have room for political discourse " ultimately , there is a much different atmosphere being portrayed coming out of bristol over the last few years . i don ' t think there was any place for what schilling said , like him or not . making statements like that about an entire group of the population the transgender comments is irresponsible and detestable , but just a few short years ago , statements like hill ' s would have been met with a very similar fate also .

2. kind of interesting that rather than show the entire twitter discussion , the writer cherry picks quotes to prove that carole thinks she  s superior . you know how even one thread on this subgroup can lead to several discussions and responses . i could cherry pick any thread to prove a point . this is exactly the same as bethenny  s  harassment  by jason . she presents him as an unbalanced dangerous stalker . when you read the actual court transcript it  s completely different . so  show the entire twitter feed including what prompted carole  s responses or assume it  s bethenny  s pr people trying to protect her by questioning other castmates behavior . another article from the poor bethenny minions .

3. if you ' ve been paying attention to anywhere outside of this circle jerk of a subreddit , you would know why people are bashing this episode .

4. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .

5. i  m not saying . i agree . the question being the magnitude of the offense . i myself have family that actually work on the show via union chicago teamsters so it  s not in their benefit that it gets cancelled . however , it begs the question  isn  t it strange how this guy creates an entire scenario that  s fabricated from the start albeit he quickly lost control of it and the show is not being affected ? yet , rosanne for comparison affects all the actors and crew just from a remark ? a verbal statement that cost no one nothing aside from those that decided to give her to time of day . not sure why i  m being downvoted  i asked if there was more information and all i got was  ummmmm  and  uh  s  and answering questions with questions . there  s no useful information with that .
