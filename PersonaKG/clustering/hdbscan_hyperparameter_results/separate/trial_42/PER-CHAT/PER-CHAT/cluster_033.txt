1. how does denouncing something mean you are associated with it ? saying you condemn these people and their actions isn ' t a bad thing ?

2. you could have said " oh yeah , cool " . instead you got defensive and downvoted me . a fucktard says what ?

3. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .

4. i am trying to show you how i feel when you tell me to do something because of your " lord " i won ' t stop cursing until you give me a fucking reason other than a deity with a debatable existence said it isn ' t okay . why don ' t you try and help those over at atheism or at least get some questions answered by somebody smarter than me ? many people there are smarter than me .

5. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .

6. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

7. you think nobody has ever typed out a bunch of paragraphs telling me to shut up before ? i ' m not going to stop and there mods abandoned this sub years ago . you ' re the one who opened up a comment that was downvoted into oblivion , don ' t open up comments that have been buried if you don ' t want to read them .
   (ID: 24bccbf5956c17ad493afaca1dced8dd5090f865)

8. your my friend are absolute scum . worthless fucking cretin . you deserve to be burning in the fiery pits of hell for all eternity . so you can take your fucking " uwu " out of here , and go fuck yourself .
   (ID: 6692d386ab188df76448f18f0e9d59c1e6d88c50)

9. yes yes your right i ' m wrong . have a nice day .
   (ID: dceaf5128ce079240dc5048df74d704163edc3a5)

10. i ' m not an atheist either but the more i learn about space , the more i can ' t believe that our earth was created the way the bible says . because w t f there are over digit billion galaxies in space that we know of . the bible has all these answers about how god created everything and our one planet and who even wrote those ? are they oc or were they added by one of the million people who have translated  rewritten a bible ? but has nothing to say about the massive expanse full of billions of other galaxies that stretches further than any one person could travel in their lifetime ? i wonder if i ' ll ever figure it out .

11. oh yea . you continued to harass me by posting comments like this . don ' t act like a fool dedicatedsloth . old people are not always wise . example  dedicatedsloth . i said to end the drama . you continued it . so you are harassing me kid . stop it kid  i am older than you !
   (ID: ac53f9ce173965984299f3686335a39bc2a5810f)

12. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

13. except no , you do have responsibility . you know that word is offensive which , i would hazard to guess , is why you like it , and further you know what it means to call someone that . it ' s a legitimately offensive thing to call someone , and just because people have called you a faggot and you didn ' t care doesn ' t mean that other people can ' t be legitimately pissed off by being called that , or by that word being used . the idea that you can use a word like that and have no responsibility for how people react is like saying you can swing a baseball bat at someone ' s head and have no responsibility for them being pissed . it just doesn ' t make any damn sense . if you were as emotionally mature as you say you are , you ' d take some responsibility for your own actions instead of projecting that onto someone else . own your shit instead of forcing other people to pick it up .

14. if they keep that shit to themselves then fine . once they start to verbalize their bigotry then they should understand that whilst they might be free to speak , they are not free from any repercussions .
   (ID: dccaef8a6226163d8d10afb2d04eb5a7babea832)

15. okay , we get it . you want to change the subject now that you ' ve been called out .
   (ID: 8bc3c38873da8df8d450deb17fd3c4a602037c65)

16. sorry , but i disagree with this . just because op is expressing their opinion of e3 doesn  t mean they are  insecure .  if you were underwhelmed by nintendo  s presentation compared to the xbox presentation , than that  s your opinion . as someone who isn  t interested in those kinds of games , cyberpunk didn  t interest me at all , so for someone like me , yeah , banjo  kazooie for smash was more exciting . if you didn  t like nintendo  s e3 direct , that  s fine , i understand how some people might be let down , but it annoys me that you are acting like your opinion is everyone  s opinion by saying things like  if you can  t admit something like cyberpunk is a bigger deal then banjo kazooie dlc then your sort of lost in your confirmation bias .  if anything it sounds like your the insecure one .
   (ID: 48327dfb7185a727925115986b0d0501d2999a36)

17. you have only proven that you do not know what you are saying regarding this subject . may you never know what it  s like to be forced to fight a war or be put in a cage . are you a brit ? still mad about the american revolution ? imperialist twat , how funny .
   (ID: 4776f36398122cafa421393accf6939d82603a44)

18. your first respons had little to nothing to do with my original post . you just tossed out your own idea . you then mentioned how it would remove the pvp aspect . i responded by explaining why pvp can ' t work in this . when you mentioned that games succeed or fail based on numerous things , i pointed out that dbd devs can focus on those numerous things that could boost the quality to oblivion , if they start using controllable ai . i ' ve stayed on topic . you haven ' t . you ' re a pathtic hypocrite .
   (ID: f67f4ffc3afd37a9ece4ede606682407c9b920b1)

19. i already told you i don ' t have time to explain the process of analyzing what people say . you can figure it out , it ' s not that difficult it just takes time . condemning one group of terrorists does not overshadow support for another .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

20. not commenting and commenting are the same thing . you imbecile . you fucking moron .
