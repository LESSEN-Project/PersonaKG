1. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .

2. my only counter point is that playing with friends is more fun it  s how other people will get better imo

3. pve upscaleds i ' m all for everyone wanting to try wvw but i really , really , really hope they are playing to win rather than playing for the achievement  loot  xp and karma train . i have seen people running back and leaving the zerg in the middle of a siege  clash just to pick  up a gaddam loot bag left behind .

4. you complaining about free rewards ? it  ll get better and more competitive as you grow within the game . i assume your still very new at swgoh and are clumped with people who are probably not that into it the same way you are .

5. i think people should play for the enjoyment and not just to win another uhc  like if you want to play dirty there ' s a cutclean game in digit minutes .  it should be for the audience .

6. agreed . i think this is good idea but i would go one step further and still have a qualification process . maybe instead of having to win digit games you only need to win digit and players already in the " real " wl cannot compete once qualified . love the idea of lesser rewards . kinda like the ncaa tournament vs the nit .

7. i feel like this would only benefit people who are late on their subscription renewal . could you imagine a new player or a person who hasn ' t or can ' t purchase a ps  subscription jump directly into gtao to find that they need real life money to enjoy digit  of what the game has to offer , or spend that whole time grinding untill the promotion is over .

8. oh oh oh i know the answer . i only play normals and i know this answer . this is my time to shine . see my friend you played with people i call " rankaholics " their ranked mmr is high , but their normals mmr is shit .

9. i mean then just go solo run nightfall at max handicap or something if you need a bigger challenge . this is just mindless fun for everyone without some crazy grind for a new exotics and gear .

10. a lot of people just ragequit in casual so it would just mess up everyone ' s ranking and people could just farm rank with friends who just leave the game . it ' s sad to see the game dying but people would abuse the system too much .

11. thanks , good to know i ' m not alone . i think the problem comes from how people take the word " noob " to mean . most people here think not being a noob is just able being able to win or get high ranks , so if you win or have a high rank then you ' re not a noob . for me not being a noob means being able to aim well , win fights and just having good general fps skills , as well as all the br skills survival , camping , etc . lots of people who win are terrible at fps stuff and they don ' t even realise it . i see it often when spectate .
