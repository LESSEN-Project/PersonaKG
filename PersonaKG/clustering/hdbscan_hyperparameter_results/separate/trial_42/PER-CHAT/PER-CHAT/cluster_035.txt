1. invest in resident relationships . getting to talk and have legit friendships with my residents makes the job so beyond worth it . i love walking out on my hallway and see digit  of my guys just shooting the breeze and being a part of that fills me with so much joy . also , i don ' t know how you ' re school ' s residence program is structured , but reach out to whoever supervises yoyour staff . they can be a listening ear or give you better advice on how to handle the stress . and as for encouragement , you aren ' t alone ! most ras or at least all the good ones struggle to balance these things . give yourself some grace when you mess up and remember that this job can be a great experience .

2. don  t worry about those digit b  s . i  m going to be a senior and as of right now my gpa is at digit . digit , i  ve not taken a single ap class and have made a couple bs as my final averages . you know whether or not you can achieve as in a class and if you did your best and still made bs , it shouldn  t matter because you tried your best

3. do it ! who knows , maybe you ' ll fall into another career path you love even more ! i took off several years after college before taking the pre  reqs . i learned a ton , had some great experiences and some not  so  great experiences , and am pretty happy with my decision i guess we ' ll see how my cycle goes . i actually think you ' re very mature  you ' ve figured out what might be best for you !

4. ok , honestly same i ' m one year ahead of you , but in the uk , we can ' t just pick up a class . i figured out i wanted to do theatre when i was digit . i hadn ' t studied it for two years , and i couldn ' t pick it up . so i ' m doing whatever i can outside of school . but now i ' ve been hit with the issue of " how the hell do i pay attention to anything in school " you ' ve gotta look at the bigger picture . universities want to see that you ' re a rounded person if you choose to do that , so you ' ve gotta have something else to show for yourself . most importantly , what your dad said about some actors not making it ? no , most actors don ' t make it . it ' s ridiculously competitive , and you ' ll have to work multiple jobs just to keep on top of rent and stuff . or , you can work hard in school , get a solid fall back chemistry for me and then know that you can work a good job alongside auditions . then you can spend longer auditioning and stand a better chance of actually making a living on acting . if that doesn ' t help , then find something in the other classes that interests you . sure , maybe chemistry isn ' t your thing , but that one topic on equilibrium you love . or you hate shakespeare , but you find the casket problem in the merchant of venice fascinating . great ! find little things that excite you and cling to them for dear life . finally , if none of that works , just buckle down and get it done . accept that you will fuck up your life if you don ' t finish highschool so you just have to . talk to your teachers , reward yourself for revision , don ' t be too hard on yourself , but just get it done . it sucks but you don ' t have a choice . feel free to send me a dm , you ' re a theatre kid my age  we ' d probably get along lmao

5. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

6. get practical . can be a lot of emotions at first , if you havent done the process before . see yourself as a product and try to focus on value as worker you provide , present this value  skill to potential employers . jobs comes and goes . most scary thing is for those working decades and then beeing forced to change job or careers with very limited experience doing same thing over and over . the more jobs you change too the better you become in transit to new situations . your next job will not be your last job . be exited for what is coming even the unknown . good luck . as for hands on advice , just get references that future employers can contact to hear that you are competent and hard working . thats it .

7. it is an important decision , but you don  t need to put as much pressure on yourself as you may think . not all of the decisions you make at this point in your life are going to be exactly right , and that  s okay . if you don  t like the school you initially choose , you can transfer . if you need to get some of your credits from a community college to save money , no one will think less of you . just work hard and do your best to do what feels right to you . it won  t all be perfect , but things will work out .

8. i  ve said it before but treat college like a digit houweek job and you  ll do well academically . you  re about to get a ton of time and that can make you think you can do it later . make a schedule . do digit hours a day of studying , writing , and assignments and you  ll do fine .

9. all i know really is that if it doesn  t get better somehow , you should definitely think about moving jobs as shit and unfair as that is because my god happiness and good mental health is so so important !
