1. the problem is a closed source company trying to make a buck on something that should be free , aka open source . i could understand if it was something like fedora where they charge for support , but not paying to host what they otherwise get for free . that is a model that we have seen fail time and time again . ms never learns from theirs or others mistakes .

2. like i said , i do pay for tweaks . but a lot of developers does not even reply when you have an issue . why would you pay them ?

3. people should stop feeling so entitled because they have been " loyal " if such thing can be sayed , to a company , in the end is a buy  sell you only have the right over the thing you buy , not the creative decissions , or strategic ones . i agree with you .

4. i used to play offline so i could enjoy the game with no ads , now it  s like playing while online . forcing me to pay just so i can enjoy the game , i don  t like devs or games that do shit like that .

5. just caught a little cnbc piece on qcom that said they were asking for a stay and will appeal to the 9th circuit court . looks like huawei is strengthened by this ruling too if they ' re allowed to buy qcom chips . also that the apple settlement will not be affected by the ruling . what i don ' t understand is that qcom makes the best chips , leading in 5g , that takes a lot of investment and time . why aren ' t they allowed to charge for it ?
