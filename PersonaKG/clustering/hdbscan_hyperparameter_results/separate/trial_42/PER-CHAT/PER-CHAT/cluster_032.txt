4. one morning , i just woke up and said to myself to stop feeling sorry for my life and get on with it . i am a physical and sexual abuse survivor , and everyday , i would dig myself a deeper hole to crawl in because i hated everyone , didn  t want to leave my house , wanted to sleep , and got disgusted with myself . i  m not sure what clicked in my brain , but i  m glad it did . i  m now living my life to the fullest .

5. i was a full blown alcoholic , who treated my friendships as transactional relationships and always had a reason why it wasn  t totally my fault some terrible thing had happened to me or that i had done something shitty to someone else . everyone , including me , was a victim of circumstance and anyone in my position would have done what i did . i got sober over digit years ago , sorted out a bunch of my shit , tried to make up my past transgressions to other people and barring the ability to take direct responsibility for those things , am just trying to live my life better . sometimes i get hung up on what i used to be like , but , can also step back enough to recognize that i can  t redo any of that time in my life and just try to be my best self now . i think past me did some shitty stuff , but , that doesn  t make me a shitty person through and through . i don  t think you can hate yourself into making or maintaining positive changes in your life . present me learned a lot through that experience and especially through getting sober . hopefully , i  ll continue to grow more , keep working on being the best version of myself and , if presented the opportunity , can help others who have similar life experiences .
