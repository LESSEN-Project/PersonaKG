1. like i said , i very rarely see arc grenades beingusedmore can ' t even remeber the last time i saw one , so i see no point in nerfing them further . as for ronin and monarch , i could agree on monarch but ronin needs the arc wave because it ' s literally his only somewhat ranged ability . i get he ' s supposed a cqc titan but that ' s why his ablilites help him close the gap . good point . the weapon balance would be very differnet without as much aim assist . ironically , you ' re forgetting about aim assist in this scenario . the increased difficulty for console players to track is moslty negeted with that , so " high speed " grapple slingsohts even though i don ' t think i ' ve ever seen one pulled off myself are weaker overall compared to pc imo .

2. i actually prefer the madsen trench to the bar storm or trench . it has more ammo and a higher max damage than the bar iirc which makes it more versatile for me at least . i remember i once single  handedly cleared out an entire enemy bunker on argonne forest with digit mag from the madsen trench , all while hip  firing . i couldn ' t have done that with the bar . i think i get into a different mind  frames when playing assault vs support , which means i don ' t mind small  mag weapons because assault is designed for close  quarters . with support , i ' m looking for something more versatile and for me the burton just isn ' t that , though you have a good point . it is a great shame about symthic , and even the wiki doesn ' t know the burton ' s damage . playing weapons on a low zoom is heavily dependant on one ' s eyesight , you ' re knowledge of faction uniforms , and how well you can spot movement at long distances . though failing that you can just spam the spot button ! another tip i ' ll give with the img is to fire off all the rounds in the drum if you ' re low on ammo before reloading . this way your soldier just pulls the chain out the gun , otherwise he has to crank it all the way back through the gun which takes ages . good luck !

3. the ross a tier above the smle , though ? i see your point with this , but the ross is still the only 4x zoom straight  pull rifle that has a sweet spot . the smle is certainly more forgiving , but i generally prefer the ross . if nothing else , i think it looks cooler . i could be convinced to put them in the same tier .  that said , i ' d move the regular  m1917  version up to b . the regular version could easily be a  tier if it weren ' t for the shitty sights . i see no point in running it over almost all other iron  sight rifles , such as the smle , ross or lebel . it ' s just annoying to use imo .  curious what you think of the m1903 exp ? great weapon , and my go  to ptfo scout rifle . can out dps most smgs in close range , and turns into a better version of the regular m1917 at the press of a button . very comfortable using it on maps like argonne , amiens and fort de vaux . it ' s only real weakness is at mid  range , where the semi  auto dps is awful and missing a bolt  action shot can spell death . if i where to do this list again i might push it up to a tier .  the martini henry in c tier ? it ' s at least as good as the arisaka . how could a single shot weapon be better than one with digit rounds ? it ' s fun as hell and is good in most 1v1s , don ' t get me wrong , but for actually trying to win it ' s pretty bad imo . come up against digit guys in cqc and you ' re pretty much dead unless you ' re really good with your sidearm . it ' s low muzzle velocity also makes hitting people running perpendicular to you difficult . it ' s honestly one of the last rifles i ' d take for ptfo personally .  the russian digit trench isn ' t my favourite ptfo rifle , but it ' s not f tier hot garbage . yeah in retrospect i might ' ve been a bit harsh with that one , should ' ve put it in c  tier with the martini henry .

4. brecci was good though , this isn ' t . i wasn ' t saying it was the remington , it ' s the only comparable in one shot kill type of way . it ' s bad when i ' d rather use fists in half the gun fights tbh . and the sg12 isn ' t garbage unless you can ' t click the trigger more than two times . any average player can use the gun like any other , sure it ' s no saug , but it ' s still way better than the mog12 . it ' s just depressing .

5. they should either remove the tac or rework it . i would rather they rework it though , my idea is make it more for shooting further away just like the heavy shotgun .  another way it could work is for bonuses for getting those meaty body shots . hitting every shot on the body should do some good damage .   x200b  pump for headshots , tac for bodyshots . also it should replace the need for an smg  secondary weapon . it needs to be a viable option or it needs to be removed .
