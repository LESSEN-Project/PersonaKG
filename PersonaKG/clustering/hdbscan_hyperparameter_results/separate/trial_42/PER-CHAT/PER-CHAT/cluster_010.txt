--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 7

1. i  ve had these dreams where people get glazed over looks in their eyes , then they  explode  sort of and become these dark trees . i  ve had it long enough that an entire forest has been created
   (ID: 507a68eb71bd6ad59b6eb966ab94fb9c2e599bc8)

2. there ' s probably some formalized theory about this , but i think that stuff your brain gets exposed to gets internalized , at least at the subconscious level , and might find its way into your dreams . you might see something like the ludicrous ghost hunters series on scifi and say , " heh . ghosts in the afterlife , yeah right " and shelve that in the back of your mind , but in dreamland your brain might ' ve been messing around with the possibility some more and provoked the dream .

3. that cold shiver that goes all the way up your spine when your in bed and you hear something in your room that cant possibly be anything that you remember seeing when the light was on .
