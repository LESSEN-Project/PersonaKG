1. for one  you didn  t answer my question . but my point  is not that it makes me uncomfortable . my point is that laws , rights , privileges , and all governing cannot be based on a subjective  feeling  regardless of how deeply rooted it is . if i can be ticketed for using the wrong pronoun in cities like toronto , where does it stop ? does nobody get that  s it  s not always about the specific example  situation at hand but a bigger picture ? for fuck sake , it  s a slippery slope . years ago people were saying  what  s next , defending pedophiles ?  and look . exactly what is happening i don  t give a fuck how you feel or what you do , but you get the same set of rules i do . and back to my original point  the left is so  science science science  but basic fucking biology is literally ignored to appease people  s  deeply rooted sexual bullshit .  just wait , you will see how this is not about who cuts their dick off and wears a dress but an endless rabbit hole of subjective legislation .

2. yea , i don ' t support it . you just can ' t change their mind by telling them these things , the only reason they are homophobic or racist it because they ' re ignorant , impossible to change their minds .

3. controversial . it all comes down to your reasons for not being attracted to those people . if it  s an overt , i won  t date her because she  s black , yea that  s rooted in racism . but if your physiology doesn  t attract you to that person then you  re fine . you shouldn  t be forced to be attracted to someone who doesn  t  do it for you .  like i couldn  t get an erection over a trans individual . is it because i hate them ? of course not . they deserve love and acceptance like everyone else on the planet . but the thought of a penis being there or ever hanging been there doesn  t turn me on .

4. to be clear  people have the right to practice whatever religion they would like . they have the right to pursue or not pursue certain things in their personal lives because it goes against their creed . i don ' t want to take that away from people . if living your life a certain way and believing in one god or another makes you feel fulfilled , then live your best life my friend . but laws impact everyone . to make a law in the name of say catholicism and then forcing people of all other religions to follow it crosses many lines . if people want to be able to change their gender markers on their licenses if they want to , they should be able to . but no one should ever force anyone to do so . if doing such a thing goes against your religion , then you don ' t gotta do it . those laws , the ones for people wanting to change their gender , only impact the people who want to do it ! nothing about those laws says that everyone else is legally obligated to as well , it ' s just an option available to those who are interested .

5. my opinion on the subject tends to piss people off to begin with  i hate it that any single group has been indoctrinated by judeo  christian hegemony and then adopts it as if it  s their own bias . african , afro  caribbean , and african americans are the unfortunate prime example , but it also extends to native and aboriginal peoples across the world . the british , spanish , dutch and french came in , installed  buggery  and  sodomy  laws which criminalized homosexuality . the european dominion of the overseas territories brought with it puritanical religion which became deeply entrenched and persisted  in most cases still persists to this day . i wouldn  t blame these communities for a second , most of them had third genders and  or never had a prohibition on homosexuality until white people told them to . and the rest is history .
