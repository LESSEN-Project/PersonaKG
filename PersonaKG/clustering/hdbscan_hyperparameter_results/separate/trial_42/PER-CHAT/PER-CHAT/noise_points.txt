10. i agree . especially a punisher rear slide plate cover . unfortunately a prosecutor can turn anything around and convince the layperson of wrongdoing . from what you saw with the young guys . officer how many hours do you spend in the gym ? how many hours do you practice with your firearm ? so it is more important for you to be stronger to carry more ammo than to be proficient with your gun ?

13. if your estate is insolvent everything you own doesn ' t cover the amount of debt owed then the estate is sold to cover what it can and the rest goes away . if your beneficiaries want to keep things , maybe a house or a valuable car , i ' m sure they can " trade " with the creditors for these things , but otherwise the beneficiaries won ' t get jack , and all your shit will just be sold off to pay the debts . edit for an example  i ' m poor and don ' t own much of anything . if i were to drop dead right now , the bank will get the car i ' m financing through them , unless someone decides to take up the payments , and my student loan debt just goes away .

15. hate is such a strong word . let ' s say i just don ' t know you well enough to say i like you .

16. i think it ' s because people don ' t know themselves well enough before committing to a relationship . whatever they think they like about someone might turn out , over however many weeks or months or years the relationship develops , into incorrect assumptions , both about who their partner is , and who they themselves are . this could explain why many marriages among younger couples end in divorce , they might still be in the process of developing who they are as individuals and might literally become a different person through the ups and downs of various relationships .

17. i do not think my comment indicates that i have a black  white perspective  just asked a question " if you settled with a powerful man then that was a smart decision " it ' s not just a " smart decision "  it is an opportunity that is given to you because you are attractive . so you ' d say everyone that settles for " poor men " makes foolish decisions ? i don ' t know , but you argue pretty " black  white " to me . it all depends what you value . if you value fame , power , money , . and the only way you can get this is by marrying someone who provides you with these things , sure go for it . if you can ' t achieve these things by yourself though , i think this is the opposite of " being smart . " a guy who is a genius but marries a gold digging whore is stupid " why ? couldn ' t you make the same argument as to why it ' s a smart decision for the " gold digging whore " to marry that guy , that it is a smart decision from the rich guy ' s perspective because he marries a beautiful sexual partner , potentially resulting into a more beneficial reproduction ?
