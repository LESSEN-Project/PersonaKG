2. hard core ! what a shame it wasn ' t a dream that you remember so vividly of something awesome happening or being a lovely cause of dream hangover that involved you and some mysterious lover that seems like everything you need or want right now . a solid regime of masturbation and netflix , coupled with unnecessary consumption of foods that your body doesn ' t need but your brain may release dopamine will get you over this hump ! i ' m not sex focused as such but i do know what soothes the soul !

3. reading this back i seem fucking insane but it  s not really how it reads i guess ? there is definitely only digit me not digit  a phobia but it might be ? basically i will be a normal functioning human being but sometimes my subconscious voice will feel estranged from  me  . what this means is that my subconscious would go  hey what would happen if i were to make you do this ?  and the i  ll have to think really hard not to do it . it feels like there is digit people in my mind and the other is trying to control what i do . or it could be compared to the devil and angel on your shoulders . for instance i  ll be walking around somewhere and my subconscious will go   what if you were to scream maniacally at the top of your lungs  or  what if you just ripped a massive fart right now in the midst of everyone  and i  ll literally have to go  nononono nooooooo  to blot out this thought or i  m petrified i might actually just go ahead and do it . at the same time i know there is no way in hell i  m ever going to do this . my mind is against me occasionally and it sucks . i promise you i am digit  a single mind and a normal person .

8. the title says  " but why do we know so little about our religion ? " so the first digit posts or so are people complaining about , that christianity isn ' t " our " religion . after that mostly atheist talk , which you can find anywhere in  atheism  atheism . in the whole digit comments so far there where about digit people saying , they belief . but they are usually cool and tolerant , so nothing to discuss digit

9. just because i have to say it  if they are repairing it themselves , it shouldn ' t matter how close or far a service center is . this whole john deere thing is such bullshit for real though and right to repair laws would be such a huge win for people of the world , not just farmers with tractors .

14. now he has a question . the question being , " do you not understand english ? " i think he ' s just indicating every mind we are aware of is a product of a physical brain . every aspect of the mind can be understood through study of neurobiology . if you mean " prove the human mind to me " to mean demonstrate that the human mind exists , that ' s a different matter . from your comment it isn ' t clear if you disbelieve in minds or just don ' t understand what causes minds .

17. not a teacher but , in my class we have multiple students not to be racist but their all black and they all are seated around me . the one behind me we ' ll call her " r " speaks in the most ghetto tone of voice one can think of , doesn ' t say full well thought out responses , and finally " r " failed a test when the teacher was giving out the answers . the next one we ' ll refer to as " m " . now " m " just like " r " talks in the most ghetto way aswell . he sleeps in class and doesn ' t know what is going on digit  of the time . the last one is " c " and she is the loudest of both of them combined . generally disruptive and annoying because once she ' s talking everyone is talking making me leave with a headache and the teachers unable to finish the lesson sometimes .

19. i don  t know if your neighbor could do anything about controlling outdoor cats . could you put up a chicken wire fence around the garden ? idk how big your garden but you could even frame up a chicken wire lid and door to really keep them out . it  ll take some work but that would also keep other animals out too .
