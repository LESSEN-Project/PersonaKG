1. i mean tell him you feel like you ' re going back to the person you was . tell him your side of the story ! how you believe the fight was unnecessary . that you feel such a similar pain . who knows , maybe he understands and talking about it will grow the two of you closer together . perhaps there is a good friend who is willing to give you another perspective ?

2. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .

3. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .

4. nah , you should probably went easier with her . anyway , someone would still tell her that and it could have been worse .

5. did you ever consider that your own habits and personality are your roadblock to those things ? if you never make an effort to better yourself or even try how can you blame the world for your blunders ? nobody is depriving you to your right to anything . companionship isnt assigned , its something that is found , love is something that is developed along with intimacy . its not just something like equality and civil rights . theres not a chance in hell you could tell me that you cant find a single woman that you cant connect at least a little bit with and work into something more intimate if you want .

6. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

7. i hear you . you believe you are unworthy . you think that deep down , you don  t matter . all i can say is that the voice that  s telling you that is lying . it  s a lie that you are unworthy and undeserving . it  s simply untrue . the truth is that you are a person worthy of love and happiness and stability and help . you don  t have to do this alone . your therapist and your hr rep will help you . your therapist can get you the right kind of treatment and your hr rep will help you make sure you can take the time off . do you think that you could experiencing cognitive distortions ? and that maybe you aren  t seeing things clearly ? what if you spoke to your therapist about the possibility of getting help ? what if you  re jumping to conclusions about how treatment will really be like ? are you jumping to conclusions about  subjecting  other people to helping you ? i would think that therapists and counselors would want to help you  it  s their ultimate goal , after all . could it be that your brain isn  t letting you think clearly right now ?

8. yes , our minds love to punish ourselves when we are low . i promise if you truly try you can feel better and once you do it will be easier next time and so on and so on . feeling like this i truly know can be dangerous . don ' t be afraid to talk . get it all out . it ' s ok to be sad . but you have to tools inside your head to make yourself better ! remind yourself that you are worth it red  heart

9. heres what id do ask her out one more time , if she says she has things to do without giving you a time where shes available then yea you did kill your chance . other than that , im sure youll find more people youll have a shot with

10. well you ' re just going to have to get over your fear of her having a relationship with someone else . cause it will happen . same thing will happen for you too . it ' s not the end of the world . how many girlfriend ' s have you had ? i ' m assuming more than just her because you used the phrase " most recent girlfriend . " most relationships don ' t last , no matter if they ' re romantic ones or not , and i don ' t think they ' re supposed to . you were with this girl for digit days , that ' s nothing . you ' ll find someone else , or you ' ll spend the rest of your life debilitated by your fear of something that you have no control over . i ' m willing to bet that won ' t happen . keep your chin up man .

11. you should try anything and everything you can to get well . leaving is something you can only do once and it will have devastating effects on the people around you . get help from wherever you can get it , therapy , medication , anything that may help .

12. sounds a lot like my story , honestly . your best bet is to talk to her about it . don ' t do what i did and hide it , it ' ll probably come back . digit divorces , digit years old , a ton of self esteem issues later and i ' m just starting the transition process now .

13. you ' re not being dramatic . he ' s telling you that he wouldn ' t be there for you . i ' d listen .

14. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .

15. if you  re on a break it means you  re not together at the moment , right ? if you  re expected to continue to be faithful then i feel like instead if a break it  s better to work through things as a couple . i guess i don  t really get the idea of a  break  that  s not a break  up in a relationship . anyway , be transparent with her if the time comes that you discuss getting back together .
   (ID: 3f4f5511095f668b3c84312b8bfeb87b30dd8f03)

16. you did the right thing for you . your ex sounds immature and there is a good chance he has cheated plenty himself and that ' s why he is so nonchalant about it . his friend is the one who did something wrong . it isn ' t on you to keep his secrets . if you were in that situation you would want to be told , i ' m sure . let him buy you a ticket home . call your people and let them know you are coming back . this just saved you from a miserable life with a selfish jerk .

17. nta . as a lesbian and as a human being with good communication in a good relationship , i see no issue with what you did . your other doesnt trust you and is very insecure . i ' d talk to her and if it didnt resolve , i ' d get a new girlfriend that trusts me enough to not cheat .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

18. you know , i  ve been at that point in my life where i wondered why i had so many failed relationships . but then i realized all of them had one thing in common . me . there  s a reason why we pick the partners we do . go to counseling because you want to be the best you that you can be , not because she made the call . go for you . i hope you do it .

19. i think it ' s super cool when people come up with things like this , props to you for putting in the effort !

20. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .
