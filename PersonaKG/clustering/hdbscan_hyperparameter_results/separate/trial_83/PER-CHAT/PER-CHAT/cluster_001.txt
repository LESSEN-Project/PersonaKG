5. upvotes dont validate my existence so do downvotes dont eliminate my opinion just to tell you once again , the person you call indogs has way way more stars than you i believe , you ' ll never even get to digit stars yet you call the person dog ? do u even know why he changed his flag to singapore ? so pathetic , throwing shits with no valid reason

6. thank you ! i also feel the same way about the post that was made earlier calling people on this sub pathetic . just , why ? this is a place where people come to vent and get out what they can ' t in other places . for them to say we ' re pathetic for doing what the sub was made for is just rude . why can ' t they just unsubscribe without being a dick ? what did they get out of calling other people pathetic ? i just don ' t get it .

7. i don  t understand ! why people like you never have any facts as to why trump is bad , it  s always the same vague arguments . be glad your bitch ass is safe from isis and if you ever decide to get a job and move out of your moms basement , trump has given us the greatest economy our nation has ever seen

8. you could have said " oh yeah , cool " . instead you got defensive and downvoted me . a fucktard says what ?
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

9. ok , so the post in question was  what evidence is there that male privilege exists ? i am in no way saying we should put out a bad product . but i am saying that none of you or i are biologists and really don ' t know how hard it is . regardless the fact that they didn ' t start until later is bad . how is that so hard to get . i ' m literally not bashing . why are you even defending it ? it ' s not your fault or anyone ' s here . is it that bad to get the word out ?
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

10. i ' m quite literally not american . i don ' t live there . it ' s quite literally not " our government . if i was going to attribute the ideas of freedom etc to someone it would probably be a greek philosopher or french revolutionary .
   (ID: 2266c34274940e2ea1a22a3dee5a3cbcdad25f53)

11. that ' s a very shallow assumption . also you can ' t tell me i can ' t . you ' re not even contributing any ideas related to the thread so why are you here anyway ? to put me down ? you ' re wasting your time . i got what i came for which was a little bit of light shed on a subject that i was more curious to learn about .
   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

12. it ' s just that you refused to address my points or say anything but lol you are stupid , since you are so far beneath me and you lack the intellectual capacity for rational discussion i have moved on to doing something better with my time . you know it as well as i do that socialism will when you ' re watching it happen on tv every day and you ' re burned up with impotent rage . i don ' t give a shit what you say about me because i have people in my life who actually love me and care about me unlike trump supporters who are disowned by their own children do to how awful they are .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

13. i apologise then . i see this a lot from trolls so i had a knee jerk recation . i ' ll tell ya , being white doesn ' t affect my job , my social life , or my relationships . racism happens , that shit is real , but it ' s never had any serious impact in my life .

14. really ? you feel the need for personal attacks because i disagree with you ? well , how about you try understanding the sentence before you attack someone . let me help you " it ' s exactly why i oppose tax hikes right now "

15. lmao how pretentious are you ? you write like a child found a thesaurus and thought it would make him cool . i understand the historical context . slavery wasn  t ok , slavery doesn  t justify genocide . white people were awful  brutalized slaves , doesn  t mean you should go and murder everyone with a drop of european blood . but sure , go ahead pretending you  re smarter than everyone else  justifying genocide , bud .

16. they are facts as you see them . your need to mock makes you an asshole and is a mistake i am trying to correct i a way you understand . further mockery . who ' s denying the facts , anyway ? to me its not what your doing its how your doing it .
   (ID: f15c79447707a6e701285e8c59cc3aa25d54daa6)

17. for one  you didn  t answer my question . but my point  is not that it makes me uncomfortable . my point is that laws , rights , privileges , and all governing cannot be based on a subjective  feeling  regardless of how deeply rooted it is . if i can be ticketed for using the wrong pronoun in cities like toronto , where does it stop ? does nobody get that  s it  s not always about the specific example  situation at hand but a bigger picture ? for fuck sake , it  s a slippery slope . years ago people were saying  what  s next , defending pedophiles ?  and look . exactly what is happening i don  t give a fuck how you feel or what you do , but you get the same set of rules i do . and back to my original point  the left is so  science science science  but basic fucking biology is literally ignored to appease people  s  deeply rooted sexual bullshit .  just wait , you will see how this is not about who cuts their dick off and wears a dress but an endless rabbit hole of subjective legislation .

18. your my friend are absolute scum . worthless fucking cretin . you deserve to be burning in the fiery pits of hell for all eternity . so you can take your fucking " uwu " out of here , and go fuck yourself .
   (ID: 6692d386ab188df76448f18f0e9d59c1e6d88c50)

19. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

20. why does it matter how i respond to you ? your argument is invalid .
