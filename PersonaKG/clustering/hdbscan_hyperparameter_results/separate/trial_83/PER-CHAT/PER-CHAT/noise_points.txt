8. currently they ' re being skeptical but haven ' t taken any further actions to both of you i mean like deducting pay or giving warnings , have they ? i think if they start to do so then present the records

9. well it  s actually not exactly safe to go there right now with all the protests that  s going on . but my friend actually stayed there for digit  digit months last year and he  s been telling me and my other friends to just go and live there . i truly would want to and could literally change a community .

10. yta . i say this rather than everyone is an ass or he is because you clearly acknowledge this is a sore spot and you used it maliciously . also , a few questions  what did he need your car for ? are you rough on cars , and is he worried you ' ll do the same to his the only functioning car of the two now ? does he make up for not working by doing chores or cooking or anything ? also , your comments to others on the thread are what truly put me over the line of you being an ass . it sounds like you just want validation , not honesty .

11. and on the third day god created tomatoes and cheese . then the devil said " fuck you , i will curse mankind by creating onions "

12. it  s hard to say without knowing what kind of relationship you have with your boss and how the question was delivered . on the optimistic side , perhaps he or she is genuinely interested in understanding how you like your job so improvements can be made . if you  re paranoid and  or pessimistic , you could be left wondering if it  s a subtle , passive aggressive attempt to threaten you so you work harder .

13. try to get the point across with statements like , " i haven ' t had something as good as this is a while . " , see if a mutual dialogue opens ?

14. it is pretty funny when i think about it now , but it was pretty hurtful at the time .

16. who makes that decision ? who determines what conditions or characteristics are fine and which are not ? disabled adults would be against this idea of yours . what makes you think you know better than they whether they have a right to live ? no , you ' re talking about babies , but babies don ' t get to be adults if you ' d have them euthanized first . this is a slippery slope that starts with ostensibly good intentions and ends with eugenics .
