1. " allowing " for direct negotiations is a fallacy because it ' s far easier for a large employer to play hard ball than it is for an individual worker to find another job . " allowing " for direct negotiations is not a kindness . i ' m happy that you enjoyed your own employment situation , i have no personal problem with this kind of thing so long as it isn ' t coercive . like you say yourself , by offering more money for the time they should be able to find willing workers . but allowing them to compel this kind of thing is terrible .

7. go and be supportive . say nothing that would be upsetting to them . that ' s what friends do . a funeral is not the time or place for you to express your views . it ' s not about you in the least .

10. exactly , you ' re not here to entertain me , but this post was meant to entertain whether or not it ' s for easy karma is a different matter . this is the first time i saw this , and judging from all the up doots , i ' d say i ' m not the only one . nothing is original because someone is always going to say it first , all that matters is how and when you do it .

11. as someone who puts up walls like it  s my job and also someone who  s last relationship crumbled because of it , the best thing i can say is to try . also , be patient , it takes time and you have to let the person get comfortable with you

12. honestly i got a shitty linex computer and upgraded the graphics card so i could run world of warcraft on it . sad to say i have dumped so much time into that game instead of going out that i noticed a big difference in my spending habits upside my childhood bestfriend also plays wow and we run discord so we can catch up and laugh the night away even though he ' s stationed in california

16. well . what i ' m trying to say is , niantic could of done something really cool for everyone that showed up and surprised them with something special like a shiny nidoking . next time they have another event advertised for a sticker . no one may show up .

17. esh unpopular opinion but there ' s nothing brave or special about coming out as asexual . she sounds like an insufferable person but at the same time you say " you were only sitting there to get closer to your crush " and implied that her asexuality doesn ' t matter to you because you ' re not interested in banging her anyways .
   (ID: 43a6fe9c16d7a48abeb6832518a650a445974a7e)

18. i was an idiotic teenager who would chase after guys that didn  t give two shits about me . the whole time i was oblivious to my best friends massive crush on me . that boy was there for me through all of my problems and it  s safe to say that he  d give me the world if he could .
