5. i didn ' t really need an answer like yours as it ' s what i would say as well . hence me saying it ' s kinda rhetorical . what i was trying to imply , if someone wanted to answer , was towards whether there has there been any footage of each phase and the amount of power needed so that we could try work out the guild power sweet spot .

6. my suggestion is that you should jusrify the desicions she makes based on beauty . for instances the more beautiful they are the healthier . there are uncountable ways to justify it like magic , culture , sport , economic competitiveness etc . you can make your character ' s perspective more poetic or funny . example  instead of saying " your nose is too large . you can say something like " you can ' t beyond your own nose .

8. while i agree somewhat to the fact that hispanics like to fuck . i find it a bit distasteful to say that the problem is with hispanics . not with retarted white christians . who are too dumb to realize that their children are going to fuck regardless of what they ' re told . so hey lets get them to put on a jimmiehat

16. it  s hard to say without knowing what kind of relationship you have with your boss and how the question was delivered . on the optimistic side , perhaps he or she is genuinely interested in understanding how you like your job so improvements can be made . if you  re paranoid and  or pessimistic , you could be left wondering if it  s a subtle , passive aggressive attempt to threaten you so you work harder .

19. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .
