4. look i ' m not saying there isn ' t value in those studies , and that parenting style . it ' s just not exclusive like you seem to think it is . try raising children with different types of challenges , like autism spectrum disorder or oppositional defiant disorder , then tell me there ' s a one size fits all . also , confirmation bias . there , now i ' m really out .

6. coincidentally just finished my latest rewatch last night before bed and this post made me chuckle . creed ' s appearances in the last few episodes , and the grass roots story , is pretty funny . i like to think that creed , out of all of the characters that use their real names , is most like himself in real life .

11. i agree with you for the most part , but some of the halloween items , like the templar ' s spirit for the medic and the squid ' s lid for the demo actually look pretty cool . i think they should just do away with the restriction .
