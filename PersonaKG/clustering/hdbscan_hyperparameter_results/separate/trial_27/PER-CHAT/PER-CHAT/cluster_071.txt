2. i have one friend who knows but anytime i tell them they just go  oof  and if he comes round he buys loads of food and eats it and it ' s really triggering . also my other friend who i hang out with is going to latvia so i ' m kind of screwed . i think my plan of action is to get out of the house as much as possible so i can try and ignore my urges .

6. damn , i guess i ' d never thought about that side of things . do you think that the subreddits that took their place are poor imitations , or maybe that the old community forums just relocated ? disclaimer  i wasn ' t never involved in any community forums before reddit so it ' s a genuine question

7. if it makes you or them uncomfortable there ' s nothing wrong with it , but if it ' s more of a " i think it bugs them " you should just ask if it does then go from there .

9. you really think someone would do that ?               just             go             on             the             internet             and             tell             lies ?

11. maybe . maybe . maybe . i can  t art but i sure can write ! so i guess i  ll just describe the dress then ? it would be really poofy but not so much that it doesn  t disguise his body from the neck down . it would be white with gold highlights running along it , with translucent gold shoulder pads with the askr insigniasymbol ? inside them . the veil would be white with touches of purple to match who he  s marryingits bruno . and also a gold bow on the back . i think that  s a detailed enough description incase anybody wants to draw it ! just credit me for the design please !
