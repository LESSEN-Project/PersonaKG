3. nta , if he really doesnt want it i understand him but if it would make you happier it is your body and he has no reason to call you a bitch . however , if you truly care about him and he is against it , maybe you should have a good talk about it , but he has no reason to call you a bitch or stop you from getting a nosejob .

6. wear the toughest full plate you can get your hands on and find a mudcrab . let it hit you over and over , casting healing spells to stay alive , or burning through low level health potions . save frequently , as this can sometimes cause issues with crashes though this has been very rare for me and because you may occasionally get attacked by something more formidable when you ' re not expecting it far more common . there ' s a good spot downriver , east of whiterun that i have used several times for this . you may also want to have a shield with you , as this is a good way to level block as well .

7. " one of my straight female friends said she likes hanging out with gay men , because she knows that the only thing they want from her is friendship . i thought that was a good point . " because wanting something beyond friendship is a bad thing ?

10. i was raised hindu and was always interested in religion so i have a lot to speak of ! another one is that hindus in india will often put a lime and chilli peppers on a string  pin outside of a home or business . this is because lakshmi goddess of wealth and prosperity has an older sister alakshmi goddess of the opposite of those . lakshmi likes to eat sweets  milk  fruits , so if you keep them inside she ' ll come in and you ' ll have good luck . alakshmi likes to eat sour and spicy food , so keeping the lime and chili out there will keep her satisfied outside without coming into your life .   x200b  in a related story , when a sage was asked who is more beautiful between lakshmi and alakshmi , he said that lakshmi is more beautiful when walking towards you because you want good luck to come into your life and alakshmi is more beautiful when walking away from you because you want bad luck to leave your life .
