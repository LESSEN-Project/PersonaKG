   (ID: e059f82a0624202d909920e56dd76f76efa711d2)

   (ID: 3cc393500aaac3a2ee1cd96955cee486bb062a46)

3. no , i think you start as something like an atheist , tell me as a kid how well did you grasp the concept of god ? until you can comprehend the concept you aren ' t going to get anything out of it as a individual .

4. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?

5. ok so how did those people kill them if they did not use a gun ? nobody ever tells me that part . i dont really care how because i kinda think dying by anothers hand is the issue . so to balance yourself before your audience could you please include the overall death rates ? its a sanity thing for me at this point . thanks .

6. they shook your hand and smiled at you because their religion instructs them to do so . if you gave a neighborhood party and a guy from down the street came and did something disruptive , i think you would consider it disrespectful in the same way people here think you were being disrespectful . i ' m finding it hard to believe you are actually this dense .

7. i think we ' re in agreement ? or by ' yep ' did you mean you would stop loving your mother for money reasons ?
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

8. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

9. think back to something you did or something that happened and figure out why it was done or why you acted like that . how it effected you or others . that reflection best way i can describe it .

10. well you seem to be correct about the cities there and i realize i failed to account for population growth earlier however the industrial revolution happened and that likely led to a large decline however the brits did do a lot of harm however india might have not developed as quickly . oh and btw the british raj was not a collony untill the 1850s so yeah that kinda changes the argument by a lot . now i have to make it clear tho i don ' t think what the brits did was moral meerely that it may have had possitive consequences .

11. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .

12. right ? i was so glad they played maud gone at that show , though i preferred their version at shaky knees the most . what did you think of the new stuff ?
   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

13. wouldn ' t everyone be a little bit suspicious , do you think that some people might assume you did something and go after you or at least heavily question you ?
   (ID: 1476398f6c778fb461539e3f78b07720d4ceee83)

14. i was not . my parents were presbyterian on paper , and i think at least my mother did does ? believe . i was taught almost nothing of religion , and only have the vaguest of memories of ever going to church . i think we went a handful of times when i was very young . maybe that ' s what allowed me to gloss over the religious context when i read the books as a kid .

15. how did you tell her ? every iteration i can think of sounds like a caveman . " you , me , sex now "
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

16. i can truly relate to the part where one day you love everyone and the next it all switched up . sometimes i think i have some form of narcissism . how did you find out about it ?
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

17. no , but you ' ll think you did when you get to middle age .
   (ID: 34de9309a5c02867b676757fa019c58a66bad300)

18. first off you sould like the kind of person to think count dankula was a nazi . this post is making fun of how the nazis belived in the aryan masterace and that they belived they were unbeatable . oh and lastly . this is historymemes and not history so now please screw off like mao did in his long march back to the little shithole home he had .
   (ID: d7f47de640bd3d8659ad150b77fea8f843c60c26)

19. it may be a little unclear now that i think about it , but if you look at the timecodes , i also won the first lost run i did ever .
   (ID: c9b1e924c86788c982ec59df3d5704354a2a4ae1)

20. but he ' s an addict and i believe he was molested by his mother as a kid . he has done some nice things for his kid . he always apologizes or at least does something to get on their goodside . and honestly i think he did the right thing by telling fiona that sean still used .
