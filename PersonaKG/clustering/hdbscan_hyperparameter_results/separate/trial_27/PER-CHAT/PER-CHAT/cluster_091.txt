7. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !

9. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .

12. having my underarms touched . i don  t know why , but whenever i think someone is going to touch them or come close to them i freak out and hyperventilate .
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

13. please calm down it ' s a trailer and the film has an emphasis on dancing , if you know his stuff then you should also know there ' s a lot of hideous shit that ' s gonna occur . i don ' t think anything on his resume warrants a mocking use of " dark "
   (ID: 1d327d2812dfee71bf8ef77d36ffd5eb70efd55b)

14. if you have doubts , don ' t do it . i think you already know that .

16. i think it ' s more of a confidence issue for me . if he makes the first move than i know that he likes  wants me rather than me taking the chance and getting rejected . although i have asked out all of my past boyfriends so i don ' t require it .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)
