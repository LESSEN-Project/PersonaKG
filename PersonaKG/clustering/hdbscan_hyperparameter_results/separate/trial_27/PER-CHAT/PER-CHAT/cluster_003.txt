2. my mom once went to a popeye ' s where the service was really slow and there was bulletproof glass separating the cashier from the customers . the service was so slow that a guy who was waiting in line was able to watch a few episodes of daredevil in the amount of time it took him to get his food . my brother wanted to leave , but my mom had already paid for our chicken and she didn ' t want to trust the dumb kid behind the counter with her credit card again . the moral of the story is that you shouldn ' t go to popeye ' s restaurants in the ghetto .

3. this isn ' t an answer , but i would like to have a time  machine so i could spectate any moment in history i would want . i said spectate because everything i would do in the past , even my presence , would influence the presentthe future . now , the answer is  battle of stalingrad or crucification of jesus .

5. i could have found better examples if i spent more time on that response , so much is certain . but there are more than enough historical movies that didn ' t take place in an english speaking country  do you want to damn every single one of them because they switched the language ?

8. if you  re in the position to not work , enjoy your friends as much as you can . it  s also a great time to find more about yourself as an individual , what your interest are and hobbies you might want to try !

10. have genuine , quality time to reflect upon yourself so that you can be better tuned to what you want out of life and a relationship .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

11. compromise . you need to find a way for both of you to get a little of what you want . often time teenagers are completely oblivious to what they really need as support and same goes for parents not knowing where an appropriate line should be drawn usually out of fear or anxiety for their child  s well being you may see improvement if you take on more responsibility around the home or in the community  but that  s only a vague suggestion because i have no idea about your specific circumstances .
