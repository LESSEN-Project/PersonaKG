1. my ninth grade intro to tech teacher mrs oh i am sorry dr h . first let me tell what what she looked like she looked like chucky with heath ledgers jokers mouth as an old pale lady . here  s what she did digit . once she got mad at me for saying the word aids . i was explaining what wakanda does to make people not want to go visit it and keep the secret digit . she talked slowly while emphasizing certain words which made listening to her painful . she talked like this  the audit . has shown that most . of you . have . been . on other sites . never mind that most of us also got our work done while on said sitesso imagine listening to her try to punish you i  ll get back to this later digit once for a class project we were planting plants in the schools front yard . while there she told me and a couple of my friends 3to be exact to go the school and get some empty boxes . we go and look for the boxes . now the only boxes we found were not empty at allthey had printer paper i think so we thought we should grab one and bring to her to ask if that  s what she meant and she just misspoke or something . we show her the box and the . this digit year oldish lady throws a damm temper tantrum . she starts yelling  i asked for empty boxes  i tried to tell her  mrs hackney these were the only boxes we foun  empty boxes empty boxes she kept yelling while stamping her foot like an angry toddler . i just turned around and went back inside to keep looking to shut her up . turns out the janitor was about to throw the empty boxes out and that  s why we couldn  t find them . he let us have them though nice guy really any cursing at all was evil to her like she downright went on rages about it  you can  t use those words there evil , your doing evil . crap i just said the fucking chrombook doesn  t work for god sakes . remember what i said about her  trying to punish you  . here  s what she did he yelled you you until you stopped and then tried to make you agree with her that you were wrong like she actually was fanatical to the rules . like when she heard me someone say fuck she would try to make you stop by saying it wasn  t in your  vocabulary  and making you admit you were wrong . while most teachers would just be like  don  t say that out loud  or just ignore if it wasn  t in a conversation with them . we were in ninth grade and i knew for a fact my friends and iwho she was talking toknew what fuck literally meant because we discussed that earlier in the school yearwe were wondering how  fuck you  became an insult instead of a complement . and when i was talking with my friends during an assignment she told me to stop because  no job lets you do that  . i told her i see what some jobs would airport guides drivers surgeons ectbut that it wasn  t affecting our .   nope no job let  s you do that restaurants don  t let the cashiers or cooks do that  . we were doing a  put a computer together  simulation which i am pretty is one of the jobs that lets you talk to each other . and actually this ended up a project that we had to end up doing together because it was too complicated . lots of her projects ended like this . her saying we need to work alone and then telling us we had to work together back on track i knew for a fact the  no job lets you do that  was bull becasue my grandma has a resultant and the workers are always joking around and stuff while working and at the local mcdonald  s and giant and all the other stores and restaurants well most the workers would talk and gossip to each other while packing bags or giving you your order . i tried to tell her this but she kept yelling so i just shut up and pretended to agree while listening to her rant on  emotional intelligence  and the ever so infamous  talking back  lecture . thirdly she tried little i mean pre k teaching methods to try to get us to do what she said . like saying if we didn  t do something that was school mandated i think not using phones . which all other teachers just ignored if it wasn  t while you still had work to do that the principal would  turn me into a toad  in ninth grade . we all knew one wizards aren  t realor at least publicly know secondly if he was a wizard why was he being a principal at a regular school ? so we just kept doing it while hiding it from her . there  s a bunch of other stuff or i could clarify on somethings if you want . tldr tech teacher tried to teach ninth graders like kindergarteners . was crazy loyal to to stupid rules .

2. thanks for the detailed response back i  m really the same way a lot of the time  i really only talk when it  s important to me and try to stay comfortable wherever i am with a calm attitude . i would rather observe than participate . it  s hard for others to  read  a person who acts so chill i don  t think being late would really affect someone else feeling uneasy around you  it  s not necessarily a  flaw  but could be misconstrued as being confident you  ll be okay if you  re late . i would definitely try to stop being late . you wanna be seen as putting in as much effort as everyone else . also , help out your coworkers ! especially the new ones  being the big kid on the block is intimidating especially if they don  t feel like they  re meeting your standards . ask someone who seems to be nervous around you for help to figure out nyc mass transit and see what happens  they might start to feel more comfortable . try to be a little less chill  most people are uncomfortable around others who seem to be confident in their silence because it kinda makes you seem like a stranger . try to observe others around you  are they asking questions often ? are they talking amongst themselves while you just observe ? what can you do to relate to them ? incorporate yourself into other peoples  lives and i think you  ll see a big change . in regards to meeting a girl  you should remember that women want to feel calm with their man  don  t try to throw out how chill you are  instead just show them a different side to you . as a first date do something really actively fun and faster paced like roller skating or an adult jump house . if they have strong opinions on something you kinda feel indifferent about , join along in their fury if it  s not that big of a deal . just little things to make you more relatable . relatable is the key word here for sure ! good luck

3. it ' s ultimately your choice to do what you wanna do . i ' m just a digit yr dude , typing on his phone . that said , if you do decide to follow through with your choice  i think it ' d only be fair for you to know , that you can ' t reverse it and that you certainly can ' t pursue your dreams to find love , friends or an enjoyable lifestyle , after you make that choice . if you do decide to keep striving at success , i ' d recommend you avoid your parents for a while , at least until you find a friend or two . finding friends is fairly easy , if you ' re in the right mindset . people enjoy hobbies some like sports , some like video games , some like a tv show  tv shows , some like movies , and just about everyone enjoys a genre or two of music , but most can ' t talk about it for too long . hobbies and interests are something you can start talking about , to basically anyone , at all . if you wanna make an attempt at a respectable life  i ' d recommend you find something that makes you a bit happy . watch something entertaining tv show , movie , sport , clip online etc . btw if you ' d like to see some crazy shit online , i ' ve been here for a while , i can show you some bizarre people and some really fucked up music genres , that you probably don ' t know about to strike up a conversation if you ' re having troubles  find a long break , in a conversation or a situation where you ' ll be standing  sitting next to someone for a while . you can strike up a conversation with someone if you ' ll be standing or sitting next to him  her for a while , anyway . most people prefer small talk over awkward silence . if that doesn ' t work for you  you can start philosophising about whatever you ' d like to  i . e . meaning of life , evolution of man , what makes the general poplation tick , what the general consensus on morality is and if we ' ll ever find any form of objective morality and my personal favorite if to some small extent  we all mildly enjoy seeing another in pain . i ' ve put a lot of thought into that philosophy , but don ' t wanna go into that now . anyways , back on topic  you can share your ideas with someone best by asking a question , regarding your philosophy . when this person answers , you can pop in with your own ideas as well . . . . . last note  you won ' t have the chance to be a good friend , to make other friends , or to be a good son if you don ' t respect yourself . if you want friends , just remember that they want a friend , too . if you want a proud father , just keep in mind that he wants a proud son why do you think he brought you into this world . you aren ' t this special turd among the special snowflakes . you are as good and as annoying as anyone else . the only difference among people who are annoying is the reason of annoyance . tl  dr ? if you wanna off yourself  nobody can stop you , unless if you turn yourself in and get institutionalized . however , nobody can really stop you from being yourself and making friends , either . i ' ve given you some small tips on how to talk to people side note  it will most likely be a tad awkward the first couple times , if you ' re a bit new to this . i know the feeling . whether you put this comment to use or not is up to you .

4. i did try to bring these points up before , they either got brushed off or lost in a giant web of bullshit .  i actually like carna because i think she added a new dimension to the tremere that wasn  t as explicit before they should ' ve used virstania , the lady who made the gargoyles , they even set that up in v20 when talking about how the gargoyles view her as their mother and if she picked a side in the conflict , then they would likely go with her .  you having shitty storytellers isn  t really the games fault , even if they are getting their shitty ideas from an incomplete reading of the rules . the thing is , if your system doesn ' t make the rules clearer , then it should ' ve been revised and reworked . at the very least , it needed more editing and proofreading before it went to the public .  it sounds like your group misunderstood , the beast , is intelligent because its you buddy . he  s already the one doing that when the st starts whispering at you . it  s talking to you through you . that voice is your voice in your head .   having the storyteller make nagging comments at you is outside your preference . maybe your storyteller leaned on it too often , maybe you just really don  t like that , but it  s not harming the personal horror , the same concepts are being explored . it might harm your enjoyment , and fair enough that  s fine , but it doesn  t mean the game is worse at doing what it does relative to previous editions and designer intention . that ' s actually about how often the beast affected me , this was over the course of an entire campaign , but the overall tone of monstrousness that it built just felt less like it was driven by my actions and more driven by the beast ' s words and tone . or as a real  world example , it ' s like when books come right out at the beginning and say what the moral  theme of the story is , as opposed to letting you figure it out yourself . it doesn ' t make it an overall worse book , but it is often something attributed to a different style of writing .  that  s an opinion , one that is also still flavored by your storyteller . honestly , it just sounds like your storyteller sucked at subtlety and picking the right moments .   once again though it doesn  t harm your personal horror , it  s still intact , it  s just your st didn  t handle it to your tastes . which is an interpersonal problem not the fault of the system . the beast will talk to you digit  digit times an digit  hour session at my table , and it  s less than a handful of sentences to reinforce what you are already going through yourself . so once again i think your primary issues with the game are not really the games fault , aside from the fact that they gave the tool for the st to fuck up with . that ' s the thing tho , like i said before , a lot of this is about taste , even mechanical issues are stuff i could bring up and somebody else might like them way more than i do . that ' s just a natural consequence of these sorts of discussions .  survivability is mathematically actually more balanced in this edition i would need to see the actual math play out to believe that , especially if somebody deals not  superficial damage .  i don  t necessarily think that  s the case , willpower was always too easy to invest in , it became a staple . now the person who puts their digit and digit into resolve and composure at char gen , is making an affirmative choice to be good at that , and is accepting their weaknesses because of that , this makes more compelling characters . and you still have digit digit  s to assign after that , so it  s not like you are gonna suck at your  core competencies  beyond that . digit in something is enough to do it professionally remember . i think the game is improved by the change because resolve and composure both fit into many many more rolls , they can actively participate in dice pools in a relevant way , therefore making expending resources on improving them more worthwhile . you also don  t have to be good at both to play a willful character , you could be exceptional at one and average in the other and still have a very good wp rating , so i think this point is pretty unfounded personally .   also we don  t play neonates and even our neonates were given bonus to spend as though they were starting at the same level as their sires in terms of for being a higher gen . so yeah no freebies for the newbie vamps , but you do get bonus to spend for making older characters . what fucking game do you play in ? i ' ve never had an st allow us to play something above neonates no matter how much i begged . aside from that , appearance was a useful stat to contribute to , i see it used in social situations a lot , particularly in visual communication  which is ironically far more important than verbal for humans in most cases . i also used it as a way to determine in how people treated you the first time they met you , no rolls , just pure appearance stat . it worked out well and rewarded people who wanted to play ' pretty ' characters much more often . both systems are fine in my book tho , the boost to charisma rolls certainly doesn ' t hurt . i still don ' t appreciate that you have to choose between willpower and socials  mentals being better and you don ' t have any freebies off the start to balance that out if it would fit your character better . and no , you don ' t need to be great at both , but it ' s very equivalent to mad from d  d , multi  ability score dependency . willpower was far more universally desirable than most traits , and thus making people choose between it and other stats feels like you now have to make much tougher choices instead of having the ability to be proficient at both at chargen if you want to divert your points that way . however if you have a shitload of at chargen that does seriously offset the issue and balance out the lack of freebies , but that ' s also a decision your st makes , not one of the book makes .  the  chance of a bestial failure is so insanely minuscule that hopefully when it does come up it  ll be adjudicated in a fun way because of its relative rarity compared to botches it  s a godsend , and on it  s own it adds flavor to  doing everything hungry  you are a predator after all , your first master will always be thirst . i mean , doing everything hungry doesn ' t really make sense , predators can be full . they can sleep , they can play , they can lounge around in the sun , they can mate , etc . without being hungry . i know you and i already disagree on the hunger mechanics , but i still just have a strong distate for the needing to murder somebody for hunger to go down to digit . like i said above , it ' s like the beast is holding your hand and going " no , no , you  have  to murder " , even if as a clever player you can roleplay it out to fit yourself , i was murdering before , trust me i murdered people a lot . see  brujah with celerity , potence and a claymore

5. let me hedge  disclaim before my super long answer  i ' m not sure about my faith right now . i ' m pretty inclined to stop saying i ' m a christian because , at this point , i just don ' t really believe in god . but it ' s complicated and i go back and forth . all my life i ' ve been a devout christian , so i feel i can provide relevant perspective to this question . i do get emotional and depressing at the end , so maybe don ' t read this if you will be depressed to read about why i am probably stopping being a christian . tl  dr which obviously misses the point , but oh well  don ' t love it  almost hate it , but i ' m suicidal anyway , so . probably not . some verses nt matter more than others . i could go either way . if we assume scriptural inerrancy , i lean toward the traditional view . if not , i lean toward saying paul was wrong , and that ' s ok , the bible can still be valuable . long version  digit . i do not love being gay . it ' s hard . do i hate it ? well , as others have said , i think the problem is with other people and society for making it so hard for gay people . just the same , i would rather not have been gay because being gay in my family  cultural context caused me to become a secretive person and i became depressed and suicidal . still am , but doing better . i think it ' s my suicidality that lets me say i ' d rather not be gay . i ' ll explain . i think lots of people , not just queer people , might look back on difficulties but when asked they ' d say , " i wouldn ' t change anything . those things have made me who i am today " like not getting into your top college choice , but then loving your life and friends after getting established at the one you did go to . you can ' t imagine your life without your friends , etc . there ' s often a sense that , since things are great now , i wouldn ' t want to change the past , ' cause then things would be worse . but i think that obviously doesn ' t make sense because you have no idea what would have happened . i think really , people don ' t want to die , and imagining yourself as a completely different person , is like imagining that someone else altogether had taken your place in life , and that ' s like never having existed . it ' s a known philosophical question with lots of related thought experiments like theseus ' ship and the star trek teleporter and others . you can find good youtube videos about it from crash course and cgpgrey . anyway , when you ' re suicidal , you often wish you had never existed . but it ' s really tricky thinking about questions like , " what if i had never been born " what i mean to say is , there is a line where being a " different " version of yourself , would be like not existing , and someone else taking your place . insignificant things about your life and recent things usually don ' t seem to define your identity , so they could be different without that existential threat . being gay has shaped so much of my life after the age i realized which was late relative to my peers that i am only ok saying , " i ' d rather not have been gay , " because i ' d also rather not have lived . harder question  " if you could stop being gay now , would you " answer  tempting but no , because so many christians around me would give other gay people an even harder time about stopping being gay . that ' s not how it works and i don ' t want a selfish miracle for just me . the good parts of being gay ? it has forced me to be more thoughtful , and to be kinder to minorities of all kinds . there ' s more to it than that , but the bad parts are easy to figure out . i think the good parts will be further revealed as i live my life going forward , given that i ' ve resolved not to kill myself . maybe one day i ' ll love being gay . digit and digit . my concept of sin changed throughout my life . sin could be thought of like breaking rules . ok , not too bad a definition , i guess . later i thought of it more like , " in any given situation , there are choices , and some would be wrong . that ' s sin " then i thought of it like , " just be in relationship with god . the rules we ' ve come up with may be right , but they shouldn ' t be the source of the information . we should just be really close to god , then we ' ll always know what ' s sin " still later this changed from a notion of " we ' ll know because god will tell us when we need to know " to " we ' ll know because we will have trained our hearts to love what he loves " this was a key moment in my faith , when lots of other things were also going on . i could explain it from a lot of angles , but it was important . we can ' t just claim to be right because we ' re hooked up to god , because so many disagreeing people have done and still do that . we need humility so that we can hear criticism and hope to apply it , and we need reason  so that we can recognize good criticism . different faith traditions have different doctrine on how we decide what ' s right . i like the anglican and wesleyan doctrines  scripture  tradition  reason  spirit i think . people criticize american evangelicals and others e . g . the gospel coalition , " reformed " traditions , which is basically what i have been for being all scripture and no tradition . people criticize catholicism and orthodoxy for being all tradition . humorously , you could say that episcopalians who are anglicans and pentecostals probably both get criticism for relying too much on just following the spirit , though in really different ways . consistently in all areas of christianity in my experience , there is the belief that it is very possible to rely too much on reason alone . i spent a while it was several years , but i can ' t say it was a long time because others have spent much longer believing that i would simply have to not act on my attractions toward other guys . much of that time i also believed i could change to stop having them . i have always wanted to be a dad and a spouse , still do , when i ' m not too depressed , so i just thought i ' d marry a woman , or maybe be celibate if that seemed better . i was a really really persistently happy person , and besides as a conservative christian teen , you don ' t have pressure about finding a spouse yet until you ' re digit , then go ahead and get married as soon as possible , so it was only in college , having friends with so ' s , and finally having my first crush ever it was on a guy , my best friend , and i fell for him hard before i knew what hit me , that i realized i could not handle marrying a girl , and i first realized what i ' d be missing if i were to be celibate . yeah , that was rough . before that and during that time , i actively kept myself from imagining what life would be like with a husband . i didn ' t want to think about it if i couldn ' t have it . i decided i had to be ok with celibacy before i could decide whether gay marriage was ok , and someone convinced me i also had to think about having a husband to be able to weigh the options . even now , i find it valuable to remind myself that it ' s unhealthy to think that i could not be ok living on my own i ' ve thought about it  i personally wouldn ' t be into hooking up , so for me the options are being celibate or being in a committed relationship . i tell myself , " if you could not imagine life without a husband , then digit you ' re not honestly able to consider the option fairly , and digit you will make an unhealthy partner for whomever you get involved with " that said , i think singleness is a better choice for some than others , and i think some are particularly suited fo in need of marriage  partnership . having made efforts to keep myself from being terribly biased obviously impossible to be completely unbiased , but i ' m big on unbiasedness , i really care , so i always tried my best to check myself , i considered the arguments , especially scripture . it ' s so much more confusing than so many christians give it credit for . i sincerely cannot respect intellectually the opinions of anyone who says , " the bible clearly says homosexuality is a sin , so that settles it " interestingly though , i absolutely feel equally little respect for anyone who says , " i don ' t see how anyone could ever think homosexuality could be wrong " if you ' re not a christian and you grew up in the modern culture , sure , why should you think it ' s wrong ? but for anyone else , anyone hoping to have any ear with christians , it grinds my gears because they are obviously just as thoughtless . you can find books , blog posts , videos , and certainly sermons on the verses themselves from all sorts of different hermeneutical perspectives , which you should do if you ' re a christian who cares . i think the old testament verses are less pertinent not irrelevant , though to this discussion than the new testament . short version of why that is  lv . is clearer in the language and original implications , but modern application given the rest of the ot ? super murky , honestly . for genesis , cultural context of gang rape plus ezekiel puts considerable doubt not complete doubt on the sodom and gomorrah story being relevant . nt is wondering what it ' s talking about where we have translated " homosexuality " in some versions , so that ' s something to talk about . continued in subcomment

6. honestly that depends where you are in the world . i love gumtree , but if you ' re in the states you might want to try craigslist and  or facebook along with other more local advertising spots . second hand shops can also sometimes carry animal cages . i guess i can try craigslist . what is a " second hand shop ?  potentially . do you know how old they are ? boys tend to scrap a little as they hit a hormonal phase around digit months , and calm down somewhat after . however not all male rats will calm down and sometimes neutering is needed to get their hormones in check . have you used the cage calculator on their current set up ? obviously a new cage should be found but if it ' s tiny , it might be another reason to get a new one asap . they are about a year old . i got them for christmas last year , along with their aquarium . i just used the calculator , and it said it ' s too small . how big do i need , then ? it didn ' t say .  yes ! i would just switch to the complete mix . are they rat nuggets ? something similar ? they ' re generally much better for your rats . seed mixes contain things like alfalfa which rats don ' t need and won ' t eat and dried corn which can be dangerous for rats . they also tend to be much higher in protein , which is bad for rats . i ' ll switch to just that kind , then .  diarrhoea in rats is uncommon , do you feed fresh vegetables rats need this in their diet too ? the most often cause is overfeeding of something watery like cucumber and isn ' t usually a long term problem . no , the only thing i feed them is what i ' ve mentioned . i also give them treats little yogurt drops , i think banana flavored . i gave them carrots once but that ' s all they ' ve ever had . also , wow , after reading that , i really feel like a crappy owner .  i ' ve never had a cat , so i can ' t advise there . however it ' s useful to first get a litter tray , usually a corner unit , and fill it with a different type of bedding . i don ' t think anything would fit . i got them a wheel but it doesn ' t fit so they don ' t use it .  then it ' s merely a case of moving their poops to the tray and leaving them there . whenever you see them poop outside , move it to the tray . repeat for as long as it takes for them to get that it ' s their new ' poop ' spot . you can try treating them after they go there too if you catch them . be aware though this generally only works for poop . rats tend to urinate to scent mark their way around , this can ' t be trained away . however they  do  like to pick a spot to poo in , so it ' s a fairly simple task of encouraging them to do this where you want . so i should like , actually pick up their poops and move them ? i ' ve always just let it accumulate and then dump all of the bedding after a week and replace it with fresh bedding .  the only thing i can say here is try to make it a habit to get them out  after you come home from work or school , get them out on your bed for digit min . the same time every day , or in the morning as you ' re getting ready . i have an extremely irregular schedule . some days i ' m up at 4am and some days i ' m up at 4pm . does it need to be regular ?  but being kept in their cage for a week will get very boring for them .   if you truly don ' t think you can take care of them then there is also no shame in giving them up for adoption . i think i ' m going to do this , honestly . this sounds like too much for me right now .  just make sure that if you do that , you charge you do not want them going for snake food and you make sure their next owner is knowledgeable . what do you mean ' charge ' ? like ask them for money ? i feel like that ' s a bit odd , if i ' m trying to get rid of them .

7. so i don ' t have personal experience with this yet , but i have wanted to change my name for about digit years now . i ' m about to finish college and might be moving away soon , so now seems like a pretty good time to go through with it . anyway , to answer your questions  1a as far as i can tell , most places that require a formal change e . g . your job , bank accounts , ect . are able to easily change people ' s names in their system probably because of people changing their name when they get married so that should be fairly straightforward . some places  like banks  may require proof that the name change is legal , but just show them a copy of the deed poll . please note  i live in the uk  the rules might be different where you live . 1b i ' ve found it really helpful to talk to a friend about changing my name . i told a couple of friends , but we ' ve only spoken about it on skype , never face  to  face , but recently i ' ve been talking to one of my friends about it in real life , not online , and it ' s so affirming , if that makes sense . before , i felt like it was all in my head , but having someone to talk to about it and again i emphasise a face  to  face discussion makes it feel not  weird . she ' s even offered suggestions for me . digit as far as explaining it to people goes , i haven ' t really had to fully explain my reasons to anyone . none of my friends really asked why , or if they did , they were satisfied with the ' i just hate my name and i am able to change it , so why shouldn ' t i ? ' explanation . i plan on having different ' levels ' of explanation , depending on who asks . so the first level would be ' because i want to ' which would be for acquaintances and people i don ' t know very well . then ' growing up , i really didn ' t like my name . it caused me a lot of grief , and i decided to move away from that , ' for the next level , for people i know better , and then for people i know really well and trust , the last level would be the full story , which is quite long and this message is long enough as it is but i ' m happy to share if you ' re interested . digit in the dating world , if you ' ve never met them before , just introduce yourself with your new name . they won ' t know that you were ever called anything else . you can tell them about your name change in time , but there ' s no need to do it right away . digit i mean , there ' s no limit on the number of times you can change your name that i know of anyway but if you change it too often , i think people will stop taking it seriously , or just get mixed up with which name you have at any given time . once you have a good idea of the name you want to use , try introducing yourself with it online . if your username doesn ' t have any actual names in it like mine here then you can introduce yourself with a different name to each person if you want , and just see if one feels right . when you ' re comfortable with that , try using it as a username . i ' d recommend getting people to call you the new name socially before you legally change it , so you can get used to it , and it won ' t be too much of a hassle if you change your mind . lastly , i would like to add that you ' re not a fraud . it feels weird at first and lots of people who change their name feel as if they ' re lying when they use their new name . you ' re not . you ' re used to being called one thing and now you ' re answering to something different , and that takes time to get used to . don ' t let anyone make you feel bad about it .

8. for me , the hermeneutic most valuable after wading through all the nitty gritty you do first have to go through all the nitty gritty , though is authorial intent . it tries to soothe problems of other objective  seeming lenses that dive deep into the language it ' s not necessarily exclusive of other hermeneutic lenses though . it can be summed up as , " what does paul actually mean when he ' s writing this " factor in cultural context which i do think is important , and you can ask , " would paul condemn the modern homosexuality we know today " honestly , i think he might . it ' s really hard to say . i agonized over this so hard for so long , and i only started to agonize less over it when i started to be suicidal , nihilistic , and to doubt my faith as a whole . also , i felt more and more compelled by the evidence of these few gay people i knew who had come out and gotten married who were so so so much happier than when they had been closeted gay christians . the celibate gay christians i knew were also happier to have come to a steady position , and for those who were out to be out . they obviously were still bearing a difficult cross though , as we say . married people talk about how hard marriage is , and it is , but when they were single they were looking hopefully toward marriage , and they really cannot compare the two that well . the people who commit to and live out singleness and celibacy when they would really love to get married , now that ' s hard . this evidence made me think a few things held loosely , and always with my investigation of scripture in mind  digit accepting that you ' ll probably never be straight is healthy , digit coming out is healthy , if no one will kick you out and you will have some support , digit marriage is healthy , if it doesn ' t violate your conscience . these flew in the face of the scriptures anyway . that is , even if paul would have condemned modern homosexuality . no , i should not say that . these reasonable but not ironclad conclusions , based on personal experience and that one study of lgbt mormons that john dehlin et . al . did , would seem to fly in the face of conservative  traditional interpretation of paul ' s writings . so many christians i would have grown up trusting had it not been for turning out gay said the " gay lifestyle " was destructive . by which they meant any life that included gay relationships would cease to have god ' s blessings , to whatever extent his blessings exist on earth . they said that calling myself gay was throwing out the godly inheritance i had received , that i won ' t be saved , and they said a lot more . we ' re on reddit where i can only hope we ' ve all learned to thicken our skin against such verbal attacks , but i mean , like , coming from your mom , that ' s really hurtful , really dire stuff . she wouldn ' t let me talk to my younger siblings about being gay , and blames be entirely for the distance that has grown between us . i ' m gonna try to keep myself from tearing up right now . i think you can tell that i can ' t be completely unbiased because it ' s very personal . but if one of those " lifestyles " is supposedly right and the other wrong , it ' s gotta be my conservative christian mom who ' s wrong , and the progressive , liberal , christians or non christians who are right . and yeah i just divided the christians and placed some of them with non  christians and called that the better group . which means that on this topic , " christianity " might not be as good as other things at showing how to live a good , right life . which leads me to why i doubt my faith . ultimately , i feel it ' s no consolation to live in the system that is " biblically consistent " when it is so obviously wrong . scripture may condemn homosexual behavior not self  identification , i believe , but i feel like there ' s little to no evidence outside of scripture to support claims that homosexuality is wrong , and there is in fact some evidence to support that it ' s really very healthy for naturally homosexual people to pursue homosexual relationships . so non  christian people are getting life right by listening , thinking it through , and being willing to change their culture , while christians are largely unwilling to do the same , but those who are willing have to rework their doctrine . and then it ' s true , i could be left with the option of any of several progressive versions of christianity , but at this point , why should i ? if christianity is not a help and guide , but is rather something that needs to be corrected all the time to allow for truth and healthiness  if it is almost just a hindrance to living a good life , why should i be a christian ? i wouldn ' t . then the only thing left is just god . let god be true , and every man a liar , right ? well , ok , so i entertain the thought that a lot of what i thought about god is wrong , but that he ' s still there , and he still loves perfectly . but i feel like i ' d need to actually be shown that he really is there , that something supernatural is in the world , more than just the nihilistic world i can see . i am already missing so much of my formefading christian life , but one thing i did not expect to miss is the songs . i realize now how i always got so emotionally invested in the worship songs . i can be excited , but otherwise my emotions are guarded , especially negative ones . i am almost never visibly angry , upset , etc with or around people , but i have literally been trained since infancy , no since i was in the womb , to pour my heart out in christian worships songs . so i am accustomed to feeling my strongest emotions while singing . you know how crying is cathartic ? i have such strong inhibitions around crying that i can rarely manage it , even when i need to , but emotionally pouring myself into songs is the next best thing . or maybe it ' s even better . but it ' s so hard now that i don ' t really agree with the lyrics of christian songs , because there ' s nothing else i know that ' s deeply emotional and contemplative . i went through that phase as reformed young people do where i hated all those shallow worship songs that are just constantly saying vapid combinations of the same words and phrases , and then i found my favorite singer , audrey assad . and her new album , which i have early ' cause i pledged to help fund it , is kind of all about this . this place of almost abandoning faith , but then finding that last kernel of it , which is raw and pure and so healing . plus a lot of her music and faith journey has led up to it . and it ' s just so heartbreaking for me , because as much as i love her and respect her , as well as so many of my christian friends who are truly being thoughtful with their faith , i just don ' t feel like i ' m landing there . and as much as i ' d love to just choose to believe , i feel much too dedicated to the need to believe only what i find is actually right and true . i don ' t think it will work for me . it would be tricking myself into believing something that i don ' t really think is true . i can ' t stand most instances of just believing sans evidence . so many other things in life are clearly bad to believe just because you want to believe them . i feel like i would have to believe based on a better reason than that . but now it ' s so lonely and sad , because i ' m losing a dear means of emotional handling  release prayer and songs , and i ' m losing all my friends . they won ' t ostracize me , but it ' s just different when one of a group of really dedicated christians leaves the faith . yes , pretty much all of my friends are christians , and all so devout . for those who know how i feel lately , it ' s really hard for them too . i am preparing to tell my parents , which is actually even harder than , though obviously related to , coming out as gay .

9. not at all . those are really great questions and oerfectly normal for you to he wondering about . mimd you , i ' m also not a professional so this is more a matter of opinion from personal experience . not those few things just makes a person a narc . there will be other signs for you to able to know . its true when they say , the similiarities between stories between people who have been abused by a narc are uncanny . there are so many signs that play into a narcissist that it will go so far back into your relationship you will feel like there has been a blindfold lifted from your eyes when you start putting it all together . and for me , i used to make up excuses for my nex . he used to ignore me to no end . if we were in an argument . he never once would apologize and admit he ' s wrong . he never once would say " i understand where you are coming from " . he would forcefully put me down in any way he could to get to me . so the majority of the time his tactic would be to ignore me , " avoid " and wait it out until i gave in and let thr matter fall under the table . when i didn ' t let up and never let thr matter go , i would withstand the horrible horrible things he would say to me and still stand tall defending myself . its then he would say something along the lines of " i ' m just not good at it " . and i was letting him use that lie for so long . it was just am excuse he made up to get him off the hook . and this is why . any person is capable of meeting you in the middle . someone who is on the narc spectrum usually is not . anyone is capabke of holding themselves accountable and acknowledging your feelings . a narc is not . but they can pretend when forced to if it comes down to it . i used to question it too and let that excuse be used . sure , there are plenty of partners out there who have a terribly hard time with confrontation . have a hard time dealing with issues snd stress . cant effectively communicate . but are those same guys gaslighting you to no end ? are thise same guys love bombing you ? using triangulation techniques to make you feel smaller and crazier than what you are ? are those same guys manipulating you to make you believe that you are the wrong one always ? that ' s not normal . that kind of thing doesnt happen in a proper relationship . not one person is always wrong . is that same person using the hot and cold technique to make you feel as if you need to over compensate i ' m order to earn their love back ? to make you put a part of yourself aside so that you can be more acceptable for them ? those types of things do not happen in a happily functioning relationship . so my answer is , no not those one thing will make a person a narc . but the accumulation of manipulative techniques does . and it can only be confirmed by a real professional , which i am not . but i do feel pretty educated seeing as i have been putting a lot of research and evaluation into my own personal situation . and my nex is bot the first narc in my life either . what really confirmed it for me is a pretty recent event . he threw a giant surprise party for our mutual friend and didnt invite me . when i called him out on it he then started gaslighting me by turning the situation around on me and saying i never come around . my argumemt is how could i come around if in not invited . he then started saying horrible things to me about how no one likes me and i am not good enough and i would have made the entire party about myself projection and ruoned the entire thing . so i blocked him on all forms . except i forgot to block email . i brought it to a level i never would have done in the past . a couple of days later i received a huge apology for everything he knows that bothered me . he should have treated me right . treated me for the gem that i am . he should have apologized more . he should have been there more . been more involved with my family . been more supportive if my goals and future . i taught him what love really is . he should have treated me better . well , two emails later he turned around and started saying how horrible i am . gas lighting i am lying and manipulative projection . i am not responsible more sensible enough of a person to know when i ' m right or wrong and i can ' t tell the difference . i don ' t deserve to be in a relationship because i am not good enough to hold someone else ' s heart in my hands . he feels sorry for me . and i have a long road ahead of me . digit  of the memories he has of me in the last digit years i made him miserable . oh , he also said that my therapist doesn ' t know the real me . only the me that they ' re being paid to know ajd they ' re only being nice to me because they are being paid too . so you see , he love bombed me basically and then turned around and threw it in my face . it makes the original apology void . in the past , i would not have blocked him . i would not have stood my ground snd gone no contact . in the past i would have accepted that maybe i wasnt good enough to be at that party and i really would have ruined it . that no one would want me there . i would have let him ignore me . i would hsve accepted the excuse that he ' s just not good at communicating . well , thats all bullshit because i ' ve been dealing with it for digit years . and there ' s always a lie . and always an excuse . and it was always followed by being ignored . and i would let him do it . and then he would wait it out without saying a word and then come back to me like nothing ever happened . but since i didn ' t this time it resulted in a major love bombing and gas lighting that hit the nail on the head for me . i hope that offers you some insight . i ' m sorry its a lot to read but i really wanted to give you a lot so you can develop your own opinion on it since i can ' t quite answer that question from you in a professional manner .

10. " sir . " i try to interject but the old bearded man keeps shouting . " i can ' t find a damn thing in this place ! " his face has turned a boiling red , in contrast with his milky white eyes . steam shoots from his ears . " sir ! you ' re looking in the wrong cupboard ! " i shout , " sit down ! let me help you ! " " speak up , boy , i can barely hear you . " he grumbles , " sit down ? oh fine . " i pull up a chair and he settles down into it . " teacup ! " he shouts , and i hurry to retrieve one . i place it in his left hand and he points his right finger at it . a stream of boiling water pours from the tip of his finger like the spout of a teapot . i hand him a tea bag . " so what were you looking for , sir ? " " ahh . just an old book . what ' s the point anyway ? i can ' t even read the thing . can you read ancient greek ? " i admit that i can ' t and avoid mentioning that we are in the kitchen , not the library . i also don ' t know my way around very well , so i ' m a bit relieved . the building we are in is not a conventional home . it is a grand , curling spire dozens of stories high . this would be a problem for the old man if he were not able to float , up or down , straight through the center of the spiral staircase , easily arriving at a floor usually the wrong one much faster than i can climb the steps . " why did you need the book , sir ? " i ask , " what are we doing today ? " " ah the village by the river has a bridge troll they need taken care of . the messengers are on their way here now . " i know better than to ask how he knows this . he continues , " i remember the spell anyway . no one else can be bothered to learn the stupid things . " or no one has the ability . the old man , while grumpy and difficult , is also the greatest wizard alive . he is known as the wizard with no name although he hates the title , assuring me he does have a name . he also says his name is probably unpronounceable for me and might make my heart stop beating . i have been his assistant for digit weeks , in exchange only for room and board . i am an orphan and this is the only apprenticeship i can find , although i know i have been treated much better in town since becoming associated with the wizard . just then , i hear the loud knocker at the front door bang through the tower . " well ? " the old wizard says , " get a move on . " i hustle down the hundreds of steps , watch the wizard float down past me , and arrive at the door as he waves his hand and it slowly opens . two horsemen stand outside with four horses , wearing the light armor of provincial soldiers . the messengers jump a bit then take a step forward . " great wizard ! " one begins , " we have traveled fifty miles to retrieve you ! our town is under attack . " " bridge troll ! " the wizard loudly interrupts . " it ' s just a damn bridge troll and you fools can ' t simply kill the thing . but fine , i ' ll deal with your troll in exchange for a small yearly tithe . " the messengers cringe , knowing how poor their town is , but the wizard doesn ' t see the reaction and they agree on a portion of the harvest for the payment . the wizard smiles , " good ! now that payment is settled , where are your horses ? i know i ' ve been smelling some . " i lead the wizard to a horse and he floats onto it while the soldiers gape . i mount one beside him . " take your time getting back , " he says to them , " it should all be cleared up by then . " we trot off but all movement by the horse seems uncomfortable to the wizard . strangely he nudges his horse to go faster and faster and i urge mine to match him . as we ride the horses seem to bounce less and less . one lets out a loud whinny and i look down to see that their hooves are floating above the surface of the ground . the horses seem to know where they ' re going because at this point the wizard is feeling around in his beard for fuzz or food . we arrive in the town in two hours , much faster than the eight hours the fifty miles would normally take . as soon as we near the perimeter i hear the sound of fire and screams . we slow our horses and trot forward until the troll comes into view . it is a monstrous beast , taller than rooftops , grabbing women and children where it can while the men fight to hold it back and secure the town ' s population in the large central church . " how big is it ? " the wizard asks . " about digit feet tall ? " i guess . he chuckles , " they ' ve been procrastinating , huh ? alright bring me to it ? " " bring you . to it ? " i ask hesitantly . " don ' t make me repeat myself boy . how else am i supposed to handle it ? " i shudder then grab his horse ' s lead . i walk our horses through the town . the soldiers shout at us to get back as we pass their perimeter and we ignore them . eighty yards away the troll notices us . " he saw us , " i say , " straight ahead . " " good , " the wizard smiles . he cracks his long fingers . suddenly , a flurry of words burst out of his mouth . in it , i hear what seem to be thousands of unique sounds adding up to dozens of languages . i hear a goat ' s bleat , snake ' s hiss and baby ' s laugh . i hear words that sound as powerful as crashing waves and silences as deep as the moment before dawn . my vision shrinks into a black tunnel until suddenly the words stop . i see the bridge troll frozen in place . it slowly falls with a huge crash like a massive tree . " good , " the old wizard grins , " now show me to the food . i ' m hungry . "

11. so , let  s break this down , folks .  i beg the principle by which you derive the conclusion that he is in debt owing to his donators . the very nature of donation implies no need for reimbursement . if a refund were a reasonable expectation , then that implies something had been purchased . in fact , no such trade was agreed upon . people willingly donated to support the arts they appreciated specifically spoony ' s . this was not a loan situation . why must so many people die on this indefensible hill ? from the patreon community guidelines page   patreon is for artists , creators , and people who bring ideas . don  t put up fake pages or collect money for things you  re not actually doing . you also can  t use patreon as a prank or to fund non  activity .  that seems very clearly what spoony is doing . collecting money for things he is not actually doing .  giving out of love or support , even if it is for a person ' s product and not just for themselves , comes with no strings attached . if you give , or if another gives , and then demand return on the investment , that is a false gift , and you are reneging , or in other words cheating on your gift children call it indian giving , but that is offensive for obvious reasons . it is an extremely bad sign of character . it is not presented by spoony as  no strings attached  . he attached them when he put rewards up . rewards he is not delivering on . it is a gift exchange , agreed upon by both parties . i give him something , he gives me something . so far , he has gotten a lot of somethings and given barely any back out .  everyone keeps calling him a scammer , but the very nature of his supposed promises on patreon is that they are supposed to be projects that he would attempt , and or things and activities that he would try to give back to show appreciation for the support of those donating fans . correct . and he has seemingly failed to even attempt many of these activities .  it is ridiculous to inflate his lack of production into some kind of premeditated , draconic , dastardly , mustache curling scam to gain money , and then screw himself out of the money that he so cleverly thieved away by very cleverly destroying his source of income . does anyone really take this premise seriously ? do you think he is a scheming thief or a bungling failure ? he ' s either good at robbing , or bad at making a living . which one is it ? premeditated ? probably not . bungling failure is probably the closest to the truth . the dude is fucking himself over , which is sad .  there ' s one very simple answer to anyone who claims that spoony orchestrated a planned scheme to steal from his fans and is thus guilty of theft  why would you steal from people who are already paying you for next to no work ? why in the name of reason would anyone choose to fuck over their main support in favor of . essentially nothing positive ? it makes no sense . indeed , it does make no sense . which is why i  m surprised he  s doing it . he really either needs to just throw in the towel and call it quits or start producing again . this limbo state his patreon and site are in is just a sign of what many perceive as apathy at best and wholly dishonest at worst .  just let it go . you ' re angry at the guy because you ' re either a millennial that feels like they deserve to be treated as more of a priority , or you ' re from generation x and you grew up thinking life was business and money , and any kind of moving of money is necessarily a purchase of goods or services and must be rewarded in some way . i  m not angry at noah . i  m really not . i  m actually sad that i get no content from him , because i really enjoyed it . and your strawmen arguments hold no sway here . it is very simple  by putting up rewards , he agreed to provide them in return for money . he has consistently failed to do so . no more , no less .  if the case is the former , then please try to remember that the man is only a flawed human , who happens to be unfortunately not so good at sustaining his own productivity for reasons that really aren ' t your concern . if the case is the latter , then you need to catch up with the world , or you ' re going to have some serious issues in the future as we continue to progress as a technological and information based society . they say generals always fight the last war . well , things are moving at the pace of progress right now , and it is observably mathematically evident that society is evolving at an exponential rate . your childhood does not represent even the world of twenty years later at this point , and you need to adapt . be flexible and try to understand that those acts of donation on the internet in no way come with a bill of sale , contract of reimbursement , or value estimation . yes , he is flawed . and he is not owning up to those flaws and admitting defeat or conquering them to become a better creator . he is just ignoring his patrons . now , the middle of that is a bunch of meaningless platitudes that have no bearing on the conversation , so i  ll skip to the end  these donations did come with an expectation of reimbursement . by spoony . himself . he said that if you give him x amount of money , he would give you y content . that . is . a . business . transaction .
