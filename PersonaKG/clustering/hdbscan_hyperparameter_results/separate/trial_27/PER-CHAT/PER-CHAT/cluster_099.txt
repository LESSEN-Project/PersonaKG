7. with soccefootball there are so many players around the world , plus the transfeloan system , it makes it easy for the wealthy clubs to acquire good players . in the nba it ' s a lot more difficult , sometimes there is nothing they can do . teams like the lakers and knicks would have been relegated a few years ago , despite how big of fan bases and wealth they have .

   (ID: 1885b01dd0970230fea2a9c9ae9c4eaeaceb59a3)

18. yeah if the case cover is off i would suspect bad contact of the cooler to the cpu . with a good aftermarket cooler you shouldn  t be seeing temps like that .
   (ID: e7516540d2045135f43a4a7c61f0bd88856c8ff4)

19. good question . seems to me like they might be able to answer quite a few of the questions around this case by discreetly placing a camera to catch whoever is desecrating the grave .
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)
