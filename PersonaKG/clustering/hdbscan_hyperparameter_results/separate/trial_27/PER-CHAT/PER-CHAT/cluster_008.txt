3. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .

4. they always signed us up for whatever activities we wanted to do hockey , baseball , figure skating , dance , etc . and made sure they brought us to every single lesson or game . not only did these activities teach me so much about goal setting and working with other people , it showed me how to support the people you love .

11. that ' s honestly worse to me . none of the dozen people in the household noticed the kid was gone , or if they did none of them said anything . usually in big families the older kids are at least partially talked with watching the younger ones . several people dropped the ball .

13. i enjoyed the 90s way too much . i just downloaded music from the radio to my tape deck . i had e  mail , but the only people i would mail with were the people i met on vacation . i had a mobile phone , but it wasn ' t that important . i would get a text or a call in the weekends from friends asking to hang out . you could still do stupid stuff without being worried you ' d get yourself filmed . we did a lot of drugs . it was such a great decade !

14. i  m thinking the things floating in the sky at the end could each be a boss which i would welcome . as for the story . i  m presuming some type of asteroid hits and started life . we were around for thousands of years and then another one hit and practically ended everyone  s lives and a handful of people survived perhaps ? but something was brought with it ? perhaps the baby is the last child . random but did anyone see any females in any of the trailers ? maybe why the baby is in some artificial life preserving machine and not a lady  s stomach ? maybe females were wiped out ?
