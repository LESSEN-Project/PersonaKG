4. surely there ' s comfort in knowing there ' s absolutely nothing you can do about the eventual heat death of the universe . it ' s out of your control so just let it be . you don ' t know that this universe doesn ' t collapse down to a single point and birth anew with another big bang . either way i ' ll be long dead so it matters not

5. i mean if he thinks he deserves higher wages and can get it elsewhere he just might . plus we don  t know how well mahrez will play in our system . it  s in the realm of possibility . maybe unlikely at the moment , but i hope to have this set of attackers for years to come . barring when aguero goes back to independiente

8. just like this . you don  t know me , you don  t even know what my beliefs are . you just assume that i don  t have a happy , fulfilling , good life because i don  t believe the same as you . you are wrong . stop being so arrogant and pushy about your religion . i already know just about everything there is to know about your religion , and i don  t believe . let it go .

   (ID: eb0cdac3cc0d373669b221df2a54b8040cfa1dde)

11. i mean , i get it . we grow up and suddenly we ' re responsible for our own survival , when we only exist because someone else wanted us to . why do i have to get a job and pay bills and all that shitty stuff , when my parents are the ones that put me here ? don ' t know that you can really win in a court of law , and maybe you should suck it up and just deal . but i get it .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

12. used to love watching epic rap battles . i don ' t even really know what i ' m looking for . i just know there ' s a lot of channels out there that don ' t get much exposure but have epic content . that ' s kinda what i ' m looking for .
   (ID: 52a73bb08e8d0c340dad3146d5a3b7b25137dfae)

13. the rest of the post is sweet , just one question . wasnt it the parshmen who willfully gave up their spren to avoid extermination ? i know radiants  humans figured out how to capture them , but i don ' t recall them extracting spren from the parshmen .

14. you do realize that its frozen before cut don ' t you ? and yes i know that for a fact my son just had it done last week .

15. i mean if it ' s installed properly it should be in there pretty well but if you pulled any out i would have it looked at just to be safe . you really don ' t know how well it was installed

16. the main flaw i see with many answers is threefold . negotiating will be difficult when you don  t know the language . even shakespearean english could be a rough adjustment . depending on whom you are negotiating with , they may just take it . and , if you bring back something that appears too shocking , threatening or evil , you might meet your maker rather quickly .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

17. i don ' t know really , however . i hope something happens , the thought of everything just ending is kind of depressing
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

18. so i created this power setup for seablock , and it works sometimes but other times the boiler is just sat without fuel for a while . i know it ' s a vague explanation but i don ' t know that much about it myself , was hoping anyone could help ?
   (ID: ae523af408f5ede28b0592f69a7488ab41bb519a)

19. honestly , i don ' t know . i ' m agnostic myself so i believe that there ' s just no way we can be sure of anything one way or the other . i wish i could suspend my sense of reality enough to fully believe in a heaven . i would seriously love to just know for sure i was going to see my grandma again one day .

20. i don ' t know what kind of eye corrections he had done but when i had mine done i needed full wrap glasses that were technically out of regs they came with a lanyard so i still was able to do pt and normal day to day activities . depending on what was done you could end up doing irreparable damage to his eyesight . dick for not informing anyone and placed himself at risk but if he has a profile he ' s got a profile not much you can do . could nc him technically for not keeping everyone in the loop but that would just be reaching imo .
