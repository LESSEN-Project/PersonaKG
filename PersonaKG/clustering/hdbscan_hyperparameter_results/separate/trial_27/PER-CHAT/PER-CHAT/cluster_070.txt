1. but you ' re expecting the outcome of making fire and trying to achieve it . if you had no concept of what it was or where it came from , why would you believe you could make it , or try to ? you know it can be made by friction and other sources . they apparently only know it comes from lightening . and they can ' t make that , so they have no reason to try rubbing sticks together .
