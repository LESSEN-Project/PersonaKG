1. if you hold people to impossible standards , you ' re going to be disappointed . what if the perfect man for you isn ' t exactly " hollywood handsome ? " you ' re excluding a lot of people because you ' re too picky . also , you might not be as great as you think . if you ' re so great and you ' re still single , there might be a reason . maybe your personality .

2. i also got a message from what i think is the same guy . the dude is probably on this sub , looking for people to harass . what a sad human being .

3. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it

4. i think it ' s more of a celebration than a " get people back into the game " sort of deal .

5. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .

6. i wanna day superspeed but the toggle part makes me think you mean i  ll be super fast at all times and can  t move normally to interact with people anymore
   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

7. i agree . do you think it ' s white people ' s fault that the number of black people in these fields is so small , like a lot of people think ?

8. i used to work as a gas agent , until medical meant i couldn ' t do it any more . one of the major aspects of my job was delivering 45kg bottles . this is less dangerous than most people think it is . i can even surmise , that the reason they are doing this , is that there is not enough pressure in the gas bottle for it to run . there are two ways to add pressure . direct heat . or compressed air . direct heat is the less likely to kill you option of those two . the real question is whether they have the taps open or not . if they dont , the pressure release valve will pop and then that gas will ignite and basically create a flamethrower .

9. think long and and about the history of black and white people in this country . now tell me . why do you think it ' s not considered racist ?
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

10. no . okay , think about it like this  people are made up of atoms , and when you die your atoms go off and become other things . this means that every girl would most likely be made up of atoms that were once in a dude , so if you bang her you are technically banging a dude , and that ' s fucking gay .

11. and back to your original premise , i believe that governments are not the answer . i see large central governments are the forces that hinder growth and human potential . i look at the current western governments and all the rules and regulations , paperwork bureaucracy covered in red tape and piles of waste  and , more importantly , the cousins and cronies who suck off the tit of the people ' s hard work . i think governments should be limited in their tasks and duties . i view the constitution as a contract to the citizens that clearly spells out the limits of governmental reach . the larger question , though , is why communism ? why do you believe that an overwhelming state structure is the way to go ? what appeals to you that you think it is the best system , especially with so many failures throughout history ?

12. but i ' m sure you can win people over . i ' m not a politician , i couldn ' t care even less what other people think , nor do i have such responsibility to do so . what ' s best isn ' t the same thing as what most people think .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

13. when i discovered that there are a lot , and i mean a lot , of people out there that think the government can , and should , fix all their problems . craziness .
   (ID: 7f3ed7262bf05d9d101b2b917869b90e43710a7a)

14. the staring . of all the things i found difficult over there , staring was one of the worst . you might think that being taught not to stare at funny  looking people is common for children around the world . nope . and what do you do when it ' s a parent and their child , staring and pointing together , like they ' re watching an orangutan at a zoo ?
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

15. there ' s someone for everyone  they ' re out they ' re waiting you and all other shitty variations to give people false hope . to me it ' s better to think " if it happens , it happens "
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

16. do you have any proof for who is bot ? you people keep saying that reddit is full of russian trolla and bots , yet you dont shoe any proof whatsoever . i think the collusion story has really left a mark on some people to the point of that they see russians and collusion everywhere
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

17. pescatarian i think is the term people use .
   (ID: 40a3b3e3ead468881f7392ff22e867f06207755d)

18. well , i love bill burr , and i also think oprah winfrey is a mostly useless gasbag , and i thought the viral ad was retarded . but for the sake of a balanced discussion , i would point out the emotional attachment between mothers and their children . yes , it is more physically demanding to be a crab fisherman in alaska . nobody is disputing that . but i bet if you asked any mother who has lost a child , she would rather pull traps for ten years than go through that again . maybe it ' s possible that the word " difficult " might mean different things to different people ? reddit is usually home to the nitpickiest of nitpickers . i ' m surprised nobody has brought up this point . and now i get downvoted to oblivion .
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

19. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

20. oh okay , yeah i can see what you mean there but i think that there are more people then me that post stuff like this on here anyway . you never answered what makes me an attention seeking whore from this ?
