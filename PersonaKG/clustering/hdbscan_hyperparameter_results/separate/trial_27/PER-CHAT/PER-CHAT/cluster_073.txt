3. when my stomach hurts on acid , it ' s because something is bothering me and i either haven ' t identified or have chosen to ignore it this approach doesn ' t work . i ' ve found that when i think through what ' s bothering me , most negative physical side effects go away . your issue could just be ibs , though .

6. possibly it  s that then , i didn  t think i had particularly strong features , just a  standard  face if such a thing exists . quite possibly my personality has something to do with it as i  ve always been mature for my age .
