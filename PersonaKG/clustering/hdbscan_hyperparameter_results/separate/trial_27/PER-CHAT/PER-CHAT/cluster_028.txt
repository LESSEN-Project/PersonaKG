1. i think you misunderstood what i meant , i meant that gbay knows what every other veteran player already knows . so he knows what to tell us , because he is a veteran player he knows what we know . for example this , most veteran players already know these things , but because gbay is a veteran player he knows what information will be new to us . sorry , the way i worded this isn ' t the best .

5. maybe their theories are garbage and yours is the theory that is right . think of all of the scientists in the history of the world who were disproven the world isn ' t flat , vulcan isn ' t a planet and phlogiston theory is not a thing . you never know what future discoveries could change things . we have to keep learning . someone wise once said something similar to , " there are far more wrong answers than right ones . now we ' re back in the decadence of uncertainty .

10. all depends on your background and motives . empathy of someone is a must . for me , as a nice guy trust me please . you need this one thing , secret tip . you need to process that every person , even at worse has had a different situation to you in the past and you do not know where , or how they became who they are . you look at yourself , and your traits and be thankful , postives overcome negatives if you think that .

11. i mean i ' m the only one who will , not because i ' m interested in you but because i know that i ' m driving you up the wall and if your efforts to get the last word and provide yourself with some small win in life , and because i think that you ' re bad and that you should be punished . and because i think you ' re impotent rage and lies are hilarious . you could easily prove to me your age and your body type yet you refuse because i ' m correct .
