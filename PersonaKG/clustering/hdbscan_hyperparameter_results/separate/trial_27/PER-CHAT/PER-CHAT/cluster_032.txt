8. wonder woman has been kind of an oddity in the recent dc film universe . as good as it was it was still far from perfect . the third act is one of the worst in any superhero films . aquaman made a shit ton of money , you ' re right ! but as for quality of film ? it ' s still not as good as even the lesser succesful marvel films . and still none of them have been nominated for best picture . say what you will , but the level of quality in the dc films is almost undeniable lower than the marvel films . it pains me to say that too , because when it comes to the comics i actually lean more towards dc . but they have next to no idea what they ' re doing when it comes to films these days .

9. glad it  s helpful  i  m fairly  new  as a catholic and not a cradle catholic either so i can empathize . there  s a really good video series from  dynamic catholic   they are currently doing this series during lent and i find it helpful  they  re 3ish minute daily snippets . it  s easier for me to listen to a video on my phone daily than most other things . certainly i don  t say the rosary enough . a couple days ago the video was about the  lie we tell ourselves   it hit me that i lie to myself too , sometimes , and you might as well . it really is more about saying yes to god everyday , even if we muck up and we do , and he knows this ! hope this link works . ? best wishes
