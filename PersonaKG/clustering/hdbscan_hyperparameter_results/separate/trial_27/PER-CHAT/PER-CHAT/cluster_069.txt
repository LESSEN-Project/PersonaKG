SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:

Total from this dataset: 24

1. i never meant should have joined salem ' s side . saying " wrong side " was a poor choice of words on my part . i merely meant that cinder had to finish that fight , and had to succeed . it is a tragedy that the towns people were made into obstacles on this missing . it really is . but that isn ' t cinder ' s fault anymore then it is the townspeople ' s fault .  but , logically speaking , if given the options , which side do you think most people will choose ? safety . most people i think would be willing to give up almost anything in the name of safety . nothing wrong with that in fact . that doesn ' t mean those who aspire for something greater are evil just because they value some things above safety though .

2. a sect ? or maybe just call it by the name of the group . i think namenerds is more about names for people or characters or pets , rather than words in general . you might have better luck on another subreddit .

3. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .

4. for me to really enjoy sex i have to care about the person , so emotions are a big part of it for me . i think it ' s important for both people to enjoy themselves , and enjoy pleasing the other . unemotional sex just isn ' t fun to me .

5. other family members watched all of it , so i ' d be in the room through most of it . i think early on i just decided it wasn ' t for me . i get why people like it but it was marmite to me .

6. i would actually like to play this scenario . but , the thing is , everyone would just camp their wool the whole game and there wouldn ' t be too much pvp . also , i think popular people ' s wool would get target too much . but overall , great scenario !

7. never gotten gold but i heard lounge is just a bunch of people insulting those who got gilded . they think they  re better because they buy reddit premium for themselves .
   (ID: 26831d6557d17492ae3b0b54585b32e08055f834)

8. no i think you raise a valid point which contributes to the discussion . people get raped and murdered every day , it ' s horrific , but just because of her status in life , this woman got a lot of media attention .
   (ID: d4912bd11a6aaa98c91794eda03e9fafdfcf5c43)

9. sounds like he has that " talking constantly " disorder . these people are insufferable but i dont think they can help themselves . their families put up w the constant talk but these people usually grate on their friends who almost always distance themselves . or ue could just be extremely selfish  wad probably catered to as a child .

10. i just think that people who get mad at trees and reindeer on government buildings are just getting mad at a part of christmas that pretty much the entire country celebrates , and isn ' t even remotely christian . gotcha . as a us citizen i pretty sure you ' re aware of our world champion status at getting butthurt . nothing official or otherwise will keep grumblers from grumbling . officially removing its religious status whatever that looks like would just provoke an even bigger response as i see it .  yeah , i ' m not trying to . i ' m starting to think i should have made my frame a little more concise as to what i meant by christmas being ' not christian ' . ya , this is the reason i think people are kind of lighting this idea up . it ' s what made me think the reasoning had an emotional basis   as stated it ' s a bit off  balanced .

11. there ' s a reason " corporate drone " is a saying . eyes forward , yes sir . just shut off everything but your brain ' s section that stops you from telling people what you really think of them .

12. so something that actually happened , is not a fact ? no wonder so many turn their back on god , they believe their opinions override facts . nearly everything in the bible has happened , with documented proof for most of it available today , but it is people who think their opinions override facts that choose to not believe the facts . therefore there is no answer that will suit some people until they drop their ignorance and selfish opinions . the stuff that has not happened , has not happened yet . so just because one thing has not happened means everything else didn ' t happen either ?

13. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .

14. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

15. well a ton of socially anxious people think of similar shit like this that happened years and ages ago so just add it to the end of the queue .
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

16. i have many hobbies . if you are inferring arguing with you is a hobby of mine , i can assure you it is not . i just think you ' re wrong , and you clearly are unable to handle people disagreeing with you , as evidenced by you telling me to get a new hobby .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

17. no you weren  t raped and it  s sad that people think what happened to you is the same as getting attacked . forget gender , you were in your house with your girlfriend , and the only reason people think is because you were tired . get real kid . your not a victim , you just need a nap .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

18. it ' s sad that because of my name everyone thinks that i ' m just a stupid person that is going to argue that communism is the greatest ideology in the world . but if you think that it ' s okay people have their own opinions . it ' s funny how you think that i didn ' t read the question but it ' s fine i guess . you can call me commie and tell me to fuck off if you wish . if that makes your day better
   (ID: be642743472cdef9445edc6dd55beb3c2a8a1258)

19. i think you are an upstanding member of a higher functioning society . i agree with you on all points . and i greatly appreciate that you have replied to people disagreeing with you . it ' s just a shame that none seems open minded to it .
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

20. sure it would be creepy if the guys were random strangers . but op hasn ' t specified that . it could just be people she knows . in view that , i think it ' s alright . quick to jump to conclusions aren ' t we !
