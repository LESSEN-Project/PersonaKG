1. i ' m just on about how people look really nothing else .
   (ID: 8b409a812bfe5e21e6e8924b5c822fc50d0d2c9a)

2. you get desensitized to a lot of the weirdness , though one i love to tell people is that milk is basically just modified , nutrient  rich sweat .

3. well , that disproves my theory that people on the internet are dickheads because they aren ' t seeing a human face when they ' re posting something ugly . now i ' m just down to most people being dickheads .

4. it probably is fake . there  s thousands of people on this app . he  s claiming something that is pretty extraordinary . if e can  t provide even a piece of evidence or a hint then i won  t give him the benefit of the doubt . that  s just me though

5. is it just me or is it really annoying when people go to schools they can  t afford and then blame the system for being in debt for the rest of their lives ?

6. obviously , this argument doesn ' t hold and it  s simply a case of people being irked that non  whites are finally being represented in a larger way . i surely hope you aren ' t assuming that just because somebody is unhappy with one specific historically  incorrect aspect that they do not care about the others . just because somebody isn ' t actively advocating against every historical inaccuracy at any given point doesn ' t mean they ' re using it as a front to deny non  white involvement  most people do acknowledge the participation of smaller groups in the war , but simply find the representation to be statistically inaccurate . i would ask these individuals what they consider of other historical inaccuracies in the game before framing them with what is implied to be a racist undertone .

7. weird flex but ok is supposed to mean  oh , that  s a pretty odd thing for you to brag about , but ok  . but people stopped using it for that reason and just started saying it in a bunch of posts for no reason
   (ID: d10c10d39129e1768465d09c5c492657be31ef47)

8. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .

9. your argument is therefore  " there is one candy in the shop . i have a penny . some guy comes along , and tells the shopkeeper he ' ll pay a dollar for that candy . shopkeeper sells it for a dollar . " so , i can complain about why should i not get candy just because some rich people decided it ' s worth a dollar ? that ' s called socialism . the real question then is , if the city is getting richer and more propserous , why are these poor people still poor ? something wrong with wealth distribution here .

10. i might just be more used to being around people of my own , not that i specifically dislike another
   (ID: dc000fb877b86a0bbd3d65fe6040b512b4f5b042)

11. i read it already . if people ' s dogs are getting out to do that , it is not the fault of the dog . it is the fault of the owner for failing to look after the dog properly . for that reason , why should i have to put my dog through such an unnecessary procedure ? it is selfish and irresponsible to put an animal through that just because it makes you more comfortable .
   (ID: 03e00c6684f9fe5cb2996bc794372ee9a7a2aea8)

12. just leave a picture . people will understand .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

13. the cost of childcare is so high in the apocalypses all the smart people just take there kids to work . if anything i see a father who is dedicated to not missing out on his child ' s childhood .
   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

14. weirdly , giving compliments to the people around you even if it  s just in your head sometimes . it makes you realize that pretty much everyone is beautiful in some way and that you are a part of everyone .
   (ID: a815d9b5c98aef3203b8f4f74528072fb989f0b1)

15. people pick the fashion that is current when they come of age and stick with it . she just happened to come of age when big stupid hair was a thing .
   (ID: fb5e95e954b3ee83c39276138f0fa3b854970db4)

16. people that hate others for the way they are , are just sad individuals , and nothing else .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

17. yeah i checked his post history . kinda a attention whore but sometimes attention attracts people who will help . i had the same thing happen , depression is not fun . but i eventually got help and here i am . i can see your point but sometimes getting people upset just adds fuel to the fire .
   (ID: ea5cdb41822e9eac6a4230514be598981cadabcb)

18. it depends on how much i could interact with them . what are my ghostly limitations ? am i visible , can people just hear me , can i move stuff ?
   (ID: b863480affffa35b0ead5c7bc5daa4c4099c0cee)

19. seriously . some creeps just come to this sub to look for people to shame  ridicule to elevate themselves , calling them " trashy " even if they aren ' t in this picture
   (ID: e9d73d2eb8490cec3e668bda1db9e716a061d73d)
