5. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

7. i ' m glad that they moved away from that . i think the floating words thing is used way too much in tv now . the first two examples that come to mind are sherlock and the good doctor .

8. thank you . i really appreciate it . at times i really think i ' m alone feeling this way . the books though , that ' s a really good idea .

9. i think the amount of toxicity a person experiences can and will be different from someone else , so asking how toxic the game is won ' t give you a good answer .

10. i can draw pretty good i ' m my hand , so if i draw other stuff do you think they ' ll pass it off as one of my weird drawings ?
   (ID: 455d2820736b8e82503d5eeacd6d1a8fa4682a68)

11. no i honestly think it ' s a good idea ! how am i so off base on this ? yes power banks exist , yes solar chargers exist but if you dont have any other options in the moment this could be a super convenient thing to be able to go and buy . jesus by all the downvotes and sassy comments i ' m getting your think i ' m advocating the clubbing of baby seals or something
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

12. very good point , didn ' t think about that aspect . but the fact that op started with " being in la " makes me think it ' s for social media purposes .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

13. i felt the same way in the past . but maybe the fact there is no objective point is a good think ! you can choose to do something or absolutely nothing .

14. i think it ' s a really useful device and it has two uses three if you count getting mew so it ' s a good buy imo
   (ID: 315ad21e3ce098f09bec23f9b7509d07540912c7)

15. my first attempt with these two characters i  ll gladly link you to when i get to my computer , it  s not nearly as good as this one i think but i  m glad you appreciated it ! bob and ervin are pretty much gonna be regulars around here now !

16. the button may be sticking it could be something underneath that ' s causing it . if you think it could be this , check out some youtube videos on how to take it a part . i had a trigger that kept sticking and once i took it a part and cleaned it , it was as good as new .
   (ID: 1413da4d65544a15a55a7323945fa06ed3f67f4a)

17. it ' s been pretty good . i think i ' m about to head to bed soon though . how has yours been ?
