15. lgbt doesn ' t have my best interests considered . any group has potential to become a hivemind , so i ' d like to avoid that as well . asexuals seem like they should go their own way , but many feel they belong with the other minorities .

16. i feel like that might have to do with the quality  nachos arent a gourmet food , but i feel like if you were to try making them at home the meat would certainly be better than most anywhere that serves nachos stadiums , arenas if you still enjoy soggy , meatless nachos after accounting for ingredients . then thats cool , healthier too
   (ID: 85ac769b0cb349e567cb91e8109645bd1ac28b9f)

17. i have friends like that too buddy but i try to see it as competition in bettering myself so i can feel like i  m better than them or whatever .
