1. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .

2. as an outsider looking in , it often seems these days anyone showing pride and waving your stars and stripes are automatically seen as trump supporters and with that comes accusations of racism etc how is public displays of patriosm actually seen in america ? note  this isn ' t my thoughts just what i often see on social media .

3. haha if you have not seen love death  robots on netflix this probably seems kinda crazy , but it ' s just a description of one of the episodes that i immediately thought of when reading the title .

4. i  ve just got this horrible feeling that we  ll end up back tracking on the due to international pressure . international law stipulates that we cannot leave someone stateless but what for the islamic state , the one that she left for ?

6. i got one for you , too  what about a god who created everything which includes sin , if he created everything , who had his own son killed to get forgiveness . he could  ve just forgiven us , because it  s him that is the forgiver . if you argued he didn  t create sin , he could actually do an innumerable list of things that would help more than killing your own kid .

11. hey guys , great place you ' ve got here . something struck me , and i decided i need to go ahead and grow out what i can and see where it goes . most times i ' ve had some degree of facial hair , but anything of beard caliber seemed a far off dream . then i figured , " why not " any tips ? also , and this may be an odd question . based on what you guys see here , could you link me to a picture of a beard that looks similar to how you ' d anticipate mine coming in ? just figuring since you ' ve guys seen many beards start off here , you can kind of read where it may go to a degree . edit  my plan is to let it grow at least one month , sept . 1st .

12. i ' ve heard it helps to start cleaning up something small , and then grow from that . even if it ' s just putting a fork into a drawer , it ' s important to start somewhere .

13. i ' ve never tried to bust it as quick as i can tbh . there are times where i ' ve lost concentration and bust it earlier than i wanted , but as no orgasm was had i can just wipe off and keep going .

14. you  re right ! the movie would have been much better if they actually filled on location instead of just making it cgi . you  ve changed my opinion on this movie .
   (ID: a154763d4a1c7d2d412ab13eeed4849772817d9a)

15. it ' s a text message . if it was urgent , you should ' ve called , imo . we ' re all adults and we ' re busy living our lives . a text message just frankly isn ' t a priority .

16. it would be nice if this girl i ' ve been trying to go out with would just message me .

18. i  ve been engineering for years and it still happens every now and then . you just realize it faster . this is how you learn .

19. hmm . interesting . seinfeld saved bee movie for me . if i hadn ' t been a lifelong fan of seinfeld i probably would have seen how bad that movie was . instead i could laugh at the jokes because they reminded me of the show just enough .

20. we ' ve been focusing on talking about prepping with friends , family and loved ones , especially because we ' re all going to be together in the run up to the festive season ! plus my partner wrote this awesome post on the sensible about how she used to grow food in just her dorm room . we ' ve now thankfully got a bit more space for our homestead than that .
