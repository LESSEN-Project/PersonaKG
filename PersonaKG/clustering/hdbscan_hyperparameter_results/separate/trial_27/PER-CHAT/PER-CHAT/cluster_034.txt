1. you have to put in more than you burn to gain mass . if you don ' t you will tone up , probably even look pretty shredded but won ' t get any bigger . as a skinny , lanky guy myself who went through this just ignore your metabolism and focus on the food , gym is the easy part .

2. nah the only challenging monster is behemoth and it ' s only because of the weird mechanics . great game don ' t get me wrong on of my top picks of the year , but compared to mhgu that came out on the switch it just doesn ' t hold a candle to the amount of content .

7. how is that whataboutism ? because they just said " well what about alcohol ? " . that ' s exactly what whataboutism is . you don ' t talk about the issue at hand , you try to compare it to something else and not what was originally being discussed .

15. don ' t wanna over  pry but any particular reason you stayed with these guys if you weren ' t super into them ? or was it just early on in the relationship so there wasn ' t an attachment yet ?
   (ID: 5f43a3019d69696064ac659bf6dd25b51f1e5bb6)

16. you kind of just do you own thing and not give a shit . you don ' t worry about developing a personality .

17. you ' re suppsoed to release the ble  whatever before you push the plunger down . so tie off  register  release the belt . if you leave the belt on andyou inject more iquid int he vein then the vein is under more pressure . when you release it the blood flow continues and the drugs you inject is carried off with the blood that is pumping through the vein . or don ' t use one if you ' re able to do it withoout , it ' s not a necessary step just a helpful tool . the bruising could be a result of that if you didn ' t release it . what also helps if you bruise easily is to put pressure on the injection site . the alcohol wipe that you use to clean your arm with before iv you can also use to push down onthe site when you are pushing the needle out . this will stop the bleeding faster , so also less blood with leak from your vein causes bruising under your skin . but most important things are to use new needles , don ' t use the same spot too often and pick a different spot to iv so the previous places can heal a bit before you use them again . lave the site witht he trackmarks a lone for a bit , let it heal .
