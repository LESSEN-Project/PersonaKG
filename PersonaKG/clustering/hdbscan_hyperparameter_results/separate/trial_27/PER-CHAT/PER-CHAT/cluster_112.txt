1. i enjoyed how you became self  aware toward the end of your post . parents are just humans , figuring it out as they go along . difficult kids teach you a lot very quickly , and make conflict with docile children feel like a walk  in  the  park .

4. it ' s awkward because after the breakup , it is always weird to celebrate your own birthday by yourself , especially if that person was toxic or abusive . i just haven ' t celebrated my birthday in years because i feel like i ' m celebrating their birthday instead of mine . in the moment it was awkward too . when it ' s your birthday you get special treatment from friends and family . when it ' s someone else ' s as well , it sort of makes you feel like you ' re not unique or special in any way .

5. excuse what . was that a compliment ? or do i not have freedom of speech ? i called myself ugly stating that i cant relate in that aspect but i came up with the simple idea maybe that she should go with her husband so if something happens she has someone there for her and someone who can make her feel better about what just happened and so he can tell them off like most guys do
