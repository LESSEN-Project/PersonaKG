   (ID: c50479206ad2428ecdc02592a82261c4f2ae30a5)

2. i love how this assumes there ' s a significantly large amount of people who want to dress up as prince . what happens if i want to go as michael jackson ? how does that work ?
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

3. makes me wonder why those people never injure themselves on purpose . it ' s a doctor ' s job to fix them . why would they want to take that opportunity from them ?
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

4. i want all the sex with all the people and im cool with however they want ti do it . i use to get a lot of it , its one of the worst parts about leaving the world and starting my own society of one where nobody judges you or takes all your stuff and makes you homeless .
   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

5. apparently i am the one who needs to grow a backbone , when everyone here can ' t cope with someone not giving them what they want . honestly , some people .
   (ID: fe56409176d2a6089f323227d5b07061f851d63b)

6. insular people have always done this to protect their own worldview . races , religions , ethnicities , classes , etc . they  ve all been scapegoated and hated for no solid reason because one group feels threatened . i dislike religion because of the use of dogma to legitimize cruelty , but worst of all is hypocrisy . conservatives want to claim to be about individual liberty , unless they feel so inclined to limit any particular group on a whim . christians want to claim to be a bastion of love and patience , but only for a small subset of people who personally serve their agendas . it  s not a difference in opinion that separates you from most of them , it  s iq points !
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)

7. i want to tell my ex that shes a slut and a lying cheating skank , however if i said that then id be hated by the people around her .
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

8. this explains also why some people hate certain acts of sex . they may want to have sex with the person they like , but doing some things with them not so much . it still doesn ' t pertain to their attraction toward the person .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

9. if u want to get rich , try flipping . it ' s mad boring but you can get your orbs piling up really quick . what i like to do is put my chaos recipe items in a public tab because you occasionally get people who offer decent prices for them
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

10. i use this subreddit for fun . this topic wasn ' t marked serious . if people want to overanalyze a comment , that ' s up to them .
   (ID: 68698bd86019a86cb34a8b2e28c6324727011b28)

11. this game is a playground for kids , most online games are cool because they are competitive in certain way , this game isn ' t . you get killed , you lose nothing , your settlement gets nuked , you lose nothing , you want to try to kill everybody ? the game will make it easier for other people to kill you . seriously , what ' s the point of this game ?
   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

12. no shit . blacks are basically a protected species it seems . they do fuck all as a people besides crime , of course , yet you can  t even stare wrongly at them unless you want some problems .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

13. some people are raised in a fashion that they never developed the want to have kids . instead they see it as any other decision in life and look upon its downsides . usually they end up turning away from it
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

14. it ' s amazing how long the list of shit people want is , it ' s never ending
   (ID: 50043497a219924fd275a92e5dadb6e04bac5936)

15. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

16. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .
   (ID: b650c9c531ec58d468c7c1fc9b7083efc4cbca9c)

17. there should be an app for shit like that . for people that want to sray somewhere else for free at someone ' s place that wants to stay at your place for free .
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)

18. i see . i feel people want others to exercise to conform to their standards using health and physique as a dumb excuse rather then caring about someone being happy . ofcourse it is different when someone is obese but you get the message . also , many sports are boring and gyms are full of toxic shits anyway .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

19. what the fuck do you want me to do instead ? go outside and talk to actual people ? pfft .
   (ID: 164327be87300906de16932661437c5b2b671c9d)

20. literally this . like do you want it to get to the point where people are detained for four years ? or sent to hard labor ? or killed by the thousands ? no . that ' s why we gotta call this what it is and put a stop to it for fuck ' s sake .
