1. being bi is fun because i get weird questions from both straight people and gay people . mostly  why can  t you just choose ? why are you so selfish ? etc .  also most people don  t seem to understand that i  m still bi even though i  m in a hetero relationship .

2. fuck you skinny bitches are fucking ugly if you don ' t have a little meat on your bones then you ' re probably a skank that thinks you can get anything in life just because of your slutty looks but you don ' t hear fat people talking shit about you why don ' t you just go slit your skinny fucking wrist motherfucker

4. assuming they both use the force they could probably counter it , there is a reason they don  t just use the force to unarm people in a fight .

5. may i ask what system you play and what rep you are ? because there is no way in hell you ' re playing high level duels and landing a mix of lights and heavies consistently as kensei . its most likely mid tier at best . people don ' t parry in high tier . they just block . and kensei is left useless at that point .

6. because i  m just trying to get to where i need to go and don  t care about making eye contact with random people . why do you care ?

7. so basically the only reason is so that people don ' t do the same to you later ? not that they have any individual value or right to a seat , just they are some sort of " karma points " for you .

8. most people don  t change , they just learn to behave .
   (ID: 83ed088161a0acc5bb20774e9e10435e55e88737)

9. don  t assume anything . ask for clarification . in my workplace , people sometimes assume they understand a vague assignment and we wind up doing unnecessary or unwanted work because someone was too shy to ask an executive some follow up questions . please , just politely and confidently ask .

10. talesfromtechsupport has taught me that   some   too many people just don ' t understand how to shut down a computer safely  and  not  corrupt  everything
