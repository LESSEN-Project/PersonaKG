2. two or three times a month i dream about very dirty public restrooms , or stalls with no doors , or toilets up on pedestals . these are extremely vivid and realistic dreams and i remember several details about most of them . i didn  t know how common it was until my dad said he had the same dream , so i did a google search and it turns out it  s fairly common . something about being insecure and vulnerable .
