1. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .

2. i wouldn  t say your original post came off as humble . i didn  t think it was arrogant though . all i have to say is , if the women that you  re talking to desire you more when you  re being a jerk , they must have no self  esteem .

3. i can ' t say for sure , but i ' m conjuring up scenes in my head of jedi force  pushing multiple droids over at once ? i think that happened . no idea why there would be an issue focusing on multiple things , although as many as the number of grains of sand in a tornado might be too difficult .

4. thank you . i think i needed someone to say that to break the feedback loop of doubt that i sometimes get stuck in .

5. i think given the fact that she sat with him all day on the weekend , no . i would say there were circumstances beyond her control making it necessary for her to continue working .

6. you might think we ' re done . but no matter what you say , we will complete this dungeon . if rocks fall and yolnaak dies , so be it .

7. there ' s a whole wikipedia page on the controversies of using that word . shame because it ' s a great word and i think it deserves a resurgence , so i say use it .

8. huh . i never romanced tali but i figured he would say it at some point , maybe you missed it ? i don ' t think shepard ever says it first though , i remember him answering " i love you too " to most of them , but not the other way around . i guess it ' s usually the love interests who confess their undying love and stuff , shep tends to show more with actions than words .

9. i think as comments flow , you ' ll realise this may not be so much of an unpopular opinion . nevertheless i must say you articulate yourself well . a  from this stranger .
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

10. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .

11. bars are places to pick up , to make friends i would say go to another forum . perhaps church or some association . as a man i would think you either is looking to be hitted on or waiting for your friends if i see lonely womman browsing around .
   (ID: 3c4a38138d39bd51556bd7f8a05ba48bf283c7e6)

12. i think i get what your trying to say , but then i don  t

13. i was here to say sushi , now i have to think of something else . its definitely not going to be brussel sprouts . i still hate those
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

14. i ' m pretty sure it ' s before , because in lore it says that doomfist was defeated by winston and put in prison . saying that the fight scene ends with doomfist and winston about to clash i think it ' s pretty safe to say it ' s before prison . i might be wrong though , because the doomfist mentioned in the original cinematic could be a different one .

15. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

16. i think you meant to say ,  would you be harder than dark souls if this were a game ?  . yes , yes i would be .
   (ID: e09cddf2452184c83537d2d4e8a36f0ba7c3fae9)

17. as a girl , i ' d say all my " firsts " , i think i should have waited for the right guy
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

18. i ' d say no . but i think a lot of it is personal bias or what one would prefer to watch .

19. instead of tucking me in to bed as a kid with the whole " don ' t let the bed bugs bite " deal , my mom would kiss me goodnight and say " you can do or be anything you put your mind to " and i think hearing that every night developed my confidence and strength for the rest of my life so far
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

20. i wouldn ' t say i have a big ass . it ' s not flat either , i think it ' s nice and i always check myself out in the mirror , but i would only say it ' s a little above average . i don ' t think ass size has anything to do with it though .
