1. i agree ! to pretty much anyone in a western  hemisphere or of european lineage context it  d be a fist fight . but , in their context though they see it as innocent not to say it  s not ignorant of medical conditions and genetics , etc , caring and a less awkward way of telling a person they  re getting pudgy . if someone was really offended they would be profusely apologetic , but also completely not understand what they did wrong and still chalk it up to a foreigner not understanding the culture .
