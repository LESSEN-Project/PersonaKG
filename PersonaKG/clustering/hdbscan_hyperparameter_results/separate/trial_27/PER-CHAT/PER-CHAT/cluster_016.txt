3. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

5. so you keep telling me , i must have really made you angry with my opinion . didn ' t know it would shake you so badly . at the point you just parrot what i say while putting crying emojis in it i would really call it a conversation .

6. thank you for being helpful . i just get so worried because i have the tendency to lose my train of thought when i get nervous . i ' m worried i won ' t be able to make my point or that i will say something that will get him angry at me . i can handle it . it just wouldn ' t be productive y ' know ?

7. i get what you mean . i  d say it  s the general misconception that if you  re jewish you support israel and that if your anti  israel you  re an anti  semite . it just that the two are paired together unsurprising very often . i know plenty of jews who are anti  israel at least in its current state , it  s just the misconception that makes it seem the way you describe .
