4. i ' m aware of the risks of budget builds , but i ' ve got a   digit affinity deck that ' s pretty fun to play , even if not the most competitive . it started out as a  digit build given the dirt cheapness of the basics of the deck , and it ' s gotten about digit bucks of upgrades , and that ' s still a really fun deck to play .
