3. that ' s nice then , i can get behind the working with some buddies to complete the challenges and it makes it a lot easier for most people . i ' ve been waiting to get home to play , but i thought it was a constant thing , i hadn ' t seen that it had to be activated to use .

4. i  ve had these dreams where people get glazed over looks in their eyes , then they  explode  sort of and become these dark trees . i  ve had it long enough that an entire forest has been created

5. tricky one this . i suppose if you went for a girl with those tendencies in the first place , or if that  s what first attracted you , then it would be hypocritical to ask her to change . if it  s that your partner has become sexually suggestive online recently , i would assume that there  s an underlying reason for that perhaps . not saying it  s necessarily a sign that they  re unhappy in the relationship , but some people need more flattery or attention than others . i  ve seen the huge amount of likes girls get on instagram for these types of pictures and it must be quite tempting  addictive .

6. i haven ' t seen this week ' s walking dead yet , but in that particular example from what i ' ve seen , it ' s treated as something that ' s in people ' s minds . that ' s realistic and entirely valid . it ' s when they start actually showing afterlives and such that bothers me . lost went too far for me . there have been a few others but none are coming to mind .

7. he  s a bit rude as well , which is a shame because i  ve met many nice people on here
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

8. interesting . i personally wouldn ' t do it because of my flat feet , but i ' ve seen people do it before , so i guess there is something to be said about it . what made you decide to go barefoot though ? also , how do you handle cold weather , especially cold winters ?
