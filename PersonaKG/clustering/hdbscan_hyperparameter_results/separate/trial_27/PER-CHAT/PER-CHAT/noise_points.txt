3. yeah i get what you ' re talking about that ' s just how it goes . theres actually a commendation if you can capture all the control points and hold them at the same time , you can also fast travel to main missions , i know it sucks and i get what you mean it ' s annoying to run ecerywhere . i dont remember if you can do it at wt2 , but theres usually little " activites " close to the control points like a propaganda broadcast , or a hostage situation or whatever and if you go do those before the control point it will raise the alert level of the control point which in turn gives you better stuff and gives you a chance to unlock other mods .

4. take out the tutors . make a list of the cards you replace them with to ease swapping them . keep the tutors in your sideboard . you ' ll have a deck with digit power levels , and you ' ll have just as much fun without them knowing you ' ve challenged yourself . swap out fetch lands , too if it ' s still too strong .

6. i don  t know if i can say that it was an  obvious lie  , but my parents always told me as a kid , that if i go outside without a jacket , i  m going to get sick for sure . even though i know that  s not digit  true now as an adult , i always get paranoid if i leave the house without a jacket during the fall or winter that i  m going to catch a cold .

9. undoubtedly more time . mentally . something is off , maybe underlying issues that arise this action . one must ask , what could she possibly of done to set him off ? how does she even stay with him , even if she did love him ? he sounds more dangerous , possibly more harm to be caused in the future . further testing should be considered with cases as severe like this .

10. it ' s an alien device , it detects when people are wearing a tin foil hat and cancels out the foil ' s atomic charge . safe to say you ' re being observed , perhaps even selected for probing , good luck my friend . or it could just be a low voltage transformer for a doorbell or intercom , who knows ? best not take any chances .

12. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "
