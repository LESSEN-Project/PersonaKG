9. this actually sound like an issue with the pc  mac  s hardware . you could check your activity monitor and see if the interface is initiating some type of search for new software , but i don  t think that  s what it is . turning off the internet is recommended for optimizing your daw . but who are we kidding . i don  t think many prosumers do . this isn  t a very common issue which is another reason i think it  s the computer  s ports .
