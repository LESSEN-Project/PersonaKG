1. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .

5. i believe it gives you a little bit more time as you still have enough time to walk under them before your timer is up and you can log out , and they would have to pathfind to you which takes longer than someone standing beside you . although i guess you could just barrage them and run while logging , i dunno .

6. even in this sub . last time some dude stole a pic with the oops tag on it the entire sub ripped on that dude so bad . all memes should have a mark somewhere imo just to give credit where credit is due .

7. at least you can play it . every time i join an ongoing match , my screen just stays black , i can hear everything , i can move , can shoot but i can ' t see anything . but yeah , the introduction is kind of " lagged " .

12. is the stoning for adultery pertaining to both genders ? because every time that i do read or hear about it , it ' s always the punishment for women . what if the man commits adultery ? not trying to toss gender  equality into an already cans  of  worm belief . just genuinely curious .

15. yeah i understand ! it has a time and a place in my life i just made it an excessive habit and didnt treat it with the respect i should have i was a wake and bake every day into the night type of guy and i never admitted it was effecting me in an ill way because i was getting my work done and keeping things clean staying healthy but i neglected my mental state of mind living in an altered state of consciousness where i brushed everything off with a bowl just wasnt working for me anymore
