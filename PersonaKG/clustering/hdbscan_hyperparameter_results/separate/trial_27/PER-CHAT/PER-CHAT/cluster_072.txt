1. i disagree with this article . i think " thank you " and " i ' m sorry " are sometime necessary acknowledgements of the fact that someone else exists   a person who has their own thoughts and feelings and things to do . i don ' t expect my kid to feel some kind of heartfelt gratitude for me getting them a glass of milk but i do expect my actions to be acknowledged with a polite " thank you " . i ' m in favor of politeness as a social norm . by telling a kid that this is a situation requiring a polite action you help instill the fact that other people matter .

2. these people are the definition of selfish . they don ' t think anything about their grandchildren , because they don ' t give a shit about them . they care purely for themselves .

3. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .

4. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .

5. i think i  m a nice person , but i don  t let people take advantage of me nor the people i love . i become a lion if anyone hurts or is disrespectful to my loved ones

6. because when you ' re in rome you do as the romans do . unless you ' re obviously a tourist or you don ' t speak english at all , i think it ' s really rude to go out of your way to speak in a manner people around you can ' t understand . my wife does this to me in spanish when she wants to talk about someone we see while we ' re out or whatever and it annoys me to no end .

7. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?

8. what the fuck ? i wonder if these kinds of people ever take a step back to question their insanity and then go ahead and do the crazy shit anyway . or if they do question themselves , what sort of stuff do they think is too crazy and don ' t follow through .

9. i wouldn  t call him an asshole in the situation if i knew the guy and could talk to him personally . this is the sub amitheasshole ? not amithepersonwhodidntthinkitthrough . i don  t think proposing is an asshole thing to do . but it was insensitive , poorly thought out , irresponsible , and a laundry list of other things that point towards  yta  which is what people request on this thread .

10. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?

11. " fair game ? why do you think you ' re entitled to other people ' s stuff ? it ' s not yours , don ' t touch it !

12. i think a lot of people who are at that point don ' t think anybody cares to listen to them , and they have thought that for so long , that it is very hard to reach out to anybody

13. i agree porn isn ' t the healthiest  most ethical of things . but i don ' t think anyone has ever used the pornhub app to kill a room full of people because his penis was feeling extra tiny that week . priorities .

14. it ' s a fun little demo to show people your watch , but i don ' t think it will improve the way you play at all . the ui is a little confusing , and the data updates a too slow for my liking . the only other thing you can do besides find portals is normal hack them , which can help you get gear easily , but is useless in the long run .
