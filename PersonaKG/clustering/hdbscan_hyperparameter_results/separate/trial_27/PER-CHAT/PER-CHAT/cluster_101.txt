12. the most common entry points are  gaunt  s ghosts  follows a company of imperial army soldiers led by comissar gaunt . good for a perspective of the regular soldier in this grimdark setting eisenhorn trilogy  follows inquisitor eisenhorn and is a good source to understand how the imperium works space wolf omnibus  follows the process of recruitment  training  creation of a space marine . the main character knows almost nothing of the galaxy , so he and the reader learn together horus heresy where i started  it actually is warhammer 30k , with it  s story being about the imperium civil war and the rise of chaos across the galaxy . self contained and explains why things are so bad in 40k . the only problem is that it  s a huge series with over digit books though not all are necessary reading . yet i absolutely encourage you to read  em all

13. hockey , it  s such a chaotic sport . players are on the ice for digit seconds and you  re basically reacting to the puck until you see a good shot . it  s hard to shave points with so many variables
   (ID: 18e18998471794de2ee0ded08a5f57a45a336e24)

   (ID: 89169d635166bbc089338914b42d288ecb2593e9)

18. i have some shirts that are digit years old . when i was fat and i thought i would never wear them again i used them for all sorts of shit . stuffing in banjos to deaden a bright tone , sealing gaps at the bottoms of doors . when i lost weight i ran around and collected them all and after a wash they are all as good as new . r . m . can ' t be beat .

19. is trish in the extra ? otherwise it looks good , maybe try compulse instead of one of the call of the haunteds because it can help against ragnazero and exciton , or let you re normal summon a deskbot digit stuck on the table . maybe try soul charge ?

20. look for the fabric percentages . generally speaking a designer peacoat with roughly digit  wool or more will cost between digit  digit . thats a pretty good budget target . schott nyc is considered the flagship in this range . a really good deal right now is actually abercrombie which has a digit   naval peacoat at  digit . great deal bang for the buck in my opinion . as usually anything under digit will get you a digit  wool blend or less . in fact lands end ' s peacoat is digit  wool and its selling for about  digit . which shows that a  f has a pretty good bang for the buck deal right now .
