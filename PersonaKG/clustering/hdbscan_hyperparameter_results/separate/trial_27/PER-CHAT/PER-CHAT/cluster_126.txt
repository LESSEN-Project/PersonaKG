8. well i would really like to see your sister . because she must be the most beautiful girl ever if you are  the ugly sister  .

10. yeah , that ' s a little unfair . although there would be false positives there too , like " you must really enjoy the elliptical "

11. that sounds like you have some really tense fingers , no idea what would help with that . my best guess would be to pay attention to your hand while you play and see if it gets super tense , and if so relax a bit . otherwise visiting your doctor might help
