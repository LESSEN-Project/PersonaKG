1. i play on ps4 aswell . i ' d say considering there is new building sensitivity , id put that higher and lower my actual sensitivy . it would probably be easier for you to aim then . also , you want to really change your ads sensitivity to the right spot , it will help you a lot . ads means aiming down sights

3. okay , then in answer to your question i would say that if you actually want to have sex then you might develop some kind of negative hang up about penis size but there are tonnes of ways to pleasure someone besides that so it shouldn ' t really have a negative affect .

4. i only downvote the " wholesome " content dealing with children . you can say it all you want to , but there is nothing endearing or entertaining about children .

6. but we shouldn  t say that being obese is okay as a society , but if you want to stay fat thats your choice but you shouldn  t spread fake ideals

7. i ' d say kratom is mind altering . i ' ve taken it daily for so long and it has definitely altered my mind . it ' s psychoactive and gives a mood boost , euphoria , and much more . hard to not generalize all substances because where would you draw the line ? is weed okay ? is adderall okay because it makes you focus ? what about alcohol ? can you drink kava ? that ' s why they generalize and say any psychoactive substance . basically they want you sober and stone cold sober .

8. when you say to attend , you  re speaking with a bit of certainty that you  ll be getting into those programs . how confident do you feel on those chances ? even if the chances are low , i do believe it  s up to you and what you  re looking to do in the future . what do you really want . if academia is more important to you than becoming a clinician , declining an acceptance may not be the worst idea . but it is ultimately up to you and what you see for your future , and that is what will give you the most fulfillment later on in your life .

9. it ' s very simple , if i say i want to be a vegan because all i eat is fruits and veggies but like me i ' m also a bow hunter i will be denied entry . why ? because i ' ll be breaking a tenet of the cult .

10. you ' d have to do a hell of a lot of searching to find a decent person these days , let alone the person you particularly want . it ' s possible but it ' s not worth the trouble for many . especially if you have no desire to go searching in the first place . but they do say yours comes to you when you stop looking .

11. i say you take what you want from it , and see it as you please .

12. there is no definitional answer but if you want a lot of enlightenment on the matter consider trying dmt , or better yet ayahuasca with a guided shaman . graham hancock has a lot of interesting stuff to say on it .
