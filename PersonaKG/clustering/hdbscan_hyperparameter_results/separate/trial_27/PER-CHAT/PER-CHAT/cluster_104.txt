2. i take it that the crew are a comedy group ? is " crew funny " highlights of their " skits " or just some bonus behind the scenes of their creative process ? in any case , eating donuts purchased for someone else isn ' t funny or quirky , it just makes you look like a self  absorbed asshole especially in the jerk  like way amanda phrased it . p . s . i ' m also the last person to complain , but that is the wrong there in your sentence will .

5. ah yes , the worldwide  feared british nukes would totally scare russia into submission , it ' s not like russia has c  300s that are proven to be capable of stopping nato ' s balistic missiles or anything like that . also , if russia were to produce just one more tsar bomba  class nuke and drop it on top of the british isles , the uk is gone and so is ireland , the northern part of france , the benelux and possibly parts of nothwestern germany .

6. because why would you need it , if it ' s for self defence and knife just as easily does the trick . if you like to shoot it go to a gun range . for what reasons would you need one in a home

11. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets

12. yes it is . how can you like your sibling ? it ' s just a piece of shit that parents love more for some reason .
   (ID: 337350fc54133b327ce0d6d9f385f82a2a6738cf)

13. you describe parts of a thing called scientific method , and do it rather well may i add . by earlier description it may have occurred to some flat  earthers that they are wrong . i often watch odd youtubes and such about things like that  it doesn ' t mean i believe in them , it just means i find them entertaining
   (ID: e57ef54aa6b4e23fcfbf5b034403be21a86f9700)

15. mate is very popular in chile , and it ' s getting more popular in the states . in seattle you can get yerba minus the actual mate just like you can tea at coffee shops , you can even get a latte version . not sure if they put milk in it in uruguay , but in chile it is popular to drink with lots of sugar and milk .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

19. i imagine it ' s normal to homogenize your peers , if they like the same things as you , logically they are similar to you and probably around your age , but realistically there is a huge age span of the old nerds who were on computers before everyone else along with those youngsters just discovering reddit . yeah , i do the same thing
   (ID: 44f5ba2e2e79c07f77ae334e708119f166a6aca0)
