5. i  m not sure what the limit is , but there is some value of goods that you  re allowed to bring in as personal luggage that is allowable as tax free . if you  re worried you can voluntarily declare it and see what they say , but probably smarter to check the regulations online first . if you  re below the allowed value then don  t bother declaring since it isn  t required , but keep the receipt and maybe a printed copy of the regulations in case you get stopped .
