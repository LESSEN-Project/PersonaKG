2. yes ! i feel exactly the same way . skiba is a wonderful person and i was super excited when i heard that he would fill in for tomstill miss him but yeah , i think there downfall was bring in a producer , i think that honestly hurt them in a way . i still give it a listen from time to time . " she ' s out of her mind " is my favorite song off the album

5. i think maybe he ' s referring to the fact that in the rpg rules , sponsored magic is something you choose whether or not to use , and you take debt every time you do . in the novels , pretty much all of harry ' s spells were enhanced with hellfire involuntarily the whole time lash was in his head .

6. it is pretty funny when i think about it now , but it was pretty hurtful at the time .
   (ID: 78a7be65b9d2e7cebf18280c07d4f44e6f2b3417)

7. i think i once saw something that said that because you spend a lot of time together you end up looking similar , mostly tan .

8. i may be wrong but , i think their idea is using the average time it takes you to complete seven games on that account
   (ID: a69486a9dd78d1ba9533599ba57eac9079ca3c8d)

9. i think the trash wheel and water shark are symptoms of a larger issue we love to ignore . when was the last time you saw a cop write a ticket to someone throwing trash out the window ? yea me neither .

10. i was a little to young at the time to appreciate michael jackson but i can still remember exactly where i heard of his passing , who i was with and what i was doing at that precise time etc also chester from linkin park . their music was a big part of my teens and it  s sad to think that he  s now gone

11. woah there bud , i think you may have reposted this garbage meme , so im gonna tell you this  next time tag your reposts , so that i dont have to report and downvote you for this disgraceful repost , alright ?
   (ID: 5ad91cf15026f9d604e90af77be91ab4f6b7289a)

12. my mil shares a reposts this stuff all the time . you  d think the spelling errors in the name would be a giveaway of the scam but guess not

13. i think what ' s scary about this video is how the cammer seems to be paying attention and driving in a relatively safe manner , yet still is unable to stop in time . this situation happens all the time where traffic slows suddenly , and i " use up " some of my stopping distance . usually , rather than slowing even more to return to a safe following distance i will follow too close for a few seconds until traffic speeds up again . i think most people do this , and it can be really dangerous in those few seconds .

14. " every time we see pus we think of you , frank "   mash
   (ID: de5db66359e6314e9bac24fd9a10ec1d49584c4f)

15. maybe think more about how you title your posts next time . your title was misleading whether you think so or not
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

16. i wouldn ' t worry . even if something came back on you , it would come down to the prosecutor . does he think he could prosecute you in a charge , and would it be worth it ? it would be pretty easy to convince him that a jury would let you off all day long . guilt or innocence means very little at times . you wouldn ' t be worth their time . no offense .

17. does anyone else try to tell themselves if they get alzheimer ' s or dementia , they will be able to handle it ? i think about that all the time . edit  punctuation .
   (ID: 7c7d6a809e77ab08fc65ee63a1ab44c11bd6ab7f)

18. yes , and it makes me cry every time . as a mom i think i should be offended by you user name . instead i laughed .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

19. because of how i think when i answer questions , it appears that i am lying . my life has been a series of false positives time and time again . it ' s frustrating and eventually i give up and let the person think what they are going to think .
   (ID: 06f2b7a65e600f531fbc47a595626f329ee413a4)

20. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him
