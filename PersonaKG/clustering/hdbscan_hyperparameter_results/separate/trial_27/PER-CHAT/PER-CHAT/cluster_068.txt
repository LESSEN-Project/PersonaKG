11. i ' m in grad school now but i had a gap year after undergrad . it was very different . i had less on my plate than before because i worked full  time during undergrad . i lost a lot of friends that year because many people moved away .
   (ID: 24d2489761902de9148fe06d43ec8d7e34c8e35b)

12. i get so damn annoyed when people criticize me for looking up everything . " you are taking all of the mystery and wonder out of life " gods dammit , no ! if you are wondering about mysteries that humanity has already solved , you ' re doing it wrong . when you look up information and can ' t an answer to your question , that is what you should spend your time wondering about .

13. " fuck off " thank you for your input . when you ' re on the clock you ' re expected to at least meet corporate and customer expectations . if you can do neither then any job that relates to working with people is not for you . when you ' re off the clock and on your time you can do whatever pleases you .

14. ha ! i so do this all the time . please remember something . i tell people this a lot . if you  re going to be weird , be proud of it . own that shit because it makes you who you are .

15. fair . i can see why bringing penicillin to medieval europe is a tempting answer . however , i have to consider that the further back in time you go , and the more broad your cure , the more you risk causing more human birth and an alternate timeline in which war , starvation , or drug  immune diseases wipe out more people that would have died had you not tried . by sticking to a smaller number of people and a more recent event with fewer possible ramifications , you ' re more likely to come out saving more lives than endangering .

16. yeah but a lot of the time people get put into positions where they feel it is the best option
