1. well heres my opinion , the guys probably very paranoid of you cheating on him , im not saying you would but thats what it looks like . heres what you need to do , if you want to stay with him id explain how hes the one and hes over reacting . tell him that you need some breathing room to do whatever you want but that youll always come back home to him . you should only unblock the guy when he understands to give you space . if you feel like things arent working out anymore because of trust then youd definitely be in the right to break up with him . thats what id do atleast

2. this might not be truth in history , but when caterina sforza ' s enemies captured some of her children and demanded that she surrendered in exchange for their freedom , she reportedly flashed her genitals and said something that ' s along the lines of  " do it , if you want to  hang them even in front of me . here i have what ' s needed to make others " or something like that . quote lifted from wikipedia . it sounds more badass in mario puzo ' s book , though .

7. i feel like you should keep giving it a chance regardless of getting bored and not feeling like you want to continue , you  ll slowly learn to love it .
