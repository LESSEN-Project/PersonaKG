   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

10. it can be frustrating when people use depression to excuse all their failings . as someone who myself is in constant battle with mental health , i know as soon as i use it as an excuse it  s game over for me . i  ll join the other failed victims . so many amazing people who succeed in spite of depression

11. kind of interesting that rather than show the entire twitter discussion , the writer cherry picks quotes to prove that carole thinks she  s superior . you know how even one thread on this subgroup can lead to several discussions and responses . i could cherry pick any thread to prove a point . this is exactly the same as bethenny  s  harassment  by jason . she presents him as an unbalanced dangerous stalker . when you read the actual court transcript it  s completely different . so  show the entire twitter feed including what prompted carole  s responses or assume it  s bethenny  s pr people trying to protect her by questioning other castmates behavior . another article from the poor bethenny minions .

12. dishes is the most straightforward one , few people talk to youunless you need to wash something , zero experience needed , and if you dont know how to wash dishes .

13. we won ' t know till we try . sending people into space in glorified soda cans is probably not the smartest idea we have ever had but it gets the job done .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

14. you know what she needs ! badly . what retarded people these clowns are .

   (ID: ab5524e568131ce7cb4db227daae4d0f489838e1)

16. sorry to tell you this but people already know that the logo is part of the garage
   (ID: ed2d2ab477a99cff4d15f5f18a7d3662571d6e1a)

17. i would argue that it only works for guesses that the average person has some level of familiarity with . people know about how big a jelly bean is and about how big the container is and can do some mental math . some will be high and others will be low , but it averages out . if you showed people a model of a new bridge being built and asked the crowd for the thickness of steel needed on the center support , you would get wildly varying answer with an average nowhere near the actual answer . so asking the public to give their input on solving an actual problem , determining tax rates , military funding , educational standards , or any number of other things that are actually complex decisions , would not benefit from this effect .

18. depends on how random the words are that i ' ll forget . if they ' re ones i can learn again , i ' ll take it . if they ' re names and identities of people i know , no . also i ' m cracking up thinking of a scenario where a person tries to use this in an interview to one up the interviewer .

19. i googled peekers advantage csgo on google , that video and that beginners guide were the only things that really suggeted peekers advantage . in a few other pages some casual people were discussing whether it was a thing . the only argument was latency and interp . there was nothing else . that youtuber whose video you shared only has 70k subscribers . he is not even famous or something . you clearly dont know csgo . there are waaay more famous and way better people . if you knew what you were talking about you would have given a more reliable source . there are numerous youtubers with hundreds of thousands of subscribers as well as many csgo pros . none of them i have watched ever mentioned peekers advantage . i havent even heard once in all those streams i have watched . i didnt even know the term before playing r6s , as a person who followed many of those youtubers and pros . sorry buddy . peekers advantage is a cancer of r6b . we dont have it in csgo . its only theoretical and practically inexistent with all those low latencies and high framerates . judging by the ratings of the comments in our conversation , this r6s community must be so pathetic . csgo is notoriously ct  sided , which means if you hold your angles properly , the defender wins most of the times . dont talk about things you have no idea about .

20. no there are plenty of checks in place . you know most serial killers never break any other laws and are otherwise normal people right ? every legal gun owner has to go through a background check .
