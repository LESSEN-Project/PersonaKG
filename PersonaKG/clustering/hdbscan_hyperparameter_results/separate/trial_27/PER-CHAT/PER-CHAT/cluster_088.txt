1. i totally agree with you . but there comes a point where people like me who like trump or just getting so f   pissed off that we ' re going to do anything and everything we can to get him re  elected no matter what .
   (ID: 331ee7d55ed61dd31719ad2346a40aaa6c969f22)

2. it ' s just a matter of what people find attractive . myself , i like all parts of the chicken !
   (ID: 128346fc1e56ccadd25a4b200ecae44637d48f5f)

3. how do people not just sit back and be like . this is ridiculous !
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

4. this is one of those people new to tf2 who thought they would like to share a video with u , so lower those pitchforks , or just a kid who wants karma , in that case , shower him in downvotes
   (ID: 5a485308ca6e36eb17d7b0fc321fcf7695f3af53)

5. yeah , sucks to see bitlife get more buzz like articles and youtube videos . i remember even seeing people saying how original is their logo , knowing they just got it from instlife

6. by the simplest and most accurate definition , it ' s a particular act that you personally sexualise more than just about anything else . it doesn ' t have to be innately sexual . just like sexualities and , closer in relation , fetishes , nobody knows why fantasies exist . but there is speculation that the reason they remain fantasies is because people rarely see themselves participating in real life .

7. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

8. i like  agree with what he ' s saying . he just isn ' t most people ' s idea of " a wordsmith . how much can you really fault him for that ?
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

9. okay , so you  re asking for yourself ? sorry , i assumed you , like most people , were just curious . the biggest thing i had was to use my intellect instead of how i felt . i felt like shit and wanted to die , but i knew in my head i wasn  t and people loved me , i was also just curious , and i can  t find out what happens next if i  m dead . as for life itself being meaningless , so what ? just because no one will remember you in a hundred years doesn  t mean you  re pointless right now , you can have a very real impact on a lot of people in a lot of ways . when i felt like i didn  t matter because humans are expendable , i just had to realise that we are , but not to each other .
   (ID: f8a8648f114c1dd8984a809bd49816978d9970c0)

10. for the most part . the problem as i see is that the investgation was long and publicised . its been at the forefront of the news cycle for almost two years . people are burnt out on it and tired of the far left and far right . its like listening to two children argue and fight with each other . at some point everyone just wants the politicians and judiciary to shut up and run the country .
   (ID: 79e5228419de270c01297915dbce56be0063c52b)

11. yeah that ' s fair enough , although players like t . brady and sydney crosby actually do do that , it ' s just more difficult for then to build super teams around them . lebron has only been able to carry a shit tier roster to the finals twice in his career , and in this year ' s case a lot has to do with the weak competition in the east . also the commercials , stoppages , and fouls are actually the biggest issue with the nba . the o my reason it seems like the " main theme " is because it ' s them only thing people are responding to . they have no answer for the terrible stoppages , fouls , and commercial breaks .
   (ID: 0264eec5f9f9a43d83f3a82c46341e90961fa3b8)

12. people like that never seem to realise how unoriginal and unfunny their jokes are . it ' s just painful to watch at this stage .
   (ID: f114f40c03e5812464be61882b264a0abe2a545e)

13. i like seeing other people progress , and its inspiring to some people . no hate towards you op , but please realise that not everyone thinks like you and just because you dont like it , doesnt mean everyone doesnt like it . thinking like this is how you get toxic people who shame anyone different not accusing you of this tho
   (ID: ba841e2486d1df5b5baefde5ead0636c7c03c79c)

14. does foster actually exist ? i always thought it was just a joke we were playing on americans . kind of like asians selling feng shui to white people
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

15. i see it and i see people in the comments like " omg there ' s no way your dads so cray cray " and it ' s just sad to see some people are that gullible .
   (ID: a73b0dda35d389b4f74e47db6574e0f71738b683)

16. no not all of them . just the ones who suck and are losers . some people are a  ok they just like being alone and that ' s cool too .
   (ID: 840f5d9bddf24e024b9a70f13cdde62d41604e77)

17. someone called me some bad stuff and admitted that the intent was to harm me . took me almost a year to figure out that bad people just exist and can fit in with society like everyone else .
   (ID: c9b1e924c86788c982ec59df3d5704354a2a4ae1)

18. yeah that  s true , not as many people are getting third party tests for sarms like they do for gear . i just wish we had some sort of better system
   (ID: 4654e3a9a75835f9ff28170ddf31d5d3cf296ea2)

19. the guy is just bad at grammar and making coherent sentences , yet some people still believe that he will actually go and admit things like that to public .
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

20. that does sound more legit , although also kind of weird since processing bitcoin has a cost . ok the more you explain this the less it sounds like a scam . if other nootropics people stand by this provider , then it ' s probably legit . although speaking frankly you will probably find just adding a few dollars to the order less hassle . if you ' re committed to using bitcoin then ok just go to coinbase and do it .
