11. well here is where you went wrong . you jumped into water with sharks ! what else did you expect ? these arent dogs , cats , or any other animal human have domesticated . this shouldn ' t be news , just a reminder if you take a risk expect to get bit .

12. i was once dog sitting at a neighbors house the dog is the nicest and most affectionate black lab ever and i made the mistake of sitting in a lawn chair next to the very edge of the porch . the big sweety climbed up into my chair , wanting pets , and before i could get off the chair i was falling . i actually did a back flip in the process and thankfully landed without injury . as i got up the dog was just sitting there , making sure i was okay .

   (ID: f4588f2a476206e602fe5b84647a1e777eaae604)

   (ID: a4eb94a9fe8ebabb780c319cc7d3f552eb79625e)

15. hahaha . i did this at work , simply tried to force a fart that wasn ' t a fart . ended up running home and yelling to my roommates " omg i literally just shat myself " . then i walk into my room and see my landlord showing some of my friends the house .

16. behavior data analyst with kids on the autism spectrum . on the whole , i found i no longer agreed with applied behavioral analysis the way i thought i did . we never bothered to find out the reason why the kids were doing things outside of broad reasons , and we just extinguished the behavior . it just felt very . inhumane , a lot of what we did .
   (ID: b8935e64705419fa81f156d0d29b88ffd1e2f443)

17. my mom did some things that made me have really low self  esteem , and i can ' t just seem to fix it .
   (ID: 2f03a8d589defb9434044b9ef9bfffc676e2b49a)

18. this is enlightened . complaining is not the same as soliciting advice . so often a child ' s minor complaint about something gets a response telling them what they did wrong , just making the kid feel bad .
   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

19. i just had three days off ! i visited my grandparents , met with a friend for coffee , did some baking , cleaned the house and played an unreasonable amount of stardew valley
