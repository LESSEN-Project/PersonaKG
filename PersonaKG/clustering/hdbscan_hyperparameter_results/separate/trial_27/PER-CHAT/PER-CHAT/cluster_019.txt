1. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .

3. if it ' s staples requesting you to do so and not a subpoena from the courts you ' ve never been to court related to it ? , don ' t waste your time by going . once you show up to court the first time , you will need to show up every month until you are actually called and might be required to be there until a verdict comes out . fyi your current company would pay you the same way they pay jury duty .

5. the reason the different categories exist is because some pets they don ' t have the time or interest in making the necessary animations for them to overrides , every pet that they don ' t make the animations for become followers instead . i do wish they ' d stop releasing new pets as followers because they ' re universally ignored if they can ' t be used for overrides , but hey they ' re a lot cheaper to produce and pad out the content so jagex likes them .

8. yeah it ' s annoying but over time it does get better . it will always be there but you get used to it . i don ' t worry about it much nowadays . if i ever get a flare up or more pain than usual i do the exercises over a week or two and it settles down again .

11. you  ll go through about an hour or so of practicing the moves on the ground with the guys who will be strapped on to you , they never once talked about what to do if you wanted to back out , so the thought was never in your mind . when you get up in the plane , they  ll talk you through it while you reach altitude . when you reach altitude , you don  t have much time before they pretty much throw you out of the airplane . it was fun , i was excited to do it so i was never scared of it .

14. i only experience a split stream if i don ' t pee immediately after ejaculating . i usually get an urge to pee within five minutes after sex or masturbating . i hold it for a while before going , it will do the same thing that you described . i started sitting down to pee while at home around six months ago and a lot of my problems have been resolved . i ' ve found that in the sitting position , urine is able to exit the urethra better and i don ' t need to shake or pump out any remaining liquid when i ' m done . i still use a public urinal when it ' s available , except when i ' m at work because it takes more time and my boss qualifies for a stupid loophole in the state break law .

15. let him sit and watch tv all day . ask him what he likes . tell him stories about the two of you and your favorite show  time together . listen to any of his stories , even if they are ridiculous . don ' t expect anything from him , so when he does remember it will be a gift . rotate caregivers frequently to avoid burnout . check out local care facilities , cost , and requirements . join a support group .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

17. i agree . i don ' t see why kids should compete with anyone but themselves . sporting events , talentshows , spelling bees . i never really got that . there ' s still time for that later . as a teacher i tend to focus on process and not so much on product . children are individuals .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

18. if i have to go someplace new for some sort of obligation , i don ' t mind a long  ish drive . it gives me time to get mentally ready .

19. apprenticeships ! you can work and get a degree at the same time . you do it with a company , you get a reduced salary , but it means you don ' t have to pay anything , and you get experience in the workplace . you do come out of it with a degree in whatever field your apprenticeship was in
