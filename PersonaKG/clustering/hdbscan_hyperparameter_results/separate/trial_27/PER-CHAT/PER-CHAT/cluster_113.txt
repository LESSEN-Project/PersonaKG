2. emailing would definitely be your best bet . your wording of the email i extremely important , and i  ve been told by my research mentor that a majority won  t answer you . you have to keep on emailing not spamming them , wait a few intervals of time before emailing again

9. while watching this , it occurred to me that they had sold millions of records at the time , and they definitely had played those songs enough times to play them flawlessly , every time . you ever see a band that has sold millions of records get wasted and play poorly , especially a punk band ? from what i ' ve seen , more often than not muscle memory is quite real . i am a musician too , but i do play " simple " music  more often than not , if you played the same sets hundreds upon hundreds of times , you will at some point just be able to play it without thinking at all .

10. this is literally what i ' ve been thinking this whole time . but this manga keeps throwing curve balls at me so it ' s probably wrong .

11. it ' s not that they ' ve degraded , its that the quality you got used to got better over time . video explains it in further detail .
   (ID: 395865cc8932d0b3d13214bce052e8915f32835b)

12. keep yourself busy and let time do its work . depending on how deep your love was and how long you ' ve been together , it might take a while .
   (ID: 7aa559a048e16f5e07993ececfa9eb494e72a8fc)

   (ID: 6ea82786a74ccdc85dc1fddd809a575aa4e4efcf)

19. i ' m responding to this   if you told one lie in your life is it fair to describe you as a liar ? i ' m saying , not your whole life . but if you ' ve told a lie in the past week , i would describe you as a liar . there ' s a period of time somewhere between a week and a lifetime that it should be forgiven .
