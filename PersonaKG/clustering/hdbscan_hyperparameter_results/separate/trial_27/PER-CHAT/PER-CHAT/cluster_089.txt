11. i guess you ' re right . the only issue is that when i get along with a guy have a lot in common , instant click , share similar goals  values  etc there comes a point where he tells me just doesn ' t want a relationship . after a month or so he ' s dating someone this has happened three times now , hence why i believe i ' m the reason

13. yta you come off as an ungrateful leach and when they told you " hey this is how we do it here , its polite and shows respect , and we will still pay for it " you decide you ' re better than their culture and just refuse to be a part of anything they want to include you in . i can understand why they would be upset with you

14. just last week a girl at my job would always want to chat with me , she ' d even wait for me to get to break so i could sit with her . i thought it was weird and couldn ' t figure out if she was being friendly or not so i ignored it i suck at reading signals now she doesn ' t bother . oh well
