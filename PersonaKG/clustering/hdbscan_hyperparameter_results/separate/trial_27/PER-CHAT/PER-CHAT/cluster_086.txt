1. not sure how to feel about this but i think i like it .
   (ID: 89a0689162d7d341f5389b93a7b5fc391663c68d)

2. i suppose you ' re right , but i ' d like to think that i deserve to be wanted and  or desired .
   (ID: fddeeaa11799939dfe96bc7fae74a22b474aaf20)

3. what do you mean ? do you think it ' s like a conspiracy or something ?
   (ID: dc639446b154d74c8655191b5a755643abd00c2d)

4. i think it was more that his character evolved the most . he started out as a date rapist and eventually ended up a monogamist who openly loves blair . he still makes mistakes of course , but he is actually remorseful and doesn ' t continue to repeat bad habits like all the other characters . also , his character has a lot of dimension , which makes him more interesting than someone like nate .

5. i dont think it works like that but ok
   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

6. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .

7. would u ever think about selling some of the stuff , like the songs she wrote ? i love little things from the past like that and id totally buy one off you .
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

8. i like that . i think the origin of " god bless you " was the belief that when you sneeze some of your soul escapes .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

9. yeah . i dont get that . even as someone who likes trump , this is something i think is okay to make fun of . he even makes fun of his own typos like when he typed covfefe
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

10. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

11. i used to be like that too , not anymore though . but i ' m afraid i will at some point think about it again so i like to make jokes because it makes something i ' m scared of a little less scary .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

12. again . it ' s unlikely you ' ll ever like the way it sounds , because it ' s not what you ' re used to hearing of your voice . but others may like it more than you think .
   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

13. i think i found it ! something called " captain blasto . this article says that one of his lines is " honey i ' m home "  here ' s a gameplay video , though it looks ps1 instead of n64 . but this is definitely your guy , in space with a blaster with the wisecracks very much like the gex game i remembered
   (ID: abbe051c76bbb939d8594349cac549cb5435920d)

14. i think it ' s more like when you go to pick up your kid from school but you forgot his name .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

15. i think hot manifests crazy , and i like hot . so by the power of association , i like crazy
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

16. it ' s amazing what teams miss . i think they start overthinking and outplay themselves . bill is like i ' ll do this till you can stop me . if you can ' t sucks for you .
   (ID: 7ed1ff576cc7dc77750ed5f15461eb3ccdb52a7a)

17. rehorical gramps . i got class we can continue talking shit when i figure out what we  re doing . i enjoy banter winking  facealmost as much as i  m going to be enjoy fucking your silly ass up . i bet you think you  re like that guy from gran torino . you  re not , life isn  t like the movies oldster .
   (ID: 54271e4114265f638c8e4c59d7a3b35b6caa55bf)

18. i think the question is asking what industries you ' d like to kill off , i think you ' re taking it as an insult
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

19. i like how you have nothing to do in your life except type insanely long answers to a random persons question . does it honestly matter to you what i think and believe in ?
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

20. do girls think of boys the way we think of them ? like if a girl hears someone on reddit is boy checks for photo posts or tried to imagine  what they look like .
