1. this is not entirely true . it is in my case . but for the majority of people , they decide to screw around for fun and suddenly become addicted . i don ' t even have an addictive personality , i just like how drugs feel .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

2. i was massively overweight for the majority of my early life and got bullied for it to an extent , not to the point of trauma , but enough to motivate me . it ' s like a really painful band  aid that people like to put back on you and then rip off again , but you just need to eventually sew up the wound yourself so they don ' t have a place to put that band  aid anymore .

3. well , as harsh as it might sound , there might be people in your life who have slept with everyone but you and they still don ' t owe it to you to sleep with you . that said , i guess it ' s one ' s own choice whether one wants to hang around with a person like that , not out of spite , but out of being annoyed by being regaled with all the fine details which might be tmi .

4. why are you asking this ? like other people said there ' s nothing wrong with it , they don ' t hurt anyone for me as long as they don ' t convince others to be gay i ' m ok with it , they ' re humans just like you and me

5. couldn  t agree with you more . yes it wasn  t a perfect remake but it was pretty damn close in my books . if people don  t like remakes , i get that . but i can  t understand why people on reddit hate on this movie otherwise . i  m not sure what people who didn  t like it would have changed . the video said jungle book was better ? how ? they were almost the same in turns of animation . i liked it . my friends liked it . like you said the original will always be number one in my heart . but this was a damn fine movie in its own right .

6. i get why some people don ' t like the casting choices but why not give them a chance and at least watch some of their performances which by the way i can ' t find much for anya

7. i don  t get the hate . i hang out on video gaming board . it  s just people wanting to have fun like me and you
   (ID: 726c36ce13fa631676ed5053f62b0f5f7b61eb5e)

8. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

9. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .

10. i get what both of you are saying . i never intend for this post to get up voted so much . i was just super excited . it was my first post on reddit . but post like this is what has kept me going . the overwhelming support is awesome . and other people have encouraged me to go after the dlc . i don ' t see anything wrong with that . we play and post cause we are having fun . what ' s wrong with that ?

11. um , no the odds of him having a child are the odds of anyone else having a child . you either do or you don  t . and he could use a surrogate like plenty of straight people do too .

12. some dogs don  t like people with hats on . might just be something they aren  t used to . or a bad experience .
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

13. i absolutely hate the threads that are deep  seated in woman hating . yet these people cry and moan about not having friends or a life outside of reddit . gee , i wonder why ? maybe if half the people on reddit stopped whining , stopped giving into the hivemind and show girls some respect . maybe , juuuuust maybe , she will like you . also , reddit is not a reliable source of dating advice ! when a single woman goes on a date with you , all your karma points don ' t mean shit . show her you ' re not an asshat and she ' ll like you .

14. yeah exactly . i personally don ' t really like the new design myself , but if people do , perhaps there ' s something there that i may have missed out on . perhaps some cool new feature i missed out on that makes it better than what ' s already here . i mean , if it ' s not broken , why fix it ?

15. i really really hope i don  t get hate for this , but there is the medication like you said . but diets have helped people . there might not be proof from a medical standpoint , but people do post their stories with diet with updates , and some of them end up clearing completely like psoriaisbuddy on youtube . auto immune protocol diets as an expample . anyways , just suggestions .

16. i have to ask you why you don ' t look this up yourself ? you have to be on the internet to type and submit your comment so why not just do a quick google search ? one of the biggest problems in this country is that a lot of people do not research anything themselves . they simply wait for someone to present information to them . when they don ' t like the information they hear , even if it is true , they dismiss it and when they hear information they do like they accept it even if it is false . it ' s absolutely ridiculous how easily manipulated people can be .

17. saw someone post something like this the other day . i don ' t understand how people don ' t get , it ' s not at all confusing . users submit any content they like , which gets voted on by the community , and those which get overwhelmingly positive feedback reach the front page of the internet
   (ID: 7d39153e3adadffd15e1638679c2e1cdc5c64fde)

18. i have the mentality of " well i don ' t like myself so why would other people like me . this just makes me push people away . the few people that i feel comfortable talking to always remain aquaintances .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

19. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .

20. don ' t complain to the people in the same situation as you , and don ' t complain to your subordinates . if you have an issue , take it higher and work towards resolving it . sitting around talking to your coworkers about how much your job sucks just makes you look like a whiney , entitled prick
