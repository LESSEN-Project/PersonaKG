3. not necessarily . i was answering op ' s question truthfully . i can ' t really rely on anybody except myself to get what i want , you know ? if i bring another person into that equation , they ' re going to fuck it up because they ' ll have their own problems . if there ' s one thing i don ' t need , it ' s more problems .

7. you don  t need to know characters sexuality to play a game . and it  s better that way because hell , they could be gay , you wouldn  t know , so you can believe what you want about them .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

8. i don ' t know if i count but my ocd ruined my life to the point i had to be hospitalized multiple times . i can ' t control my thoughts and i want to be productive but my intrusive thoughts just get so bad . i want to go to college and eventually a job but these damn thoughts are ruining it for me .
   (ID: f9d3bf7ce779e854aa865f12a7dfaaee14a65cfa)

9. all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be  so i guess what i  m saying is breathe . enjoy each breath and take it for what it is . you  re not in the past and if you keep looking back you  ll never enjoy today . and life is a beautiful thing that you don  t want to let pass by . i don  t know if that will help but it  s the advice i can give . best of luck

10. probably a matilda situation . in my experience , your parents don  t have to tell you that you were unwanted and they resent you for it . kids are pretty intuitive that way , and if he didn  t know before then he probably knows now based off of the fact that they want literally nothing to do with their grandchild . but i bet the maternal grandparents will have more than enough love to go around !
   (ID: b40d1d3ae1e77bcbdcb98e62deea24396d4b4d40)

11. nope i  m having the same issue and i def don  t want ghw . am looking through her moments on wechat right now to see if she posted better pics . will let you know if i find anything useful !

12. firstly because it was a long response , and it wasn  t angry , i thought u were offended . secondly was daily in capitals i now know it was a mistake and the fact that you told me to go and get the armour myself , which would be pointless as i don  t want it
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

13. sims is only boring if you don  t know what you want out of life . me ? i just go around and impregnate already married sims face  with  tears  of  joy
   (ID: 08da4119a215672a002df8147181afbb771a75f9)

14. start sometime this week or next week and the interview is tomorrow morning . which is great cos it  s soon , but i also don  t know how long it  ll be for an in  person interview and then a potential offer or not . the second job is way better for me in terms of  and parking ! first job isn  t too bad but parking is awful . so ideally i want the second one .
   (ID: 5f75c9b696f1ea78d1a7d21e5a6d5dd1c9391b14)

15. i don ' t know who needs to hear this right now , but you can literally do anything you want in your house , it ' s not illegal unless you get caught .
   (ID: a93c4b4e04523abdf134a40204e81619d6e659ef)

16. ah , well in this case i ' m not sure , sorry ! i guess what you want is a way of speeding up the responsiveness of actions , but unless you actually had a system to play with and test ideas i don ' t know how it would actually behave .
   (ID: aa4c399e0083dd1bf730546e6c4fbd9b75104d67)

17. you don  t have to . just letting you know about the side subs that these kind of posts would be more popular and appropriate in . it  s still twd , so you can keep it if you want .
   (ID: d8492ac2e05f869f3bd79bafc9f32c603a615e59)

18. well , i hope that you ' re still here . those friends that your referring to , those aren ' t the type you want to have . if they don ' t like you or your interests , that ' s their lost , not yours . if you don ' t mind me asking , why does your mom want you to move back in ? you may call her narcissist , but aren ' t all parents , in a way ? i would suggest you call her . if you kill yourself , it could destroy her . i wouldn ' t know , but maybe she wants you to move back in because she likes having around . maybe she needs some help , that is if she lives alone .
   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

19. that ' s the way i ' d go . if you don ' t want to do any of the things you already know , knowing more means options you might not have considered will open up .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)
