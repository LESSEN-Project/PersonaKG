2. not sure what you meant by that ? i was just letting you dig your hole of assumptions until you finally called me a carnivore . felt good to throw that one back in your face .

3. dude i didn  t mean to come off as judging ! i was just expressing my surprise at different cultures . that  s fair enough and i  m glad you have a good mum .
   (ID: b1f9e512a76d2c07b1eae248bca4e0bf140d4bc8)

4. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .

5. if you send me pc vods i can still analyze them and give you coaching tips or just discuss strategy via discord , but i cant join games on pc . good luck finding a coach though !

6. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .

7. just sit with good posture ! i have some friends who game with their feet up on the desk . one of them already has back issues and he still does it !
   (ID: 5d6cecafd26473d96b39b973965364f09d4d41f1)

8. i wish you could meet my cat , buuuut . learn more about them and what their body language means . understanding them helps a lot . and just keep an open mind over all , good luck !

10. just change your definition of ' instant ' and you are good to go !
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

11. good explanation , thanks . i agree . manhood can  t be measured , as that plays into the concept toxic masculinity . then the belief of manhood being measured should instead be just considered how macho someone is ? not in a negative sense for example , if you see a strong , burly man with a beard and place him next to george constanza , considered the former with higher manhood is wrong , but instead maybe more macho  stereotypically masculine characteristics ?

12. good luck my friend , you got this ! just remember , others are comparing themselves to you as well , everyone does it .

13. i should of known that the prices for these pokemon ones were too good to be true . they are quite hard to get hold of here in the uk , so fraudsters have filled the gap in the market by flogging these fake ones . ebay will be on your side to and help you and get you a refund if you receive a fake , it is just a lot of hassle that is probably best avoided !

14. thanks ! and yes i was talking about the night vision . since now i  m assuming the night vision won  t give any real details in the character all you need to do is just a fix up and you are good to go . but i  m just a casual gamer who is giving a really , uninformed opinion . again good luck to you !

17. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !

20. that i just applied for a  10k  loan that will be looming over me for the foreseeable future in hopes of not washing out of college and getting a job good enough to pay of for the loan plus interest in an extremely competitive society that is only growing more cutthroat by the day . college is fun .
