1. you know what , i kinda like this . if you can clean this up a bit , this style could be good .

2. i ' m anxious too and that would bring me super down . are those guys average looking or extra attractive ? it seems like a lot of work to have someone come over for sex and do an oh hell no rather than just getting off . not that that ' s a good thing per se but at least you wouldn ' t know . i ' d try and give you my honest opinion but i might be too nice to do so .

4. i feel like it wouldn  t be so good honestly . i know i shouldn  t judge a book by its cover but the movie  s plot seems too bizarre to me .

5. that can ' t be healthy . yeah my friends are literally the reason i even know of furries because their the ones that told me about them in the first place . now of course it wasn ' t good stuff but i gradually started to like them from my one sided mind .

6. my point is that there may be a youtuber you like more and you would never know . sparklz is good tho but i stopped watching minecraft a while ago and now that i use reddit myself he doeant have any content that interests me .

7. it  s sort of a human pheromone . certain smells attract us like how we know something tastes good before we eat it based on how it smells .

8. looks like the kid is pretty harmless , but you never know . looks too good to pass up .
