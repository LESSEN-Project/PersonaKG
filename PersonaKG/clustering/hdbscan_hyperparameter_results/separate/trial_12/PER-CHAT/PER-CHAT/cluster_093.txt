1. the blackness within whatever one may call my soul would give the great old ones pause . unfortunately for me and fortunately for everyone else , my conscience is too strong . it causes me a great deal of stress to contain the evil within , yet i could not cope if even the tiniest drop slipped out . i am dumbfounded by those who act with malfeasance . what lack of self control they exhibit . how damaged are they that they can ' t contain . i ' m lucky to have this self control . all of you are lucky as well .
