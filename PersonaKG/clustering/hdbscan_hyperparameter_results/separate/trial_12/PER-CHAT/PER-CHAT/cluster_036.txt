1. there was a time , not so long ago , when things like this were all we had . for gen x this qualifies as gaming .

3. for some , like the darkmoons , you can do both at the same time , but for most the ai is faster . pvp is only faster if you have someone to grind with since its a bit dead atm for the gestures you have to get them all one on character , the same with all the other achievements .

6. well , it uses satellites , which by itself sounds like a lot of flat earther ' s deny as well even though you can see them with the naked eye . and clearly with optics . those satellites orbit the earth on fixed paths . at any time , there are at least three in the sky above you , and by calculating the time that a signal takes to reach you , and the other satellites , it is able to find your position through trilateration .

9. christmas with the kranks , the whole movie is this couple who wants to do something differently this time for christmas , and the entire community flips their shit and bullies them to teach them to never change or do something different .
   (ID: 661cbd631caa9db4ab702976879371243802e35e)

10. it depends , me , being judged for a long time , needs the extra assurance . but there is a fine line between being like that naturally and being like that do to circumstances
   (ID: 72b6366221d77b2fc8bc314dd4ba65436ee466f1)

13. my mom makes remarks like that all the time
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

14. i ' d still be able to text . but my thumbs would fly up towards the closest perspective of my eyes like they ' re in front of my face . and the letters would seem like they ' re popping up and out of the screen . so i ' d even astound myself how i type in full sentences while i ' m watching all that go down . it ' s a vicious and perpetual cycle of hallucinating . by the time i ' m down i just put my phone down and take a deep breath " glad that ' s over with "
   (ID: 199704b2ab3344a95185dd1a9c09023379518eb0)

15. it ' s not about time . you just have to immerse yourself by moving to a place where the language is spoken and it will flow like a period .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

16. with a face like that it  s no wonder you  d wanna be high all the time
   (ID: f23956d7a437d91e64a9d94dcd8eaae6945fa691)

17. there  s a sub called  entitled parents  that  s full of things like this . it is difficult to have a child with special needs . you deserve to have a nice time , just like everyone else . but , you can  t ruin everyone else  s time in the process . if your child is screaming and yelling , you have to leave . you  re not being discriminated against , no one is picking on you , you are disturbing a place with a set of rules and you have to follow those rules .
   (ID: f18b19a52bbf1505af84d01563a51626d4ae363f)

20. i wonder if it is that when we are waiting for something we measure time against itself . in other words , when one checks the time it is like a reset  like the time before doesn ' t matter . the increments get smaller , yet feel longer . on the other hand big one , little one , take your pick when we are engaged or entertained we are not paying attention to the passage of time .
