1. it ' s insane that people think we all came from two people .
   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

2. in my culture , if your ears are warm it means someone either mentioned you or someone ' s talking about you . when my ears suddenly inexplicably get warm , i think people are talking about me that exact moment .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

3. it honestly not that . i think it  s smugness coming from people who think they are more important than they are .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

4. i do find it girly  " gay " to not be weirded out by a stranger covering you in lotion and rubbing up on you . how is that exclusive to those who are girly or gay ? that ' s fucking ridiculous . what do you think women and gay people are like ?
   (ID: 372e357e1e3acd2a4dea24aa56a5900a539a9e59)

   (ID: 33483b17911ec063ef4562ae3263fe478eba6a2c)

6. that ' s where breath comes from . what else would people think ?
   (ID: 5218a6fd3b7d990775fbaa39249c20beea16f741)

7. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

8. well its not like most people think , everyone knows my name and who i hang out with and stuff , im mostly known for my jokes tho so that helps .
   (ID: 43ff6712f938088182c4011cf9d1aa047c64130b)

9. some stupid people think being gay is a defect are are trying to treat it . but , like i said , they ' re stupid .
   (ID: 4bb0a21212688dbc67fe64d6f42fca297fed4f4f)

10. if this is a fan given award lebron ' s gonna win it , so many people would vote for him without caring about the others and after watching all the videos i think donovan , lebron and dwight powell are actually the ones who deserve the award the most

11. do you think it ' s funny when people with red meat allergies get hurt or die because of this ?
   (ID: febdcc12d3197b7a4d4961055915936bb23ef3ee)

12. i think that people shouldn  t have to lie about their beliefs . i think their religious beliefs shouldn  t be mentioned at all
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

13. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

14. i think it ' s perfectly fine to call people out on their shitty spelling and grammar . now everyone knows what our opinions are . hooray !
   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

15. people often hide names in screenshots , i think it is  was against the rules to include them .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

16. no . okay , think about it like this  people are made up of atoms , and when you die your atoms go off and become other things . this means that every girl would most likely be made up of atoms that were once in a dude , so if you bang her you are technically banging a dude , and that ' s fucking gay .
   (ID: a90f01f580b7cc08038958d5c1f659fd492b1f2c)

17. i agree . do you think it ' s white people ' s fault that the number of black people in these fields is so small , like a lot of people think ?
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

18. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

19. biggest plot twist is when people realise i ' m a boy . because i have long hair so people think i ' m a girl i ' m like . wot
