3. no i think you raise a valid point which contributes to the discussion . people get raped and murdered every day , it ' s horrific , but just because of her status in life , this woman got a lot of media attention .

9. don ' t say anything . i honestly don ' t see what the big deal is . i thought one man ' s trash is another man ' s treasure . i feel that applies to everything including life . i honestly don ' t have any interests or passions worth pursuing or working towards so don ' t really see why i should stick it out any longer than i have to . i went to post secondary got my degree , got laid , got high , got drunk and don ' t really feel like there ' s anything left worth doing . i have no places i honestly want to travel to . the only things i really like doing in my spare time are video games watching movies and getting intoxicated . i ' m never getting married or having kids because fuck that bs . all i honestly want to do now is have enough money to retire so i can drink more which is waaaayyyy too far away .

10. well , gosh ? why wouldn ' t you ? black cats are the best . as i am sure you know .

11. depends on their costs . at first , probably  but it ' s only a matter of time for a dentist to start advertising how much cheaper this new method is . one man could drive a dozen dentists out of a job easily , if this meets sensationalized expectations .

12. thanks all . i ' ve done a large scale crown lift on the tree , so hopefully shouldn ' t be too bad with the light . it ' s a neighbour ' s tree but i took as much advantage as i dared when they said i could do what i wanted to it . the area got a fair bit of sun in the summer last year , before i cut the tree . so will risk it , i don ' t really have much option to go elsewhere with the plots . the daikon  green manure idea sounds good . but can i resist the urge to get growing veg this year ?

13. the other issue with speculation sub is they are parroting articles and online blogs about the movie that are either from disney or sanctioned by them . then they use this to back their speculation . i like to read some of the speculation but when they start re  writing what has happened or quote some fake news i voice my concerns . has everyone forgotten that the us government called out and are prosecuting people over an online campaign by a foreign power to influence the result of the digit election ? on any sub we should call out bs when we see it , and expect people to do the same for me if i post crap too .

14. the word " fuck " have always been my favorite word all  time , because you can use it whatever the fuck you want to

16. how do you know how much of a role leprechauns play in the world ? have you conversed with one ?

18. do you work on an australian mine site ? it sounds just like working there . if you come across a piece of paper on the floor you can ' t just pick it up , you have to fill in a form first . " what is the hazard ? why is it a hazard ? can it be removed ? what are the dangers of removing it ? what will happen if i attempt to move it ? considering your answers what is the best course of action " once you submit your form to a supervisor they will read it and get back to you on what they believe the best course of action is .

19. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?

20. don ' t get me wrong i would still love to fuck jennifer aniston but why didn ' t she go through the slutty phase digit years ago .
