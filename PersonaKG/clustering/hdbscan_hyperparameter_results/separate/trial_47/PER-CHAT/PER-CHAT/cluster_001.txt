3. i was taking a shit in my alternative school bathroom stall , put my phone on the floor so it wouldn ' t fall out my pocket and break , some guys walked in and saw it on the floor , my teacher thought i was watching porn , my probation officer heard about it , i lost my phone to him for a week . that ' s my only story so far . and it wasn ' t even a porn watching story .
