4. agreed . i ' d rather watch it and listen to it in my own language . i admit some of the dubbing can sound really bad the show golden boy is the first to come to mind but i ' m not picky about a lot of it .

5. this is the best thing ever ! a quick question tho will there ever be a warning applied letting you know that someone sent an agi or bufu in your direction ?

7. i don ' t know why either . what is it that makes people take an overwhelming interest in what others might be doing behind closed doors ?

8. it came from me . here ' s what happened  my best friend ' s girlfriend was spraying water at another one of my friends , and i , as a joke , and i say " stop squirting on me , or i ' ll squirt on you " oh , and another one , this time a joke i made up  put the emphasis on bam in alabama , and you ' re like ala bam i ' m fucking my cousin because that ' s what happens there , i guess

9. i used to be an extreme example of this . i ' d assume intercourse meant he loved me and ultimately wanted to marry and have kids with me . thank god for guy friends setting me straight . main reason to disclose and have some sort of talk is to filter out girls who think the way i used to . they may not be stalker psychos but were simply raised with a certain set of beliefs and have peers who share them .

10. you and your feelings are valid , don  t forget that . it is hard getting that hard sign the relationships over , particularly at a very difficult time in your life . i  m sorry for that , but also recognize the emotional and mental energy given to your ex  partner can now be re  routed to healing yourself and helping your mom . a small consolation but sometimes it helps me to find the positive in a situation . you  ve got this op , you are strong , resilient , and worthy of someone who cares about your wellbeing

11. i don ' t think you know what i mean . we can eliminate jesus being a human . therefore he is a alien

12. i felt the same way in the past . but maybe the fact there is no objective point is a good think ! you can choose to do something or absolutely nothing .

13. my favorite book series is the dresden files by jim butcher . the quality of the first couple books isn ' t great , so i recommend starting with dead beat book digit in the series . that will give you a feel for what the series as a whole is like , and if you like it , then go back and start from book digit .

14. i ' m proud of my body and how much hardwork , time and effort i ' ve dedicated to the gym . i can ' t really talk to anyone about it because i ' ll come off as conceited or something . but i ' m so proud of myself .
   (ID: 4e289af5e18133c4578deba659b7e1d2784a925d)

15. i think you ' re missing my core point . it ' s perfectly reasonable to your end your relationship with someone . but to stop loving them in your heart because of money ? if that ' s what you think , you sir are the one who has a lifetime of darkness ahead of you .

16. hmm , well i can be pretty bitter about it too . although i still occasionally get propositioned for sex so i guess i could be uglier . too bad i ' m kind of involuntarily asexual meds and other issues or else i ' d sleep around more . at least someone wants to touch me lol . i ' ve done the weight loss thing and that didn ' t really help not like those before and after pictures where the after is a totally cute guy . it doesn ' t help help that i ' m a socially anxious and naturally introverted reserved person been that way since before the tumblr era so it ' s hard for my inner personality to come out so that ' s another strike . i guess just hold on to see if someone can look past looks and try not to be a forever aloner . pretty hokey advice that i try to give myself .

17. i may be moving to mt soon for work ! i ' ve read that people from montana are not super stoked on outsiders moving into the state . did you find this to be true ? thanks and enjoy that snow ! happy new year

18. i get stuck in a place with no dimensions , it  s just darkness around me . i can see things , but can  t tell how far away they are because i have no frame of reference for their size . it  s really hard to explain . it  s almost like floating , but i have a feeling of being heavy , almost weighed down by something . i guess the best way to explain it would be emptiness , with an occasional object in the distance ?

19. if you go to new londo ruins there ' s a guy behind some bars who sells sorceries , which use intelligence . or you can save a pyromancer a bit later on to get pyromancies . attunement simply affects how many spells you can equip

20. i think i would start by finding the venue i want my funeral to be at . i would place clues there that would take the form of clue or some shit . i would carefully pick out a guest list and assign personas to them . i would higher a mortician to make my dead body look like i was murdered and i would get my best friend in the whole world to accidentally knock my coffin over so my body would fall out . the she would find a piece of paper in my pocket that said  i will see you at the funeral  with bloody fingerprints on it . cue murder mystery funeral .
