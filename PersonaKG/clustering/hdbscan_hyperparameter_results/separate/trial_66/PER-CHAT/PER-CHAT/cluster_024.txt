3. in my honest opinion , i know it ' s loosely based on real history but i think they killed off ragnar way too early . and floki ' s story is getting stale really quick . ivar and his brothers are acting stupid . and lagertha needs to pull her head out her ass . this show turn a turn for the worse . not to mention the stupid way they set up their season numbering .

8. it bothers me so much when cops in shows are willing to plant evidence to catch someone , and they don ' t really get called out for it , at least not in a meaningful way . that ' s so illegal .
