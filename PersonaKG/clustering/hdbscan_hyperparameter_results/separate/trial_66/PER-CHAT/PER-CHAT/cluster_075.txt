18. how anyone could act like that is beyond me . i don ' t understand this new surge with the " pack " mentality . it ' s a primal trait that is affecting certain populations art an alarming rate . is there a de  evolution happening before our eyes or is this a product of modern society ' s failures ?

19. mh . that ' s harsh . but i don ' t get it though . it ' s like one wishes for one ' s own death to be like a curse taken off his loved ones . because that ' s basically what happens when this one dies . they might not be exactly hated , but . it ' s odd .

20. many thanks for this insight . this is gold for me . it ' s bothering me that i don ' t seem to find anything from the public opinion or like articles about the topic . i ' m writing a paper about it and sadly there isn ' t much i can reference .
