2. i know this sounds like a standard answer giving to everyone , but i know that its the best way . i know that because i also was in that position when you have lost so many of your friends , that there is no place to start , to regain them . put yourself out there , and with out there i mean really into the world of the people you want to befriend . when i needed a friend to go to parties with , i needed to go out alone , to find those with similar interest . and is definitely not so hard when you start building up confidence to go up ro people . most people don ' t have a reason to approach you when already having their social circle , so there is no was around for you to just start randomly talking with people that think may be symphatic . nearly all of the people i started talking to reacted super positve on that behavior . some may find it strange at first , same stick to that attitude and evem some of them will become your friensy

3. my dad would always beat me at monopoly . once , i was winning a game of monopoly when my dad intentionally poured a bottle of wine on the table , ruining the board , and ending the game . since we didn ' t finish the game , he declared it a tie . that was over digit years ago and i still haven ' t forgiven him .

5. hi , thanks for replying . your perception of if is quite interesting . how long did it take you approximately to get into that zone where you could eat only when you were really hungry and not just cuz its ' been a while since last meal ' ?

9. well , i did some reading and mostly what gets mentioned is the psychological impacts on the people that were experimented on . but you cannot tell me absolutely no advancement was made on diseases . which they did experiment with . but ! i shall admit that i was wrong over all . also i ' m not saying what they did was right , rather it was done , it was horrible but there is knowledge that was gained regardless .

10. i wasn  t saying every  og  does this , it  s just that a lot of them do . i do agree it would be cool if they did that but i also think some people need to quit whining about it . again you don  t seem like one of those people .

14. i do have strong feelings about keeping the extremely sick alive just for the sake of it . however i ' ve had relatives with alzheimers , and long after they forgot names , they were still able to enjoy life  get joy out of it . that is the most important thing imo .

15. me and my brother went to this wedding . my brother doesn ' t drink , and he was bored . so he decided he would pretend like he ' s drunk . so he sit with other digit friends on a table by the dance floor . they started yelling thing like " how does it go now " and " wait for it " before the drop on every song that the dj played . this went on for almost one hour before the three of them got bored with that as well and stopped doing it . i can ' t decide if i wanted to die or to kill them . put yourself in the bride ' s shoes , three idiots ruining the wedding party out of boredom . geez .

16. oj for sure . yarn provides good , quality strategy in a nutshell and yet still manages to make it entertaining . nickatnyte and chief pat are good too , but their videos get repetitive after a while and their much longer than yarn ' s . clash with ash also provides good content , but his videos are a little too long for my taste  excellent for strategy but not that entertaining . the other ash is awesome but rarely uploads . as for the rest of the ones i ' ve seen . they ' re meh . molt and eclihpse are entertaining but they clickbait too much , and galadon is starting to go down that road too recently . those are the only ones i ' ve ever watched so don ' t hate me for forgetting any . grinning  squinting  face

18. i  m not hating on christianity , i just don  t want people assuming i  m christian when i  m not . also , i just don  t like wearing religious symbols when i don  t practice the religion , because to me that seems kind of insulting to the religion . while i don  t know what chaos magick is , i can promise you that i only use magick for good . the point you completely missed in my last comment is that i do not know everything about wicca . now please calm down and stop being rude
