4. this made me think of something that i find really ironic . the united states championship belt , which only represents as the name suggests the united states of america , a single country . while the intercontinental title represents many continents at the very least , north america , south america and europe . so one would think that the ic title would be more prestigious because it covers a greater area . but based on booking and how short title reigns tend to be with the ic belt these days . the opposite seems to be true .
