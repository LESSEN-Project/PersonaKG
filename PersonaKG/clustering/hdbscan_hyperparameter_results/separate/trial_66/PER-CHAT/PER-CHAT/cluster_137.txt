Total from this dataset: 9

1. this was done back in the days when bows were instant  fire . since you couldn ' t hold the button down longer to get more distance , the maximum range was significantly shorter , and a lot of people found it easier to pull the ghasts in close and kill them with a sword . this continues to be a valid tactic today , especially if you ' re trying to collect ghast tears and the ghasts are floating somewhere that their drops would be difficult or impossible to collect .
