16. im waiting for kunimitsu and negan , and i know several pros and cons . pros are you know the most of the match up , move , what safe and what can be punish . cons are sometimes you do wrong input for example yoshi ender i always use with f3  digit but some times i mix that with miguel button input . also , having your brain expand the size of the entire roster , sometimes i found myself think of all the move i use when i fight those character , for example like if i fight yoshi , i would expect my opponent to only use what i also used but nope he use other tech so i find it difficult sometimes . sometime you you underestimate your opponent because you know most of the match up , and other than that , you can mix some move into other character for example yoshi didn ' t have savage but you think he has cause you play most of the roster . in short it can confuse you .

18. if you use a relatively new wireless router , it may already have some sort of firewall built in , it will stop most of the obvious attacks . but obviously , this isn ' t enough , download either windows defender or malwarebytes . activate steam guard  change your password every digit  digit months , ensure it is strong and uncommon , and never use the same one for anything else , not even for your steam support account . if you have trouble remembering all the passwords for everything you do online , write it in a book if you think you are physically secure to do so . if you have to do any risky browsing , for whatever reason , do it in a virtual machine set up for that expressed purpose . and don ' t let it share any folders with the host os . never click dodgy links from chat or steam forums .

19. from my earliest memories , i loved super spicy food . my mom would use tobasco sauce on my tongue as a punishment , but it was nothing .
