16. the seti project began after astronomers began detecting pulsars , assuming that it was ' little green men ' . after examining the pulsar  and that it was not an am radio signal from et  the idea was that looking at un  natural type non  recurring of radio responses , assuming that broadcasting on the radio spectrum would be evidence of knowledge and manipulation of nature and therefore intelligence . the question is are we looking for ' life ' or evidence of ' life '  or are we looking for mr . spock ? there could be ' life ' built with silicon instead of carbon  but can we talk to it ? would we recognize it ? i think our quest is two fold , we need to decide how prevalent our idea of ' life ' is   whether it be bacteria on mars or the oceans of europa . once we have that part of the drake and then humanity can fill in some gaps and assumptions . then we can go on our search for spock .
