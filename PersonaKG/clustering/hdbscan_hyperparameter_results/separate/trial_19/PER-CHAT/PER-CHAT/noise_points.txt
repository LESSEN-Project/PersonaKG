4. im diagnosed with anxiety and all i have to say is a couple things . i used to have panic attacks everyday . it was the worst years of my life . there is no way to get rid of anxiety . everytime i see someone ask " how do you get rid of anxiety " i just tell them my story and say there is no way . ive had it for so long that i get used to it . im aware its not going to go away . i listen to music , that helps . i meditate , hard but helps . i paint my nails and chill .

10. i see your point in a sense . it ' s not that they ' re being confrontational , it ' s that people come up to the camera . there are plenty of   boring   videos where nothing happens . there are also videos where people learn their rights . there are auditors i disagree with and auditors who react well to the public better than others . suspicious activity is only suspicious to the person who doesn ' t understand what ' s going on . i suggest watching a bunch of different auditors and see which ones you like best , or none at all . i really like the boring ones where nothing happens because it shows that they ' re not out there to harass people .

15. and that  s your achievement today . you  ve made a healthier choice than millions of people around the world , people who would drink themselves to sleep . that  s something to be very proud of . even on my bad days , if i  ve brushed my teeth , i consider it not so bad . you  re achieving so much just be being able to speak to me , some random stranger from the internet . i know it feels like a stretch , but as i said , the littlest steps are often the biggest . getting started is the hardest part , but you  re already on that path by reaching out for help .

18. cool , as long as you know what you ' re getting into . never know the experience level with forum folks , ya know ? always worried i ' m going to toss out something that takes a little experience or common sense and get someone killed

19. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?
