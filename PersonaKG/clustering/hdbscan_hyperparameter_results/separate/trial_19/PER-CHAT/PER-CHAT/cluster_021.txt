4. just make a new character ! that  s part of the game ! learning and trying new builds ! just re  level another character ! it  s endless excuses over at that community when the fact of the matter is  the game is complicated for the sake of being complicated . plus , the story  theme  tone is nothing great like diablo digit and digit were . poe is not a valid replacement for diablo in my eyes .

8. overwatch . the game currently has too many ways to stop a player from playing  stunlock and all that . took a while for me to realize what it was about the game that was making me so angry , but i haven ' t been back since . sometimes i kinda miss it and want to go back , but then i see a play of the game or highlight that involves so much stunlock it hurts , and i decide not to .

20. sorry on mobile so i booted up the game today and accidentally clicked kyf instead of killer  the game lagged out for maybe a straight minute and then loaded killer without me backing out of kyf and selecting killer killer loaded weird , i had all the perks at rank three but all four perk slots , both addon slots and the offering slot were locked and all the cosmetics except mike ' s bloody mask eventually it smartened up but never did give me my mask back or take away the overalls . i ' ve even played a few matches and still nothing
