7. huh . i never romanced tali but i figured he would say it at some point , maybe you missed it ? i don ' t think shepard ever says it first though , i remember him answering " i love you too " to most of them , but not the other way around . i guess it ' s usually the love interests who confess their undying love and stuff , shep tends to show more with actions than words .

12. i had philophobia . i don ' t know if i still have it . it ' s basically the fear of love . i have it because of my parents . i had to watch them constantly argue . their sick relationship and the fact that they hardly ever showed any signs they loved me , caused some brain damage to me and now i usually can ' t listen when somebody is talking about love , especially very traditional love . i hate family as a unit and i hope i will never have children . also i find newborn babies disgusting because they are kinda a " a fruit of love " .
