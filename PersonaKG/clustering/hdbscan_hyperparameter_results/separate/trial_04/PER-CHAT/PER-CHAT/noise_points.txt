1. esh leaning on nta provided you used protection . anyway you can send him a message and tell him whatever you want if you think it  ll make you feel better but i doubt it  ll have any affect on his behaviour what so ever .

3. just take time talking with him . as a male , performance anxiety can certainly be tough . however , with the right support , it can be a great dynamic . tell him and show him that finishing early one of the main fears is perfectly normal and will take practice to control . nobody is born to be a pornstar in terms of performance right away ! for example , if he finishes early , i found the greatest confidence booster wasn  t necessarily my partner saying  it  s perfectly fine  rather showing me and reassuring me that she viewed it as me being so attracted to her that i couldn  t hold back . after we both took time to learn each other  s sexual preferences and finding the balance , the sex is great and i don  t have to worry about performance anymore the nervousness was simply caused by me thinking about societal  norms  and their implied notion of me having to perform perfectly or my woman would get bored and be unimpressed .

6. it really sucks when things don ' t work out with someone you love . people make mistakes , but cheating isn ' t a mistake . you don ' t accidentally dip your dick in someone . it ' s a choice . a choice someone who fully loved you wouldn ' t make . i ' m sorry , you probably could ' ve worked things out if that hadn ' t happened . but he did it and you shouldn ' t let him get away with it . it sucks having to live without someone you love , but people make their own choices regardless of what anyone else tells them .

7. that  s very strange . if you reall really wanted i would start a new game since it that  s pretty early , but i would try restarting maybe

8. dude , i think the main part of social skills is knowing different social clues  hints people give . for example  someone on their phone  they are busy and find it rude when people try to interrupt them someone looks really happy and approachable  most likely would be willing to talk to you someone is responding in few words , doesn ' t sound very engaged  probably not interested and sometimes , these social ques can help you determine how well the conversation is going , and maybe signal that you ' re doing something wrong

11. are these people and their one sided twitter beefs a joke or something ? this phd person has to be satire . then there  s the troll who keeps trying to stir up stuff with rackets for attention i guess ? maddox needs better foot soldiers on social media , the cringe is unreal .

12. yes , it was incredible . particularly given that the ferrari f310 was an absolute dog even in optimum conditions . schuey had irritated the hell out of me for the previous couple of seasons my flair will probably tell you why but nobody could deny his genius after that digit season .

14. these are the people that would be cowering behind you in case you had to use your ' assault ' weapon to protect their rights

15. it ' s clear you ' ve never had depression . my mind wants to do something but my body just won ' t move no matter how motivated i am . i try convicing myself to do something but subconsciously my body knows i hate my life and dont want to do it . it ' s like falling into a deep hole you can ' t climb out of without someone getting you out .

17. when you ' re the only one in your first grade class whose favorite novel is frankenstein , it dawns on you that you might not be normal .

18. i watch the zombies with binoculars from my crow ' s nest at the top of my compound on the outskirts of my town . occasionally i ' ll see a car drive by , with a zombie or two lagging behind , moving as fast as they can to chase it . i have headshot several with my . digit rifle . the first time i did it i expected them to swarm toward the sound . but no , even the closest zombies seemed to look , acknowledge my presence , then shamble away . a part of me wondered if it was me , my gun or my compound scaring them off . i wouldn ' t really mind if they came . i have a huge fence , three towers connected by my underground home and a recently installed minefield clearly marked but luckily zombies can ' t read signs . i have a water purifier , solar panels and waste disposal , as well as medical supplies . i have enough food and ammo to last digit years . it is lonely . but even when people shake on my gate to let them in i don ' t open it . the virus is undetectable and passes through saliva . i have been quarantined here since the first recorded case in brazil . i have prepared myself totally for this but now the zombies seem to be ignoring me . that ' s fine though , it ' s a good problem to have . judging by what i hear from people over cb radio , humans are the ones i need to worry about .

19. alright i  m gonna be brutally honest . quit lying and bullshitting to your self , and be you . i looked at your history and read this post idk what you did or what you want , but the biggest thing to success will be accepting everything and not lying to cope . afterwards it  s a easy path of going out of your comfort zone and changing lifestyles . if that  s not possible then you need to live so your happy . you can live in the wilderness in alaska alone for example if you hate humanity so much . personally i would love to do this but i still have other goals that require me around humanity
