3. i had a date once and the girl had no social skills . like she couldn ' t hold a conversation . i don ' t ever struggle to make conversation but this was a real shitter . in the end it was just me talking at her . the worst part is i would talk about things and she would never add to the conversation . just " yes " or " no " answers . eve now i wonder if it was me that was too talky ?

5. why don ' t we just dump amphetamines in the water supply ? isn ' t this pretty clearly a slippery  slope fallacy ? is there a real counter  argument to the ' better living through chemistry ' idea when we ' re talking about decisions individuals and their doctors make ?
