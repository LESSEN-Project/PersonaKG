5. no , i think you start as something like an atheist , tell me as a kid how well did you grasp the concept of god ? until you can comprehend the concept you aren ' t going to get anything out of it as a individual .

6. i think we ' re in agreement ? or by ' yep ' did you mean you would stop loving your mother for money reasons ?
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

7. but he ' s an addict and i believe he was molested by his mother as a kid . he has done some nice things for his kid . he always apologizes or at least does something to get on their goodside . and honestly i think he did the right thing by telling fiona that sean still used .

8. i think they did a reality show about that . a homeless man was given a lot of money . can ' t remember how much , but apparently he didn ' t really use it well . but we should try again and again .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

9. i think you did , unless you gave me the wrong info haha

10. lmao seriously tho what did she think was gonna happen how could that possibly ever go good for her .

11. i sampled 1st chapter and part of the second . there are hints of effective altruism , but not much . also , this taylor is stupidly straightforward . one would think that utmost priority for a parahuman whose power stops working when she is seen would be ways to prevent being seen . the obvious idea is making a lot of smoke bombs , making suit out of them , igniting them all . if someone sees you , you turn into smoke  spewing teenager . as soon as smoke obscures you , you gain your powers back . once smoke dissipates , you turn into smoke machine again . that ' s the idea i got by thinking about cheats for a minute . taylor who lives this , whose life and death depends on it , would think of a hundred more cheats . she did not . i am disappointed . also , i feel compelled to ask the questions  spoilers about ending of worm  s " can taylor win ? if yes  why did simurgh choose this timeline ? why didn ' t contessa involve taylor in her path to victory right away "

12. borderline ex gf did it and i was too young to think about the consequences . have been doing it for a few years now

13. like what did they think water sheep really just gave him that book ?

14. it ' s funny that you have this ego centric idea that everyone that disagrees with you is a whiny snowflake baby , and you , the one that supports a reality tv star known for being a whiny baby , are somehow the superior man . i seem to remember a whole eight years of crying when obama was in office . the media did to him much worse than what ' s happening with trump . trump is literally just giving fuel for the fire . and honestly , i think of him as a distraction from actual governing . he acts out more when important things happening . i ' m crying not from dispair , but from laughter . you think he ' ll get a second term . now i ' m gonna sit back and wait for the ' beta cuck ' insults to start rolling in

15. think back to something you did or something that happened and figure out why it was done or why you acted like that . how it effected you or others . that reflection best way i can describe it .

16. i did a quick google search of mexican rooster footed demon and i think it might be the devil in the dancehall which has a lot of similarities o your aunts story like the stranger just disappearing and his feet changing . ill leave a link to the website i found

17. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

18. i can truly relate to the part where one day you love everyone and the next it all switched up . sometimes i think i have some form of narcissism . how did you find out about it ?
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

19. no , but you ' ll think you did when you get to middle age .
   (ID: 34de9309a5c02867b676757fa019c58a66bad300)

20. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
