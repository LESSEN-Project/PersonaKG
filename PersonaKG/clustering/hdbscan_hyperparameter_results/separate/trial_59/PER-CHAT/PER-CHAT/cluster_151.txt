3. let ' s be real tho , how many times is a centurion gonna charge his heavy from neutral ? if we ' re talking about casuals , then yeah that probably works , but if we are talking high level duels then most often than not the centurion starts with a kick or a feint . btw i ' m not talking about just dodging the kick , almost the whole cast gets some sort of guard break or cc after dodging one but kensei doesn ' t , he just dodges because the recovery is so slow to do anything .

9. see now you are just trying to bait me into political arguments . i ' m not biting . i will not be commenting on comparisons to school shooters , real  world terrorism , etc . it is insensitive and unfair downplay the severity of these actions so much that you can compare them to a tv series . these are real lives being effected not just characters on a show .
