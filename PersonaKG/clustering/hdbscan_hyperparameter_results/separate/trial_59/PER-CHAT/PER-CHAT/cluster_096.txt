6. woodworking man . go pick up a stack of free pallets , and you can tear them down with an hour and a hammer . after that , you know you have free wood , so even if what you make is crap , it didn ' t cost a dime . make a shelf , box , whatever . if it ' s something you ' re into , it ' ll grow to making cool stuff . and if you ' re not into it , no harm no foul , didn ' t cost anything but a few basic tools if you don ' t have them hammer , drill and circular saw will handle most everything , and are cheap online  craigslist . good luck man ! hope it works out

14. hi , i can see that you  re really talented and you played really good if i would change one thing though i would play the original music clip in the corner so everyone who is not an guitar expert and doesn  t know what everything does can look at the original clip and the rest can ignore it because the clip is in the corner
