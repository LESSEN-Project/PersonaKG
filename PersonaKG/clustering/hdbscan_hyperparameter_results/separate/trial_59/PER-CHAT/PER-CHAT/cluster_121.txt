1. i  m not a bootlicker , i just have mad respect for the people that risk their lives to keep my county safe . i see the sacrifice that these people make for my country and i give them the recognition that they deserve . my grandfathers were in the military and they always told me to show respect to those who risked and gave their lives for my country , i guess it carries on

2. omg . murder and war are just examples of the flexibility of human morals . i knew some idiot would get wrapped around the axle over some inconsequential minutia and miss my point . it was simplistic to make a point . morality is completely relative based . mistakes are made when i apply my morals to your situation . fuck , people , get out of the fucking weeds . op wasn ' t asking about specific moral issues just morality in general . goddammit .

4. just talk to everyone you can . sure you may have some weird convos that are a lil uncomfortable but then its done and you move on with life . the more comfortable you are talking to people the easier life will be

5. because you were obviously born here , have an excellent command of english and you ' re an aussie reddit user , so i ' d imagine reasonably well informed and educated and likely , left leaning . i ' m making assumptions here just as you make assumptions about these people and their situation . i ' m assuming you aren ' t working because you ' re picky about what you ' ll do to earn a dollar , consider yourself above physical labour and simply working hard , seeking opportunities where you can find them . or the most likely assumption is that you ' re just damn lazy .

6. after reading some of the comments ive come to realise people find some of the magic eyes difficult . i assumed you could either see them or you couldn ' t . although this image is quite shallow in depth it resolves itself just as easily as any other . not entirely sure what point i ' m trying to make only that it was an eye opener so to speak
