1. going inside a home will be fine , i can  t picture japanese people saying no to that . however the sock idea mentioned on another comment is really good and would show your hosts a lot of respect . as of the tatamis . i  m sorry but i think it  s a no go , the crutches would surely pierce holes in them

2. it ' s good to hear he doesn ' t mind the crate . i wish my friends had gotten one of those huge metal crates , i think that would have saved their dog . i wish we could have conversations with our dogs and explain what ' s going on where there is thunder or fireworks . i imagine they think the world is collapsing around them or something . i have heard of people using dog training cd ' s that play scary noises or you can just use youtube videos and teach them its no big deal . good luck !

3. i think you ' re good as you are . never listen to these negative people , just ignore them . your hair looks pretty nurtured  normal , and your breasts might be smaller but that is completely okay , there is nothing wrong with you ma ' am !

4. hmm . good point . my argument seemed to be a bit flawed . i guess it  s just down to the amount people use and nothing else . or is it . i guess imma have to come back to this topic at a later date and think about it a bit more

5. i took this question as what policy the manager should implement for themselves . i have noticed that management only does what the higher ups tell them . there is no leadership . what is lacking in most places are leadership . i ' m not in a good headspace on this topic bc of my current employer lacks leadership especially at the lower levels . our turn over rate is atrocious . i always think of the old army doctrine of " people first , mission always " if you can understand what that requires , then you are on the path to good leadership .

6. i think that there is a trade off being a public persona and private persona off of camera . one ' s disguise has to be really good or the pressure to be constantly ' on ' can get to even the most seasoned celebrities . i think it would suck to be constantly hounded by people  but if done right then people would think you were cool no matter what for no reason . really it ' s a double  edged sword with trust and complicated social dynamics based  out of trust and exposure .

7. doesn ' t the poop emoji exist because the japanese word poop is similar to the word for luck ? like the emoji is for good luck ? it started out as a joke because people thought it was random to have an emoji for poop , but i think people have taken it too far . also , i hate how prevalent gross out humor is , it ' s honestly really annoying .

8. just started my second year and my old friends ditched me cause the thought i was weird , and they didn  t have a good rep so people think i  m a douche

9. i never understand what people think will happen if lowe is gone . i ' ll answer that question , nothing . nothing will happen good or bad .

10. it  s not being  holier  than  thou  , all it  s doing is challenging how we think about the people around us . if you  re a good person , great ! keep on doing what you  re doing . you are the type of person the ad is calling on to call out inappropriate behavior . that  s all .
