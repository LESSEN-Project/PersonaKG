2. my mom says ,  it  s because you  re on that game all the time .  while that  s partially a factor , i  m on the game so i don  t go into mental breakdowns every night

3. teach them that there is no end to your problems  it is a race with no finish line so take your time and don ' t rush through life only to regret it . i wish i learned that sooner

4. i agree . i don ' t see why kids should compete with anyone but themselves . sporting events , talentshows , spelling bees . i never really got that . there ' s still time for that later . as a teacher i tend to focus on process and not so much on product . children are individuals .

5. i ' ve never been discouraged from being in the room . the techs and doctors don ' t really talk to or even look at me , but i ' m there and no one every complains . might be time to switch providers if you ' re able , i kind of get there ' s not much for me to do but listen and be there for her but not letting you in if you and your partner wish otherwise is a different matter .

6. if i have to go someplace new for some sort of obligation , i don ' t mind a long  ish drive . it gives me time to get mentally ready .

7. let him sit and watch tv all day . ask him what he likes . tell him stories about the two of you and your favorite show  time together . listen to any of his stories , even if they are ridiculous . don ' t expect anything from him , so when he does remember it will be a gift . rotate caregivers frequently to avoid burnout . check out local care facilities , cost , and requirements . join a support group .

8. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .

9. this is the only time i don ' t feel bad for guilt tripping somone

11. if you are connected to internet i believe you get regular drops the only non tradable drops possible are handed out gold wrench for example which don ' t appear at this time , and achievements

12. apprenticeships ! you can work and get a degree at the same time . you do it with a company , you get a reduced salary , but it means you don ' t have to pay anything , and you get experience in the workplace . you do come out of it with a degree in whatever field your apprenticeship was in

13. the reason the different categories exist is because some pets they don ' t have the time or interest in making the necessary animations for them to overrides , every pet that they don ' t make the animations for become followers instead . i do wish they ' d stop releasing new pets as followers because they ' re universally ignored if they can ' t be used for overrides , but hey they ' re a lot cheaper to produce and pad out the content so jagex likes them .

14. if it ' s staples requesting you to do so and not a subpoena from the courts you ' ve never been to court related to it ? , don ' t waste your time by going . once you show up to court the first time , you will need to show up every month until you are actually called and might be required to be there until a verdict comes out . fyi your current company would pay you the same way they pay jury duty .

15. yes , but you probably at work in a morning . where  s the fun in that ! now you home  time for maintenance . hope they fix this dupe thing , i don  t care how long it  ll take .

16. yeah it ' s annoying but over time it does get better . it will always be there but you get used to it . i don ' t worry about it much nowadays . if i ever get a flare up or more pain than usual i do the exercises over a week or two and it settles down again .
   (ID: 2ad50e702ea7ef4cc62a34ca116f658d564c0474)

17. try to waste their time as much as possible by pretending you don ' t understand what they are talking  asking about
