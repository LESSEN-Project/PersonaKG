1. well a ton of socially anxious people think of similar shit like this that happened years and ages ago so just add it to the end of the queue .

2. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .

3. i think some people have mentioned that unless the sandbox is encouraged through narrative play , it won ' t occur even if the mechanics allow it . i like this idea , though , of sandboxing the game . here are some ideas off the top of my head   like orig dnd allow servants , slaves , and followers as rewards for quests , until your party is full of them  reward players with real estate  introduce a need for it and then create submechanics for things like smithing a sword , building a battering ram , or even modifying spells  introduce combinable elements . perhaps the magic shop doesn ' t sell potions , just ingredients . i hope these are helpful jumping off points !

4. other family members watched all of it , so i ' d be in the room through most of it . i think early on i just decided it wasn ' t for me . i get why people like it but it was marmite to me .

5. i would actually like to play this scenario . but , the thing is , everyone would just camp their wool the whole game and there wouldn ' t be too much pvp . also , i think popular people ' s wool would get target too much . but overall , great scenario !

6. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .
