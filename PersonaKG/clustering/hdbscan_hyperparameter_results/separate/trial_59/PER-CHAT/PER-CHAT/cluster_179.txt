6. religion will always be relevant no matter how smart we become or how advanced our science and technology become because that doesn ' t matter to people who turn to religion as a moral compass . religion provides some sort of hope for those living in hard times as well . obviously , large portions of mainstream religions today are pretty fucked up , but religion changes . so that ' s my answer without resorting to reddit sarcasm and typical " hurr durr religioius people stupid " answers . i ' m not religious , btw
