7. choose your poison that ' s a nice test to give to people that are literally incapable of telling good from evil , because you made them in such a way . doesn ' t sound very flattering about god ' s character , is it ?  christianity at least imho is a soothing white lie i prefer calling it opiate of the masses . it helps one notice both great utility as a painkiller and horrible side effects .   x200b

8. i was never really bullied in grade school and high school because i befriended the bullies . they had use of me helping them out with their grades , general companionship , and lending an ear to their issues , and i had use for them protection from other bullies , general companionship , so it was a mutually beneficial relationship . i thought i was above it all and would not succumb to their bullying influences , but come high school , something snapped . the good girl who was too nice for the bullies to bother , who nobody really minded , became a bully herself . i suppose it was their influence , and the anger and rebelliousness inside me that i repressed throughout my childhood that made me snap and become mean to specific people , and nice to everyone else . i had a track record of being good that nobody believed that i was capable of emotional cruelty .

10. i hate when people doesn ' t understand that an elementi has not the same properties in every molecule he ' s in . shouldn ' t otherwise your mouth explode when you put salt on food because of the sodium ? or oxygenated water be good to drink ? this is simply pure ignorance , even middle school teaches you this
