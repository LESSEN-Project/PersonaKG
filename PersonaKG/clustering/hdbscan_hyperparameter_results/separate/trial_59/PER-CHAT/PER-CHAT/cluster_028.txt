2. and there ' s no reason for them to not understand it , they just mentally disconnect . ask if they know what a penpal is , they say yes . ask them if it ' s possible to fall in love with a penpal , they say yes . ask them to imagine having a penpal over the internet , they can handle that too . but ask them to imagine falling in love with an internet penpal , and suddenly they don ' t know left from right .

6. that makes your opinion even more ignorant than it already was . or maybe your definition of abuse is different from mine . or maybe the abuse you suffered was insignificant . you obviously don ' t know what you ' re talking about becuase no woman who does would say any of the things you said here . nothing about this is funny . how dare you go online and perpetuate the idea to even one other woman that she could possibly deserve to be abused ? shame on you .
