1. i hate streaming movies , the quality no matter how good your internet is almost always is worse than the physical copy . another reason i don  t use it is because there have been times at my friends house that we want to watch a movie but he only streams so if his internet is out and it happens pretty often , he  s pretty cheap we can  t watch anything .

2. oof , as a woman i suggest you not to spoil women that much , some of us get used to get all we want and then it ' s really hard to get on track again . not my case , i made clear to my boyfriend we are equal and he can count on me as much as i can count on him . i suggest you to talk to her and give her an ultimatum , you should take care of her but she ' s abusing it and not thanking what you do for her . obviously you need to change this , and don ' t have any kids for now , neither more pets or expenses . that wouldn ' t be good for the kids or you .

3. it is not a good life . you really have only the things you really need and nothing more . you cannot buy cigarettes , you cannot buy a computer , you cannot buy anything at all if you don ' t want to cut down something from food or clothing .

4. for fucks sake . no i ' m no talking about iraq . enjoy a joke . live life for fun . quit looking down your nose . fine , call me a " foolish yankee " if you want . i ' ll laugh at myself too . because i really don ' t give a fuck . i ' m here for fun , laughs , and good . why anyone would want to analyze a silly joke to the point that you have is beyond me , but please feel free . i ' m sure it will enrich your life and give you a extra pip in your step . carry on .

6. i say go for it ! change is good , and for your situation and everything you described moving is definitely going to be good for you . you don  t want to keep thinking about doing it for years and regret not going sooner .
