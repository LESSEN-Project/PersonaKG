1. she ' s only snored while i was conscious at least every few months before , last few weeks have been rough . i just sleep on the couch if it becomes a big issue . that sounds rough i guess , but i actually sleep at least as well if not better on the couch than in bed . i made sure to talk to her about it and make sure she knew there were no hard feelings and it was just a practical matter . i never start out there , and make a point to spend time talking to her and the bump before she goes to sleep every night , we just agreed i can bail if i need to .

5. every break has to be done where both parties can see each others faces , next time youre on skype or something where you see his face , show him he ment something to you and just rip the bandaid . never ever text im breaking up with you . that will destroy a person . also make sure hes fully aware of whats going on , and explain why youre breaking up with him

9. again , that doesn ' t mean that the choice should be taken away from young boys . just a question  what about their right to vote ? why should we take away a young boy ' sperson right to vote ? or how about their right to make life altering choices ? part of being a parent means , unfortunately depending on how you look at it , making decisions for your kids .

10. well if you knew exactly which neurons were responsible you could trace the signal to the exact nerves where the " signals for consiousness originate . that then narrows down the work significantly , then all you have to do is make sure the nerves pass the 40mv point  and i feel like we have many ways we could do that . i mean it just inhibiting electricity right ?

14. start by asking about what healthy ways she has been dealing with stress . that will help her start thinking about that . talk about how she feels and if she notices any correlations with her choices that day . the food thing is also something i get . when i ate the wrong thing for me and my body , even if it was healthy , i  d get this pit in my stomach that i confused for hunger so i ' d eat more . it took a long time to realize that and how to not feel that way when i ate . just make sure you realize that this may go deeper than what she is putting in her mouth and why . it could be a medical and  or psychological reason to the weight gain and eating habits . she may not be ready to see and explore that yet , but as a partner , you can guide her if you choose to .

18. every day , i find someone that has money , and make them give it to me . stand in line behind someone at the atm and make them give me the money they just took out . hang around at a casino and wait for someone to win big then make them give me their chips . stuff like that . and make sure that it ' s somewhere that has video cameras . i can make them say something like " here man , you take this " " seriously " " yeah , just pay it forward . and then if they try to take it back , i have video evidence that i didn ' t steal it .

20. just a quick question  why not make the " vik " something closer to a kashtan ? it would certainly make the dreadnaughts much scarier since this is hfy . you would need to reduce the number probably but it would look much better in my head .
