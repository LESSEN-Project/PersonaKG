1. im a male and ladies if i am wrong please let me know . their dog will be there when you cheat , lie , and steal . their dog will love them on their darkest and brightest days . their dog will be by their side no matter what . a large number of the male population cant even accomplish one of those sentences that a dog can do without trying . does this make them  obsessed  ? nope . it merely shows their loyalty to those who are loyal to them .

5. but you ' re expecting the outcome of making fire and trying to achieve it . if you had no concept of what it was or where it came from , why would you believe you could make it , or try to ? you know it can be made by friction and other sources . they apparently only know it comes from lightening . and they can ' t make that , so they have no reason to try rubbing sticks together .
