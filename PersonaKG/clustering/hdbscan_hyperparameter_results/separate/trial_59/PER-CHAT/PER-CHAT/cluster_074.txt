1. glad it  s helpful  i  m fairly  new  as a catholic and not a cradle catholic either so i can empathize . there  s a really good video series from  dynamic catholic   they are currently doing this series during lent and i find it helpful  they  re 3ish minute daily snippets . it  s easier for me to listen to a video on my phone daily than most other things . certainly i don  t say the rosary enough . a couple days ago the video was about the  lie we tell ourselves   it hit me that i lie to myself too , sometimes , and you might as well . it really is more about saying yes to god everyday , even if we muck up and we do , and he knows this ! hope this link works . ? best wishes

2. i believe that hacking is fine if you are say in a 1v1 trolling someone , basically if it  s not being used to pretend that your really good or something along those lines i  m fine with it . unless i  m the one getting cheated lol .

3. it ' s an alien device , it detects when people are wearing a tin foil hat and cancels out the foil ' s atomic charge . safe to say you ' re being observed , perhaps even selected for probing , good luck my friend . or it could just be a low voltage transformer for a doorbell or intercom , who knows ? best not take any chances .

7. there ' s really no difference functionality  wise between the newer generations of smart phones . do we really need more powerful phones if we won ' t even use the to their full potential ? do we really need to go thinner instead of thicker for more battery life ? and storage is really dependent on how much money you throw at it . the only thing i see separating iphones and android phones at this point is the os and a headphone jack .

8. i hate when i hear about girls who say guys suck in bed so they have to fake an orgasm . its so hypocritical . they are literally the reason he  s bad . like if u fake an orgasm , theyre basically telling him  good job . keep doing that . its great

11. this is a pretty good answer . its hard to say when the changes occured . i guess it has a lot to do with intetaction of people in geographic proximity . the alps is a pretty good boundary that would have restricted cultural ideas . ill be thinkin about this for weeks grinning  face

13. you can be on your way of hitting rock bottom and nobody will warn you . people will view you as human filth , but nobody will say anything . in their eyes you are past redemption . ask yourself if your life is on a good course .
