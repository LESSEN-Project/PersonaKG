1. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .

2. because when you ' re in rome you do as the romans do . unless you ' re obviously a tourist or you don ' t speak english at all , i think it ' s really rude to go out of your way to speak in a manner people around you can ' t understand . my wife does this to me in spanish when she wants to talk about someone we see while we ' re out or whatever and it annoys me to no end .

3. i disagree with this article . i think " thank you " and " i ' m sorry " are sometime necessary acknowledgements of the fact that someone else exists   a person who has their own thoughts and feelings and things to do . i don ' t expect my kid to feel some kind of heartfelt gratitude for me getting them a glass of milk but i do expect my actions to be acknowledged with a polite " thank you " . i ' m in favor of politeness as a social norm . by telling a kid that this is a situation requiring a polite action you help instill the fact that other people matter .

4. i think a lot of people who are at that point don ' t think anybody cares to listen to them , and they have thought that for so long , that it is very hard to reach out to anybody

5. " fair game ? why do you think you ' re entitled to other people ' s stuff ? it ' s not yours , don ' t touch it !
   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

6. these people are the definition of selfish . they don ' t think anything about their grandchildren , because they don ' t give a shit about them . they care purely for themselves .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

7. after reading a lot of mmo forums and seeing a lot of crazy things yes , i do believe he was serious . if you think people don ' t have that viewpoint , you should put aside your own bias .
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

8. what the fuck ? i wonder if these kinds of people ever take a step back to question their insanity and then go ahead and do the crazy shit anyway . or if they do question themselves , what sort of stuff do they think is too crazy and don ' t follow through .
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

9. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

10. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?
