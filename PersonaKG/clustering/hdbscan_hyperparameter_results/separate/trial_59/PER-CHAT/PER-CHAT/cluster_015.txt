6. okay , then in answer to your question i would say that if you actually want to have sex then you might develop some kind of negative hang up about penis size but there are tonnes of ways to pleasure someone besides that so it shouldn ' t really have a negative affect .

7. but we shouldn  t say that being obese is okay as a society , but if you want to stay fat thats your choice but you shouldn  t spread fake ideals
