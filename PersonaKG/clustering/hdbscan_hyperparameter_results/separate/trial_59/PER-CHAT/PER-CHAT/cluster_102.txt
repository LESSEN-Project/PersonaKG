1. " don ' t be afraid to be truly bored or alone with your thoughts . " i can ' t remember the situation , but the general idea was to not be afraid of having nothing to do . your mind can create some interesting ideas , given the opportunity . boredom can be a gateway to discovering yourself or a new creative outlet you can use to express yourself . the counter to that tends to be that your mind can also create some rather worrying ideas too , but i don ' t think that was really the goal of the idea .

2. i haven ' t because i don ' t really see any redeeming qualities that i can focus on that can help me me think i deserve more than i have , or to be happy .

4. similar ! i don  t care if my friends go without me but i do care when they insult me . i don  t really care who else insults me whether it be a stranger or family , but if my friends insult me i will think about it for at least two decades and become extremely insecure as a result of it .

5. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

6. i don ' t really think about that stuff since it doesn ' t serve the story in any way . i chose earthborn , so i ' m assuming my shepard was low  life trash until he enlisted without anything special to him . i have no imagination for stories lol .
