1. yeah , the first week of season digit the planes were just fine to everyone , i didn ' t see a single post about how op it is until the freaking sword was realest . now the sword is gone people want to attack the planes now ? excuse me , what the fuck . i just think people doesn ' t want anything added in season digit if this is the case . whats the point of playing fortnite if you can ' t have fun and keep bitching on how everything added is ' op ' . in conclusion , plz stop this , bring back the sword , and subscribe to pewdiepie .

2. as nice as you are holding them in case people want them , i would suggest just dropping them . that  s a whole digit pounds

3. i think people should play for the enjoyment and not just to win another uhc  like if you want to play dirty there ' s a cutclean game in digit minutes .  it should be for the audience .

4. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .

5. probably one of my favorite game . the combat and movement are fluid , and the maps are very well designed . if you want to play stealthily , the maps offer many different ways to achieve your goal . if you want to don ' t want to play stealthily , you get a large array of weapons and powers . just watch stealthgamerbr on youtube to see what i ' m talking about . great replayability , and the dlc that comes with this bundle is excellent as well  they ' re not just short missions , but lengthy sets of missions which introduce you to new characters and powers . the only drawbacks i can think of are that some people may not like the artstyle , and that people complain about some powers being op . also , if you ' re a completionist , finding all gold in every stage is a pain . for  digit , it ' s a must buy imo

6. not gonna lie , it doesn ' t seem like you came to have your view changed like the sub suggests . so many people have given you extremely solid reasons why college is beneficial or complimentary at the very least and you don ' t seem to be budging . it is coming across that you don ' t want your mind changed , but rather want to argue with people why you ' ll do just fine without college . i myself was even digit  digit on if college was needed , and i would ' ve given deltas to so many of these comments for reasons i didn ' t even think about . maybe just go to an it forum and discuss this ? not trying to be rude , but the point of this sub is to discuss something you ' re actually open to . it doesn ' t seem like you ' re open to changing your opinion here . if you are , what would it take to change your view ?
