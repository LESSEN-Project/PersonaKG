1. was that my argument ? dr doom will do anything to gain power , his desperation makes him a constant threat to the marvel universe as a whole . whereas dr strange , as stated by eternity , is " more powerful by far than any of your fellow humanoids " i am saying i would rather see a clash of this magnitude than any publication where doom fights the ff .

2. compare his lifestyle to the previous one . the current pope is much more modest with his attire and seems to me like a genuinely good guy . it ' s a nice message and you are just hating so you can hate on religion . why do you care ?

4. that ' s horrible ! law should protect people no matter what , not allowing to hurt them legally . i ' m from poland . my physics teacher is roasting and disrespecting whole lgbt  and other minorities all the time . he ' d better teach us physics but noooo . he ' s been teaching in this school for years and it seems nobody ever complained about him to the headteachers , or they did but it had no effect . i guess there are multiple teachers like him here . even wort ones

8. this sounds a lot like my story . i appreciate all the people trying to make you feel better , and they might be right . but here ' s my two cents . yeah , you might be a narcissist . you might just have narcissistic behaviors . you might not have any . in my experience and research , i found there are a lot of misconceptions about the concept of narcissism . i began my research after thinking an ex was a narcissist . low and behold i eventually saw clearly that these behaviors were in my own actions . i highly recommend emdr therapy . changed my life . i definitely think that zealous religious cultures like mormonism breed narcissistic traits and tendencies because people have stunted emotional growth  emotional intelligence . it also cultivates codependency . people miss out on a lot of experiences that are key to growing into a health functioning adult . hang in there . no matter the situation , you have the desire to be self aware which means you will keep growing and getting happier . bravo and hang in there !

10. everything might just be a creation of man . man put god into a book , man creates more men to be slaves to work for him . and the whole world is ruled by men who control these slaves that believe in a god that was created by another man ? does it make sense ? i  ve had a beer or so , and it  s about a beer before bed , so that  s what time it is

17. i really don ' t care about life expectancy . as a human , we have an " agenda " that is socially accepted which is  go to school , get a job , get married , have kids . that agenda doesn ' t apply to dogs . you literally have no obligations and i bet if you lived longer than digit  digit years imo you would get pretty bored and find no meaning in life .   x200b  anyways sorry for being so deep all of a sudden , my opinion . you might wanna live longer idk you do you

18. thanks but no thx money wise i  m just gonna leech off this family for college  medical . shitty as it may sounds and i  m digit  gonna get both , unless they want to have everything they worked for destroyed . legally of course if my digit year old brother gets digit  digit grand money monthly and digit  digit grand cars i  m sure they can afford digit  digit grand dental and college even tho my dad got on to me for braces under his breath lmao i don  t want therapy or counseling either . it just annoys me to no end . the way i process things is just whatever happens tough luck . now accept it and just make better of it . irony aye of being a counselor and depressed . can say i use to help a lot of people and worry about them and not one of them ever did a digit but just dug a bigger hole . the causes of my depression is a variety of things not just this family but this community i live in too . it  s being forced into hinduism  christianity and then american  indian cultures is what caused it . can say now tho i told everyone to fuck off and i  m my own boss digit . i been the outcast in everything and deal with verbal abuse and racism and now i just laugh . what  s sad is there are many people who are short temper and only thing they know is violence majority of humanity . i actually wonder if any other digit year old knows that just bc your in the usa you have a opportunity compared to if you were born in india or any third world poor county you have nothing . you can  t even come to the usa unless you want to come illegally . its sad how just bc your born in a one geographic location it can dictate a lot of things about your life . no amount of it gets better will help either . american indian and seen both welp let  s quit talking negative and depressing . hope you get and better best of luck . all i can say is get a goal  chase it and then just remove toxicity .

19. sounds like it is doing you good . both of you . despite how  shallow  some people will think it is , health and weight are an issue in a relationship . no one wants to see someone slowly kill themselves , its absolutely defeating , especially when they refuse to listen at the cost of losing their loved one . so i personally at least think the choice was good and it shows that its going well for you both . i hope you can get back together .

20. hey kyzabro , i can relate , i suffer from insomnia , first i was given vallium , then melatonin and then put on antidepressants to make me groggy and get sleep . i posted this on day three and got some really solid advice from ckreon , have a read of the comments , the hard part is actually doing it , but the first night i did it , slept like a baby , my sleep has been slowly improving ever since i get a solid 5ish hours unbroken sleep now and fall asleep pretty quick . when everyone says do some physical exercise i put it in the bullshit advice pile , but i swear to you , it really works . best of luck mate !
