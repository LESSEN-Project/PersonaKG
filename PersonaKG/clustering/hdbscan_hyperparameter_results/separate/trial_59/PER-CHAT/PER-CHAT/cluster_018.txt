5. compromise . you need to find a way for both of you to get a little of what you want . often time teenagers are completely oblivious to what they really need as support and same goes for parents not knowing where an appropriate line should be drawn usually out of fear or anxiety for their child  s well being you may see improvement if you take on more responsibility around the home or in the community  but that  s only a vague suggestion because i have no idea about your specific circumstances .

9. my mom once went to a popeye ' s where the service was really slow and there was bulletproof glass separating the cashier from the customers . the service was so slow that a guy who was waiting in line was able to watch a few episodes of daredevil in the amount of time it took him to get his food . my brother wanted to leave , but my mom had already paid for our chicken and she didn ' t want to trust the dumb kid behind the counter with her credit card again . the moral of the story is that you shouldn ' t go to popeye ' s restaurants in the ghetto .
