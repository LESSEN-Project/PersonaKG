1. no i don ' t watch it . the titans make me nauseous for some reason .
   (ID: 54d8d3056c8f47c31e118e652b57922cf96c4876)

2. descent of angels only deals with dark angels backstory , so it  s skippable . half of fallen angels does deal with war efforts during the heresy beginning , though nothing major . to be honest i quite enjoyed both books , especially fallen angels , and don  t understand all the negativity towards them . they are no masterpieces , for sure , but highly fun .

3. are you sure ? i don ' t remember that being a thing .

4. " don ' t bother learning to make plurals properly . write ' parent ' s ' when you mean ' parents . ' no one will judge you "

5. fine in moderation , but anything that encourages escapism may hinder motivation to find some real life action . i heard kids don ' t care about getting their drivers license right away anymore and teen pregnancy is way down . i ' m sure glad i missed that sad ship by a decade .

6. do the best you can do and don ' t worry about theirs . don ' t argue as that leads easily to a insubordination write up . if necessary make notes why you didn ' t work on or complete the job and keep a cya journal of the situations . if you need to speak to the gm , then request a " open door " meeting .

7. so many talk about climate change because it ' s cool and do a couple of meaningless actions that make them feel better about themselves . if you truly care then don ' t have kids , that has a real positive impact on climate .

8. then why didn ' t he make it a commandment ? i don ' t even believe in him so why should i care what he thinks ?
