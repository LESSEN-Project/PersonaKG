3. it  s funny to me that there  s this obvious disparity in quality of plastic surgeons . we think of doctors as infallible gods of science and trust them with our lives . but then you see some of these obvious tit jobs and you have to stop and think , do they deserve our unquestioning trust ?

6. well is it only when you think about kissing her that you think about being a guy ?
   (ID: 55510b17a4f0d7b5820e6f21287525ef6cd60994)

7. yes , travel would be impossible unless you were rich . why do you think no one would maintain them ?
   (ID: fbed02b3d7caf00e8d1533f452f8951cf390df73)

8. but you  re insane to think that hitting your hand with a hammer the first , tenth , or even a hundred times will not hurt . it  s mental illness making you think there has to be a secret number of how many times you can hit your hand until it doesn  t hurt anymore

9. disagree  i think if there is profit to be made then digging in old landfills , dredging the ocean or mining asteroids in space  these elements will be recycled and re  purposed .

10. what kind of drugs do you need to be on to think of this stuff ?
   (ID: c23be0b501278176a288ed6b3ab6669ac6b9896a)

   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

   (ID: 6b2e7201275c9aa1dcb6d1b24840765a41796c3d)

13. my kids . made me think how devastated they would be without me .
   (ID: aaee7c28c6f1f83a427cf3dccf635bb78656a19d)

14. i would think it  s the least of his worries . why invite more public commentary ?
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

15. ah . still , if you are stabbed and then seek the person out to hurt them , i think you are probably technically violating the rule . only if you are punching them to keep from being stabbed are you in the exception .
   (ID: df28c2a39b633ca418192316a199668289382292)

16. hmm now that i think about that i would be kinda hard to find him . but there ' s no harm in trying
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

17. thats a different photo i think but i remember it in this subreddit
   (ID: 701f8001d10c04dcd53d9b13ab2a896b452e50f7)

18. i think the fact that this happened proves for a fact that " we " are not better than this . this subreddit isn ' t even about lol anymore , it ' s about pros and funny lol pictures . it ' s pathetic .
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

19. i think you need to type it in but here you go
   (ID: 12a4255ed85f0655e8fd899838bf98179465eded)

20. exactly . for me , it ' s because i ' m either trying to think of things to talk about or because i can ' t think of anything to talk about . then i get super nervous .
