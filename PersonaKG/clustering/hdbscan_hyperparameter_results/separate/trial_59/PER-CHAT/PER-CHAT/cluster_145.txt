1. some dogs don  t like people with hats on . might just be something they aren  t used to . or a bad experience .
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

2. this is not entirely true . it is in my case . but for the majority of people , they decide to screw around for fun and suddenly become addicted . i don ' t even have an addictive personality , i just like how drugs feel .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

3. i have the mentality of " well i don ' t like myself so why would other people like me . this just makes me push people away . the few people that i feel comfortable talking to always remain aquaintances .

5. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .

6. why are you asking this ? like other people said there ' s nothing wrong with it , they don ' t hurt anyone for me as long as they don ' t convince others to be gay i ' m ok with it , they ' re humans just like you and me

7. i have to ask you why you don ' t look this up yourself ? you have to be on the internet to type and submit your comment so why not just do a quick google search ? one of the biggest problems in this country is that a lot of people do not research anything themselves . they simply wait for someone to present information to them . when they don ' t like the information they hear , even if it is true , they dismiss it and when they hear information they do like they accept it even if it is false . it ' s absolutely ridiculous how easily manipulated people can be .
