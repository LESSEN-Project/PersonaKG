1. yeah i was reading his post and was unable to even answer what the third perk on a shotgun was . he first said it was two shot and then anti armour and then digit  strength which i don  t think is even possible . he should be reported to mods but in my experience they dont do shit anyway

2. cool to see you dig the free hit i play digit  digit surv  killer but i had a game as survivor a few weeks ago where we had wraith on haddonfield and we completely destroyed , i don  t think anybody got hit never mind hooked . i had brought a purple toolbox and we had triple streamers one being the wraith  s anyways after the gates opened my friends all left and one of them mentioned the killer only had like 2k points . i felt awful that he gave us a streamer and wasn  t getting nearly anything so i stopped at the gate to take a hit for him  you guessed it , noed digit , hooks me , beats on my corpse , spam messages chat after saying  tbagger piece of shit fuck you kys  and then tries to add me when we leave lobby to bm some more unfortunately i don  t give out hits at the gate anymore

3. i don ' t think most are brainwashed , i think most are scared to speak up against their government . edit  if the government would have treated then right , and let them have a lot material things and would have taken good care of them , then it would have been difficult to to deal with them . from what i understand , news reports coming from that area , is that theya re living in poverty . not too long ago there was a video going around of reddit of a digit year old girl who was starving to death .

5. this card is basically a zero mana discover a spell . u can either play the discovered card or another spell but either way you are still paying full price it ' s not that similar to glyph because the discount doesn ' t last . it ' s not a true discount like prep because the card itself costs digit mana . personally i don ' t think it will see any play outside of hagatha .

6. digit the lady at the pizzeria said she would serve any customers who came into the shop but that she would not provide pizzas to a gay wedding . digit i seriously doubt the law would have covered her in this instance . no doubt she would have tried to use the law to cover her but i don ' t think it would have been upheld by any court . digit if she is really against gay weddings personally do you really think its right that she be forced to service a gay wedding or loose her business ? if you think its ok to force someone to do something they are morally against then i think there is something wrong with you personally . if you think its not ok for a person to make a living if they dont have the exact same values as you do , then again , i think that there is something wrong with you .

7. real talk , self control and no small amount of will power . also when i decided to stop i went out and bought digit or digit of those little cheap nail clippers they sell in the checkout aisle and put them in drawers and on shelves etc . around my house and one in my car so i wouldn ' t have an excuse to bite . i don ' t let my nails get too long so i ' m not tempted . think of the upsides too , i don ' t have to be self conscious about my fingers now when i hand over money to pay for things or go to shake hands with someone . it ' s super unsanitary to bite and chew your nails no matter how much you wash your hands , i play guitar and when i would chew really bad it would hurt sometimes to play , not anymore . think of all the plus sides to quitting , you can do this !

8. i don ' t recall hearing the word sportbike when i had a norton in the digit ' s . i think it may not have been invented yet . none the less , norton was the sportbike of its day . there were plenty faster bikes but no one could keep up with me on the mountain roads .

9. i ' m not a mean person in fact i ' m rather empathetic . that said i ' m at an age digit and a point in my life where i don ' t care what others think of my diet . if someone decides to judge me for being vegan i pretty much tell them where they can stick it .
