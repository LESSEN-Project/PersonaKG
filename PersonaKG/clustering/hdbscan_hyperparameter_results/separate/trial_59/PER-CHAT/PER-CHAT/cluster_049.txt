9. " hot tits " is a winner in most girls books . men don ' t understand that women want to be sexually spoken to and touched like a whore , but respected like their mother all in one . most of what we complain about would fall into one of these categories . guaranteed . in some way it will be either a you dont find me attractive or b you don ' t respect me enough summary  fuck like whore , respect like mother . p . s . clean dick is a must .

11. yeah , that ' s pretty terrible . you ' re better off elsewhere . like , i don ' t even want your stuff . it ' s tainted with badness . before the downvote nazis arrive , i ' m joking .

   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

13. oh you used a big word ! was that hard ? is that why it took so long to type out ? you all wonder why woman don ' t even want to look in your direction , bold of you to call me stupid when you can ' t even understand how self destructive your life is . hating woman and then wondering why they don ' t like you back , crying about it to other basement dwellers like yourself . woman don ' t owe you shit and they never will .

14. definitely say something . call her , though . tone can be kind of difficult to determine through text and you don ' t need want to give her any more reasons to push you away even more . " hey , insert sister name . how you doing , casual chatting , blah blah blah . i need to talk to you about something . i feel insert everything you just told us . i know it ' s your wedding and you can do whatever you want , but i ' m starting to think that you don ' t even want me there . if not , that ' s fine bc you ' re kind of being a bitch and i could do without all the cross country trips . if you genuinely want me to be a part of the wedding , then act like it and maybe ease up a little bit " . feel free to modify to your liking .
