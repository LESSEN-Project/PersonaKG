2. absolutely ! it ' s such a good show . watching the characters come to their own conclusions whether they be true or false is really interesting . if you like broadchurch , i recommend fortitude .

   (ID: 943cc5e526975c71d69ca1804666ab2f83b06a27)

7. thank you gunther  w for chiming in . i like the design concept of the coils but i kinda figured they might be " too good to be true " i ' m not sorry i tried them , but i really like the starre with their stock coils more .
   (ID: 6778aa4e3cf401044823c475db231fc0b1d0ff4b)

8. yeah if the case cover is off i would suspect bad contact of the cooler to the cpu . with a good aftermarket cooler you shouldn  t be seeing temps like that .

10. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .

11. i like everything but rap . the feeling depends on the song and what it reminds me of buy it ' s usually good
   (ID: 9e778023eda5589ac577e3789edfd900d208edf7)

12. i can somewhat understand this with subs like wpd , or cringeanarchy , but waterniggas ? seriously , what the fuck ? that sub is actually pretty wholesome . memes about staying hydrated can turn into good tips on living a healthy lifestyle .
   (ID: 419b67e0e2cdcb7bd8ea9a89d34d0747a1f5f620)

13. yeah you ' re good . if it ' s hitting high 80s use some software like afterburner to set a limit on it . you should be fine though .
   (ID: 1885b01dd0970230fea2a9c9ae9c4eaeaceb59a3)

14. are continents large enough scale for you , retard ? if not , good news  you could be only a day and airfare away from living like a king in africa .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

15. imminent domain ? where the government can take your land if they feel it is for the good of the community ? example like a park or roadway .
   (ID: 2988ee1cd7a2bcf8e2d215c795ee2d06a985665a)

16. good question . seems to me like they might be able to answer quite a few of the questions around this case by discreetly placing a camera to catch whoever is desecrating the grave .
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)
