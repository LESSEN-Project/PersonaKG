1. hmm , well i can be pretty bitter about it too . although i still occasionally get propositioned for sex so i guess i could be uglier . too bad i ' m kind of involuntarily asexual meds and other issues or else i ' d sleep around more . at least someone wants to touch me lol . i ' ve done the weight loss thing and that didn ' t really help not like those before and after pictures where the after is a totally cute guy . it doesn ' t help help that i ' m a socially anxious and naturally introverted reserved person been that way since before the tumblr era so it ' s hard for my inner personality to come out so that ' s another strike . i guess just hold on to see if someone can look past looks and try not to be a forever aloner . pretty hokey advice that i try to give myself .

2. um , sometimes they wake me up . there are times when i ' ll just go through the whole thing , even when it ' s bad . today , i woke up with a heaviness in my chest and shortness of breath from a nightmare that lasted days in dream . sometimes in my dream , i decide to fly . it ' s never super easy to do . i have to really try hard . a lot of times i will just jump really hard to start flying but it takes me a few minutes . i love flying in my dreams even if it takes a while to do . i also like to call my husband , almost like a companion . sometimes he ' s already there . i ' ve never been able to have a companion in a dream till recently and only my husband . now , we get to do a lot of fun and cool stuff . he looks like he does everyday , which is mostly flip  flops , not matter what the dream environment is like . it ' s really fun to watch him hunt off crazed post apocalyptic creatures while he ' s running around in flip flops .

3. being a male i ' ve never had a period so i honestly feel it would be pretty disrespectful to voice that sort of opinion towards any female as i haven ' t experienced it myself . it ' s like someone painting a wall and somebody else comes up and says your taking a long time . how do they know what it ' s like or the problems that can arise if they haven ' t got any experience of what i ' m doing ? i choose just to be supportive .

4. i dropped from marshes to badlands to reduce the incubator pool for more raptor dna and more dna in general . i throw multiple matches if i feel like my i . rex is being a little turd , but most of the time i don ' t even have her in my team . i ' ve been using galli and ornitho for fun and lord are they just the most fun things i ' ve ever used .

6. yeah , the potato faces bug me , as far as i can ' t tell races apart very easily in oblivion . but honestly , my biggest complaint is the voice acting , it takes me right out of character anytime i hear a voice . i will get through oblivion , i love the story , and the quests i ' ve done so far are fun , but like i said there are aspects that just drive me nuts . not that skyrim is perfect , it ' s just much much better in my mind . but because i ' ve seen a lot of morrowind is text based i feel i still might enjoy it . and i know most fans see it as the pinnacle of the series . it really makes me wish i started playing es with morrowind , not skyrim so it won ' t feel like a completely different game .

7. i ' m happy to hear you haven ' t had to do that in some time . it ' s pretty shit to feel like you ' ve got to go so far out of your way just to not be made uncomfortable .
