1. i  ve just got this horrible feeling that we  ll end up back tracking on the due to international pressure . international law stipulates that we cannot leave someone stateless but what for the islamic state , the one that she left for ?

3. i ' ve heard it helps to start cleaning up something small , and then grow from that . even if it ' s just putting a fork into a drawer , it ' s important to start somewhere .

5. hey guys , great place you ' ve got here . something struck me , and i decided i need to go ahead and grow out what i can and see where it goes . most times i ' ve had some degree of facial hair , but anything of beard caliber seemed a far off dream . then i figured , " why not " any tips ? also , and this may be an odd question . based on what you guys see here , could you link me to a picture of a beard that looks similar to how you ' d anticipate mine coming in ? just figuring since you ' ve guys seen many beards start off here , you can kind of read where it may go to a degree . edit  my plan is to let it grow at least one month , sept . 1st .

7. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .

8. i ' ve never tried to bust it as quick as i can tbh . there are times where i ' ve lost concentration and bust it earlier than i wanted , but as no orgasm was had i can just wipe off and keep going .

10. we ' ve been focusing on talking about prepping with friends , family and loved ones , especially because we ' re all going to be together in the run up to the festive season ! plus my partner wrote this awesome post on the sensible about how she used to grow food in just her dorm room . we ' ve now thankfully got a bit more space for our homestead than that .
