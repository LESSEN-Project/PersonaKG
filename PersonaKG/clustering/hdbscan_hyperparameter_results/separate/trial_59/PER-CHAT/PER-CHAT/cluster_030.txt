1. they always signed us up for whatever activities we wanted to do hockey , baseball , figure skating , dance , etc . and made sure they brought us to every single lesson or game . not only did these activities teach me so much about goal setting and working with other people , it showed me how to support the people you love .

2. i am regretting posting this . why did i have such a stupid lapse in judgement that i believed for one second that people on the internet were not going to be seedy about me doing the most natural thing and feeding my child ?

3. that was quite shitty of her . lots of people use others as kink dispensers and then get mad when they ' re not comfortable with what ' s going on . you did the right thing in stopping .

7. that ' s honestly worse to me . none of the dozen people in the household noticed the kid was gone , or if they did none of them said anything . usually in big families the older kids are at least partially talked with watching the younger ones . several people dropped the ball .
