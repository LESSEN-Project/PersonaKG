5. the action scenes were painfully average but it had something to say about race relations in our world today and it does it with a little , not a lot of nuance . while it wasn ' t the best picture of the year i myself am completely fine with its nominations especially considering the two biggest winners of the night were green book and bohemian rhapsody . it ' s totally ok if you didn ' t like it just acknowledge that it was trying to do more than your average blockbuster .

6. it ' s funny that you say that , i just compared our snoopsnoop profiles . seems like you need to take a break .

7. well you know what they say , there ' s someone out there for everyone . i love to smoke with them because we play games , watch movies , just have fun . and now they just all ignore me like they never gave a fuck and i ' m freaking out . i just feel like there ' s no one there anymore .

8. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol

9. i would like to say loyalty but in all honesty it ' s probably just as simple as my capacity to relate to them overall . maybe you could call that open mindedness .

10. i can answer this despite being an english speaker . it ' s because you haven ' t been taught that cuss words in other languages are just as bad . we never snuck around our parents to say " mierda " , unless of course you ' re spanish , so yeah . it ' s just that it wasn ' t drilled into your head like it is with your own version of the word . like americans using bollocks
