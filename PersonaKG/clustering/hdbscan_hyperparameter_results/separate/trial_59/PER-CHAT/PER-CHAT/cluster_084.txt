4. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .

   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

7. so he is name  calling and spreading gossip ? that tells you a lot about the person he is . it doesn ' t say anything about you . just be honest about what happened .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

8. i ' d say start with the oldest generation going towards the latest . but thats just me .
   (ID: fd112b0116b574aa5911af63529dca9683e5f6eb)

9. i ' d have to say ori and the blind forest . it ' s such a beautiful game with such a beautiful soundtrack . the story is told with few words and more visual story telling . that game never fails to make me shed a few tears , even on the 5th playthrough . it ' s not playing a platformer , its living the trials of ori and it just submerges you so well that i ' d have to say it ' s my all time favorite game .
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

10. well guys do tell me i ' m hot , but they say that about so many guys that i think it ' s just something they habitually say and it really doesn ' t mean much . it ' s also such a 1980s saying that i ' m surprised anyone still uses it lol ! i suspect they ' re just settling since they couldn ' t get any of the hot guys .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

11. well i hope she has the same energy for herself and her actions because from what you say , you didn ' t really do anything bad . she just says so .
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

12. that ' s why when a couple of my friends do that all i say nowadays is " punching above your weight " and it gets a chuckle from those of us who see things in the way you just described .
   (ID: bf662bc559367d8b6475102fe891d5e4eb072ffd)

13. idk just the bussiest road in the world and it would say subscribe to pewdiepie

14. but that ' s not actually what ' s happening , you are writing hypothetical fiction at this point . suppose in your hatred of trump supporters you become a murdering psuedo  vigilante who kills trump supporters . you should be banned from reddit you murderer ! you should be in prison ! see , anyone can do it . and my point with that example is that you are really going to say that a good father and successful mechanical engineer is " piece of garbage " just because of who he voted for ? give me a break . to be fair , though , washington dc is just a corrupt city in general , it ' s not just trump , although he is probably among the worse . nonetheless , the whole city is owned by corporate donors , e . g . the koch brothers . at least it ' s not as corrupt as it used to be in the gilded age , boss tweed era .

15. but i can say ' je ne sais quoi ' without feeling that way . damn loan words . edit  i just realized i only use that phrase satirically . i guess we should just leave other languages alone .
   (ID: a4eb94a9fe8ebabb780c319cc7d3f552eb79625e)

16. i  m getting one that isn  t a full controller but offers triggers so i can switch my shoot  aim button on pubg to be where they press . i  d say your best shot is to just search game controller for phone and see what would fit you best
   (ID: cd907372aff0871825a64e977822586e3bb0ecb7)

17. i ' m sure this is true , even though i think a lot . my gf will sometimes ask what i ' m thinking about and i honestly say " nothing " or " just abstract shit without any meaning " but she always has words to describe her thoughts .
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

18. then replace the coil unit and spark plug wire . before you do , insure yourself with some flywheel marks so your timing doesn ' t become skewed , though that should not be a problem . i have just learned to never say never .
   (ID: 457d7d37e1181cc932693cd4220e6fbfd564a75d)

19. i was just about to say this .
   (ID: 7bbefe3c73b49467552610b8dad9354ce8c09cde)

20. i was being facetious about the " afternoon snack " thing but i ' m gonna just say that all bets are off if a momma thinks their baby is in danger and leave it at that .
