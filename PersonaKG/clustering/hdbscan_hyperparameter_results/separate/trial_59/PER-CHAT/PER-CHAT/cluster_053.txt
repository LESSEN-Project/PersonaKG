1. thank them , especially with an avengers movie . they drop a hint about something that ruins the movie for me , i won ' t want to see it , and i typically don ' t sit down to watch a two hour movie without first finding out what half the plot is .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

2. poor you . maybe people don  t want to hear someone swear on this nice subreddit
   (ID: 726c36ce13fa631676ed5053f62b0f5f7b61eb5e)

3. i figure if you don ' t leave me a message . then you don ' t actually want to speak w me .
   (ID: 97c35f21c6a14bb50b6faae9a7b18cd5968c350c)

4. if this as a issue for you , then tell your gm that you don ' t want to work at that store and explain your experiences if necessary .
   (ID: a61db1f2f0a3d15376fd168a1637c028f25100e1)

5. probably current patch apart from very minor changes . they rightfully so don ' t want to change the meta a lot right before such a big tourny .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

6. i don ' t believe in a god that would allow a world like this . you can do what you want but i doubt itll change anything . if there is a god it ' s obvious he couldnt give two shits about me or millions of other people for that matter .
   (ID: f46d1bfdfed7fc05bbe39789c092019944471e9d)

7. our city is trying to figure out what to do about this right now . they don  t want people to drive drunk and don  t want to punish them for making the right choice , but they often need the street in the morning for a market .
   (ID: e1d1404c2d4f1c884debe976d40ee13df3959fcf)

8. if she would be mad at you for doing the same thing , even if you don ' t want to , it is a little sketchy then .
   (ID: 73c241755308e15ea272f3060f9c0a430c541f1a)

9. i was very careful with power washing my fence . i didn ' t want it to splinter . then i thought about it . who cares if there are a few splinters . wash it and stain it . don ' t walk on it with bare feet . oh wait it ' s a fence .
   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

10. i always assume they are not chasing but getting caught in the air currents of people running away . when you move fast there is a tiny area of low pressure behind you and they sort of get caught up in that . walk away slowly and they don ' t appear to follow unless you ' re eating something they want
   (ID: cda2027ff011b74a04f79a766c8e8da339eb1f0b)

11. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

12. i don ' t normally do this but i imagine it ' s because my stop is nearing and i don ' t want to move in , only to have to move out again shortly . it may also be for the legroom .
   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

13. if you want it , sure , i don ' t see why not .
   (ID: 080eedcfaabe8f67b2c0a8da33a3a401906822f2)

14. to the men of reddit  we really don ' t want to see your penis , which is why we hide it in orifices thanks
   (ID: a2291731ea6532473dc0e3f9275ce68c86abfad6)

15. its hilarous that this guy got downvoted for pointing out the truth . but , when you ' re drinking the bungie kool  aid . i guess you don ' t want to hear that .
   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

16. while i like the grand notion of basically forcing certain breeders to become virtually extinct , this may fare better for the other side . many people don ' t want kids and still can ' t get sterilised because they don ' t have kids . kind of a paradox . a really dumb one . some who end up with kids end up resenting them . i believe if those who truly want this treatment can get it , a large portion of bad parents would be eliminated before the deed is done .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

17. i absolutely hate hate hate adopting . its a bunch of bullshit . i also dont believe in fixing animals so i don ' t want mine to come fixed .
   (ID: 91dc65ba6eef536f17becface16989de7f988dce)

18. guy here . because its always followed with a " why " and that leads to more conversation they don ' t want to have with you .
   (ID: b5f9b695867ef3b560a4fe7610f75e43b62809f6)

19. this is a combination of many different insults . i prepared it in case of emergency years ago . " this is usually where i ' d tell you to suck my dick , but i don ' t want the disease ridden void that you call a mouth anywhere near me . so could you do me a favor and go fuck yourself "
   (ID: d54a04c3eba52404f5dd7abb0e459a949dbc7f93)

20. because it has nothing to do with me , and i don ' t want to be the reason it was destroyed .
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)
