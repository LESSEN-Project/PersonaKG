5. haha , this too . because weapon durability . her dragonstone had digit uses and i ' m pretty sure you couldn ' t repair it . once it broke , she couldn ' t transform anymore and she would effectively lose a lot of stats .

6. does anyone else love the fact that all attachments were removed from all weapons ? cuz i sure do ! its fun to spend digit minutes navigating ubisoft ' s shitty menus before playing the game again . i love the way ubisoft thinks .
