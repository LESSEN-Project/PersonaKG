1. i see . i feel people want others to exercise to conform to their standards using health and physique as a dumb excuse rather then caring about someone being happy . ofcourse it is different when someone is obese but you get the message . also , many sports are boring and gyms are full of toxic shits anyway .

2. when people ask me to do this , i explain the coupons are based on what you purchase , so there is no store card . they can sign up for their own if they want . end of story .

4. you ' re responsible for your actions and if you want something , then you ' ll have to work for it . sadly many people today seem to always want things handed to them , but get upset when they realize it ' s not free .

5. i love how this assumes there ' s a significantly large amount of people who want to dress up as prince . what happens if i want to go as michael jackson ? how does that work ?

6. makes me wonder why those people never injure themselves on purpose . it ' s a doctor ' s job to fix them . why would they want to take that opportunity from them ?

8. some people are raised in a fashion that they never developed the want to have kids . instead they see it as any other decision in life and look upon its downsides . usually they end up turning away from it

11. dude , if you have an attractive so , let her show that shit off . you should take it as a compliment when other people want to fuck your girlfriend . if you really can ' t handle her style , then maybe she ' s not for you .

12. no shit . blacks are basically a protected species it seems . they do fuck all as a people besides crime , of course , yet you can  t even stare wrongly at them unless you want some problems .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

13. i want all the sex with all the people and im cool with however they want ti do it . i use to get a lot of it , its one of the worst parts about leaving the world and starting my own society of one where nobody judges you or takes all your stuff and makes you homeless .
   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

14. because being with someone shows that you ' re desirable . people see that somebody else wants you , so they want you .
