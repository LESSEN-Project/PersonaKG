1. tbh i ' m fine . kind of got used to shrugging that shit off . it ' s just that all of the trauma growing up until last september just got me a little handicapped in life y ' know ? i ' d want to build a better life for my future kid and hope that he  she will never have to experience what i went thru . most probably having a real family of my own will actually fill that " void " .

3. if you do raise a child i recommend coming out to them to normalize it . of course , everyone has different comfort levels , but it  s just a thought . also , the only people that should know your gender identity are the ones that you want to know . if that list is just your husband , then that  s perfectly fine !

4. when showing friends who are new to csgo or counterstrike in general i always go to community or casual classic servers just to get the " counterstrike " feeling and learn the maps . if you have no idea about what you have to do in the game it ' s no real use to head for competitive . ive met so many people in matchmaking who didnt even know that you have to plant or even defuse the bomb . knowing how to " eco " or what to buy is something you will learn on your own later on . to learn how the game even works would be my first priority . a lot of my friends are coming from games like cod and are new to the fact you have to buy your weapons and they still dont understand why you cannot buy your weapons you want every round .

5. i assume they masturbate if they feel the urge . if you are an a list celebrity , you can ' t just hook up whenever you want because people will know who you are eventually .

6. that idea is still there , you just have to ignore society and their ideas of livelihood . honestly , the thought if having kids isnt in my book and i still dont know if i want to get married . so i ' m just living and loving my life the way it is now .

7. i want to know why many black people put their hair in dreadlocks girls or super curly guys . i want to know if it ' s a cultural thing or they just do it .

8. living in the area we all know just how bad br can be at times . whether it  s the traffic , poor drainage , failing school system , old infrastructure , or a lack of entertainment , it  s just not something i want to be reminded of on a daily basis . i get wanting to be made aware of the issues but it seems like the same issues have been around br for ever with no sense of improvement in sight .

9. youtube is going to be your best bet . as someone else mentioned , just pick a topic and go . if you ' re wondering how brakes work or how you replace them , or you want to know the difference between engine configurations , etc , you should be able to find a video explaining it .

10. hey , it ' s me your brother . just wanted to let you know that i want one of the parachute you got there
