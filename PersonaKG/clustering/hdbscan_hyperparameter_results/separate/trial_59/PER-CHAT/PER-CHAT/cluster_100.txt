2. you make it easy by jason aldean it used to be my favorite song in the world , now it makes me feel like dying . i think that should sum up why .

3. i think damage should be the number one criteria . that ' s the whole point of fighting , right ? i feel like aggression is a terrible way to score if you ain ' t hurting no one . i mean , i can follow someone , make a mean face , growl , and point at them angrily . that ' s not fighting though .

4. no way ! i grew up on the prequels so i have the nostalgia goggles going on . that being said , i rewatched them last year after years of not seeing them and view them differently now . i like the phantom menace , but still think jar jar and anakin significantly make the movie worse . i do hate that the actors suffered immensely after the film but that doesn  t change that their movie parts sucked .

6. i used to be like that too , not anymore though . but i ' m afraid i will at some point think about it again so i like to make jokes because it makes something i ' m scared of a little less scary .
