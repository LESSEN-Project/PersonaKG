1. most of the time is parental pressure or self pressure to be with what is perceived as the ' best ' group . somehow our monkey brains haven ' t worked out that what we enjoy and what is the best for us is the same thing safety aside , i mean where you feel like you belong

3. i feel like watching stuff like this is why i have such a hard time getting over being friendzoned . i ' m like " come on  let this be truman show or some scripted shit "

4. it is and it isn  t . virginity for women varies from person to person , is it only full penetration with a penis ? or what about a dildo ? being fingered ? inserting a tampon ? or is it if the hymen is still intact ? which can be broken without intercourse or even remain intact afterwards ? the general societal consensus is a woman is less pure after this very vague construct is  taken  . imagine how destructive this concept is when as a young girl you  re told that a huge factor of your worth is based on this notion . the current societal implications of losing your virginity , which originated from men determining how much a woman is worth for sale , dowry , sacrifice etc . read  patriarchy are damaging , where as the other examples you listed are not . if there are similar examples though i  d like to hear ! having sex for the first time should be celebrated as a mark into adult relationships , and nothing else . it matters to some and to others it doesn  t . but if you sit here and equate disregarding the importance of having a penis inside me for the first time to disregarding the death of a mother then that is fucked and is part of this issue . for me it didn  t matter so much , but i saw how negatively it affected my friends  especially those that were religious . i like discussing this because everyone has their own view .

5. i never feel like i was born in wrong time period . i feel like this was  is the best time to be born . coming decades are gonna be the turning point in human civilization , wither we are destined to become rulers of the universe or vanish without a trace . everything will depend on the decisions we make , as a species and some luck . we get front seat to witness it all . what better time to be alive ? who cares if no one liked your fb post . winking  face

7. as a child , i suffered a lot from ear infections and as a result i had these drainage tubes which meant that water at the time was a big no . even though that ' s a thing of the past now , my ears are still quite sensitive when it comes to pressure and i would very much like to avoid experiencing what the girl from your scuba class had to go through . i guess i ' ll have to stick to snorkeling .
