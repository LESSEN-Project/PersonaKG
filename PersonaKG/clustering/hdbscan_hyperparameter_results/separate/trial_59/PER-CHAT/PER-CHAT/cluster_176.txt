18. hell yeah ! preach ! just one correction tho  transgenderism isn ' t the right word . it ' s just " being transgender " . the term has a lot of baggage from people using it as a slur so for the most part we avoid using it unless joking about people being dick .
   (ID: 77e0b8c51dfb89ff57bd838b86ee4d78a9fe856f)

19. obviously , this argument doesn ' t hold and it  s simply a case of people being irked that non  whites are finally being represented in a larger way . i surely hope you aren ' t assuming that just because somebody is unhappy with one specific historically  incorrect aspect that they do not care about the others . just because somebody isn ' t actively advocating against every historical inaccuracy at any given point doesn ' t mean they ' re using it as a front to deny non  white involvement  most people do acknowledge the participation of smaller groups in the war , but simply find the representation to be statistically inaccurate . i would ask these individuals what they consider of other historical inaccuracies in the game before framing them with what is implied to be a racist undertone .
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

20. people that hate others for the way they are , are just sad individuals , and nothing else .
