6. i feel the same about reyn , i like riki he acts like you would expect from a nopon but reyn has just as much out of place lines as riki if not more . i know he is the best friend and everything but how can he be so stupid considering who he hangs out with . reyn and riki are both comic relief characters but i think riki has more depth . and i think riki would be far less hated if reyn had just kept his big mouth shut in riki ' s early cutscenes . reyn also has the least interesting heart to hearts with a few exceptions while riki has some of the most heartwarming . his voice might be a little grating to listen to but that is just the best any western could have done sounding ' childish ' without having an actual child or a woman doing it .

8. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .

9. " you can just speak plain language to yourself " if you speak words in your head , like think whole sentences , you can change your mindset .

10. it just adds to the badass effect , i like to think of it as having my gun out passively but always ready for shit to hit the fan .
