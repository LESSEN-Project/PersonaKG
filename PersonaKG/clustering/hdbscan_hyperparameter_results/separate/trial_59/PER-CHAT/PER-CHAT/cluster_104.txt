3. the fear of spiders is not something humans are born with , it is something you learn . if your parents always start screaming and crying when they see spiders , you ' ll learn to think spiders are scary . dogs also don ' t have an instinctual fear of spiders , so they would have to be taught to fear them too . most dogs aren ' t afraid of spiders , so they don ' t have a born fear of them either . but i ' ve seen dogs that are afraid of spiders , and their owners are always afraid of them too , so it seems they can learn it too .

4. it  s very uncommon to find it in restaurants i don  t think i  ve ever seen any . however , if you come back to france and have a kitchen where you stay , head to the nearest supermarket in the frozen section and you should easily find some !
