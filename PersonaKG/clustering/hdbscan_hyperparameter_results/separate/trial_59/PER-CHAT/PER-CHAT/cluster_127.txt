1. do you find  how  or  why  or other type of questions better ? or does it just depend on the situation ?
   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

2. nice list though duplicating some of the requests earlier to the normal maps app . i  m sure if they bring them then they  ll bring it to both this one and the maps app . on another note , i recently submitted most of this feedback to not just the apple feedback site , but also to eddy cue as he  s the svp of maps among many other things . you might wanna do so too so it likely gets better prioritized as imho few from the teams read our postings here .

3. pick it up . stand around the area for an hour and so to wait if somebody would come looking . will return if somebody does . if none , then i just earned 1k for standing for an hour , not bad .

6. not to be a debbie downer , but it ' s not a hero move . it ' s the right thing to do . if someone else does otherwise , they ' re just scumbags
