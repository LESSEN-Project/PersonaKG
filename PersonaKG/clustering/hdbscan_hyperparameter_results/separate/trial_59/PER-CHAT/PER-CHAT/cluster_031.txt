2. i can ' t stand instagram however i don ' t like the people who use the site , you do you , if you want to use that cesspool of garbage , that ' s fine . the reasons i strongly dislike instagram , is particularly because it is made by the owners of facebook . i ' m not saying reddit is superior , or anything like that it is just because of the history of facebook , history of anti vax users . i

3. honestly , i think most of us hate the pc culture that is spreading as well . we just dont want to get into an argument , so we go along with everything . i definitely agree that people need to stop getting their panties in a wad about stupid shit and begin focusing on the real issues . however , it will probably never happen .

4. wow , what assholes . " the people you love " don ' t sound very loving .   x200b  listen , it ' s much better to have a great personality than looks . any day of the week . i don ' t want to date a model , i want to date someone who makes my life fun . some people are severely shallow , and don ' t worry , it ' ll end up biting them in the ass one day . just because some awful people have told you that you are not attractive , doesn ' t actually mean shit  because attractiveness is basically opinion  everyone ' s got a different one .   x200b  if i was you , i ' d call out and cut out everyone who said anything negative about you or your appearance .

5. i mean , sometimes i just really don  t want to talk to anyone , even if i  m on the internet doing other stuff . talking to people can be exhausting and not everyone can handle being in constant communication with multiple people . i  m ignoring my best friend as i type this because i just want to be left alone right now , but it doesn  t mean i hate him . if i were to send that brief  hi  i  d be committed to a solid hour of giving another person my undivided attention when i barely have the emotional reserves to scroll mindlessly through memes . some of us are introverts . some of us are depressed , or busy , or have people in our lives with issues that we need to prioritise over a friendly conversation . honestly i think the way we  re constantly a press of a button away from everyone in our lives has given people unrealistic expectations about how much attention is reasonable .

6. i feel so bad for ya haha . i swear some people are so retarded . i wish religions as a whole would just die out i give it a decade or two before it  s critiqued like hell and looked down apon . i respect others beliefs but shit that type of beliefs ruin kids lives and force them into cultures they probably don  t want to be in . even more religions is just a guide book  rule book of life . the god figure is to keep you sane and not ask questions that have no answer

7. we don ' t want to stop killing each other , we just want to look like we care about people while killing them .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

8. i like to solve problems . if someone complains about something to me , i ' m ready to jump in and fix it . apparently , people enjoy the act of complaining , and me leaping in to correct the issue startles them or something . i ' ve had people even tell me , " i don ' t want your help , i just want you to listen " . it ' s really difficult for me to just let people whine .

9. they ' re just doodles i felt like sharing with the sub . there ' s plenty of great fan art out there , so go look at that if you want something more professional . don ' t gatekeep what other people can post .

10. well that just sounds lazy to me . is that the only reason people want illegals is so we don  t have to do the jobs nobody wants to do ? what job could be so terrible that somebody wouldn  t take it ?

11. yes i can but you will probably make fun of me if i say it . i use my senses . it gets me through a lot of things in life and not just listening to the ' smart ' people that try to get me to believe something that they want me to believe in . when i look around the world i can see that it is flat . i have never ever seen anything with my own eyes that makes me think the earth is round . that ' s why i believe that the earth is flat .
