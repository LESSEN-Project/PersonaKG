1. firstly because it was a long response , and it wasn  t angry , i thought u were offended . secondly was daily in capitals i now know it was a mistake and the fact that you told me to go and get the armour myself , which would be pointless as i don  t want it

   (ID: 4136a1b6da64b3c5f49dfe23761d1a0ec8925dba)

3. all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be  so i guess what i  m saying is breathe . enjoy each breath and take it for what it is . you  re not in the past and if you keep looking back you  ll never enjoy today . and life is a beautiful thing that you don  t want to let pass by . i don  t know if that will help but it  s the advice i can give . best of luck

5. probably a matilda situation . in my experience , your parents don  t have to tell you that you were unwanted and they resent you for it . kids are pretty intuitive that way , and if he didn  t know before then he probably knows now based off of the fact that they want literally nothing to do with their grandchild . but i bet the maternal grandparents will have more than enough love to go around !

6. today every fucking 14yo i don ' t know why the foid is doing that thing at her age  probably mental illness says he has depression , anxiety or i  want  attantion syndrome we should do this things the filthy frank way  first you get the note , than you get the right to brag about it

8. well , i hope that you ' re still here . those friends that your referring to , those aren ' t the type you want to have . if they don ' t like you or your interests , that ' s their lost , not yours . if you don ' t mind me asking , why does your mom want you to move back in ? you may call her narcissist , but aren ' t all parents , in a way ? i would suggest you call her . if you kill yourself , it could destroy her . i wouldn ' t know , but maybe she wants you to move back in because she likes having around . maybe she needs some help , that is if she lives alone .

10. start sometime this week or next week and the interview is tomorrow morning . which is great cos it  s soon , but i also don  t know how long it  ll be for an in  person interview and then a potential offer or not . the second job is way better for me in terms of  and parking ! first job isn  t too bad but parking is awful . so ideally i want the second one .

11. ah , well in this case i ' m not sure , sorry ! i guess what you want is a way of speeding up the responsiveness of actions , but unless you actually had a system to play with and test ideas i don ' t know how it would actually behave .
   (ID: aa4c399e0083dd1bf730546e6c4fbd9b75104d67)

12. that ' s the way i ' d go . if you don ' t want to do any of the things you already know , knowing more means options you might not have considered will open up .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

13. don ' t you want to know the character you ' re writing about ? know what makes them tick ? what keeps them up at night ? the why behind the reasons for them doing what they do . someone doesn ' t masturbate with shit for pleasure because they had a normal childhood .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

16. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .

18. not necessarily . i was answering op ' s question truthfully . i can ' t really rely on anybody except myself to get what i want , you know ? if i bring another person into that equation , they ' re going to fuck it up because they ' ll have their own problems . if there ' s one thing i don ' t need , it ' s more problems .
