1. don ' t build circles , bridge them . from a career and personal standpoint , linking several social groups gives you more influence and resources , rather than hand picking and attempting to manipulate people . basically be the friend , be fair , and do your job as best you can and people will help you because they respect you . it ' s not right away or even in equal effort but they will help you when you need it . it beats cutting people down , dividing groups , and possibly being ousted from a group .
