1. i ' m glad that they moved away from that . i think the floating words thing is used way too much in tv now . the first two examples that come to mind are sherlock and the good doctor .

2. i think the amount of toxicity a person experiences can and will be different from someone else , so asking how toxic the game is won ' t give you a good answer .

3. absolutely . you could also create a personal grooming schedule where , for example , each friday morning you wax  shave to his specifications . in fact , a " standard work " schedule where each day of the week you have an assigned task might help you stay focused and occupied . for example , maybe each monday you wash your panties by hand naked of course , tuesday you practice skills naked , wednesday you study the sub culture online , thursday you practice skills again , friday you groom . you can identify whatever regular tasks you think appropriate and schedule them so that you have something to look forward to each day . if your husband likes you could even document your schedule and keep a journal . good luck !

5. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

7. the button may be sticking it could be something underneath that ' s causing it . if you think it could be this , check out some youtube videos on how to take it a part . i had a trigger that kept sticking and once i took it a part and cleaned it , it was as good as new .

8. i felt the same way in the past . but maybe the fact there is no objective point is a good think ! you can choose to do something or absolutely nothing .

12. very good point , didn ' t think about that aspect . but the fact that op started with " being in la " makes me think it ' s for social media purposes .

13. thank you for the reassuring words . you think abstinence is a good idea ? won ' t i orgasm too soon if i keep hard anyways ?

14. no i honestly think it ' s a good idea ! how am i so off base on this ? yes power banks exist , yes solar chargers exist but if you dont have any other options in the moment this could be a super convenient thing to be able to go and buy . jesus by all the downvotes and sassy comments i ' m getting your think i ' m advocating the clubbing of baby seals or something
