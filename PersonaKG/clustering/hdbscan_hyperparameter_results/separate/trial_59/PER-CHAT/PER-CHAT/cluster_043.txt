1. watching what is happening , while they reply to our comments on here and their forum . i can ' t help but think that the money activision is forcing their hand on a lot of this . its like getting mad at a f1 driver for letting his teammate pass him on the last lap . it seems ridiculous when you ' re watching , but we don ' t hear the owner of the race team in his ear saying " if you ever want to race again , let him pass " .

2. definitely nta but your bf is because if he can ' t respect someones boundaries  consent than that says a lot about thew kind of person he is . i really don ' t think you should have kids with this guy and while i don ' t want to get all up in your personal life ' do you really want to be with a guy who doesn ' t understand consent and the meaning of the word no ?

3. well i don ' t think i can convince you if you don ' t see it , but for me , it ' s more about them becoming too human . and i associate digimon with much more human  like creatures mostly because they talk to you  i never made it far enough into the show to get to machine guns and stuff . i ' m a biologist , so i love animals , and i want my pokemon to stay animals . if it ' s based on a cat , i want it to be a cat , not some human  cat hybrid looking thing .

5. i think you really don ' t get it . we don ' t want a significant other , we do not want to find " someone to spend our lives with " your post and your opinion shows how little you actually know .

7. if it bothers you that much , think about it more like this  your parents are rich , you ' re not . you don ' t have to take their money if it makes you uncomfortable . if you ' re old enough to move out go for it . tell em you want to succeed on your own merits , then try it .
