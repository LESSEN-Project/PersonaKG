1. no . okay , think about it like this  people are made up of atoms , and when you die your atoms go off and become other things . this means that every girl would most likely be made up of atoms that were once in a dude , so if you bang her you are technically banging a dude , and that ' s fucking gay .

2. i think it ' s more of a celebration than a " get people back into the game " sort of deal .
   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

3. it has given me things to do when things are bad and makes me laugh when people i think i won  t laugh again

4. i also got a message from what i think is the same guy . the dude is probably on this sub , looking for people to harass . what a sad human being .

5. the staring . of all the things i found difficult over there , staring was one of the worst . you might think that being taught not to stare at funny  looking people is common for children around the world . nope . and what do you do when it ' s a parent and their child , staring and pointing together , like they ' re watching an orangutan at a zoo ?

6. if you hold people to impossible standards , you ' re going to be disappointed . what if the perfect man for you isn ' t exactly " hollywood handsome ? " you ' re excluding a lot of people because you ' re too picky . also , you might not be as great as you think . if you ' re so great and you ' re still single , there might be a reason . maybe your personality .

7. it ' s always a thought . like  what would happen ? what would people think ?
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

8. glad we ' re on the same page in this technological age i think more people are looking into names and most people will check what they mean , but they ' ll always be some .

9. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

10. people often hide names in screenshots , i think it is  was against the rules to include them .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

11. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

12. it ' s insane that people think we all came from two people .
   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

13. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .

14. i think people that use no true scotsman fallacy to distance themselves from " extremist muslims " will generally have no problem using it again with " stupid muslims " , so don ' t expect instant deconversions from people you intend to debate . still , it may help with people on the fence , go for it .
   (ID: fae28587bce17296589bf92d656ad68ee32601d6)

15. you think the only people who are people , are the people who look and think like you . but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger , you ' ll learn things you never knew , you never knew .

16. well , i love bill burr , and i also think oprah winfrey is a mostly useless gasbag , and i thought the viral ad was retarded . but for the sake of a balanced discussion , i would point out the emotional attachment between mothers and their children . yes , it is more physically demanding to be a crab fisherman in alaska . nobody is disputing that . but i bet if you asked any mother who has lost a child , she would rather pull traps for ten years than go through that again . maybe it ' s possible that the word " difficult " might mean different things to different people ? reddit is usually home to the nitpickiest of nitpickers . i ' m surprised nobody has brought up this point . and now i get downvoted to oblivion .

17. i never meant should have joined salem ' s side . saying " wrong side " was a poor choice of words on my part . i merely meant that cinder had to finish that fight , and had to succeed . it is a tragedy that the towns people were made into obstacles on this missing . it really is . but that isn ' t cinder ' s fault anymore then it is the townspeople ' s fault .  but , logically speaking , if given the options , which side do you think most people will choose ? safety . most people i think would be willing to give up almost anything in the name of safety . nothing wrong with that in fact . that doesn ' t mean those who aspire for something greater are evil just because they value some things above safety though .

18. some would argue if a company has interviewers who get off on asking overly technical questions you ' d be better off not working there . just something to think when you choose to grill people with random unrelated  to  work algorithm questions .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

19. a sect ? or maybe just call it by the name of the group . i think namenerds is more about names for people or characters or pets , rather than words in general . you might have better luck on another subreddit .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

20. i think most people miss the problem with her name . the problem is stupid parents naming kids stupid names . that is the real problem .
