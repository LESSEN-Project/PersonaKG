1. well heres my opinion , the guys probably very paranoid of you cheating on him , im not saying you would but thats what it looks like . heres what you need to do , if you want to stay with him id explain how hes the one and hes over reacting . tell him that you need some breathing room to do whatever you want but that youll always come back home to him . you should only unblock the guy when he understands to give you space . if you feel like things arent working out anymore because of trust then youd definitely be in the right to break up with him . thats what id do atleast

3. thats completely unethical and if anyone found out , it would ruin his career . im not saying that you should attempt to do such a thing , but knowing that you got blackmail on him may give you the feeling of a bit more power over the situation . im sorry you had to deal with such a terrible therapist and your feelings are totally justified . perhaps you dont feel like you want to be a part of the dating scene for a while , but there are guys out there who do respect women and will respect your needs . the only reason i mention dating is because i imagine it  s easier to have s . o . you can talk to about your emotions than not . mutual hate makes for a great friendship anyways

4. okay great , but you ' re missing the whole point . obviously i dont want that either , but in the scenario where we had to give up pokemon which it seems like we are living in , which ones could you part with ? i doubt that you personally love every single pokemon equally .

6. is that your only response ? what if she does want to be secretly fucked like a cheap whore , with a dick hitting her throat ? who are we to judge ? shes only human . she can be both an intellectual and a sex object , i suggest you stop holding women back from their incredible potential .
