1. why is so hard for me to think of original things to say or do ?
   (ID: c5b665e8ba18adb2125a557bd8ecbb0654907c67)

2. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

3. i ' d say no . but i think a lot of it is personal bias or what one would prefer to watch .

4. you might think we ' re done . but no matter what you say , we will complete this dungeon . if rocks fall and yolnaak dies , so be it .

5. instead of tucking me in to bed as a kid with the whole " don ' t let the bed bugs bite " deal , my mom would kiss me goodnight and say " you can do or be anything you put your mind to " and i think hearing that every night developed my confidence and strength for the rest of my life so far

6. i think you meant to say ,  would you be harder than dark souls if this were a game ?  . yes , yes i would be .
   (ID: e09cddf2452184c83537d2d4e8a36f0ba7c3fae9)

7. huh . i never romanced tali but i figured he would say it at some point , maybe you missed it ? i don ' t think shepard ever says it first though , i remember him answering " i love you too " to most of them , but not the other way around . i guess it ' s usually the love interests who confess their undying love and stuff , shep tends to show more with actions than words .

8. thank you . i think i needed someone to say that to break the feedback loop of doubt that i sometimes get stuck in .
   (ID: 063122b93a40a719244d27587193e154f2fed59d)

9. i have lived in canada my whole life . never had to say a pledge of allegiance . as someone who has never done it , i don ' t think it ' s weird . the usa is a great country and typically they ' re very patriotic . you ' re swearing to the ideals of the country , not the leader itself  that would be messed .
   (ID: 90779ea1e5aa2ec3ed3a1fa6b99a8207c0d66d3e)

10. i think as comments flow , you ' ll realise this may not be so much of an unpopular opinion . nevertheless i must say you articulate yourself well . a  from this stranger .
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

11. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

12. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

13. i think i get what your trying to say , but then i don  t

14. i was here to say sushi , now i have to think of something else . its definitely not going to be brussel sprouts . i still hate those
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

15. there ' s a whole wikipedia page on the controversies of using that word . shame because it ' s a great word and i think it deserves a resurgence , so i say use it .
   (ID: 0fbaeef283f7b2090f763028c227ed73724f3e6c)

16. as a girl , i ' d say all my " firsts " , i think i should have waited for the right guy
