2. mosquitoes . they cause the most human deaths compared to any other living thing . seriously , whenever i see one flying around , whether it ' s minding its own business or looking for a midnight snack , i get my zapper and dart to the other side of the room . i ' m literally fine with a spider , i even held a jumping spider to put it outside , with my bare hands ! but i can ' t even look at a mosquito without trying to reach for my zapper . i just realized that i made this a confession . sorry to those who didn ' t want to hear that .

6. yta you come off as an ungrateful leach and when they told you " hey this is how we do it here , its polite and shows respect , and we will still pay for it " you decide you ' re better than their culture and just refuse to be a part of anything they want to include you in . i can understand why they would be upset with you

7. actually i ' m really sad i thought of this . it ' s just awful . who would want to go through that with the cast of any typical movie ? no matter how attractive a given actor is , there ' s always that one scene where they visit their parents or something . i couldn ' t do it . limiting it to just human adults because , just because , the worst character cast to have to fuck would probably be the silence of the lambs .  shudders

8. depends on what your needs are . if you just want a hole to dump cum in , then yeah , a sex doll will work okay . if you want anything else , then probably not .

9. i guess you ' re right . the only issue is that when i get along with a guy have a lot in common , instant click , share similar goals  values  etc there comes a point where he tells me just doesn ' t want a relationship . after a month or so he ' s dating someone this has happened three times now , hence why i believe i ' m the reason

10. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .

11. what do you want ? answer that first even just to yourself and then it will be clearer what you should do . i want hugh jackman to come over to my house and rub me with oil and roger me senseless . i can want all i want  nothing wrong with wanting . it is just that what we want is not always going to happen .
