3. they are not quite playmates since they are pretty much ignoring each other . i am just happy i can have them in the same room and can spend more time with each of them . condescending karens are everywhere lol

4. it will be ok and just imagine the relief when it ' s all over and in the past ! your doctor will not scold you for holding off on appointments , she will be happy you came in ! even if you have the worst case scenario , you will be in the right place , plus most cervical cancers are treatable when caught in time .

5. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .

6. my brother used to do this all the time , dont worry nothing really comes to it just a small lecture and than thats the end of it . keep getting them cookies .

7. my gf and i tend to devolve common phrases and words over time to more just nonsense noises . we can have almost whole conversations with bizarre words and noises . we often ponder that to anyone on the outside it might seem we were both handicapped in some way
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

8. wait , what ? you can only get it once ? i too lost it a long time ago . i was just waiting to find another prismatic shard .

10. mist raven also works if you time it right just when the snake attacks you .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

11. due to the blatant disregard to what happened . why risk your job after working there a year and lose the reference for future jobs ? why choose a place that would inevitably get you caught and fired ? the fact that he couldn ' t stop laughing after he was busted . he could have easily been an asshole who just doesn ' t care , but he never really gave that impression during the time i knew him .

12. the thing is , phoenix aren ' t meta . they just help a lot early in the game as their tags allow you to unlock ep , thrawn and chimaera . it saves you time and makes you pretty competitive early on in arena .
   (ID: 480f3d8feb42f76cdfa6ea3a1dfffaf98bf91060)

13. every time i get used it ' s just another masturbatory story to me . who ' s next ?
   (ID: 917dfa16e92ce1db67ec3f88bc07b87b70a36c95)

14. they  re wrong and so are you , because there literally is not a correct answer . sorry if what i said stung , but i hear it all the time from fans who obsess over it instead of just enjoying the show .
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

15. is the stoning for adultery pertaining to both genders ? because every time that i do read or hear about it , it ' s always the punishment for women . what if the man commits adultery ? not trying to toss gender  equality into an already cans  of  worm belief . just genuinely curious .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

16. just takes practice , i just drawn a lot in my free time as a kid and now its kinda stuck with me
   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

17. even in this sub . last time some dude stole a pic with the oops tag on it the entire sub ripped on that dude so bad . all memes should have a mark somewhere imo just to give credit where credit is due .
   (ID: 97f042c151ad751b2811d75ae69fd7feae42ed77)

18. this boy is not worth your time . just dump him now and move on to someone that ' s not going to shame you repeatedly .
   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

19. i believe it gives you a little bit more time as you still have enough time to walk under them before your timer is up and you can log out , and they would have to pathfind to you which takes longer than someone standing beside you . although i guess you could just barrage them and run while logging , i dunno .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

20. this happened to me the first time i took the test . the only thing that helped me was to find something else to occupy your mind . whether it ' s a tv show you binge i rewatched the office , a new workout i started walking  stretching  and spinning more , or something else , just find something where you can kind of let your brain turn off for a bit . do that at least once a day . once i started that , i mostly stopped perseverating on something i couldn ' t change .
