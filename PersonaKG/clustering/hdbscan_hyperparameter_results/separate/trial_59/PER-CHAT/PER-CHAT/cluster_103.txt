1. do girls think of boys the way we think of them ? like if a girl hears someone on reddit is boy checks for photo posts or tried to imagine  what they look like .

6. do you think it ' d work ? maybe , maybe not . the biggest problem is that marcone is assuming that when dresden comes for him it will be a straightforward assault on marcone in a position where marcone has the advantage . harry ' s a lot smarter and sneakier that that . the thing is that marcone as a character is a lot like harry . underpowered compared to some of his enemies , but smart enough to win anyway . a conflict between the two of them is likely to be a lot more like a chess game than a straight  up fight .

7. hopefully given a break . like , a few lifetimes waived or something . i think about this often .

9. its more like they dont buy any plastic . they definitely dont use microwaves . even i dont do that . but i do think the plastic thing is ridiculous .

   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

11. i think it ' s more like when you go to pick up your kid from school but you forgot his name .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

12. i think everyone pronounces their ts like ds if its in the middle of a word

   (ID: 2c1d97aa622f6ad7ec3a9aad9285dd4ec1e1f28d)

15. true , but to me , i think it seems like a question they should be answering rather than asking . that ' s why i ask several questions about working conditions and technologies used , etc .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

17. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

18. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)
