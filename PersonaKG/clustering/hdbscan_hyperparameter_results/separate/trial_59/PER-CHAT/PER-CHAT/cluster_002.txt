1. i live in bulgaria and the govenment here doesnt care about shit other than money . for example they keep raising the taxes and the bills for electricity . and if you come here you can see that becouse they dont even bother fixing a single road or anything like that outside the capital . this country used to be great until capitalism took over it and fucked it in the ass .

2. could be worse . we could live in an unarmed society were the rich treat the poor like shit .

3. please note  i am sorry if i sound ridiculous or well off the mark . i ' m from nrth qld , and have no real sense of what the city of adelaide is like . i am happy to not live near the heart of the city , so long as my labouring  standard job type partner can work close enough to the home , there is a nice school in the area , and there would be a doctor or hospital close enough if one of us or my kids needed emergency care . also being from the north , our threat is cyclones so i would be clueless and terrified in a fire . so i would not be the best to live in the middle of a fire threat zone etc . thanks for being patient and i do google earth the area a lot . i like the look of the suburbs in the area i circled but i ' m not sure if they are actually suburbs or if they are small communities considered " way out .

4. that is a deeply reductive line of thought . i don ' t deny the fact that sex is fun . but we live in an age where we no longer have to be slave to our primal impulses . have you read about maslow ' s hierarchy of needs ? you ' re stuck on the lowest level . your biological duty , as you put it , is to procreate , yes . then what ? what is the point of just fucking around if you have no other reason to live ? take it from me , living a shallow existence like that is incredibly unsatisfying .

5. this poster is a f  kin nightmare . it looks like it ' s tying to appeal to every single child , with all their favorite characters , and yet it looks like a live show of sorts . you can ' t use those characters in a live performance or an advertisement for all i know without the copyright holder ' s permission . but what the hell is it ?

6. i don ' t believe they ' re cold  tolerant . i live in usda zone 8b , and i can ' t plant them outside . how cold does is get where you live ? and what in particular do you like about their appearance that you like so much ? maybe we could find something that would substitute ?

7. well , have you ever considered that your past experience and current lifestyle is what ' s shaping your outlook right now ? i won ' t claim to be an expert but perhaps the lack of " desperate " struggling has raised your level of contentment beyond what even you would consider " normal " perhaps ? my mother came from a 3rd world country we live in the west and my dad is british and i always felt like a piece of trash whenever i visited my relatives and the little nitpicks creep into my mind . but i noticed that despite their struggles , they seem infinitely happier and more comfortable with themselves than i can honestly admit .

8. you look like a lesbian who complains to the manager when a restaurant doesn ' t serve live oysters .
