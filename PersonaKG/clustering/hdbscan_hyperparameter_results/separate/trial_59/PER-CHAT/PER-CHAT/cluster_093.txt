1. i would say that has some truth to it . shows and movies are getting more realistic and we realize that life doesn  t always have a happy ending but there  s still a story to be told . if look back to  50s   80s , almost every movie that depicts the future was very vibrant and colorful and everyone was happy . but in today  s cinema every time we see the future on screen it  s dark and dismal and destroyed . something to think about

10. i didn ' t get the hype as well . i simply think because we both expected to be hyped , we expected something extraordinary . whereas if we had no expectations going into the episode for the first time , it might have been profound .   x200b  i hope this made sense

13. i can understand grabbing raiga , it saved time to create the seven ninja swordsmen of the mist for the 3rd generation i think . even though hes like a clone of zabuza . answer to your question to my knowledge no . raiga is the only originally anime  exclusive character to be integrated into the naruto manga , along with his weapon , kiba .

18. if you say so . you should take the time to get on google though because it ' s pretty mucb unanimous that either infinity is a concept and therefore the arguement is nonsense , or inifinty is a number and subtracting one is still infinity . when nearly everyone agrees on what i ' ve been trying to tell you , and you ' re the only one who seems to think otherwise , that usually means you ' re wrong .
