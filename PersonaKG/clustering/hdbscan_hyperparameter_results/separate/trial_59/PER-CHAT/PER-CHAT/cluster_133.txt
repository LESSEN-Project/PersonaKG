1. good luck . if you get a craving , just do something different . for instance , if i get one in the car , i ' ll change the channel and listen to something else that distracts me . on chantix , the cravings pass pretty quickly , if you have any at all .

2. that i just applied for a  10k  loan that will be looming over me for the foreseeable future in hopes of not washing out of college and getting a job good enough to pay of for the loan plus interest in an extremely competitive society that is only growing more cutthroat by the day . college is fun .

3. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .

5. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .

7. little house on the prarie , andy griffith show , the waltons . just regular good ol lessons about life . how that you have to struggle and suffer through things sometimes and not have anyone to ' save ' you . and you learn to be a better person because of it .

8. ooh good point . just because something or someone has left you , there is still the emotional trauma left behind . i have no idea what that trauma would amount to when it comes to an extra sliver of someone else ' s evil soul inside another .

11. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !

17. there ' s a few good youtube videos on it . watch mark kermode revisit on the film , where he feels more warmer to it . take a look at ' the philosophy of cloud atlas , how beauty will save the world ' and the in  depth analysis by ' the angry hippo ' such a shame the film is so polarising . as jim broadbent ' s character says " if you extend your patience for just a moment , you will find there is a method to this tale of madness "
