1. if transmitting the data in real time is too expensive , why not have a redundant system that jettisons a black box when impact is imminent . i don  t think it would that difficult to implement in this day and age . might be easier to find than when it  s possibly under two miles of water .

2. i guess the question should be are they saying " nice work " on objectively average work as a compulsion to be nice , or are they saying " nice work " to everyone any time their work is objectively above average ? that ' s the difference . i give a lot of compliments , but i never give one i don ' t sincerely mean . you ' re welcome to your opinion , but i think you ' re wrong .

3. i don ' t think the complainers get it . the guy could ' ve retired and then there would no more new shows ever . the fact is , when he was terrestrial , he was a machine because he needed to keep high ratings to justify the costs . now that ratings don ' t mean as much and he ' s an older guy he ' s entitled to more time off . he warned everyone over and over and sometimes i think you won ' t appreciate the digit  day weeks until it ' s all re  runs all the time .

4. as much as this would be great , it  s still a lot of money . as if we already don  t get robbed every paycheck anyways yknow ? granted there are things our taxes go to that , aren  t really beneficial . but it  d be a rough time i think . what about you ?

5. a clear  cut answer to that would be great . i don ' t think one exists . the correct information has been out a long time .

6. they sort of fade in time , you can get creams that are meant to help . but totally vanish ? don ' t think so .

7. really don  t think about that aspect much . you have a job to do , so that  mission focus  stays . i remember freaking out the first time mortals fell near our fob , i panicked and ran for a bunker . a few months later i wouldn  t even bother grabbing my helmet and kept walking to lunch chow .

8. you ' re so , so young to be thinking about these things . you can tackle these issues if you ' re still together as adults , but for now , enjoy your time together and don ' t get caught up in things you won ' t to think about for digit  years . and also you don ' t have to be married to start a family together if you do reach that point .
