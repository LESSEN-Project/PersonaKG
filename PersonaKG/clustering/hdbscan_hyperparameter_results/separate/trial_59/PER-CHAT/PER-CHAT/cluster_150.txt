17. funny how you haven ' t actually been able to make a logical counter argument . you ' re just saying " you ' re wrong " without the logical backing that i have . then the " boo hoo whatever dude ! you ' re , uh , just like , uh , a flat earther dude " really , i am ? i ' m literally just like a flat earther ? that is your brilliant counter argument ? that saying it is wrong to promote a lie is exactly as bad as lying ? that is what you ' re telling me ? do you . do you realize how incredibly stupid you just made yourself look ? you just made yourself look like a clown .
