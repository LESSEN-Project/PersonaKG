--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 14

1. people use the word " everyone " in sentences as if they know every single person in the world . " everyone thinks they are the hero of their story . absolute truths don ' t exist . there are gray areas as well .
   (ID: 3171687207fd659f146afaa305fc2ad7b92ea52b)

2. because most people know that they can just choose to ignore things that don ' t interest them . i suggest you work on that , for your own sanity .

3. i get social anxiety too sometimes when i ' m in larges groups of people when i smoke . i don ' t know of a way to counter that , but alcohol makes me much more sociable , while when i get high i ' m just chill and spaced out . try smoking alone a few times to get used to the feeling of it , and try to smoke with people you know well i would suggest .

4. i talk to people every once and a while they hate me at first then get used to me and friend me out of pity . i don ' t know why they do that they could just stop talking to me if they hate me but it ' s just what happens .

5. what . i thought he just meant like anyone or anything it doesn  t matter what it is . i don  t know why so many people start bringing random bullshit to a random comment . it  s a hobby people have now to get offended by everything they see that might be offensive to them . i meant no hate with that comment man  shrugging

6. enjoy the life i ' m living even though it ' s far from being perfect . the reason i ' m saying that is that a reddit has quite a reputation of of people not happy and quite depressed when you ask people about reddit . i know it ' s not the case and i don ' t generalize but that ' s the general thinking about reddit .

7. i don ' t know why either . what is it that makes people take an overwhelming interest in what others might be doing behind closed doors ?

8. " i don ' t know sql , python nor r , i don ' t have any technical skills as i am a manager , i manage people . " no , son , you ' re the manager of a machine learning squad and you ' re proud of the fact that you have no technical skills ? get the fuck out of here you lil bitch

10. it literally is sexist i don  t know how people can deny that
   (ID: 4136a1b6da64b3c5f49dfe23761d1a0ec8925dba)

11. i don  t have evidence , there hasn  t been a study that i know of . but what  s happening now isn  t working so it  s gotta change . as someone else suggested in the comments making the people private to media and public would be a better way then my original suggestion
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

12. tpms are horrible , especially in the cold . best bet is to look at the tires and if it doesn  t look flat , it  s not . it  s just a cash grab against people who don  t know how a normal tire looks
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

13. it takes over literally every aspect of your life . everything . it gets to a point where you literally have to put yourself before anything else . it can seem narcissistic to people who don  t know what you  re going through , but when it comes between wanting to blow your brains out and everything else , it  s an easy choice . hopefully
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

14. wow i know what you mean . it ' s hard for me to tell people no so i usually end up in situations that i don ' t wanna be in .
