1. i feel the exact same way about people of color that constantly shit on white people and make blanket statements about them . you don ' t like it when people do that to you , so why would you do that somebody else ?

4. in my opinion , you not only keep people who made these mistakes , you utilize the experience as a preventive measure . everyone screws up . you don  t manage by fear  it sends a horrible message to employees . people who make repetitive mistakes despite appropriate training and coaching , however , should be allowed to find other employment as should people who are indifferent and unapologetic about their errors . people who screw up big things usually feel horrible about it . hopefully , the hr manager will now be a cheerleader for caution and security and that may be a better outcome than replacing them .

7. no , you can only make money by getting the people with money to give it to you . a service is useful , and i don ' t care how many new jersey housewives you poll , a dog fingernail painter does not do anything useful . you can only create wealth by performing labor .
