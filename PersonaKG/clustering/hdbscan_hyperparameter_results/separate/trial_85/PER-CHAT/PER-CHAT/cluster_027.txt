2. first of all , get help second , distract yourself . it can be hard now but find something you like to do . it worked for me one day at a time
   (ID: e216f2a1e0d7d814b7ad58452ce6ac21e0b763fc)

3. fucking up happens . its okay  if you learn something from it . why not try drawing on yourself instead any time you feel like that ? keep drawing even if it takes up a whole leg or arm . i recommend crayola .

4. hmm , try it like this  " i ' m not racist , but why can  t black students shut the fuck up and learn like everybody else ? " it help ' s identifying you as you are early in the sentenceand doesn ' t waste someone ' s time reading racist bullshit

5. kid , expand your thinking . what would happen if everyone thought like you ? if banging chicks is the ultimate measure of success , we ' d probably go back to the time when sultans kept harems . women are humans , not trophies for you to ejaculate in .
   (ID: dfcca9c384a4fff7bbeb3cd1fb2f40aacb47fd7e)

6. i wonder if it is that when we are waiting for something we measure time against itself . in other words , when one checks the time it is like a reset  like the time before doesn ' t matter . the increments get smaller , yet feel longer . on the other hand big one , little one , take your pick when we are engaged or entertained we are not paying attention to the passage of time .

9. for some , like the darkmoons , you can do both at the same time , but for most the ai is faster . pvp is only faster if you have someone to grind with since its a bit dead atm for the gestures you have to get them all one on character , the same with all the other achievements .
