1. then i guess it ' s not gonna happen at all which is okay too . don ' t ruin your work environment . those are some bridges that shouldn ' t be burned . you can control your emotions . only you chose what you think and feel for a person .

4. this actually sound like an issue with the pc  mac  s hardware . you could check your activity monitor and see if the interface is initiating some type of search for new software , but i don  t think that  s what it is . turning off the internet is recommended for optimizing your daw . but who are we kidding . i don  t think many prosumers do . this isn  t a very common issue which is another reason i think it  s the computer  s ports .

5. obviously you don ' t care if you ' re insulted . i ask this question for others . what do you think smells worse , that couch or the under boob sweat ?

   (ID: 17b8a304069d7530607e28f8e04d840e28be0d3e)

7. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

8. to be fair , i doubt most of us would be here if we didn ' t trust him , but i don ' t think any of us can make up your mind for you . read about him , watch videos of him and decide for yourself if he deserves your trust .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

9. i don ' t think that is laughter . it is probably saying " get your friggin ' grubby man hands off my body "
   (ID: 60767c0b3f4fbb31bad0bee921528b0976287f68)

10. i don  t think that  s what those settings mean but i could be wrong
   (ID: 09ceeb62f2a165a9c38283d43984e8e6f6f5580e)

11. i ' m not following . in op ' s scenario , they ' re getting referred for a procedure  service not covered by their insurance . what about the solve . care platform would lead to the payment responsibility being handled similar to a pcp visit ? i can understand solve . care handling the referral for an hmo . but unless i ' m misunderstanding op , don ' t think that was the scenario .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

12. i don  t see what the fuss is about . what exactly do you think is going on inside women  s restrooms ?
   (ID: 08122a9a2a4681e85c950e276210d33c3d0a8f96)

13. as for the questions i think so not yet i don ' t thin so
   (ID: a590a48cc57b678d7925ce142e639876d9df69d6)

14. hmm . i don ' t think it can see its own reflection from there .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

15. i don ' t think that i ' m above anyone or feel that others are less than me . i ' m not desperate , miserable , or ugly inside . whether i ' m with someone or not i will be happy no matter what , thank you .
   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

16. i have a question to you . you said yo are a father , are you talking about nofap with your childs ? my dad is such an angry person so i don ' t think i will be able to tell him about nofap .
   (ID: c41e4affc406bbc71e6c12aabf095d759b6dbec2)

17. i don ' t think it is " liberal white guilt " as much as the importance of knowing what happened , understanding the reasons why , and working toward learning from those mistakes . unfortunately , we seem to fail somewhat on these points , especially the last . even gasp ! the current administration .
   (ID: 0f3da013abe745c83b2d4eb042abb7fd28f5e872)

18. i don ' t quite think you get how to use that correctly
   (ID: 4e2fa6f27a1d1e593b4d7f007fea784cb7cbfc65)

19. why do they always seem to think that being anorexic means you don ' t eat anything at all .
   (ID: ddd12abb48a0f3ffcb28acfc187dad268b34e3a9)

20. isn ' t this type of controversy and reaction to a manager ' s decision exactly the type of this that shows how the team is valued ? klinsmann seems to understand that he will be fired if they don ' t advance , to the point that i think he will be upset if he isn ' t fired for not advancing . of course , i could be clouded because ld being left off makes sense to me .
