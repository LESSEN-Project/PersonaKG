2. almost everyone in mass communication , especially film and broadcast communication . anyone who ' s not rich or at least , upper middle class , outgoing , sufficiently attractive , and has little to no connections in the media and enterntainment industry , would not have survived mass comm . the professors with some exceptions are either hard  ass or too relaxed . popularity and connections is everything in that place , and since i had none , i was under the radar for most of the time .

5. the entire premise of the movies is that they are in our universe , in a galaxy far far away , a long time ago . so if it ' s set in our own universe , then the same physics must apply . okay , if the same physics must apply , then there shouldn ' t be any force and so the movies shouldn ' t be made . oh and it ' s the same physics so lightsabers can ' t exist . their residual heat would cook you alive if you wielded one . oh , and light speed . yeah , that ' s stupid and should never have been added since we can ' t travel faster than light . any of the movies can be picked apart for its lack of realism . so many hooks in the other movies were added for simply making the story move in a way they wanted .
