10. now that seems a little harsh . why should i murder my wife when she ' s of the same mindset as you ? she hates all varieties of olives . and why should i commit suicide ? i actually save people like you and she by eating all those unwanted black olives . seems pretty shortsighted of you .

11. yeah it  s not a question of whether these people exist , they do . it  s a question of whether they would be dumb enough to paint themselves as hypocrites . it reads more like someone imitating a hypocrite .

17. yes , this piece of you missing sounds like the social part you reserved for people who do not accept you . i am sorry to hear that but no you can seek out new social ties from people who accept you for who you are . i can  t promise it will be easy and you may always miss what you have lost but it will get better if you remain open to new relationships .
