7. if they already know everything about you how could it hurt ? i thought they were the feds who else has this power ? the first step to getting help is proving the problem exists . you ' ll notice that black people are starting to get help with police violence now that they ' re able to film the police . do you have everything to gain and nothing to lose but your delusions .

   (ID: 29b9b56e163cbfecbc98e83c436b436aca056a8c)

   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

15. all of those statements are wildly different from taking children to a circus . i ' m not condoning what happens to animals at circuses , but a kitten slaughterhouse is not something that was organized and operated for the entertainment of the common people . i know that you probably feel strongly about this , but you ' re being ridiculous .
   (ID: 40e7e4fcc325e808f67616071f736d382e20795c)

16. stop explaining it and start having fun with it . i know a bunch of people that do have at least some form of stutter .
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

17. i would argue that it only works for guesses that the average person has some level of familiarity with . people know about how big a jelly bean is and about how big the container is and can do some mental math . some will be high and others will be low , but it averages out . if you showed people a model of a new bridge being built and asked the crowd for the thickness of steel needed on the center support , you would get wildly varying answer with an average nowhere near the actual answer . so asking the public to give their input on solving an actual problem , determining tax rates , military funding , educational standards , or any number of other things that are actually complex decisions , would not benefit from this effect .

18. hahah we have those fences too in many places , you know what people do ? jump over .
   (ID: f37c6d73f88ae9488245dcae1da46589d182fa9b)

19. when you see a no soliciting sign , that is the easiest sale of the day , the reason they put those signs there , they know that they are suckers and will buy anything . remember pma equals opm , it means positive mental attitude equals other people ' s money .
   (ID: 4d69affb6415148eda5d5103b282ce15476169d5)

20. i know it ' s silly but i get embarrassed when people are singing happy birthday to me in a restaurant . you know , when the guy comes over and places the big sombrero on your head and the waiters do that happy clapping dance routine and then ask all the patrons to join in . my family loves it and they love it when i go bright red !
