2. you sound like you are young with zero confidence . who gives a shit if he flips out . leaving him means you don  t have to deal with it . you really need to ask yourself why you love someone who treats you this way . if you really loved him , why are you posting for ways to make someone leave you ? it sounds like you don  t love him . you  re scared of him . you need to speak with a professional because a person who loves themselves don  t do things like this .

4. he didn ' t make hell . hell is the absence of god . doctor who , of all things , gave a fairly good description .  the space between dimensions . there ' s all sorts of realities around us  different dimensions . billions of parallel universes all stacked up against each other . the void is in between , containing absolutely nothing . imagine that  no light , no dark , no up , no down . no life . no time . without end . my people called it the void , the eternals called it the howling . but some people call it hell .

8. i did mention that it was from revised and never got ported over to v20 , and i ' ve never seen anything really in v20 , the most i ' ve seen is when the tremere say that a 3rd dot blood bound individual is a little too willing to throw their life away , but that doesn ' t imply they are literally going to go insane and turn you into a blood fountain . there ' s personal horror and then there ' s just being excessive . you don ' t need to go that far to really achieve personal horror , you can still accomplish it just fine through other means . by making a digit  dot blood bond that horrifically unstable , you are detracting any benefits it might have . you don ' t hear about doing stuff like that because not every vampire has presence , it ' s not a common ability every vampire can utilize . any and all vampires can be blood bound by their sires , but not every sire needs to use , or even can use , presence on their childer , but we see it does happen . and there is an event all about being presence ' d , the anarch free states were started because their prince would dominate people with majesty and force them to injure themselves simply for daring to defy him , so yes , it is a big deal . absence of evidence is not evidence of absence .

12. being " special " isn ' t about being greater , it ' s about telling a child the intrinsic qualities that make them different are okay . one of the biggest challenges for children is overcoming the feeling of difference  learning when to measure themselves by others and when it ' s ok to be themselves . to quote mr . rogers , what children most want to hear is , " it ' s you i like . " in terms of child development , this is huge . children need to develop a strong self  concept  the idea that they are unique and distinct from others and that that is not a bad thing . here is a collection of self  esteem studies that support that idea . frankly , telling a child that they aren ' t special isn ' t going to get you anywhere . children already feel different , they know that they have qualities that make differences socially and academically . feeling different leads to self  esteem problems more often than it leads to entitlement . we should tell them that they are special and worthy , but balance that with attainable goal  setting . " special " doesn ' t mean that they don ' t have to work . in fact , if you look at the tiger mom approach , special is combined with intense planning and goal setting almost crazy goal setting .

16. i ' d say kratom is mind altering . i ' ve taken it daily for so long and it has definitely altered my mind . it ' s psychoactive and gives a mood boost , euphoria , and much more . hard to not generalize all substances because where would you draw the line ? is weed okay ? is adderall okay because it makes you focus ? what about alcohol ? can you drink kava ? that ' s why they generalize and say any psychoactive substance . basically they want you sober and stone cold sober .

19. i don ' t know you , so i can ' t say what you feel or don ' t feel , but i will suggest that you question again why you had those feelings . was it really because you are ashamed of being gay or was it that they were attempting to use the fact that you are gay to insult you that hurt ?
