   (ID: 3bc536069edd6aa052ced5b6ea5f69eefae07cb7)

2. you think you have a brain damage , then you kinda realize that you are asleep and try to start a self induced dream about pornography and it does not work , so you just hang back until you wake up
   (ID: 53aa6c267ff5eccf891e178786d41ca5df80a5de)

3. i think you just clearly stated the concept of a ' starter home ' that you and your spouse are doing right now . as your family and income grows , you may find that house too small and if you are able to buy a larger home , you may do so .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

4. just watching the one card and it ' s got me thinking , what do you think the optimal cage shape is for mma ? or does it not matter as long as it is the right size and there is no sharp corners ?
   (ID: 1fb7025aaa0b620e024c8abbaecd72d34f8418b0)

5. i see where you ' re coming from . it makes sense . i just think that when ai starts to become more effective in it ' s uses we will move on to another thing . i like to use maslow ' s hierarchy of needs as a sort of comparison . once you fulfill your needs and for food and water you move to relationships and love . i think we ' ll just move to the next level of the pyramid

6. i think we got way of topic here anyway . the original question was well kinda why does gaming industry now day feels obligated to satisfy all those  pissy dickweeds  , can  t we have just  he , she , they  characters , maybe even white ones too ?
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

7. this question just made me think of the movie sleepwalkers .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

8. how well someone speaks in a beauty pageant is irrelevant to my point , i wasn ' t trying to point out everything about each topic . plus it is just an idea , i think you are taking it a little too serious .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

9. so you think it ' s ok to just go around and steal memes that someone worked for hours on ?
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

10. i think you just solved where infinite shrinkage goes , its  limbo  , where you can be in one place and not be able to move but you can .
   (ID: a77a8bcaa391d8b6584d32e6ad243e71297d7258)

11. i ' m actually still just on the side of liking it , but it ' s getting tougher . gaping plot holes , uninteresting storylines , painful characters , terrible dialogue , such poor consistency of any in  universe tech that i have to call most of the sci  fi elements one big continuity error . and that ' s not limited to the newer films . just started watching the original trilogy after tlj , and think i have to accept they ' re just sci  fi films for kids . i think they have some really great core concepts to work with , but then the actual stories that are told in the setting get ruined by the issues above .
   (ID: 1b160a23109a802786ef06d0b2abff0841f4eb37)

12. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

13. it ' s not really shepard anymore , the shepard ai has much bigger priorities than talking to an old crew now . everyone would think he just died during the crucible firing .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

14. i didn ' t . i just got drugs from my psychiatrist . now i hate everybody and think how stupid humanity is .
   (ID: 080eedcfaabe8f67b2c0a8da33a3a401906822f2)

15. actually i just realized op  s would still be wrong because the apostrophe shows ownership so i think it would just be ops . my bad
   (ID: 5042e4f4cf4f00f86836211d30b97922c92f0b46)

16. thanks , that only made me think everyone else was doing the same thing , and doubled down my fear that they were just tolerating my presence out of politeness . that ' s pretty much how all of society works , we all just tolerate each other existence . you fit right in .
   (ID: 225291489bc1a4ddf3d197a3062fa9ff935f3029)

17. i think it  s pushing your luck not to get two fish . often they stop eating and just lie there and give up on life if they are all alone . my piggiest boy went on a hunger strike for a week when he was in his own for his friend had to go to the fishy vet tank .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

18. i think so but just my opinion .
   (ID: 3e906e06d59fb5c2993270f0b4efed5b9ab122f7)

19. you can never stop a single crazy no matter what draconian rules you think up . they will still be crazy and we will just be freedomless , passing reactionary legislation that doesn ' t do anything but pandwr for votes .
   (ID: 1cb49ecc2e4fdb9752d9ca12d02f3cfc2f6659c9)

20. i think that chefranden just means everyone thinks the religion they were raised with is the right one . he ' s not saying everyone ' s religion is the right one . in the context of the original post , he ' s saying faith is a prepositional belief . you left prepositional beliefs out of your list of how to choose the right religion in the op .
