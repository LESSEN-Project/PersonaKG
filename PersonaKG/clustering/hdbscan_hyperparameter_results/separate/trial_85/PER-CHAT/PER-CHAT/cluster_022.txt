1. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .

2. think long and and about the history of black and white people in this country . now tell me . why do you think it ' s not considered racist ?

3. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?

4. no you weren  t raped and it  s sad that people think what happened to you is the same as getting attacked . forget gender , you were in your house with your girlfriend , and the only reason people think is because you were tired . get real kid . your not a victim , you just need a nap .

5. i think it ' s perfectly fine to call people out on their shitty spelling and grammar . now everyone knows what our opinions are . hooray !

6. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

7. i think that people shouldn  t have to lie about their beliefs . i think their religious beliefs shouldn  t be mentioned at all

10. wth ? you are given that much power , and all you can think of is how to cause trouble ? what the hell is wrong with you ? use it for something that helps people , dammit . save some people . deliver medicine somewhere . bring a long lost relative to his dying grandfather . something , anything , that doesn ' t prove you are an immature prick .

12. being happy and being usefull for other people . for me if you think you shouldn ' t be happy you are living wrong and if you think it ' s fine being a useless piece of shit you are living wrong as well .

   (ID: 88c35221745da41b29ff5b9f921026de5ccbb6c0)

19. do you have any proof for who is bot ? you people keep saying that reddit is full of russian trolla and bots , yet you dont shoe any proof whatsoever . i think the collusion story has really left a mark on some people to the point of that they see russians and collusion everywhere
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)
