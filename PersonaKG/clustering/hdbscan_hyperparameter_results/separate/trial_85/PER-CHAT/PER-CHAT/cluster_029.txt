   (ID: 4dd03f320502247ea725348e21fe67168d7cf5f1)

11. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .

   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

15. i can somewhat understand this with subs like wpd , or cringeanarchy , but waterniggas ? seriously , what the fuck ? that sub is actually pretty wholesome . memes about staying hydrated can turn into good tips on living a healthy lifestyle .
   (ID: 419b67e0e2cdcb7bd8ea9a89d34d0747a1f5f620)

16. are continents large enough scale for you , retard ? if not , good news  you could be only a day and airfare away from living like a king in africa .
