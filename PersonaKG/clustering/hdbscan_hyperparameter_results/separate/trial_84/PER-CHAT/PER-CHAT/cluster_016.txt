3. they why has the whole logo changed at the top of box changed ? marvel bobble heads do not change like this . for example , you have the punisher funko pop . there are a few different versions . the marvel logo remains the same , but they just put the different version in in brackets by the name . ie ' the punisher thunderbolts '

4. lsd made me realize that i was overthinking most everything , and that most problems like that are just made up in your head . it really changes your mindset . would highly recommend taking lsd  mushrooms at least once .

7. it was on reddit and someone said to some innocuous comment i wrote ,  i hope you die .  i could not see anything offensive or rude or even that opinionated in my comment . so i didn  t care . if anything it helped me . that comment reminded me that i shouldn  t take anything online to heart . if i offended or upset someone i would not like that  and i would apologise but if someone just wants to be a rude little fucker it has no impact on me .

9. do you work on an australian mine site ? it sounds just like working there . if you come across a piece of paper on the floor you can ' t just pick it up , you have to fill in a form first . " what is the hazard ? why is it a hazard ? can it be removed ? what are the dangers of removing it ? what will happen if i attempt to move it ? considering your answers what is the best course of action " once you submit your form to a supervisor they will read it and get back to you on what they believe the best course of action is .

10. stumbling through the club , the lights strobing so i can ' t see where my feet are planted and it feels like my body is being chopped up into different sections , and this songhttps    just blaring . finally unable to keep my balance , i accidentally pitch forward , i fall down . and someone turns up the music .
   (ID: a3c37892d1eb5776c9a4299ce29fc6200c20dd34)

11. i didn ' t read the whole sentence and i assumed you were just going to get them to sign something . like you go up to some and be like , " imma need you to sign this then imma knock your lights out "
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

12. i take it that the crew are a comedy group ? is " crew funny " highlights of their " skits " or just some bonus behind the scenes of their creative process ? in any case , eating donuts purchased for someone else isn ' t funny or quirky , it just makes you look like a self  absorbed asshole especially in the jerk  like way amanda phrased it . p . s . i ' m also the last person to complain , but that is the wrong there in your sentence will .
   (ID: 808718709a1de9360ade79304c59728079eae812)

   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

   (ID: 0254dc2f43007419c5c3fd1e155e6bf15fce137d)

19. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets
   (ID: 0264eec5f9f9a43d83f3a82c46341e90961fa3b8)

20. i hate such mis direction . a movie should be like fight club with subtle clues all around place . maybe its just my preference .
