' pre google ' i clicked it and instantly felt sick , turned my computer off and worried for almost a week that someone was going to find it on my computer and think i was a pedophile . iirc i reinstalled windows thinking it would hide it . heh bad times .

13. yeah certainly , the troubles was what i was referring to , i think it would have been far worse with legal guns . london and glasgow have a very troublesome violent crime issue and they are other areas i believe would be worse with legalised guns . although this is sheer speculation , both cities have major knife crime issues , maybe it wouldn ' t be so bad if the other guy had a legal firearm . who knows ?
