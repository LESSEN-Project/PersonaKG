1. hold on hold on hold on you are telling me that while we are probably in one of the most crucial transfer windows in the past decade that ed went on a freaking vacation for digit days ? are you fucking kidding me ? you do realise our potential targets could have slipped through our fingers while you were burning your balls in the sun . get us a freaking dof that works his ass off during transfer window and enjoys some vacation when it ' s all done after all . no wonder ole looked a bit sad when asked about transfers . he ' s busting his ass off to get something going while the boss is slurping margaritas . we needed players to be part of preseason but guess since you have digit understand of football go enjoy your fucking vacation ed . sorry rent over . please continue to your usual muppet duties .

3. ok so all costumes are off limits if they depict anyone who isn ' t white ok sounds fair . also i forgot that being black is way worse than a digit  employment rate , monumental suicide and depression rates and not being able to relate to anyone or form any relationships . take your ablism elsewhere . evidently not .

4. get kids ready for the real world . it  s not about this bullshit they roll out . when i got out of high school the real world hit me hard and i was lost . they shouldn  t keep you in the safe as in working out your problems for you bubble for digit years . no one in the real world is going to do that and it  s a false way to represent what  s to come .

9. to be fair that was a fucking fluke . wasn ' t skill , was luck i was amongst the top rated when the sub exploded 2k subs in digit day and the new guys upvoted the top stories by about digit points each . if i was digit  digit positions lower by now i ' d be somewhere around the 6th page .

14. jesus no we didnt need a whole other film but i thought they made some questionable choices for the last act . visually i thought the snapped heroes returning was pretty meh . it shouldve been strange leading them out of digit massive portal , instead we get t ' challa first . why ? and the whole assemble felt too spaced out . get rid of all the filler warriors and have the main heroes together and get a better run  up action scene , they shouldve used the angle that was in the infinity war trailer that had hulk running through wakanda .

15. nothing changed ? what are you talking about ? the defensive meta is gone after all the changes . it ' s not as reliable as before to stay on defense . for honor is in a digit times better place than it was when this year began and there was no way to do damage unless you picked a dlc character and everything was shadowed by timesnap and it felt clunky . sure , they need to optimize conq ' s bashes and some more character , but even if they leave it where it is , it ' s still a fuck ton better than year digit and a little bit into year digit .

16. call my friend ' s business called traffic tax services at digit digit  digit . for more details , please go to . he advertises a digit  success rate , but i am not sure that if it accurate . still , the method that he uses will significantly reduce the chance of getting conviction . note  this business is legit .

17. beautifully written  im the exact same way . sensitivity and sa are both blessings and curses . you are absolutely right however and hit the nail on the head . you may be an empath . check out empaths . thanks for the great post . i identify digit  .

18. in this subreddit alone ? not even past digit minutes probably . these questions are forever forgotten in the void where no one will ever see them again .
   (ID: 4917a362688355621979e016028f58dbf7f3ac7e)

19. apr should be the only consideration . ask an accountant that is not a complete moron , they all agree . you will not be able to keep paying it off every month forever , something always happens . your comment is digit  wrong .
