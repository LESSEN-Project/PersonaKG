   (ID: b6c3e540255084641f0e148a3992d9113c560f0b)

3. to be fair , i doubt most of us would be here if we didn ' t trust him , but i don ' t think any of us can make up your mind for you . read about him , watch videos of him and decide for yourself if he deserves your trust .

5. i don ' t think the average gamer could even survive a week in the woods , let alone survive not being corrupted by the marker , or killed my necros
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

6. what is their to argue about ? it  s pretty opinion based . i don  t think any scientific arguments will change someone  s perspective who truly believes it is murder
   (ID: 4f1b65a581332b9d19507ccf0e921d0967e013e7)

8. i ' m not trying to defend him but don ' t you think someone might have already redeemed it and you later decided to check it out only to find out it ' s gone ? it ' s happened to me many times for free steam keys in discussion tabs
   (ID: 43361d3d352286328dcb058ec017ca0e2d364601)

9. honestly , if it does happen to be there , you can  t do shit about it anyway . don  t even think  worry about the dark web
   (ID: 274e8da1cefa1c3c6583ca4fb0ca85be567cde0e)

10. why do you think i automatically support it because i don ' t smoke it ?
   (ID: fddeeaa11799939dfe96bc7fae74a22b474aaf20)

11. i don ' t think that ' s really much of a save tbh
   (ID: 4e2fa6f27a1d1e593b4d7f007fea784cb7cbfc65)

12. yeah , everyone knows you don ' t wear a donald trump inside . come to think of it , i wouldn ' t wear that big asshat anywhere .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

14. there is the other side to this . which is there used to be no other problems but the db is such a big problem that they don ' t think about the rest of it . when your so says , i love you i am sure your automatic response is , i love you too . but do you , have you actually thought about it or are you just saying it out of habit .
   (ID: 3b45915d58b20f0e2abb6b26d4534980a5d3aa68)

15. i don  t see what the fuss is about . what exactly do you think is going on inside women  s restrooms ?
   (ID: 08122a9a2a4681e85c950e276210d33c3d0a8f96)

16. this actually sound like an issue with the pc  mac  s hardware . you could check your activity monitor and see if the interface is initiating some type of search for new software , but i don  t think that  s what it is . turning off the internet is recommended for optimizing your daw . but who are we kidding . i don  t think many prosumers do . this isn  t a very common issue which is another reason i think it  s the computer  s ports .
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

17. unfortunately this sort of thing is already happening . i think that ' s why lots of american cops are pretty jumpy and don ' t hesitate when using a gun .
   (ID: a90f01f580b7cc08038958d5c1f659fd492b1f2c)

18. because every product i used caused me dandruff , and one day i noticed that it stops when i don ' t use anything . i think that answers your question .
   (ID: 4dd03f320502247ea725348e21fe67168d7cf5f1)

19. that you need to manipulate men into taking care of you . also fake a pregnancy if you think he ' s about to dump you . i don ' t do these things my mother is a horrible person .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

20. homosexuals are still able to pass along their genes , just not in the ' traditional ' sense . i think it was , but i don ' t think it is any more .
