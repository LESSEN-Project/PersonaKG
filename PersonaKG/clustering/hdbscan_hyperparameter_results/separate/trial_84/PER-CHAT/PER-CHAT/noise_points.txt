1. my mom once told me she didn ' t understand why god allowed me to live . little backstory . i was born nearly digit months premature . i technically died twice . the doctors told my parents not to get attached cause i wasn ' t going to make it . fast forward to the incident . my mom accused me of stealing her digital camera . she had just returned from a stay in maryland and couldn ' t find it . for hours she berated me and topped it off with the " god shouldn ' t have let you live " comment . the next day she found the camera in a box she had yet to unpack . she never told me she found it or apologized for her comment . she just pretended the entire situation never occurred . my dad apologized on her behalf .

2. not sure about these specific parts , but something i always bear in mind is that official accessories hold their resale value far better than any third party parts do . if you do end up selling on your kit , it ' ll be a lot easier to sell it with the official grip .

3. name the tool something you will keep so that you don  t leave it behind for digit emeralds , something like an axe or a sword

4. thank you . i taught myself python so the way i do it is probably super unorthodox . i really appreciate the insight . by format you mean the "   this is what this part does " right ?

5. sounds like they might be a bit envious of your successes and they are picking on the tattoo out of spite . why see them at all tomorrow ? it will be more crap about the tattoo and nothing about your new job . reschedule and say you are sick . it  s your bday , you deserve to feel cherished and loved and you aren  t getting it from them .

6. what do you mean by incriminating ? like you would be in legal trouble if you said it ? i don ' t hate or enjoy facebook but it can be useful . i dislike some people , and human nature , and how facebook has made being dishonest and playing to the crowd more desirable . but i still think it ' s the individual ' s fault for giving in to that .

7. some random garden type thing that my mom brought me to when i was like digit . it was a wip then . i  ve brought it up multiple times , saying that we should go check it out , and she doesn  t remember . it  s too vivid to have not existed .

8. this is the hardest thing to deal with in this day and age . this kind of stuff has happened to me and what i did was tell twitch and stuff like that . they don  t listen to creators now . it  s super difficult .

11. at least for me , i use the word , proud , as a way of telling someone they did good or exceeded any of my expectations . i almost never use it when i feel actual pride .

12. i sampled 1st chapter and part of the second . there are hints of effective altruism , but not much . also , this taylor is stupidly straightforward . one would think that utmost priority for a parahuman whose power stops working when she is seen would be ways to prevent being seen . the obvious idea is making a lot of smoke bombs , making suit out of them , igniting them all . if someone sees you , you turn into smoke  spewing teenager . as soon as smoke obscures you , you gain your powers back . once smoke dissipates , you turn into smoke machine again . that ' s the idea i got by thinking about cheats for a minute . taylor who lives this , whose life and death depends on it , would think of a hundred more cheats . she did not . i am disappointed . also , i feel compelled to ask the questions  spoilers about ending of worm  s " can taylor win ? if yes  why did simurgh choose this timeline ? why didn ' t contessa involve taylor in her path to victory right away "

13. great question and i honestly dont have an answer for you . it can ' t be just feminity because the women i like , and the woman i married , are tall basketball player types . so . i dont know . just is what it is , i guess .

14. if we are quiet in a group setting it does not mean we are having a bad time . although it ' s a nice gesture , you don ' t have to constantly check on us . it makes us feel insecure and like we ' re doing something wrong .

15. One of my favorite things is family jewels.

16. oh , you mean mean you don ' t know ? so you decided to comment on a scientific subject despite not knowing what the fuck you ' re talking about ? and now you need the information spoon fed to you because you ' re too busy jacking off to animal cartoon characters to do anything intelligent or interesting with your time ? well nope . see , i don ' t like people like you . you ' re an ignorant , boring , loud mouthed piece of garbage , and i don ' t want to help you . i don ' t want to explain a single thing to you . you ' re fucking repugnant to me . so go back to your sticky , disgusting little animal fuck fetish subreddit and shut the fuck up about subjects you ' re too stupid and too fucking lazy to understand . stay in the corner with the rest of the nauseating degenerates who literally want to fuck cartoon animals since normal humans have rejected them outright . as well they should . fucking gross . blocked . because i really never want to encounter you again . wow . just . wow . absolutely disgusting .

17. idk , i  m able to relate to nearly every message and character in the book . halliday  s created the most immersive  video game  in the universe and yet it  s so much more than that . people get lost in it .  the missing millions .  all just because he wanted people to like what he liked . and that somebody like wade who had quite literally nothing but passion and skill for the same things was able to beat his game . i think cline wrote every character perfectly , being able to understand their plights , i mean even sorrentos character was compelling , somebody you really wanted to hate . the references were insane . i didn  t even grow up with the old school games but the attention to detail was incredible . in an era where aaa titles don  t even come with enough content for digit month , cline was able to imagine up a place where everything was under digit platform , the whole world shared halliday  s creation , gunter or not . free learning , unlimited content , whatever your hobby was , it was in the oasis . i  ve never wanted something to be as real as i do the oasis . but the themes hit home too . the problems with being overly connected , letting the real world pass you by . the want and need to not let corporations rule the world . i just think it  s amazing start to finish . i understand liking something and later feeling differently but man , this book , i don  t think i  ll ever get tired of .

18. wow this was super interesting , you  re a good storyteller ! i don  t think you did anything wrong considering you were having your own experience and you couldn  t possibly read her mind if she was expecting more to come out of it but you didn  t do anything out of the ordinary . . in the meantime , don  t go into her restaurant until this is resolved
