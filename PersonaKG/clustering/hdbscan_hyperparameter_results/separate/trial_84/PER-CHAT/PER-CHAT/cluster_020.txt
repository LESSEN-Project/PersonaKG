10. look up ygopro  devpro online and download it . it is a virtual version of the game , and i believe the percy client has an ai mode that you can test decks against . then i would lurk around the sub a little to see what people are playing , pick something that piques your interest , and start from there . warning  cardboard crack is an expensive and addicting habit , and devpro has cost me a fair bit of sleep after discovering it

   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

16. thats apples  oranges dost . your heels are a part of your style . it ' s about how you choose to project yourself to the world . it ' s totally different from standing on a stool using an external prop . i ' m not suggesting that photography is or should only be about total realism . i totally get that a photographer tweaks the space  choreographs the people in the frame to get the most aesthetic bang for buck . especially in celebrity shoots . this situation here appears different . i ' m not a betting man but if i were , i ' d bet that if the woman was significantly shorter there wouldn ' t have been a stool for her .
