1. you gotta put the time in , brother . that ' s half the fun . films would be trash if you only ever watched the last digit minutes .

2. bad players will be bad . gating isn ' t going to fix this problem . good players will want to learn the game and will use resources to do so and no amount of artificial blocking is going to solve it . co  op and practice are so stupidly easy that they don ' t teach you the repercussion of a lack of proper laning , how to teamfight , or really anything that you list as a problem .

3. people get surprised when they find out that a majority of my aerodynamic knowledge comes from playing games and making paper airplanes it ' s interesting to read about what you study but when you play a game based on what it is , it really kick  starts your experiences in that field .

4. no i honestly think it ' s a good idea ! how am i so off base on this ? yes power banks exist , yes solar chargers exist but if you dont have any other options in the moment this could be a super convenient thing to be able to go and buy . jesus by all the downvotes and sassy comments i ' m getting your think i ' m advocating the clubbing of baby seals or something

5. i never really forget it because i ' m a small guy aiwb carrying a glock digit . but my problem is sometimes forgetting to grab the damn thing . i go every day carrying and it just slips my mind that i actually have to pick it up and holster it , not just assume it ' s there .

6. out of curiosity , how much of that is old people ? i could understand if they have a hard time actually reading the signs . otherwise , yeah , that is pretty weird . totally separate question . do you find the job draining on your writing , because it is annoying ? or are you actually more free to write than you would be if you were doing something academic ?

9. please note  i am sorry if i sound ridiculous or well off the mark . i ' m from nrth qld , and have no real sense of what the city of adelaide is like . i am happy to not live near the heart of the city , so long as my labouring  standard job type partner can work close enough to the home , there is a nice school in the area , and there would be a doctor or hospital close enough if one of us or my kids needed emergency care . also being from the north , our threat is cyclones so i would be clueless and terrified in a fire . so i would not be the best to live in the middle of a fire threat zone etc . thanks for being patient and i do google earth the area a lot . i like the look of the suburbs in the area i circled but i ' m not sure if they are actually suburbs or if they are small communities considered " way out .

10. you people will never stop trump . how can you people expect to stop trump if you people refuse to argue against his policies ? all i see is a bunch of people complaining about how " mean " trump is . the washington post lost their access to trump events because the majority of the articles they put out on trump have nothing to do with his policies and instead they just focus on trying to get the reader to become irrationally emotional so they can guide them into hating trump . maga

13. a few weeks ago i finally watched " don ' t be afraid of the dark " for those of you who have watched it remember the scene where the little elf , fairy , monster thingy is behind the little girl ' s teddy bear and is making it move while the bear repeats " i love you " over and over again . the next morning i was at work eating breakfast and out of nowhere from one of the lockers i hear " i love you " in the same damn voice the teddy bear had . so yes kinda creepy .

17. tv show for sure . i spend more time on the computer than watching tv nowadays . also , my favorite show is the kardashians . my pregnant wife loves to watch it all day when she isn ' t doing stuff around the house .

18. who on this earth has the right to tell you no .

19. why are you so quiet ?  or  how come you  re so shy ?  i don  t really know you that well if you  re asking me that , and some people are just shy . also anxiety , but that  s not something i should bring up .

20. well even if that ' s the case , it ' s sort of hard to just take control  analyze your own subconscious without professional help . this was like a few months ago . i guess my biggest fear relationship wise is becoming that father in the movies who is so thrown into his work , that he never makes time for his family which causes them to drift apart . this could be something else or just something petty . i mean i won ' t tolerate something that ' s obviously worse like cheating or something but i ' m not sure how to " fix " my issues in terms of attraction unless professional help is called upon i guess . i think it could be way worse though .
