6. overwatch . the game currently has too many ways to stop a player from playing  stunlock and all that . took a while for me to realize what it was about the game that was making me so angry , but i haven ' t been back since . sometimes i kinda miss it and want to go back , but then i see a play of the game or highlight that involves so much stunlock it hurts , and i decide not to .

9. right there with you , but without the guilt . i started playing this as something to do when i was trotting my dog around town . back then i was playing a game where a solo player could expect to be able to do it all eventually . the game has moved beyond that now , and catching them all has become a distant dream , but i ' m still content to do all the solo stuff i can whilst entertaining the goodest of girls .
