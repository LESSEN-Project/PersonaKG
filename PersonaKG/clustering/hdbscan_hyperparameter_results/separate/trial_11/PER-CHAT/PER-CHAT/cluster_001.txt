2. so basically the only reason is so that people don ' t do the same to you later ? not that they have any individual value or right to a seat , just they are some sort of " karma points " for you .

3. well you gotta remember they have a job to do , and something as simple as that seems pretty minuscule to you but is a big deal for the employee , boss , and establishment .

4. nah . i don  t think it  s really that big of a deal for her to go back and grab a couple of things while you are ringing up groceries as long as you  re not already done scanning and other people including you aren  t having to wait several minutes on her . on the other hand , i don  t think you were necessarily in the wrong . i mean , i understand your reasoning . if it is something that bothers you , you have the right to voice that . it  s probably something to bring up in the car on the way home or at home and not at the store , however .

5. you always give the neighbors one pass . that ' s the neighborly thing to do . if it happens again , then you call the cops .

6. woman took my seat and had her kid next to her . normally i wouldn  t have made a fuss , but she got all loud and hostile when i pointed it out while standing in the isle i had window seat . always do so i can sleep . so i stood my ground until they moved all of their junk and moved so i could sit down . slept so i didn  t endure the heavy breathing and flares the rest of the flight . be nice to people .

7. that ' s why i don ' t tip new people with low karma
   (ID: ff36137e68382d33016fdf568208704ea2c16642)

8. the company i work for pays us to go volunteer a few times a year with a food bank we work closely with and donate to and what not . the fuckin nerve of some people that come in there is unreal . you have the super nice and just down on their luck people that are super appreciative for anything you give them , and for helping load it into their cars and what not , then you get the giant pricks who make you put digit bags into their brand new car , then when you get there they open up the bags and start taking out vegetables and whatever else they dont want and demand you bring them back inside and give them extra cake or sweets , or whatever they choose then flip out when you tell them that ' s not really how it works .

9. classmates blamed me for being late to class . at least he have the decency to do it right in front of me and the class .
   (ID: a35d2e75aaca32c6e87ef13f40d514b9769453f0)

10. i once had a guest completely lie  and i mean totally fabricated everything he said  and my boss bought every word of it . it applies to really any scenario in life but when you know for a fact someone is lying through their teeth and you can  t do anything about it , it has to be one of the most frustrating things ever

11. i will say it ' s pretty mean to pretend to steal something to fuck with a store but if someone is wrongly accused i think its on the store to remedy that . i remember this one time at safeway i watched these two asian kids playing with items in their shopping cart . they took a frozen concentrated juice each and placed it under their shirt to cool off since it was a pretty hot day that day . their reactions we ' re pretty cute . all of a sudden a manager comes rushing over and asks the boys to lift up their shirts , appearantly some old lady reported that they were stealing . one person sees two boys playing another will see two boys stealing . some people are just way too paranoid .
