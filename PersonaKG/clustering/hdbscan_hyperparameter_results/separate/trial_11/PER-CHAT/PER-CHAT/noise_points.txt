2. yeah i understand this . one of the things i  m going through now is seeing high school friends on facebook make posts about being home owners , and i want to buy a house soon . so it is easy to feel jealous but i don  t want to . you know ? i want to mature and just be patient and not envy others . but it is a conscious decision that we have to make sometimes .

7. the only difference is you sound like your experience is from page digit while mine is from raising a daughter after many failed relationships as a teenager , hence my clumsy attempt at telling the young team how life works . i may not come across like it but i am the voice of experience . i  ve lived it

11. well go in there with the approach that you are not digit  satisfied and want to return everything . the worst case scenario is  we can  t refund live animals but you are within the return policy for the accessories  cage etc .  if they say that , you let it go in the store after they refund you . make sure to bring it in a box . also , record it

19. there  s so much that goes into explaining the  crusades  as a whole that it would take way longer than most people are probably willing to write . i would suggest just reading up on it and attempting to school the guy yourself . it  s not really easy to breakdown digit years of majominor wars in the name of the church and what intentions pope urban ii or any other prominent figure had at that time . they still argue about that today . good luck on your adventure though . it  s an interesting read for sure .

20. seriously look it up it was a way to mark slaves , then jews and other religions then jump to the 1900s american doctors claimed it would reduce masterbation . when in reality all it does is remove pleasure along with climax control and lubrication . i will never do it to a baby boy . no one should . if they dont like how it looks by the time they start using it you can do it later in life .
