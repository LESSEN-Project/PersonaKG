1. i feel like food is more of a right than healthcare . that being said the government shouldn  t be providing either of those things to all .

2. right , because one gender has medication for a thing and the other doesn ' t , but it ' s all sciences fault , our people aren ' t smart enough to figure it out . sure we can fly in space but equal reproductive control ? pssshh . you can see how that isnt a chip on my shoulder , right ? like everyone thinks everything has to be personal , but . maybe it doesnt . maybe i just look at it and see one gender being pressured to use bc but the other doesn ' t even have the option . and i think it sucks ! i think it would be way easier if we could choose who got to use bc . maybe it doesn ' t work well for someone so the other does it . but it ' s not like that . it ' s a condom or female bc , or you are screwed . and the fact that we didn ' t even start until relatively recently , is more evidence to the fact . things won ' t be solved overnight . hell i ' m happy i can vote and live by myself without a caretaker man . but it is a process . saying it isn ' t a gender issue is ignorant , because it kind of is . either you just aren ' t listening , or you just don ' t care .

3. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .

4. because if we ' re making special pleadings for sexuality w  t regarding racism , it opens the door for people to make disingenuous claims about all sorts of other racist things not being racist . the problem i ' m seeing here , though , is that if you wash the term " racism " down to such a degree that it includes mere personal aesthetic and sexual preferences , then it becomes nothing but a shaming tool with no real descriptive usefulness . basically , when you put someone who considers certain races to be inherently inferior to others and someone who has a mere aesthetic preference regarding skin tone or facial features under the same umbrella , then that umbrella serves no purpose but to trivialize the former while stigmatizing the latter . edit i ' m also seeing problems with maintaining this logic ' s consistency . i mean , this may sound like a cliche , but by the logic employed by the article , you really would have to consider homosexuality an inherently misogynistic sexual preference , for example , unless you want to do some special pleading right here by contriving some arbitrary differentiation between a racial preference and a gender preference .

5. no free healthcare ? that is crazy ! why would anyone oppose free healthcare ? healthcare that nobody has to pay for ? who could possibly be opposed to free healthcare ?

6. so am i supposed to expect the government can do better for me by taking my money rather than let me use it to my own advantage ?
   (ID: 225222aa213d7057c7af320e746ccbb2afeb2f27)

7. no , not just free stuff . you want to force the wealthy to work for free for you .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

8. you ' re an idiot who clearly hasn ' t lived in very many countries . welfare is not what builds the nice parts of town or the transport channels to get a coke into the hand of any person in earth . rich people do , for their own benefit and the benefit of those who work for them . just because a few assholes kill the farm and pocket a tax break instead of giving you personally a job on a micro level doesn ' t mean trickle down economics doesn ' t elevate everyone on a macro level . i repeat , go live somewhere not built by the rich if you disagree .

9. that ' s something that people often turn to , like " people will be out of jobs " but there ' s still things that need to be done within a universal healthcare system . there are still plenty of jobs that people can do .

10. i couldn  t help but notice how much people were saying that this stuff is common sense . i think the author kind of missed the point of the dave ramsey cult in some ways . it almost feels like she  s calling us cheap , but the point of beans and rice isn  t to be a miser , but because you  ve dug a hole and you can  t afford to eat anything else . i ate a lot of chicken and rice while on baby step digit , i now have room in my budget for steak . when i hit adulthood i realized that poor people had a different mentality compared to middle class and the wealthy . i grew up pretty poor , and i couldn  t help but notice that every dollar coming in gets spent right away . i remember hearing ,  it  s just money , we will make more next week  from my parents a lot . you will also hear a lot of ,  well , it is what it is .  i think the mentality of ,  someday i  ll die tomorrow , so why prepare for my future when i eventually won  t have one  fits in the same category .

11. then they lied to you , mate . it is literally illegal to fire someone for an injury . in fact the employer is legally obligated to pay sick leave .   the only way they would be sent home would be if they were illegal immigrants and have no contract . lots of them are brought in as independent contractor and they are cut loose pretty much whenever .   and it does reward the hard working , but you also need to be smart and work with the proper papers . just look around you and see the massive number of people improving their living conditions . as i said again . if it rewards the hard  working then migrant farm workers should be rich as fuck . but it doesn ' t . it works the people who are working in the right industry with absolutely no correlation to how hard they work . especially relative to those outside of that industry who work hard .  can you name another structure with this rate of growth ? go ahead . what is growth have anything to do with it ? i have not said anything about growth . i am simply pointing out that it is a myth that capitalism rewards the hard  working .

12. yeah , i don ' t disagree to that one bit . it ' s just that if a generalization for any other race is made , people go fucking nuts . imagine if i said , white men can ' t dance . nothing wrong with that , right ? but somehow black men like fried chicken and watermelon is a no  go . i don ' t mean to start an argument , as i actually agree with you that there are some fucked up things about old white men of that generation .
