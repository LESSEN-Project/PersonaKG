1. that literally makes no sense . i ' m not sure you know what hypocrisy is . nor do you have any grasp of the abortion or gun control issue .

2. so tell me child . how much joy do you get out of this ? and it seems as though you ' ve forgotten there is a world outside of america . where left and right wings protest peacefully , intellectually an through many generations . you seem , perspectively through your comments on this thread alone . like nothing more than an imbecile , a child , an idiot . i hope you come to learn one day that there are benefits to all sides of the political compass . and if your narrow . you ' ll only lead to a narrow mid which in all cases . is simply , useless . good day

4. oh , i still say israel shouldn ' t . but you wanted a answer from the left so i gave you one . me being from the right doesn ' t mean i ' m unable to give a left answer .

5. really , i have to thank you for the exchange we ' ve had . i intend to share it with as many people as i can . my friends all over the internet , my peers at work , and all the folks i have contact with on social media . i plan to share it with strangers at every opportunity . and you know what , those folks will share it with their friends and acquaintances . it will go far and wide . on and on . all over the country . look back at the lengths you ' ve stretched to bend reality because of your obsession with guns . the facts you ' ve attempted to dismiss because they don ' t square in a gun nuts head . the reality that americans kill eachother with guns more than any other developed nation . that america leads the world in mass shootings . keep hunting your hogs as the world looks back at you with disgust and pity . i should feel sorry for you but i don ' t . i have common sense and you do not . this is the last time i ' ll be responding to the nonsense you post . just know that you ' ve provided me with enough evidence to convince all those that have yet to be subjected to the garbage you and your ilk spew to reject it on a logical and factual basis . sleep on that . like i said earlier . thank you . your posts are nonsensical and increasingly bizarre . you have confirmed to me and to all that i intend to share this exchange with lol , which is a hell of a lot that gun nuts are real and are preposterous . so in love with the ability to create death that the essence of living is total lost to them . thank you . you have gone beyond proving any point i wished to make . once more . the gun control lobby have nothing to fear from you and will soon see their advocacy pay dividends because of crusading sophists like you leading the charge .

6. fair point and i fully agree with you , but you " should  have hidden paxter redwyne ' s username , or seek him out in the forum and inform him that you have exposed his opinion here . because as it is he sounds like an ignorant and may not even know . he deserves a right to reply and clarify his opinion  correct his mistake .
   (ID: 67ef96fb30756c49a9ffdff2579058eb2a3c1398)

7. overreact much ? your response highlights what is wrong with what passes for " debate " these days . no matter what point you make , no matter how unbiased you try to be as a person , there ' s always somebody there getting off on making their favorite point by framing your words to mean something completely unrelated to what you meant .

8. by that logic , we shouldn  t allow driving at all because it increases the risks of harm to people and people  s pets . it is already being worked on self driving cars to minimise the potential of crashes . here is a article about that  dough i do understand what you are trying to say , i would still just do rules like that because still , it puts the animals in danger . earlier you said that weed lessens the aggression , but sooner or later other drugs will be legalized where they do make people more aggressive . that is the problem . by just having rules like that it would atleast prevent a few drug users to buy pets , which is better then nothing wouldn ' t you say ? sure it maybe just prevents digit drug users from buying pets , but thats better then nothing in my opinion .

9. you are absolutely correct . they are just points . what the main idea is that they are all a part of several things that you have to consider before just simply saying  giving that land to corporations is just an absolutely horrid idea .  i don  t want to be type of person that draws a conclusion too quickly . instead of seeing a headlining article and jumping on the bandwagon how about going to local sources of the are affected and reading more of what is actually going on . such as my first post , what if it is meant as a means to preserve a community by giving it more land to develop and increase revenue , as opposed to letting it turn into a ghost town and go to waste ? my comments might seem incoherent to you if you don  t take the time to understand , or even ask me , what it is i am trying to say .

10. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .

11. i was with you until the end man just because you don  t like something doesn  t mean you can  t research things , if you was in a debate then that research would be a lot more convincing than just saying  lol school shooting no matter other things kill more  for example op made a post that out school shooting deaths into context . also that  s really just something a child would say  oh you don  t like      then why are you trying to justify why you don  t like it

12. i ' m confused on your stance on racism . in another comment you claim you were denied into a committee of sorts based on you being white . so you understand what racism is . yet you make a statement like only asians and jews are good at math . sounds to me like you ' re delusional . a stereotype is formed from ignorance and ignorance comes from not understanding or not wanting to understand  which fuels racism . so unless there was a misunderstanding , i think you and i have different definitions of what racism actually is .

13. your my friend are absolute scum . worthless fucking cretin . you deserve to be burning in the fiery pits of hell for all eternity . so you can take your fucking " uwu " out of here , and go fuck yourself .

14. ok , so the post in question was  what evidence is there that male privilege exists ? i am in no way saying we should put out a bad product . but i am saying that none of you or i are biologists and really don ' t know how hard it is . regardless the fact that they didn ' t start until later is bad . how is that so hard to get . i ' m literally not bashing . why are you even defending it ? it ' s not your fault or anyone ' s here . is it that bad to get the word out ?
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

15. i  m arguing because you say stupid things and can  t accept the fact that your post is not fun , smart , or helpful . you argue like a child and need to learn that not everything you say matters . you don  t want to argue , don  t respond . your the one who posted a garbage post with moron comments . you get off reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

16. the op asked a question about islam , the guy you responded to then talked about islam , and then you brought up other hostile anti  gay groups as if this would invalidate anything said so far . it doesn ' t . every single christian on the planet could be a violent gay  hater , and it wouldn ' t make islamic extremists any less of a problem , nor would it nullify " tommy  chicago " ' s concern about bringing more of them into the country . the vile actions of christians or other fundamentalists  pick your poison do not excuse or legitimize the vile actions of muslims . i think this is precisely the kind of thing the op was describing . for some odd reason , many progressive  minded people have this strange knee  jerk reaction to any kind of criticism of islam , whereby they portray it as an inherently peaceful , inherently tolerant religion , even though this requires just as much cherry  picking of the quran as it does of the bible when attempting to paint christianity in a similarly flawless light . these defenses are simply dishonest , and your attempt at normalizing violence and bigotry through relativization isn ' t any better either .

17. funny , just like you chose to make yourself look bad , you could have just as easily ignored my comment .
   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

18. posting something that i as a muslim support doesn ' t make me a cunt . you using a generalising term clearly shows the upbringing you ' ve got . wow . shows where you stand ? oh wait . nowhere !
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

19. and you ' re the type of person who thinks so highly of themselves they can ' t even understand a simple joke . get your head out of your ass .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

20. why are you so stupid ? is it because i ask you to shut the fuck up while you are being condescending towards someone ?
