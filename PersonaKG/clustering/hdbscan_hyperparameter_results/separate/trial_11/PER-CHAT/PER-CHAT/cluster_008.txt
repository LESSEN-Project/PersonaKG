1. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them

2. you should never look at sex as something that needs to be done just to say you did it . ask anyone that ' s been married to the love of their life , they ' ll tell you they wish they waited . its not that you can ' t because of anxiety , its just that it isn ' t the right time . there are no such things as missed opportunities because when you meet the person of your dreams , you will never let then go and vise versa with or without anxiety . those aren ' t friends , they are just cliche douche bags and it probably burns when they piss . fuck em , because the kind of anxiety you get from meeting someone new is something you learn to cope with . the anxiety you get induced from people you already know , you are stuck with .

3. the same thing applies to others , even with different situations . people will treat you differently based on who is and isn  t around . if you find someone who seems interested in you who does not change under attention , then you should go for it so long as you are interested .

4. i can relate , when i was dating this ome girl earlier this year id rather hang out with her than do anything else , she just made me happy . heres the thing if you hang out with them too much there eventually gets to the point where you get bored of them , lose your interest in hanging out with them . i know i know you might be saying that you wont and some people can be like that and never get bored of them but incase you do take a step back but not to far back , they ' ll think something is up when in reality you jusy want to create distance to rekindle the flame of loving their company . thats my opinion atleast

5. oof . imma a lonely boy so i can  t give advice from experience , but i would say something along the lines of . i was already looking at another girl and blah blah blah . but you already fucked up so what you learn . take your time bruh . i mean if ur tryna smash and dash then try to  sexualize  yourself . but if u tryna get a relationship be honest and genuine . be like a anime girl right before she confesses ya know . or if your neither and it was  spur of the moment  just play it off like ,  natural boy reacting to your above average sized breasts  , good luck ! ur gonna need it .

6. my opinion , go out more . not to a bar or club more like a social event at the park find someone whose doing something similar to something you feel passionate about . ex girl jogging in the park go join her keep her company ask like how long have you been jogging here ? then improvise from there obviously ask her for her name just dont make it the first question so you seem interested at her hobby aswell as herself . next try to get into the friend area yes i know you don ' t want to be here but this stage is where youll learn the most truthful information about her . next start sharing life moments you wouldnt tell most people just think before you say it so it doesn ' t sound like extra baggage for the person . eventually youll know when to ask her on a date

7. at first i was like , what ? this doesn  t make any sense . then the part about you potentially leaving the country came up and i understand better . i think i  m almost any other instance , it would be weird to ask to be exclusive without some amount of commitment . the two ideas go hand  in  hand . in your case , i think it would be ok to say ,  hey ! while we are seeing each other , let  s not see other people . but in case i end up leaving , i don  t want to get too serious .  just make sure to be clear about what you want and expect out of your relationship .

8. forget about how you ' re supposed to act to be a man . just be you . for example , you ' re about to be of legal drinking age . you want a sherly temple at the bar while everyone else is doing shots and chugging beer ? fuck them . get your sherly temple and drink it with pride . trust me , it ' ll work out .

9. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

10. i think the worst thing you can do in a relationship is expect the other person to know what you ' re thinking , wanting , or feeling . i ' m introverted and keep things to myself , but i knew things were vastly different with her when i felt comfortable telling her my insecurities , dreams , and pretty much everything about me  i actually found myself wanting to share all of that with her . it may sound overly simple , but we communicated really well from the get  go .

11. i know exactly how you feel . i ' m a man and when we were dating my wife was always touching , kissing and the like . i liked it but it was all a little overwhelming . and she is a tender thing so i never wanted to say for fear of making her cry . but i finally made the plunge . she did cry . but she was happy that i was honest with her . that ' s where relationships thrive . honestly . i think you should choose your words carefully , adding be honest .

12. well the good news is that you don ' t have to have sex with anyone with whom you don ' t want to . also , stop listening to your family and so called friends who tell you that you ' re unattractive . that ' s just ridiculous and you know better . meet people in real life which is what you prefer anyway . i do too and go ahead and be picky ! it ' s your life  your body and your choice ! one thing though is that there are plenty of people who are attracted to you . whether they admit it or not that ' s another thing but it ' s true . your friends are your allies . trust them but also trust yourself . there is someone out there for everyone . you must believe that .

13. let it slide off you . why would you care whether someone thinks you are unmanly or creepy . if they think so , let them think so . it should have no influence on you whatsoever . aren ' t you a man going their own way ? exactly doing that ? not caring what people think of the choices you make and doing whatever you want to do anyway ? that ' s exactly what mgtow is about for me .

14. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .

15. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

16. totally agree with this , once i learned how to use my funny side things really took of . but for me it was more about being playful rather than haha funny . one thing that really worked was asking them  so whats special  unique about you ?  i could see them really unplanned think how to impress me . hillarious and effective .

17. definitely say something . call her , though . tone can be kind of difficult to determine through text and you don ' t need want to give her any more reasons to push you away even more . " hey , insert sister name . how you doing , casual chatting , blah blah blah . i need to talk to you about something . i feel insert everything you just told us . i know it ' s your wedding and you can do whatever you want , but i ' m starting to think that you don ' t even want me there . if not , that ' s fine bc you ' re kind of being a bitch and i could do without all the cross country trips . if you genuinely want me to be a part of the wedding , then act like it and maybe ease up a little bit " . feel free to modify to your liking .

18. i have a few friends like you , and i want to shake them all . it  s easier said than done but you have to understand if people didn  t want you around , they wouldn  t invite you anywhere . research some small ways to help yourself with confidence .
   (ID: f14ea91df683dc236b3ffe5956871b69581e71d3)

19. if you just met them like at a party ,  tell me about yourself  is a perfect opener that allows people to take it where they want . if you have developed some rapport , asking about people  s brothers , sisters , and parents  remember their names , and if they sound positive , ask what that relationship looks like  would you say you act more like friends or are you the protective sibling  . if they sound negative , venture elsewhere or play it safe and ask something more open ended like ,  who are you closest with ? who do you tell stuff that nobody else knows ?  the provocative questions like that last one is a gambit and can either turn people away or build intimacy quickly .

20. i don  t recommend you drastically change your look . you should go in baby steps . you want to change your hairstyle ? sure , go ahead . you want a new wardrobe ? if you can afford it financially , go on a shopping spree ! you want to get tattoo  s ? well , it  s gonna be on your body forever so just make the right choice ! as for your boyfriend , if you don  t see a future with him and you truly believe you want to move on , i think you just tell him how it is .
