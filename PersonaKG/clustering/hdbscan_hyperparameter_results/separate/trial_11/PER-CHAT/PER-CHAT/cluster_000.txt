1. i feel sorry for you , this sounds like a feeling no one should have .

2. not really , but if you don  t like your life change it . take a step and talk to someone my dude doesn  t hurt i was a shy dude but still had a lot of friends . i wouldn  t think of your teenage years wasted because you e spent time with yourself either you probably know more about yourself than a lot of others . stay strong home dog and go talk to someone about how you feel .

3. this post is actually a pretty good start . whether you realize it or not , you ' re reaching out . now you need to go to a doctor , or a therapist , or whoever you feel comfortable with , and tell them all of the things that you have told us here . i ' m no doctor , so i can ' t say one way or the other whether or not you actually need medicine . but that ' s all the more reason to go talk to a real one . if you really do have depression , you might need meds . you wouldn ' t leave any other disease untreated , right ? as for the girl in the pic , i ' m guessing you look nothing like her . the hard reality is that you probably never will . everyone is different . you need to stop comparing yourself to other people , because you ' re only hurting yourself more . chances are , that girl has insecurities of her own . everyone does . but you can ' t let it control your life .

4. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .

5. i hate to ask , but i feel i have too . at what point in your moms illness did you realize the fight was over ? or did you never come to that point ? i ask because i ' m dealing with some stuff and would really like to know . when do i stop " pretending " and start preparing for the inevitable . i ' m at a loss .

6. i wish i could offer some insightful advice , but i don ' t have any , and honestly , it doesn ' t sound like you need any . i will say this though , part of it isn ' t just you . part of it is that as a whole at least in america , we are finally learning how to accept people who are not either neurotypical , or who are fully disabled . for far to long we as a society didn ' t allow , or make room for anyone who we felt strayed from the " norm " to fully integrate into society . anyone viewed as " different " was either kept in a " hospital " or hidden away . it ' s great that you are so self aware , and are trying to better yourself , but remember that society has a lot of catching up to do as well .

7. because i felt like my body failed , or was broken , especially since i already had one child , so of course i should be able to have another . so somehow that made me responsible . grief is a hell of a thing .

8. i think your time will come but if you tell yourself stuff like that always i don ' t think it will ever come . it ' ll happen
   (ID: f9d66cb7c29781b64b81947ff0e36c01dd0aa973)

9. nobody should ever feel this way . it hurts me that your  friends  would tell you things like that . i would take some time to find a new friend group . if there is a counselor or someone on campus , i would utilize that resource too . you don  t need to feel alone . you have a bright future . i  m sorry this is happening to you .

10. sounds like you had it rough in hs , sorry to hear . i did to , but eventually you grow up and realize none of that matters
