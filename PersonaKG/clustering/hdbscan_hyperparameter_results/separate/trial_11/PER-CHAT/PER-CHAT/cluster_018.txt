18. i ' m not clicking on a resetera link so you ' re completely ignoring my evidence but basing your argument on what is basically a hunch ?  i have absolutely no trust in anything ea makes their studios say fair , but respawn wasn ' t owned by ea back when titanfall digit came out , they couldn ' t make them do anything .  respawn either knowingly killed their own game this is pretty much what happened . i love respawn but face it , they let their ego get the better of them when they thought their game could compete against cod , and you ' d know that if you clicked the resetera link .  if you ' re going to do something that you can ' t do without engaging in scummy business practices , then don ' t do it . how exactly are the cosmetics in titanfall digit scummy ? you pay a coupe of dollars for a purely cosmetic skin that gives you no real gameplay advantage other than a bit of extra and that ' s only used for unlocking other cosmetics as you level up . no loot boxes , no randomisation bs , digit  optional , and it literally tells you if buying them individually would be cheaper than buying a bundle .  apex needed some voice actors to say a couple of generic lines a couple ? have you seen the list of voice lines ? there ' s at least digit for each hero , not including callouts and other miscellaneous noises .  most aaa games need all new animations in pretty much every case i ' ve seen , developers have reused animations from previous games in new games where they can get away with it . hell , even titanfall digit takes almost all of its weapon animations from titanfall digit .  keep in mind that most every aaa game has to do all the things you listed , except way more . most other aaa games aren ' t free  to  play .  no marketing while that is true , drew mccoy executive producer on apex legends said " it has a comparable marketing budget to a standard major studio title " . i would link you the article where i found that but there ' s no point since you have an aversion to clicking links .  they expected it to fail , they were just throwing a br game out to make a quick buck or two . there ' s nothing about the game that shows this . the game was relatively glitch free on release iirc , the ping system and ally revive mechanic they developed are way too fleshed out and revolutionary for a throw  away game , and they ' ve literally just released a new , well thought out hero , and there ' s no way they completely developed him in the less than digit months since release .  anthem and bfv are both pieces of shit bfv is good but that ' s not really something i want to go into here .  there ' s already no real reason for another titanfall game . right now there isn ' t really a proper fast  paced , high mobility , mech filled first person shooter on the market . if it was timed right an the marketing was good , i reckon a new titanfall game could be a huge financial success in the not  so  distant future .  no , ea made one good game in a sea of shit , i ' m not going to go out of my way to financially support them and the far worse problem of microtransactions just because of one good game beyond purchasing that one good game . this is somewhat fair enough , but my post is more aimed at people who picked up the game cheap and feel like it ' s worth more than they paid , which i would in their situation .
