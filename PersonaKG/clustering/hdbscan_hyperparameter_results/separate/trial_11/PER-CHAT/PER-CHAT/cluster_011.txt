1. its nice to here all those things . i could give you one advice for creating memes dough . have you heard of meme generator before ? its a mobile app for free with all sorts of meme templates and lots of customizability . the great thing is if you are not home you still can make a meme on the go ! that is atleast what i always do and i can ' t recommend it enough . still thanks for all the support dough , it has been kinda hard making memes lately because i have a sorta writers block . you may have noticed that i upload daily which i dont recommend . so its always nice to hear nice things like that
