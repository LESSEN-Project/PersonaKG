3. we can both agree on that bro idk why i know x has his own style and i fucking love that but for some reason it reminded me of eminem  s mockingbird or kim or hopsins ill mind in the sense that it  s very minimalistic but it tells a story and i fucked with it so heavy because of that . there isn  t a lot going on but you feel that emotion you feel the message

4. if it ' s something you deal with daily , you just do it everyday until it seems like part of your routine and you kind of forget how horrible it seems

9. people " bitch " about it because of situations like in this clip . that guy was in a charge for less than a half  second , was sprinting a different direction than the one he was charging , and still got the instant kill . fundamentally , he should be doing no more damage than shanking a guy with a knife under these circumstances  his bayonet charge is missing the " charge " portion . the main balancing mechanic behind the charge is the windup time and the sound of someone charging , but both of those are obsolete in a situation where you can just enter the charge state at the last possible moment and instantly kill someone .

15. go and be supportive . say nothing that would be upsetting to them . that ' s what friends do . a funeral is not the time or place for you to express your views . it ' s not about you in the least .

19. you don ' t have to stay in that job if you hate it . there are other jobs out there that you ' re way better at , and will actually enjoy going to . you ' re not as trapped in your job as you think you are  and things will get better .

20. nah . old people are notorious for speaking their minds , as are iranians in my experience , and there ' s even a chance the neighbour was just venting frustrations on you about their own children they don ' t see . you work a lot and still made time to go see your parents who live a few hours away , your not a bad son by any means well , no means relevant to the story anyways . and had clearly reached a breaking point for strangers bullshit . the neighbour obviously shouldn ' t have said anything that confrontational but realistically probably had no idea that western culture frown upon chastising strangers .
