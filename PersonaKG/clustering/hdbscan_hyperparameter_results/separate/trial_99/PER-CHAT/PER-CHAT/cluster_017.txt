9. yeah , they could have swapped these amateur  oriented modes " effects " and " scene " for u3 and u4 . they messed this up on the d7100 by putting " effects " between u1  u2 and m  a  s  p and i still like the d7000 ' s approach on this for the same reason  on this type of camera , they could easily go with m  a  s  p , u1  u2  u3 and nothing more . if the d750 could go up to , say , digit fps with a grip and if it had an adequate buffer depth , it would be something of an upgrade from the d700 . i agree it could be named d650 , because the d6xx could have more serious af in the first place . if i was soon going for an fx body , i ' d gladly pay the price of the digit for a d750 without these things that are crippling it .
