6. i don ' t like anyone bagging my groceries for me , just the way i am . so when i see someone coming to bag it for me at the self check out , i turn them away . many times it is someone who is mentally challenged , probably often times i didn ' t even notice . either way , i don ' t want to be rude . i don ' t want them to think because of their disability i don ' t want them handling my food . so i say , " oh , no thank you . it ' s going to two different places " so they figure i need to pack it a certain way .

8. i googled peekers advantage csgo on google , that video and that beginners guide were the only things that really suggeted peekers advantage . in a few other pages some casual people were discussing whether it was a thing . the only argument was latency and interp . there was nothing else . that youtuber whose video you shared only has 70k subscribers . he is not even famous or something . you clearly dont know csgo . there are waaay more famous and way better people . if you knew what you were talking about you would have given a more reliable source . there are numerous youtubers with hundreds of thousands of subscribers as well as many csgo pros . none of them i have watched ever mentioned peekers advantage . i havent even heard once in all those streams i have watched . i didnt even know the term before playing r6s , as a person who followed many of those youtubers and pros . sorry buddy . peekers advantage is a cancer of r6b . we dont have it in csgo . its only theoretical and practically inexistent with all those low latencies and high framerates . judging by the ratings of the comments in our conversation , this r6s community must be so pathetic . csgo is notoriously ct  sided , which means if you hold your angles properly , the defender wins most of the times . dont talk about things you have no idea about .

9. buildings going up in the urban areas , but some still stalled that were started when you were last here . fancy hotel district in saigon is being gutted as they actually begin digging for the rail  subway project . kids left and right have digital devices and are online , and dropping international pop  culture references and awareness of the world beyond the borders not much , but a positive move . , the government is in the middle of a strange immigration crack down , making visas and work permits a pain even for those who ' ve been here , contractually employed for years , anti  china sentiment still exists from the oil rig fiasco , and finally , the fucking phenomenon of the " beer club . a " beer club " is pretty much a hybrid of a bar and a disco , and they are really popular now , springing up every other day , it seems . it seems to be more socially acceptable to go to a " beer club " than a bar or club , though it is pretty much the exact same thing . but people are going , dancing , drinking , etc . despite my confusion with regards to the nomenclature , i ' ll take any embrace of nightlife as a good move in these parts . source  have been here since the last time you were , living in a few different cities .

19. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
