1. i nominate bird box as tribute . never has something that  s been so shoved down my throat  oh my gosh youd love it !   scariest movie ever !  disapointed me so hard . how did they get so many a  b listers on this mediocre film ? the dialogue was meh , they never showed the monsters which , you can do that . if your suspense is really good which this wasn  t . and that ass pull character growth where it took this woman five years to love these kids through flashbacks was lazy writing ! . but maybe i  m just jealous , cuz netflix hasn  t touched my psychological thrillers .

10. man , i feel you , i prefer watching the anime too . i ' ve found out the hard way . if you search anything up about naruto , you are guaranteed to get spoilers . generally avoid discussion videos bc they dip into manga territory . this subreddit ' s rules are pretty good with spoilers , just avoid anything tagged with spoilers .

16. if your family barges in your room out of rudeness or to make shure you aren ' t doing anything , then i have the solution for you . hentai , but the weird stuff that you only jack off to when your really really horny . pull that up and your pants down then go to work on your mighty maul . when your family member barges in without knocking , look them in the eyes and yell at them to stop watching you masterbate maybe a good " this isn ' t alabama ! stop standing their ! " . bonus points if you nut while there still there . masterbating is a completely normal thing that everyone does , but it ' s not normal to watch your fam do it . so it ' s really effective at getting them to knock . and if they take off your door , then do it without headphones so that they can hear and when they complain , comment on how they " want to watch so might as well help them hear it too "
