1. hell yeah ! preach ! just one correction tho  transgenderism isn ' t the right word . it ' s just " being transgender " . the term has a lot of baggage from people using it as a slur so for the most part we avoid using it unless joking about people being dick .

3. that ' s what i wonder . it seems that so many people in power are bad people , and i wonder if that was their end game from the beginning or if they started with good intentions

5. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .

   (ID: 2a3f07a52e2fc5e79fd2ed52f4f601fa39ebe2e4)

13. i am inclined to agree with most of what you said , and i ' ll look at the studies , but i suppose it ' s partially what i was trying to say , no drugs are safe , legal or illegal , if done wrong . i tend to indiscriminately tell people not to do the illegal ones though , since they can destroy your life , in fact it can have nothing to do with the drug and everything to do with the social situations illegal drugs tend to put people in . though i ' m sure you know that much too .
   (ID: 6ea82786a74ccdc85dc1fddd809a575aa4e4efcf)

14. we as humans like to apply black and white labels to everything . there is nothing wrong with emotions . there are things wrong with what people do with them or how we feed them
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

15. why people get all emotional over the death of some total stranger on the news or whatever . there are a lot of things about people that still confuse me .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

16. i ' m fresh out of high school , and i hated when people would do this . or brag about how they only smoke the ' good ' weed . granted i know there is a difference between mid grade weed and high grade , just shut the fuck up and smoke it . it ' s pot , it ' s going to get you high regardless . why do people feel the need to brag about such things ? shouldn ' t weed unite us ?
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

17. when i for some reason or another , i or someone else makes stupid mistake or such say " humans are stupid " most people take it as offense  they don ' t realize i am human too and i have to explain it , always , to them .
   (ID: e57ef54aa6b4e23fcfbf5b034403be21a86f9700)

18. i  m not a bootlicker , i just have mad respect for the people that risk their lives to keep my county safe . i see the sacrifice that these people make for my country and i give them the recognition that they deserve . my grandfathers were in the military and they always told me to show respect to those who risked and gave their lives for my country , i guess it carries on
   (ID: 93c3b3d523de0afd404d3bcb4acdf023866f9281)
