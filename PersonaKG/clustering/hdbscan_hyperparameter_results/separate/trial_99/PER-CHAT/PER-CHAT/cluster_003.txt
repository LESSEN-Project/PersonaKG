1. when you load up one of them , there ' s a setting that says " position " . you just have to change the value and it should move .

2. if they understand everything else i said , then they understand the last part too , they ' re just in denial .

3. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path

4. in my limited experience  it ' s best to set boundaries clearly , but one issue at a time . you walking up to her mother and saying " you need to back off " immediately sets you up as the adversary trying to cut her off from her baby girl in the most important time . you ' ll be treated that way from that point forward . instead , you need to talk about the individual things with your wife so you have an agreed stance the next time they come up with your mil . it ' s way less likely to lead to war if you can hold your wife ' s hand and speak up for her saying ' we ' ve decided it ' s best if it ' s just us and the medical staff in the delivery room ' , ' we ' ve done the research and want to do x ' , etc . than if you go in by yourself and try to lay down the law to a mother about her child . you can be the one to make the statements , but they need to be phrased as joint decisions with your wife ' s clear if silent support . if your wife doesn ' t want to have those conversations alone alone , that ' s fine . her part becomes to deflect , i . e . " we ' ll talk about it next time we see you " , or just not respond when the mil isolates her on an issue . her backtracking or bargaining alone will kill any progress you make by standing strong together . talk to her about that , too . also , congrats and good luck !

5. but why would he need just one ?
   (ID: 77a6bff8693a174b55d34fc32fdd8a87710fecb7)

6. my opinion is that trump is doing nothing to prevent it . he ' s just kinda pushing them over the edge more and more .
   (ID: 9e778023eda5589ac577e3789edfd900d208edf7)

7. lmao , yeah i ' m not racist , but fuck africa . just get rid of it , it ' s not needed !
   (ID: e807b18e05d35f02282740d90e8c63546558b267)

8. and it ' s just monitoring his heart rate
   (ID: 41d66f92509db20d202cca3f348509c6cd25586b)

9. see now you are just trying to bait me into political arguments . i ' m not biting . i will not be commenting on comparisons to school shooters , real  world terrorism , etc . it is insensitive and unfair downplay the severity of these actions so much that you can compare them to a tv series . these are real lives being effected not just characters on a show .
   (ID: a22b82fe301caa42c89cbd71b2e3733753f695d9)

10. at all , it just teaches them to accept violence as an answer
   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

11. and what if those kids families were killed in the wars they now serve and the only thing they can do to survive is to take up arms . not justifying just saying
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

12. i am using the word can as a verb the second definition of being permitted to do something . now i was using it in the way to ask someone to allow me to do something and not the first definition of can . so please read a dictionary and come back to me when you have educated yourself . or just say , " you ' re an idiot "
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

13. it ' s not really faking it though . you ' re just putting the diagnosis out of your mind . you ' re temporarily living your life as a regular person that just does stuff differently . it ' s just a mindset change to help you better become aware of your actions that are excusable by your asperger ' s and those that are not .
   (ID: df5213e759ef279850d575577da3967d8f71679c)

14. just give it back to them
   (ID: f0cc6658fb97955562b5f1b7845c6141dd2eefdf)

15. im liberal and i dont bealive that solution for europe is just to welcome more and more refugees . we have to cure the cause not the consequences . i also bealive in death penalty . a serial killer is just a burden for a society .

16. admitting there is a problem is hard . fixing it even harder . your kids are likely in school full time . perhaps there is a way that you can find an after school program instead of a daycare . or , a dayhome . an hour or two in the afternoons probably won ' t affect your children negatively as a they are more connected to you by this age and can identify right from wrong and tell you , and b an after school program is guided by professional people and c less costly than full time care . i am a mom to a half day kindergartener digit and a digit mornings a week preschooler digit . i would need to find evening or weekend work to save myself from childcare costs being enormous , so i choose to wait until they are schooled full time . do you have any flexibility with your job ? perhaps you could drop off and pick up and return to work if necessary when she returns home . i ' m getting off track . i can ' t think of anything you ' re doing that isn ' t gentle , kind or thoughtful and coming from a place of love . i know my husband works long hours for our benefit and i appreciate the hell out of him for it . you are a good person and it sounds like she does need help in the form of a doctor or counselling for ppd . just keep coming from a place of love when you tell her you miss your partner in crime and that you want her to be happy , and all that growing old together stuff . i would beg and plead with my husband to come to counselling with me if i thought he needed it , but if that ' s likely to make her angry i just don ' t know . maybe if you guys are close with her family you can discreetly discuss with a trusted family member that you are worried . maybe they are worried too .

17. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

18. if you just kind of brushed him off at first or just nervously laughed you ' re kind of screwed . he thinks he ' s " wearing you down " at this point . just tell him no and do not explain why . just say no . if he doesn ' t get the message , it may be time to talk to your supervisor about it .
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

19. i know someone said this already but i ' m saying it again because it got lost and i couldn ' t second it  if your parents ditch your wedding and your own father leaves you to walk down the aisle alone never speak to them again . never let them meet your children . ever ! all the other advice about talking to your parents ahead of time is good but what comes after they make their decision is just as important . i wish you the best of luck in this and the best on your wedding day , which should be solely about you and your fiance . how many days in your whole life are solely about you ? this one day . you absolutely deserve to have everything be just the way you want on your day .

20. just gonna throw this out there but i think the older brother is gonna be ippos first pro opponent , cant remember his name but its the one who quit and got fat  they just look similar imo , have similarly aggressive personalities and overconfidence in their under trained fighting strength , its just a feeling .
