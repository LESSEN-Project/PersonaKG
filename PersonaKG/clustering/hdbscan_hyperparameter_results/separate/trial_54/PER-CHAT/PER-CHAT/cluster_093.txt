1. it ' s just crazy rng . if it was a mode where it was bo2 round wise and you got all your health back after each game then it ' d be a lot more reasonable to beat . but asking players to fight digit  digit fighters that can pop off out of nowhere since they ' re a npc and can just decide when to tech every grab and aa any jump in is just ass . it doesn ' t help that you have to watch your character do his little dance every time you ko someone . you have to do digit fights and that ' s a solid digit minutes of just sitting there waiting for loading . hell , i ' d accept the game mode as is if they just made check points for hard and extreme . have it be a random drop like the current buffs and things but make it cost double the cost of a full restore or something like that and it can only be used once . i ' m thinking of this digit ways . one is where say you get to round digit  digit and you buy the check point . if you get to round digit and lose you just go back to round digit where you bought it , like you ' re setting down a marker . or when you buy one it just lets to do the fight again if you lose but you can ' t stack retries .

2. main character wise they are standalones , but world lore wise they are heavily linked , specially digit and inquistion . i would hold on playing dai and start with origins . i differ from the general consensus and actually like da2 a lot and think dai is just an ok game aside from the tresspasser dlc , which is phenomenal

3. just make a new character ! that  s part of the game ! learning and trying new builds ! just re  level another character ! it  s endless excuses over at that community when the fact of the matter is  the game is complicated for the sake of being complicated . plus , the story  theme  tone is nothing great like diablo digit and digit were . poe is not a valid replacement for diablo in my eyes .

4. no . it  s just idiots like you that ruin the game . go play rainbow digit and be toxic there

5. the first time i played runescape i was a total noob i knew nothing about the game at all and i was rather young i was atrocious at the game and i remember sitting at the castle that i cant remember the name of when a dude came up and offered to teach me the game he was so patient it took me like digit minutes to do something rather simple and he was just so patient to this day i wish i knew who that mystery man was we played for like digit  digit hours and he helped me all the way and was rather patient .
