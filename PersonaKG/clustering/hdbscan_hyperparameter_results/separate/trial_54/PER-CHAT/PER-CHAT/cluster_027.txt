1. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .

4. if you don  t enjoy it and find no meaning from it at all from reading the book twice , then why are you attempting to force yourself to enjoy it through people who did ? if you didn  t like it then that should be the end of it , no ?

5. that ' s honestly worse to me . none of the dozen people in the household noticed the kid was gone , or if they did none of them said anything . usually in big families the older kids are at least partially talked with watching the younger ones . several people dropped the ball .

7. i digit  agree , confidence is everything ! many times people didn  t realize how short i actually am hell , some didn  t realize i was shorter than them sometimes because i did the same made it a non  issue and where i lacked  i made up as well . the more you don  t care or act like you don  t care , the more other people will take the same attitude . i admire your attitude bro !

8. i enjoyed the 90s way too much . i just downloaded music from the radio to my tape deck . i had e  mail , but the only people i would mail with were the people i met on vacation . i had a mobile phone , but it wasn ' t that important . i would get a text or a call in the weekends from friends asking to hang out . you could still do stupid stuff without being worried you ' d get yourself filmed . we did a lot of drugs . it was such a great decade !

9. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?
