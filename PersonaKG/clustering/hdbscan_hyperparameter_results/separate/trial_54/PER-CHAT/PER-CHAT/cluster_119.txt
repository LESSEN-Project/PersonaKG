1. i have the mentality of " well i don ' t like myself so why would other people like me . this just makes me push people away . the few people that i feel comfortable talking to always remain aquaintances .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

2. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .

3. don  t they hate white people or something ? or is that just if we try to immigrate there

4. that ' s the problem . they shouldn ' t be yours . the system would be far more fair to all styles of play if collecting the oro from the kill of another simply removed it instead of giving you points . i know for a fact that you are against players joining your server just to hide or not actually participate in battle for the sake of making it through the event . in my opinion , spamming movement techs , not actually killing anybody , and only stealing oro is just as destructive to the point of " pvp " as sitting there hiding or feeding oro . rewarding people for doing so is a bad idea , and it ' s part of the reason people continue to complain about pvp and treat it like garbage . there ' s a reason i used the word " relatively . there ' s a mile of difference between hitting a fast  moving , erratic target with a bullet  projectile and simply swinging a melee weapon in proximity to them . whether or not i fall under the definition of your pretentious jargon is irrelevant . thanks for the clip , but it completely misses the point of what i ' m talking about . there ' s a reason oro theft is a popular complaint .

5. harassment is indeed illegal . just wanted to point out that we shouldn ' t hate on people who simply states their dislike of the lgbtq community , as that is what homophobes wants us to do so they can have an excuse to harass us .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

6. i think they ' re just not putting up with people ' s shit anymore . at this point it ' s like " i am who i am some fuck you if you don ' t like it ! " they just people to stop treating them like shit for it .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

7. it probably is fake . there  s thousands of people on this app . he  s claiming something that is pretty extraordinary . if e can  t provide even a piece of evidence or a hint then i won  t give him the benefit of the doubt . that  s just me though

9. misophonia is a serious disorder . if you file for divorce , you might be on the wrong end though . seeing a psychologist might be more beneficial . what about all the other people you hear eating ? or maybe she was just absurdly loud ? who knows .
   (ID: 5bb6e2d4db1d5ccf3a1f430564735551dfb4c28b)

10. i understand intersex . i get transgender . you wanna be the opposite of what you are . you identify with being the other sex . i ' m talking about people who claim they are neither . no , you were born with a vagina or a dick . you can ' t be neither just because you fucking feel like it .
   (ID: 8285a776fd60b145ed2afc145cdf2b926b93ed8b)

11. men are just mad that they  re being asked to be better people . if the ad doesn  t apply to you , there  s no reason to get mad at it . if you  re getting angry at it , you  re probably a part of the population gillette has asked to be better .
   (ID: 12803a9aad224d0537b68ab83a6cdc6a45d3160f)

12. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

13. when people touch your stuff . it happens too often that people just pick up my backpack and throw it on my lab instead of asking to free the seat next to me . and for some reason its always women who do that , guys always ask
