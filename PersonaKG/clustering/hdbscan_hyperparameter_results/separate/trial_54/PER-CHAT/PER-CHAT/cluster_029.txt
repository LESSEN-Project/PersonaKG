Total from this dataset: 16

1. i ' m going to assume that you , as a police force , have limited resources , and you can ' t possibly investigate every reference to some crazy thing in art . so , if that ' s the case , how do you choose what to investigate ? are you investigating rappers because you think they ' re more likely to be involved in crime ? that could be racist and prejudiced . if you ' re investigating rappers why haven ' t you investigated carrie underwood for " before he cheats " ? start to see why it might be a civil liberties issue ?

3. if done right , a collection of vignettes can be incredibly engaging . suttree by cormac mccarthy is a prime example of this , or steinbeck ' s cannery row . one of the things that makes it doable is how the vignettes tap into the reader ' s humanity  there is something they can connect with . i think it ' s a cool idea . who cares if it ' s the in thing right now .

6. kim kardashian . i dont think she has said or done anything to hate her . i think that her family have a succesfull business and know how to manage it and i never saw them make a scandal appart from kim ' s sextape . the only annoying thing is how much attention they get but thats thanks to media and people bitching for why are they famous every single day .

11. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?

   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

14. i think it ' s a manners thing ? i mean , if you are in the company of others older generation . checking your phone could seem rude . but to them , reading a book in that situation could be too . i think it comes down to being aware of the situation you are in .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

15. the only thing i ' m scared about is my parents taking me to the hospital for my thoughts but after reading this has made me think " isn ' t it better for someone to take you there for thoughts rather than an attempt .
