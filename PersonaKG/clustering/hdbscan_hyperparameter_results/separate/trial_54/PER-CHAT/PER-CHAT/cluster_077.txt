1. pretty much all the time but it quickly turns to dysphoria and depression . i tend to find its more about who they are , how they carry themselves , what they wear , especially if its something i can identify with , rather then whether i feel there pretty .

2. fucking up happens . its okay  if you learn something from it . why not try drawing on yourself instead any time you feel like that ? keep drawing even if it takes up a whole leg or arm . i recommend crayola .

3. nta but you might regret missing out on that special time with your loved ones later on in the future when it may not be possible anymore  and avoiding a chewing noise might not feel worth it .

4. i never feel like i was born in wrong time period . i feel like this was  is the best time to be born . coming decades are gonna be the turning point in human civilization , wither we are destined to become rulers of the universe or vanish without a trace . everything will depend on the decisions we make , as a species and some luck . we get front seat to witness it all . what better time to be alive ? who cares if no one liked your fb post . winking  face
