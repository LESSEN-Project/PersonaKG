1. think about the positives in life . well our lives are pain and suffering
   (ID: 726c36ce13fa631676ed5053f62b0f5f7b61eb5e)

2. the planet or just life on it ? i think it would be cool if we explored to other planets and earth became obsolete .

3. that ' s just statistics at work . if you have ever even glanced at the numbers to see how many planets are around how many stars around how many galaxies then the idea of any single phenomenon occurring once and only once becomes so unlikely it ' s borderline insane not to think there is life out there .

4. doesn ' t the hypothetical intruder think that about you ? why should they be allowed to take your life ? will you not defend yourself ?

5. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
