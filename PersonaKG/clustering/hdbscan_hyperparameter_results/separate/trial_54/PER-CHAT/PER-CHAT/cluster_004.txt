1. i am the first in my family to go to college . i did ok but should have done much better . my dad worked to pay off my school through a small business he started . he paid until junior year when he got cancer . at that point i got loans . i came out of school with about  19k in debt . not bad but not zero . that seems like a small amount of debt but i hustled for digit years throwing everything extra i had at it . then i got married . i hated that i brought that burden on my wife . you never know what may be coming . will your car break down ? will you get  keep a job ? will you have tremendous medical needs ? you can get hit by a bus like anyone else . my advice is this . go to community college and get an associates degree as cheaply as possible . then go to college for your bachelors degree in a field you like may not love and that has some demand . if you do that you  ll never worry about a job . good luck

3. that ' s a good theory , but i wouldn ' t discount him overpowering her so easily . i ' m not a small girl , but when i was sexually assaulted by a drunk man who was over digit years old and smaller than me i was barely able to fight him off . if i ' d been as drunk as kristin smart apparently was that night , i have no doubt that it would have been a rape i experienced rather than an attempted rape . it happened in the middle of a sunday afternoon , in a residential area and no one heard a thing , or if they did they didn ' t do anything about it . it ' s a hell of a lot easier to overpower a woman than we ' d like to think .

4. do you realize what day and age this is ? did you just get from , like , digit years in the future , where it ' s some utopia , and you ' re surprised that this sort of thing doesn ' t get the attention and reform it deserves , or something ? yes . we call the future europe .  if you disagree , we ' re literally going to have to break down the semantics of " intent " so that you can understand . yes , i do disagree . let ' s break down the semantics of intent . according to the oxford dictionary , " intent " means intention or purpose . purpose in turn is " a particular requirement or consideration , typically one that is temporary or restricted in scope or extent  " i think that fits rather well .

5. i worked like this for a while digit years or so , and liked it . bosses understood we had to have breaks every now and then and we did when we wanted to . i do not think it ' s too bad , each brick  thing moved being less than digit kg and you can do the work how you like , it was more freedom than in most of my it work most bosses didn ' t know what they were talking about . so basically , i didn ' t see negatives  you got   from bosses for doing " hard work and not complaining " is good in any later work you like  apply . if you don ' t get decent wages then that ' s a different issue altogether .
