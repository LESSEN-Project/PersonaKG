SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:

Total from this dataset: 7

1. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !

2. that just leaves the rule of thirds , it may also help to do a quick google for photography rules and  or tips . honestly , i was just trying to find a suggestion for you because you asked , the picture looks good

3. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !

4. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .

5. i wish you could meet my cat , buuuut . learn more about them and what their body language means . understanding them helps a lot . and just keep an open mind over all , good luck !

6. ooh good point . just because something or someone has left you , there is still the emotional trauma left behind . i have no idea what that trauma would amount to when it comes to an extra sliver of someone else ' s evil soul inside another .

7. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .
