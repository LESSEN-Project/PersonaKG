3. amlo is just another stooge that protects and propagates the interests of transnational capital . he provides cover and a nice veneer while the capitalists go in and loot the natural resources , markets and labor of the country . much in the style of an obama or trudeau . i have no idea why you think anyone would care what time the asshole wakes up at and why you find this at all admirable . it ' s funny you would leave out the chavistas and maduro . why do you have such little political imagination ? why do you think your liberal tendencies are at all permissible in this sub ? are you another one of these white latin american men that has no problem stomping on the rights of indigenous peoples so long as capital accumulation processes can go on unabated ?
