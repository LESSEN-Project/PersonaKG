4. making cute comments about parenting . or the men i know who are currently trying to pursue me , always talk about how much they love kids , want kids , want me and my child in their life . its like music to my ears but unfortunately for them , i ' m just not wanting a relationship at the moment .

6. i always wondered why people like you feel the need to be dicks on the internet . is it because in real life you  re pushovers who don  t know how to earn respect or stand up for your selves ? is this your outlet ?

10. wow thank you so much . genuinely it ' s hard to tell over technology . while i live in canada i might call that number and if that doesn ' t work i might take it to a local tech repair shop . thank you so much and i ' ll be sure to tell you what happens in the near futre . well i ' m digit years old so i might be grounded but i ' ll try

12. well . i ' m honestly more upset that instead of getting new movie trailers during movies biggest night of the year we get digit fucking walmart commercials . like seriously behind the scenes people can only effort walmart clothes ?

13. because if you ' re booking it that close to the date you probably really want or need to go , so you kind of bend over and they fuck you . if they tried to fuck you sooner you might be able to travel another way .

14. yeah , he had a digit revolver i think , and a shotgun . police also found bombs in the area . people said this kid got bullied quite often and even by the coaches so he did it out of anger . the shooter also said he didn  t shoot anyone he liked .

15. even though felix constantly gets targeted by vox , wsj , and other mainstream media , he doesn  t let that effect him , he just ignores it since the articles aren  t true . he doesn  t do what makes us happy , he does what makes him happy . he helped some smaller channels get popular . so felix is truly a kind and caring youtuber

16. thank you , i just find it to be quite logical honestly . checking yourself in the best way you know will work to see if it ' s worth the wait , if your results were different emotionally you would know not to waste your and your so ' s time , which is better than starting the official relationship just for you to find out you don ' t really love her , now that ' s fucked up . goodluck with whatever you decide !

17. that is a deeply reductive line of thought . i don ' t deny the fact that sex is fun . but we live in an age where we no longer have to be slave to our primal impulses . have you read about maslow ' s hierarchy of needs ? you ' re stuck on the lowest level . your biological duty , as you put it , is to procreate , yes . then what ? what is the point of just fucking around if you have no other reason to live ? take it from me , living a shallow existence like that is incredibly unsatisfying .

18. people lying to you about how great they are and how deep and full of significance and meaning their life is . nobody cares about how your grandmother grew tomatoes instilling your love of fresh produce , or how your mother ' s use of seasonings opened up your senses , or your soccer coach touching you filled you with a love of sausage . i just could not remember if i needed digit tbs or digit of flower for a basic roux . please put the recipe at the top and your poorly written life story at the bottom so i can choose to not read with out being annoyed by having to scroll through it .
