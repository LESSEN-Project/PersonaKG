4. wouldn  t the accounts receivable of banks be completely thrown off though ? the banks would simply be wrecked financially and the federal reserve requirement eventually . someone would make money off of the hedging the risk but i would think that ultimately banks would lose millions if not billions in accounts receivable . hell if it actually happened i don  t think the us would have serious consequences . i think it could happen if everyone started to default on there loans alone .

5. i apreciate that you think my art is worth stealing but i really don ' t mind . i don ' t make art for the clout , i do it to practice and get better . it ' s only one drawing , i can easily make another .

6. to be fair , i doubt most of us would be here if we didn ' t trust him , but i don ' t think any of us can make up your mind for you . read about him , watch videos of him and decide for yourself if he deserves your trust .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

7. then why didn ' t he make it a commandment ? i don ' t even believe in him so why should i care what he thinks ?

9. no but i still keep my stance if the money is there . pay me . everybody is different , they have their own thoughts and ideas . if i don ' t do it somebody else will . why shouldn ' t i make that money if i ' m perfectly able to ? it ' s a job . that ' s all . now if it ' s universally immoral then we may have an issue . i ' m not gonna be the spokesperson for human trafficking . with that same thought process though if your thoughts and ideas don ' t allow you to think like that then that particular job isn ' t for you .
   (ID: 7cece6bbdf487f99b6d494ab790bde8e66ce8966)

10. i don ' t think there is any conspiracy in what physically happened . there will always be some uncertainty based on the confusion , unreliable eye witnesses , and the fact that any evidence was damaged . as for the political aspects of it . i think there is more to the motive behind things than most people know . i don ' t think the us planned it or staged it , or anything like that , but i do think that it was a retaliation for things that the us had been involved with overseas . we provide a lot of military assistance under the claims of helping people defend themselves , but from the perspective of the other side , we are throwing money at one side of a foreign conflict to make sure that the side that would benefit us more is the side that wins , and that is bound to anger the side who doesn ' t get our military aid
