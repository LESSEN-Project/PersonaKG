1. very good point , didn ' t think about that aspect . but the fact that op started with " being in la " makes me think it ' s for social media purposes .

2. as someone else said , you need to go with it . two ways to do it  have a comeback . you said you ' re not good at it , but keep trying to think of some even after the fact . if they ' re falling into patterns with what they ' re saying , you should be able to use one of those . build off one of their digs and take what they said one step further . part of this might all be part of being low man on the totem pole , but you want to show you have some edge so you ' re not always that guy . good luck op .
