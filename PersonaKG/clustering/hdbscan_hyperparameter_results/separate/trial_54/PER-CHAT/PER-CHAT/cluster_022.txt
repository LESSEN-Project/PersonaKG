SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:

Total from this dataset: 9

1. keep rei and kill asuka . i never really got why that bitch backstory apeared , like , she lost her mom so shes a bitch to everyone for no reason . and they thought it would be understandable . if you want to make a backstory to some jerk , then you should make the character with a frustrating backstory involving violence towards them , so it would be easyer to understand why they want to treat the world like shit . but nooo they make the worst character the less understandable backstory . tldr  asuka  bitch with no understandable backstory . rei best girl .

2. i would never want to measure it because i don ' t want to be either sad or happy about it since making me sad is giving me insecurities about my body and happy might make me cocky no pun intended about it . i am happy with it and it gets the job done well .

4. yta , sorry to burst your bubble , but you can ' t make someone do anything to you . if she doesn ' t want to have sex , she doesn ' t . and making her give you a bj just fucked it up even more .
