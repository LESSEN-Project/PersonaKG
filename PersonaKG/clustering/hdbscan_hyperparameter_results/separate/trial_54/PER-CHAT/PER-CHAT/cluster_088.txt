1. why would you want to hide your personality ? i see it as expressing your true self to people , because i have been liying to people for too long . on the other hand there is the argument that , well accourse it ' s just a hobby and that people shouldn ' t care what hobbies you have , but lets be honest , who ' s personality hasn ' t changed because of the fandom ?

2. it was mostly just talk , and they acted like they were showing what the people want , even though a lot of people wanted pewdiepie to be in it , or the whole jake paul suicide forest ordeal .

5. i see . i feel people want others to exercise to conform to their standards using health and physique as a dumb excuse rather then caring about someone being happy . ofcourse it is different when someone is obese but you get the message . also , many sports are boring and gyms are full of toxic shits anyway .

6. i want all the sex with all the people and im cool with however they want ti do it . i use to get a lot of it , its one of the worst parts about leaving the world and starting my own society of one where nobody judges you or takes all your stuff and makes you homeless .

7. well the easy solution is for everyone to not be obsessed with having as much sex as they can get . to treat it with the proper care and attention it deserves . sex is designed by god or nature you pick to produce a child . if you cannot take care of a child or afford the mean to have sex without producing a child then you should not be having sex . an analogy would be like having a credit card . if you cannot purchase something with the card and have the money to pay it off then you should not be buying it . of course that would be impossible to implement because more and more people do whatever they want to do with little to no thought of the larger community

8. when people ask me to do this , i explain the coupons are based on what you purchase , so there is no store card . they can sign up for their own if they want . end of story .

9. apparently i am the one who needs to grow a backbone , when everyone here can ' t cope with someone not giving them what they want . honestly , some people .

10. i use this subreddit for fun . this topic wasn ' t marked serious . if people want to overanalyze a comment , that ' s up to them .

11. makes me wonder why those people never injure themselves on purpose . it ' s a doctor ' s job to fix them . why would they want to take that opportunity from them ?

12. we can go outside and still not talk to people . remaining " quiet and invisible " while socialising gives us time to observe people . for me , that makes it easier to see if we ' d have anything in common and so be able to have a proper conversation . having lots of inconsequential small talk with numerous people is very tiring for me . i want a conversation that stimulates my brain .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

13. because being with someone shows that you ' re desirable . people see that somebody else wants you , so they want you .
