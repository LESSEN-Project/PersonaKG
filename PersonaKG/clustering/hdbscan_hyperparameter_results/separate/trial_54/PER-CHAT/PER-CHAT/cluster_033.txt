1. thanks for explaining . i can understand employees wanting to get paid for the work they ' re doing , but that seems like a really harsh punishment for just a minute or two of time .

2. it really is the best bet . and it really is relieving . i struggled with my sexuality for a long time until i realized that i really am pan . sometimes i  d be like , no i  m gay . others it  s , no i  m straight . then there  s the  am i bi ?  but then i was really into this trans dude so my sexuality was all over the place . i gave myself a few years to figure it out , i dated a couple people to see what it was like and i still talk to most of my ex  s , but after a while i now know what i am . i hope you find out who you are too grinning  face  with  smiling  eyes

4. i  ll do my best if i  m honest , it wasn  t exciting , it felt horrible and annoying . she was a friend and i trusted her with some stuff , not everything but somethings and everything turned around quickly enough to give someone whiplash true and thanks for the relationship advice . really , you seem like you know what you  re talking about what i can  t get over is that someone told me something really similar to that on thanksgiving . it was weird he just out of the blue said  if i could go back in time i  d change my major to motorcycle repair , they charge a lot of money to get those fixed . if not that then some other trade
