5. so you keep telling me , i must have really made you angry with my opinion . didn ' t know it would shake you so badly . at the point you just parrot what i say while putting crying emojis in it i would really call it a conversation .

6. i don ' t really have anything to say , but you ' ve put a smile on your face for having personal responsibility . i can ' t sympathize with the ' previously religious ' part , but for the rest , you ' re not alone . being responsible for your own actions sucks sometimes .
