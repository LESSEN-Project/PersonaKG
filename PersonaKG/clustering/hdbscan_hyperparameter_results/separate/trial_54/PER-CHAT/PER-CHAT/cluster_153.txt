14. i wonder why that is . it couldn ' t possibly be because men are conditioned to keep their emotions all bottled up and also that they ' re conditioned to be more violent than women so when they do act out they tend choose more violent means of suicide the fact that women attempt suicide more than men kind of proves this  if we attempt suicide more often than men , why do we actually die in fewer numbers ? hmm it sure is a conundrum .
