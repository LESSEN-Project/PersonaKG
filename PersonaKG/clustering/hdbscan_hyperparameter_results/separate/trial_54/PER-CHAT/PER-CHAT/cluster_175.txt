2. ah yes , the worldwide  feared british nukes would totally scare russia into submission , it ' s not like russia has c  300s that are proven to be capable of stopping nato ' s balistic missiles or anything like that . also , if russia were to produce just one more tsar bomba  class nuke and drop it on top of the british isles , the uk is gone and so is ireland , the northern part of france , the benelux and possibly parts of nothwestern germany .
