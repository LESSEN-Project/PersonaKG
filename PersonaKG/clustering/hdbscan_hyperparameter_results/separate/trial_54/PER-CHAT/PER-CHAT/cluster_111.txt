2. i think it ' s more of a confidence issue for me . if he makes the first move than i know that he likes  wants me rather than me taking the chance and getting rejected . although i have asked out all of my past boyfriends so i don ' t require it .

5. you don ' t see the problem at all . you don ' t know any of the complexities or the implications of the issue , and that ' s why you think copy  pasting your own method would work . how offended would you get if the us told your own government  hey , our economy is the most successful in the world , you should copy it directly . of course you ' d be insulted . you should run your own country to your own circumstances , and we should do the same .  copy pasted from question digit mins ago

8. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !

11. having my underarms touched . i don  t know why , but whenever i think someone is going to touch them or come close to them i freak out and hyperventilate .
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

12. what makes you think i might not already have ? the dt should not be compelled to post the images , fine , but you either do or do not . all it takes is a few seconds to unblur that ridiculous compromise they went for . it makes as much sense as censoring swear words with asterisks and grawlixes , we all know what they are , don ' t treat all of us like children .
