1. digit  . hardly any difference , then just live off the interest and fuck off the rest of my life

2. i think death is a state which alters our consciousness to the same form of life in an other parallel universe . so that we can live better and evolve . inspired from time is a flat circle !

3. of course they " shouldn ' t " thats not the real world its the same as saying ' if everyone was nice there would be world peace ' its just word vomit that means nothing . the punishment would be letting the potential kid live in a fucked up life and you know that .

4. they are the best . they raised with great values and always supported me to do what makes me happy in life even though one of my dreams was to live digit time zones away from them .

5. oh wow someone told you something so you threw years of your life away ? let me guess you didn  t work in this time frame either ! and i  m also guessing you live in a poor area to be in this position , for example i live in a place where you can easily earn  digit  and likely earn  digit plus no degree , no experience with low cost of living . i don  t think this is  something  bad that happened to you  just a result of poor decision making . luck plays a role , but not a significant one in things like these , and i am in my position in life basically entirely based on luck .
