1. sure do . and then you also risk having someone see that you haven ' t touched that juicy last bite yet and assumes you must not want it . they might try to steal it from you . this causes table fights . but ofc i wouldn ' t be brining no spoon to a knife fight . especially if its my last bites i ' m fighting for smiling  face  with  horns

2. i think ugliejosh makes an excellent point and is not delusional , but rather rational and insightful . if there would ever be a hypothetical pre  revolutionary rupture within the imperial core , however unlikely , sympathetic elements within the u . s military  intelligence apparatus would be crucial for success . i would highly , highly recommend listening to the ' it could happen here ' podcast . it ' s essential listening for leftists of all stripes . also , eyes left is a very well produced leftist military podcast made by two socialist military veterans . there are many military veterans that are well seasoned activists and organizers that have participated in wto , occupy , standing rock , ferguson , etc . are you sure you don ' t want their help in fighting fascism , building dual  power , and maybe one day capturing the state ?

5. it seems rather unlikely that a full  scale war will happen . no one knows for sure of course , but north korea ' s ultimate goal is state survival beyond anything else . the us will respond to any attack with the destruction of the regime , which is something they don ' t want to deal with . the concern is that if the us strikes thousands will die , and we will be left with a major refugee crisis .
