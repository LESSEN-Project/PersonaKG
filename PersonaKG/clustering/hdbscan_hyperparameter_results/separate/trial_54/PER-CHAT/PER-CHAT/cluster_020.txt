   (ID: 5bb6e2d4db1d5ccf3a1f430564735551dfb4c28b)

2. i felt the same way in the past . but maybe the fact there is no objective point is a good think ! you can choose to do something or absolutely nothing .

3. i thought you had to take them all the way off but i guess that makes sense if you can lean back on something or got good balance . never really thought about it .

5. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck
