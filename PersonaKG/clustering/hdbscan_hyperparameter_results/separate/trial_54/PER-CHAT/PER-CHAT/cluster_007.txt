1. while i know mocking gobert for crying leads to a toxic environment , is there not some point here in at least examining why he  s crying ? gobert , reigning defensive player of the year on a team playing great and trending upward , broke down because he didn  t receive an individual honor . specifically , an individual honor that feels more like a popularity contest for an exhibition game . can he not let this past him ? does he really need the validation from a combination of fans , players , and journalists to let him know he is a good athlete ? he  s last year  s dpoy ! on a great young team ! i don  t want to attack the act of crying in itself , but i feel like for me to defend it , i would have to know he  s crying for something that matters . if he cried after getting knocked out of the playoffs , or blowing a digit point lead , i would understand . crying after not receiving an all star bid ? i guess i just don  t get it . if there  s something bigger i  m missing here , please enlighten me , because i really want to understand this better . i just feel like if i was an nba gm or coach , i don  t want my player getting worked up over not receiving an individual honor when i  m focused on winning real games .

3. i don ' t feel like my perception of reality is very off it is that i am way more critical of myself than i would be months ago and some weeks are worse than others to the point i don ' t want to get out of bed . i also don ' t feel like anything triggered it really it just sort of stuck it ' s head out of the blue , i don ' t really know how else to discribe it .

4. i don ' t really feel like he holds me back , but my life isn ' t the way i want it to be living with him . i ' m gonna say the same shit everyone else says , i do love him and i enjoy being with him . but lately it doesn ' t feel the same . he ' s a good person but i feel like i don ' t really like him anymore . maybe it ' s my mindset but i feel like we don ' t have fun or enjoy each other ' s company . but if i leave i know i ' ll miss him and be sad . i ' m not going to go jump on another guys dick .
