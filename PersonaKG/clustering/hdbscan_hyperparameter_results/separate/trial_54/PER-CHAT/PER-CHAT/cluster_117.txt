1. was just looking at shaw ' s performance in the under digit if that ' s any indicator . of course they are wholly different levels but still i feel he deserves a chance

2. then you really are as stupid as i suggested at the outset . they are completely accurate and they are about digit times more useful than your nonsense because they ' re the meat and potatoes and nobody gives a shit if you could add digit tomes of ands , ifs , or buts to them . " meat " is not a complete description of steak and " vegetables " is not a complete description of salad but those are the main points you think of when you see steak or salad on a menu and an adequate description of the difference between them for you to decide you feel like having one a lot more than the other . and all i asked you , was the difference between autism steak and retard salad .

3. like digit how old are you . regardless this is about you . what about yourself makes you feel ugly

4. i feel like ever since digit took over everything halo has severely dropped in quality apparently that includes text on a box which would be so easy to spot and cheap to fix that they just really must not give a shit anymore

5. is there one of these for the extra deck ? sometimes i feel like digit cards is just one to few , and theres so much nuance in deciding how many copies to run in the extra .

6. very interesting ! also interesting that you had a similar experience to mine . dengue fever is very serious . looks like if i ever go back there will need to some immunizations or something first , hey ? i lived there digit years ago . saying that makes me feel old . maybe i am old .
