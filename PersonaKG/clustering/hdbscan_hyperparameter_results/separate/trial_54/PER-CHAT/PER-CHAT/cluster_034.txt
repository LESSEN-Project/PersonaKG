1. i ' m a christian . i believe that jesus preached for us to do things like love , be compassionate , generous , and honest . as such  i believe in evolution and human  caused climate change , because the proof is overwhelming . i believe that being gay is neither evil , nor a choice . god created gay people , just as he created me . he loves them , too . i refuse to believe that god would be so cruel , as to set gay people up for failure . i believe that money and religion cannot mix . either you serve god , or you serve your greed for money . not both . there is no such thing as a racist christian . there are plenty of racists , though , who call themselves christian . if you truly love christ , you love your fellow human , no matter the ethnicity . i sincerely wish that the many cinos christian in name only in the world would recognize their own hypocrisy , and denounce dogma , when it clearly causes suffering , inflames hatred , or requires hefty lying to oneself .

2. well , i love bill burr , and i also think oprah winfrey is a mostly useless gasbag , and i thought the viral ad was retarded . but for the sake of a balanced discussion , i would point out the emotional attachment between mothers and their children . yes , it is more physically demanding to be a crab fisherman in alaska . nobody is disputing that . but i bet if you asked any mother who has lost a child , she would rather pull traps for ten years than go through that again . maybe it ' s possible that the word " difficult " might mean different things to different people ? reddit is usually home to the nitpickiest of nitpickers . i ' m surprised nobody has brought up this point . and now i get downvoted to oblivion .

3. i saw tons of things from reddit that were stolen and put on to other sites and i heard a lot of people talk about it , so i downloaded and fell in love with the app . i ' m probably most active on teenagers

5. yeah i agree , i kinda expected more of a  hows the internets work  kinda stuff , not  let  s laugh at conservatives who were laughing at liberals .  i get it  in the us a lot of grandmas are proper , god fearing conservatives and their email forwards and facebook tags would reflect that . but my grandma still sends me  satan thinks you won  t forward this to three people you love , jesus has faith folded  hands in you  type shit .
