1. so i don ' t have personal experience with this yet , but i have wanted to change my name for about digit years now . i ' m about to finish college and might be moving away soon , so now seems like a pretty good time to go through with it . anyway , to answer your questions  1a as far as i can tell , most places that require a formal change e . g . your job , bank accounts , ect . are able to easily change people ' s names in their system probably because of people changing their name when they get married so that should be fairly straightforward . some places  like banks  may require proof that the name change is legal , but just show them a copy of the deed poll . please note  i live in the uk  the rules might be different where you live . 1b i ' ve found it really helpful to talk to a friend about changing my name . i told a couple of friends , but we ' ve only spoken about it on skype , never face  to  face , but recently i ' ve been talking to one of my friends about it in real life , not online , and it ' s so affirming , if that makes sense . before , i felt like it was all in my head , but having someone to talk to about it and again i emphasise a face  to  face discussion makes it feel not  weird . she ' s even offered suggestions for me . digit as far as explaining it to people goes , i haven ' t really had to fully explain my reasons to anyone . none of my friends really asked why , or if they did , they were satisfied with the ' i just hate my name and i am able to change it , so why shouldn ' t i ? ' explanation . i plan on having different ' levels ' of explanation , depending on who asks . so the first level would be ' because i want to ' which would be for acquaintances and people i don ' t know very well . then ' growing up , i really didn ' t like my name . it caused me a lot of grief , and i decided to move away from that , ' for the next level , for people i know better , and then for people i know really well and trust , the last level would be the full story , which is quite long and this message is long enough as it is but i ' m happy to share if you ' re interested . digit in the dating world , if you ' ve never met them before , just introduce yourself with your new name . they won ' t know that you were ever called anything else . you can tell them about your name change in time , but there ' s no need to do it right away . digit i mean , there ' s no limit on the number of times you can change your name that i know of anyway but if you change it too often , i think people will stop taking it seriously , or just get mixed up with which name you have at any given time . once you have a good idea of the name you want to use , try introducing yourself with it online . if your username doesn ' t have any actual names in it like mine here then you can introduce yourself with a different name to each person if you want , and just see if one feels right . when you ' re comfortable with that , try using it as a username . i ' d recommend getting people to call you the new name socially before you legally change it , so you can get used to it , and it won ' t be too much of a hassle if you change your mind . lastly , i would like to add that you ' re not a fraud . it feels weird at first and lots of people who change their name feel as if they ' re lying when they use their new name . you ' re not . you ' re used to being called one thing and now you ' re answering to something different , and that takes time to get used to . don ' t let anyone make you feel bad about it .

2. my ninth grade intro to tech teacher mrs oh i am sorry dr h . first let me tell what what she looked like she looked like chucky with heath ledgers jokers mouth as an old pale lady . here  s what she did digit . once she got mad at me for saying the word aids . i was explaining what wakanda does to make people not want to go visit it and keep the secret digit . she talked slowly while emphasizing certain words which made listening to her painful . she talked like this  the audit . has shown that most . of you . have . been . on other sites . never mind that most of us also got our work done while on said sitesso imagine listening to her try to punish you i  ll get back to this later digit once for a class project we were planting plants in the schools front yard . while there she told me and a couple of my friends 3to be exact to go the school and get some empty boxes . we go and look for the boxes . now the only boxes we found were not empty at allthey had printer paper i think so we thought we should grab one and bring to her to ask if that  s what she meant and she just misspoke or something . we show her the box and the . this digit year oldish lady throws a damm temper tantrum . she starts yelling  i asked for empty boxes  i tried to tell her  mrs hackney these were the only boxes we foun  empty boxes empty boxes she kept yelling while stamping her foot like an angry toddler . i just turned around and went back inside to keep looking to shut her up . turns out the janitor was about to throw the empty boxes out and that  s why we couldn  t find them . he let us have them though nice guy really any cursing at all was evil to her like she downright went on rages about it  you can  t use those words there evil , your doing evil . crap i just said the fucking chrombook doesn  t work for god sakes . remember what i said about her  trying to punish you  . here  s what she did he yelled you you until you stopped and then tried to make you agree with her that you were wrong like she actually was fanatical to the rules . like when she heard me someone say fuck she would try to make you stop by saying it wasn  t in your  vocabulary  and making you admit you were wrong . while most teachers would just be like  don  t say that out loud  or just ignore if it wasn  t in a conversation with them . we were in ninth grade and i knew for a fact my friends and iwho she was talking toknew what fuck literally meant because we discussed that earlier in the school yearwe were wondering how  fuck you  became an insult instead of a complement . and when i was talking with my friends during an assignment she told me to stop because  no job lets you do that  . i told her i see what some jobs would airport guides drivers surgeons ectbut that it wasn  t affecting our .   nope no job let  s you do that restaurants don  t let the cashiers or cooks do that  . we were doing a  put a computer together  simulation which i am pretty is one of the jobs that lets you talk to each other . and actually this ended up a project that we had to end up doing together because it was too complicated . lots of her projects ended like this . her saying we need to work alone and then telling us we had to work together back on track i knew for a fact the  no job lets you do that  was bull becasue my grandma has a resultant and the workers are always joking around and stuff while working and at the local mcdonald  s and giant and all the other stores and restaurants well most the workers would talk and gossip to each other while packing bags or giving you your order . i tried to tell her this but she kept yelling so i just shut up and pretended to agree while listening to her rant on  emotional intelligence  and the ever so infamous  talking back  lecture . thirdly she tried little i mean pre k teaching methods to try to get us to do what she said . like saying if we didn  t do something that was school mandated i think not using phones . which all other teachers just ignored if it wasn  t while you still had work to do that the principal would  turn me into a toad  in ninth grade . we all knew one wizards aren  t realor at least publicly know secondly if he was a wizard why was he being a principal at a regular school ? so we just kept doing it while hiding it from her . there  s a bunch of other stuff or i could clarify on somethings if you want . tldr tech teacher tried to teach ninth graders like kindergarteners . was crazy loyal to to stupid rules .

4. okay so this comment is a little different than the answer your looking for but it kind of fits . i worked at a resturaunt as a server and had a manager who was really mean all the time and had such an attitude problem . she would piss off the guests in my section often and let them leave pissed off to write a bad review , on numerous occasions . she would shoulder check me and make fun of me in front of people and yell at me on the floor for something that wasn ' t done by me , wasn ' t even in my section and had literally nothing to do with me . and she has left me in tears often because of how badly she treated me . she also made a lot of really horrible calls like choosing to not tell me about guests special requests and letting them get mad at me for not being prepped on how they prefer things . they ' re rich assholes and prefer their experiences where they don ' t have to communicate the way they want things . which is completely opposite of how we treat the normal guests . but i wouldn ' t know that unless she taught me that . so she ' s made me look like an idiot on a couple of occasions . one night it was really busy and the sushi chef was behind so i had to wait a really long time for a roll for an appetizer . this table was very high maintenanced and picky so they were pissed . i asked the manager to move it along and talk to the table and she ignored me . finally i talk to the sushi chef he usually prefers no contact and i find out that the lines i put in on the computer to distinguish between apps and entrees just didn ' t show up . so i draw them on the paper and ask him for the roll asap . the manager should have been doing this because i needed to get to my tables and run my food . then i tell the manager about the problem with the specific computer and how it has been giving me trouble again . it happened at random since the very beginning of me working there . she gave me a horrible response about how there ' s nothing she can do about it . it my head lady , i still have the number of the posi support team in my phone from my old management job and i know that you can fix it . again , in my head . so i ' m upset because she had no regard for the happiness of my table . had no regard for the problem with the computer that was causing a lot of issues . and had no regard for helping me out which is her job . but again , she ' s a bully . so im in a hurry i ask the sushi chef for the entree roll and he hands it to me and i drop it at the table and apologize over and over again . in my head i ' m like i ' m just ganna split this sushi roll off the bill and tell them at the end i paid for it . i wasn ' t even going to ask the manager i was just ganna pay for it myself . so then i realize he hands me the wrong sushi roll and when the entree sushis come up its wrong because he gave me an entree one for app . so the sushi chef is fighting with me tooth to nail and i ' m telling him what i need and he ' s just saying no . and in my head i ' m like how can you fight against this . this is for the customer we need to fix the mistake and talk about it later for the happiness of the guests . i tell the manager i need her help again and she starts yelling and screaming in my face about how i should know the difference . so i said out loud " the sushi chef didn ' t know the difference either . it ' s busy . i need my roll for the table there should be no arguing about it " . so i basically undermined her at that point . then she pulls me to the side to say that i have no right to fight with her , i was acting like a child and tried to threaten me with the owner . whom was sitting right in front of the sushi station and didn ' t even offer a helping hand to get the problem solved efficiently . then i ' m so fed up i start literally crying . saying i don ' t care was the owner says at this point i need the help when there ' s an issue and instead all i do is get yelled at . then she says we ' ll talk about it later . we never did . i worked there for a year and had a lot of shifts and was really good with the guests and always had compliments . about a week later i came down with the flu really bad and kept showing up to work anyway . i was literally throwing up in the bathroom on between tables for days there . i called out once because no one would cover me and i needed to get better . i even gave them ample amount of time to motivate someone else to come in . then i went to work for a couple days again . and i was getting worse . finally it was so bad one day that i had no voice was throwing up with diarrhea , had snot continously dripping from my nose and could get my swollen eyes to stop tearing . so i called out . and the next day this bitch had me fired . they fired me . i loved that place . i loved the people i worked with . i loved the kitchen crew and the guests . i have never been so sad about leaving a job . i have also never been on bad terms with a job before either . but her awful professionalism to handle situations in a correct manner for the guests directly resulted in me losing my job .

5. i don  t think people understand this . it  s important to know life is gonna change nothing will ever he permanent , idc what you say it will never be , so people need to learn how to push through tough times . mourning for a few days is good but you have to start grasping yourself after that as if not you will never learn to accept what happened and move on to a extent where it doesn  t affect your day to day living , i can say what a joke i was at digit i was so fucked up that i just coped with my friend being in coma with getting more fucked up . but idk how i would feel if she never woke up or etc , . , . i probably would not be talking to you rn if she hadn  t as i would never did a digit and just killed myself

6. definitely know how you feel . it sucks big time . but i  ve learned that those kind of friends aren  t real friends . i tend to only have digit or digit close friends who i do stuff with  activities that require other people such as going to the cinema or jamming . all my other  fake  friends , i just don  t expect anything from them . if they invite me out somewhere , fine . otherwise i try not to give a shit . and truth be told , i can  t really stand being around them for too long . helps with the not giving a shit part . hope you feel better soon . xx

7. really don  t know anymore lmao i use to be fucked up and pushed my emotions aside not caring about anything to deal with the shittyness and stress i had to deal with , currently i did a digit and quit all the bad habits cold turkey it  s been a few months and honestly i  m going insane . just before reading this a thought of suicide popped through my head and i was asking myself how would i deal with my friend who stood by my side for the worst of my years in life . how would i ask her if she wants to ask me anything before i did the act ? this is just a theoretical and not physical . i don  t plan to kms ever as i just can  t deal with the effects of it , even if i  m dead i would regret abusing my friends generosity . regardless i will just deal with this battle and just see where it takes me i  m envious that the friend has moved on from near where i am currently and i hope she never goes back but sometimes i do feel like shit when i look at myself . regardless she has a jump start as she  s digit  digit compared to where i  m digit  digit . here  s a funny talk we had . i noticed that most of he people i talk to are older then me and she said yes you attract older people . face  with  tears  of  joy even so i told her when i talk with people i never think about their age much as long as their above digit as their mature and not overhyper or etc . and she said she never though anything about it either and we always talk as we are equal not teen  adult teen . no this is not a sexual relationship and no this is not me abusing someone else or vice verse . she looked after me when i was deep and i did the same . i can say this if she never got out of coma i would have died a few years later probably . here  s the irony of this post ? you ready ? i never met this girl irl lol . goal is to meet up later after college and tour the world and just fight over a few stupid inside jokes . who knows maybe i will have my digit nova build by then and maybe will part with it as a thank you gift , always can just build another one haha . goal is to build roughly digit  digit before i drop dead haha . being digit in a toxic family sucks , but i  m glad to an extent of being able to see the things i can . and mainly meeting the people i have let it be irl or over facetime  online .
