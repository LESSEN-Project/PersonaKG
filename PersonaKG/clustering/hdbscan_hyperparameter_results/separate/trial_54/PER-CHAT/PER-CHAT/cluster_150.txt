3. see now you are just trying to bait me into political arguments . i ' m not biting . i will not be commenting on comparisons to school shooters , real  world terrorism , etc . it is insensitive and unfair downplay the severity of these actions so much that you can compare them to a tv series . these are real lives being effected not just characters on a show .

13. let ' s be real tho , how many times is a centurion gonna charge his heavy from neutral ? if we ' re talking about casuals , then yeah that probably works , but if we are talking high level duels then most often than not the centurion starts with a kick or a feint . btw i ' m not talking about just dodging the kick , almost the whole cast gets some sort of guard break or cc after dodging one but kensei doesn ' t , he just dodges because the recovery is so slow to do anything .
   (ID: fc02053133b0aa8d444b95ed56c24999ae82879b)

14. holy shit ! i just ate one of those for lunch today , no joke . that ' s what inspired me ask this question .
   (ID: af0db6dfe4be67a6b6915437597ea564bbb33830)

15. just forgot . or too lazy to do any other stuff beside a comment . i set my mind to certain task , and do it . but only that . so commenting is a task , upvoting is not . so my thumbs doesnt go for the upvote .

16. oh , i agree they should probably return the items , but i ' m pointing out just how vulnerable these things can be in this world . it ' s a real concern .
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

17. no , but the stereotype is filled and this movie seems to be leaning very heavily in girl power bo peep not a soft woman any more . they didn  t do that with jesse , they just introduced a great character that was female . this is forceful feminism and it  s achieving the opposite affect . that  s what he  s saying . now stop being defensive .
   (ID: 9414b9913220ebe2601862e3001aac74ebcffe33)

   (ID: 8f7369c6ebb47df350fec663be46dfd8481ee2db)

19. i never stated as to it being the best , it is just a well written piece , as was batman noel and a death in the family . it is all about perspective
   (ID: b5153b16e61f6bc5e4bf4d8db479b7093df1ae26)
