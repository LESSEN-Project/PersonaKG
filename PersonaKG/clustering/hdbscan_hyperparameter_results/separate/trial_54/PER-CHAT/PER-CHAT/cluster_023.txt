1. aussie here , so what i ' m about to say may not apply in the us , but going around to talk to sparkies face to face is worth digit resumes you send out . do the leg work .

2. i would definitely say for you to go for it , however i would try something other than minecraft at first . minecrafts popularity on yt has gone way down and it would be better off to start with something else that is a bit more popular . like beamng or something . but it is your call on what you want to start out with .

3. funny you say it that way . i interviewed a lady who is digit the other day and when she found she didn  t get the job she thought she deserved an explanation . maybe you should try to not generalize so much , there  s a lot of smart hardworking millennials out there . although , with your attitude , it  s not like you  re ever going to find them anyway .

4. in toronto theres a company called fix it females that higher mostly women but they want ppl who are ' ' experienced ' ' even though a lot of them aren ' t , but apply anyway say you have painting experience . best way honestly is to be a helpelabor at sites , sweeping , passing tools , moving what you can etc . and you gain experience through that . tbh like digit  of construction crews your ganna experience peverted guys cause most of them are rough around the edges high school drop out type guys so you gotta find the right crew

5. thank you bingsby . you i see are aware of the language filter that works quite nice you cant even say things that are slightly vulgar not just f  bombs . when i posted that my guild asks me to stop swearing its not every five seconds i do have respect for people . however if there is a language filter and you can easily click it to not see things your little virgin eyes dont want to see . why not be the intelligent person in the room and click the damn button . i like the way your brain works buddy

6. regardless of the selfishness in your ideas , which caused the existance of the kids in the first place , in going to say that my point is , that you cant expect kids to be slaves because you provide them food and shelter . " i give you shit , so you should do exacly as i say " that sounds like a regular employment , except the kids can ' t quit . they have to put up with you . and they dont even realise that because you have fashioned their brains the way you want . im digit and took me digit years and living away from home to realise that parents are the entitled ones . i hope for the sake of kids , fair doesn ' t only come in octomber to your house too .
