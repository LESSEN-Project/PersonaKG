1. if the only reason you can find for still doing something partners included is that you  ve been doing it so long why stop now ? just try to stop and move on . it  s most likely just holding you hostage with your on sentimental emotions .
   (ID: 411b23f3d2a1f254c1c92c17670bb02c191a1301)

2. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

3. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted

4. hey . you have everything you need inside of you . all the power in the world , all the love . everything . you  re gonna make it through whatever it is you  re going through . you  re not just gonna make it . you  re gonna fucking thrive . wake up every morning and name at least one thing that you  re grateful for . like being able to communicate w complete strangers on the internet . anything ! the list will keep growing and you will start attracting all that good juju you want . sending you love .

5. i don ' t know about the falling in love and all that . but if you ' re looking for advice take it from someone digit years older than you . forget about her . don ' t even think about it anymore . you ' re young as fuck and there ' s plenty of women out there . and don ' t fall in love .

6. sounds to me like you ' ve been screwed over a lot and are making the best of your situation . sure , the person you live with is your mom but you ' re paying your share . you ' ve got a roommate you just happen to be related to . you ' re doing what you have to do to take care of your kid , no shame in it .

7. i experience this even now . i think it ' s fine to think every now and then about your situation . it would be impossible to never think about it , but don ' t stay focused on it for a lengthy period , it ' s unhealthy . when i had a job in retail i caught the train home every night . friday and saturday nights were almost unbearable . watching groups of people your age socialize and have fun hurt bad because it would remind me how i ' ll never be able to experience it for myself . you can still find some people to hang around with , maybe from work or education . but i think we should agree that looking forward is the best thing to do
   (ID: 6f44a04a8b717b1f28e50b97f8c5e8608d598324)

8. i have a few friends like you , and i want to shake them all . it  s easier said than done but you have to understand if people didn  t want you around , they wouldn  t invite you anywhere . research some small ways to help yourself with confidence .
   (ID: f14ea91df683dc236b3ffe5956871b69581e71d3)

9. it ' s a big mix of stuff but time is just one component . youtube is full of really socially intelligent folks that know how to help you navigate heartbreak . finding the right advice along with finding healthy distractions is key . you have to acknowledge your feelings , while at the same time giving yourself liberty to feel different emotions through other activities and diversion . you have to delve into healing while at other times work on suppressing certain emotions since they are not all constructive and sometimes even accurate . stay social . don ' t be afraid to hook with folks . i personally recommend tripping on molly , mushrooms or lsd to create an experience that could heighten your sense of how beautiful consciousness is . it sucks to say , but pain is a very helpful tool for progress . some people use it masochistically to self sabotage and wallow in a cycle of victimhood , self pity and depression . you could instead use pain to turn around and help other people , perhaps hold yourself to higher standards in important ways and above all use this opportunity to learn more about yourself and how to become the best friend to yourself you could possibly be .

10. " when you find someone you really like as a person , tell them that you hope it grows into a closer relationship . if they don ' t feel that way . all is not lost , platonic female friends are a good ally when you ' re in the dating scene . " i actually don ' t have very nice experience with this thing . once i confessed to a girl that i want a close relationship with her . she said she didn ' t want it . i then decided to continue platonic friendship with her . i was now looking after other girls . one of whom was showing some interests in me through her body language . i was now interacting with this new girl on regular basis . she was sending positive indicators to me . my platonic friend asked me about my interests in that girl . i told her that yes i ' m interested in this new girl . i was also thinking about getting some female perspective  thought my platonic friend would be good wing  girl . i confessed my feelings to new girl . she accepted . i was a happy dude . but my winggirl started telling me that my new girlfriend is not the ideal girl  that in her words " she sleeps around " . i said that i ' ll be careful . i was on a trip to family for a week . when i came back , my new gf was ignoring me . i felt something is wrong . i just didn ' t know what . i then went straight to her  asked her what is wrong ? she didn ' t answer me . i asked again . this time she said that she didn ' t know i was sleeping with my winggirl . i asked her about who is telling her such things . she said the name of my wing  girl . i was shocked to hear that . i don ' t know why she did it . if she didn ' t want a relationship with me , why was she ruining my relationships with others . i know i shouldn ' t use this blanket thing to stereotype everyone . but now i feel its far better to get rejected  move  on than choosing to remain friends .

11. why are so many people telling this guy to get a lawyer ? no lawyer needed . just don ' t do it ! it ' s illegal as hell . also , stop paying for your brothers car . tell him it ' s transferred into your name or you stop making payments . also , also  move out ! i have to be brutally honest , your mom sounds shady as fuck . you don ' t want to be around when it all comes crashing down on her . stay at a friends place or rent a cheap room . just get out of there !

12. digit you don  t have to meet him if you don  t want to . lots of people never really get closure , and that sucks , but really what is the goal here anyways ? you could easily exchange longer messages over email or something and give him closure that way . digit why are you so concerned about the image he has of you ? are you hoping that something will be rekindled ? otherwise i feel shattering that image that he has of you will probably just help him move on and you won  t have to hear from the ex again . digit even if you do meet up , you don  t actually have to reveal any information about yourself that you don  t want to . just keep it vague . there  s nothing wrong with just broadly answering  i  m taking out some time to figure out my life , i  ve grown out of x interest  etc . if the subject of what you  re doing these days comes up .

13. you ask her out , you flirt for a couple weeks or so and then you pause for couple of days . during those weeks she enjoys the attention , then during the pause , which preferably is for digit  digit days she gets confused , thinks about you , what you mean for her . and then you get back to asking her out , flirting and she is hooked , she already has thought about her feelings for you . just don ' t overdo it . you do this trick more than twice and she will think that you yourself don ' t know what you want .

14. maybe i ' m coming off as too depressed . i wouldn ' t say i ' m officially " depressed " i live my own independent life . i go to school in a major that i love . i workout digit  digit times a week , i taught myself to play guitar , i fly  fish any free chance i get , i love hanging out at winery ' s , i love to cook for other people and i love to just be outside . today i did a ten mile bike ' n ' hike . the problem is , is that i do most of these activities alone or with my guy friends . i don ' t know though . maybe i do need some form of therapy and anti  depressant . the main issue is , it would mean i ' d have to tell my parents . i don ' t want to admit to them that i have a social anxiety that comes from fear of initiating a conversation with a woman . my dad made a joke the other day that he thought i was gay because i ' ve never brought home a girl from school . i took it personally . i don ' t know why i ' ve built this up to be so much harder than it should be .

15. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .

16. hmm , well i can be pretty bitter about it too . although i still occasionally get propositioned for sex so i guess i could be uglier . too bad i ' m kind of involuntarily asexual meds and other issues or else i ' d sleep around more . at least someone wants to touch me lol . i ' ve done the weight loss thing and that didn ' t really help not like those before and after pictures where the after is a totally cute guy . it doesn ' t help help that i ' m a socially anxious and naturally introverted reserved person been that way since before the tumblr era so it ' s hard for my inner personality to come out so that ' s another strike . i guess just hold on to see if someone can look past looks and try not to be a forever aloner . pretty hokey advice that i try to give myself .

17. oh , honey . sending hugs . can you ring a friend for a chat ? you need to speak to someone who knows your worth . i hope it gets better or , if not , you find what you need . good luck .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

18. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path

19. i agree that she ' s dropping hints . next time she brings it up say something like " why in the world does anyone get married ? the details are mind numbing ! i can ' t imagine putting myself through that . big sigh . i don ' t know how you ' re managing to deal with all this . let ' s go to a movie or something because this is seriously depressing me . "

20. on your third date , hump him awkwardly at a phish show . it ' s the only way .   x200b  raves are a special thing . i wouldn ' t bring someone around who made me feel awkward a third time . and there ' s nothing wrong with keeping looking for someone who has long term potential or at the very least is more compatible now !
