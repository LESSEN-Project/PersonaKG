12. i know i have no control over her life , but im going to be spending quite a bit of time there , as she is my girlfriend . and it ' s not just that i don ' t like the guy . he actually wants to fight me because i made my girlfriend mad once . i genuinley dont think she ' s safe living there with him .

13. i can relate , as i too have it , and have turned to hurting myself rather than others . though , in recent years i ' ve come to have a lot more self control when it comes to doing anything negative such as the aforementioned punching of walls . for me it ' s the smacking of lips and the sound of saliva moving in another person ' s  animal ' s mouth , so i often eat alone , or with distraction like a loud tv . my nfather has no concept of disorders , and as such he constantly would exacerbate the problem to the point where i actually started to claw at my arm at every meal . i actually remember being so upset that i punched a wall and broke my hand one night when it was particularly bad . i don ' t lash out like this anymore , probably due to the fact that i did that when i was digit , and since have matured , at least enough to not punch walls . i ' m so glad that after my father was out of the picture , my mother let me eat in peace . i can ' t remember when i haven ' t eaten in my room in recent years . i ' d like to think it ' s one of the reasons i ' m so happy to have her as my mother .
