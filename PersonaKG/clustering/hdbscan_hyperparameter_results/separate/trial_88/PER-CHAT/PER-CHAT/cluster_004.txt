6. well you see since the white male has been the majority for most of history it is now somehow acceptable to discriminate against him . because the idea of everyone being equal doesn ' t apply to " everybody .

7. funny how you haven ' t actually been able to make a logical counter argument . you ' re just saying " you ' re wrong " without the logical backing that i have . then the " boo hoo whatever dude ! you ' re , uh , just like , uh , a flat earther dude " really , i am ? i ' m literally just like a flat earther ? that is your brilliant counter argument ? that saying it is wrong to promote a lie is exactly as bad as lying ? that is what you ' re telling me ? do you . do you realize how incredibly stupid you just made yourself look ? you just made yourself look like a clown .

8. like how you assumed i have a side not religious at all i don ' t care about abortion , i ' m simply pointing out the double standard of " it ' s my body " until the kid is out and then it ' s " but you helped make this kid , so pay up " even if the father doesn ' t want to or can ' t .
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)

9. yep , you ' re totally just ignoring this . you didn ' t make a comment about how you were unsubscribing or respond to my comment . i can see how you just mind your own business and ignore things . you ' re totally not acting like a whiny snowflake at all .
   (ID: dc639446b154d74c8655191b5a755643abd00c2d)

10. oh you used a big word ! was that hard ? is that why it took so long to type out ? you all wonder why woman don ' t even want to look in your direction , bold of you to call me stupid when you can ' t even understand how self destructive your life is . hating woman and then wondering why they don ' t like you back , crying about it to other basement dwellers like yourself . woman don ' t owe you shit and they never will .

11. actually i only wanted to talk about you and not to you because i know you act like a child and knew the level of stupidity would reach all time high like this " conversation . but believe what you want , i don ' t care . i ' m done wasting my time here .
   (ID: 8bc3c38873da8df8d450deb17fd3c4a602037c65)

12. not playing into your hand or giving you the answers you want is not avoiding questions . i have answered each question you asked , if you don ' t like the answers stop asking the questions . once again you think you will paint me into in a corner . you cannot . you will find yourself wanting if you continue to play your social justice warrior , validation game with me .
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

13. i ' d rather not copypaste . can you elaborate how me refrencing what i said prior , which you can see , is an attempt to cite something as an exception to a generally accepted rule , principle , etc . without justifying the exception .
   (ID: 0be93b714cd5f5999c7ff30ac3a245ba907b2d81)

14. what i thought the question meant was something different , not all this " social justice warriors " nonsense . also , the cop thing i said happens very often in big cities .

15. i lose a dozen brain cells for every fox news article i attempt to read . don lemon is right . the gop is so desperate for digit to do something positive that when he does the slightest thing that seems correct in the midst of all the bullshit he does  he gets praised like he turned water to wine . a bad person doing a decent thing doesn  t make them a good person . it makes them an opportunist .
   (ID: 60a31a4071ae4962f2a308822d53a634a3760fa1)

16. i don  t have any words of wisdom i am just sending a hug . that must have been so painful for you and i understand how hurt you are on so many levels . i am sorry you had to hear such unkind , untrue and vile words . hold your heart close , let it beat , you deserve love and you deserve better than an ignorant , spiteful woman .

   (ID: 6692d386ab188df76448f18f0e9d59c1e6d88c50)

18. my opinion is that trump is doing nothing to prevent it . he ' s just kinda pushing them over the edge more and more .
   (ID: 9e778023eda5589ac577e3789edfd900d208edf7)

19. does it fucking matter to you ? are you a professional ? are you even a parent ? why dont you keep your " opinions " to yourself since you obviously know jack shit about what ' s going on .
   (ID: ee2906681b3174a80cefe2bcfb40bd3a110c1b29)
