1. let me make it easier for you . the sku , and what you paid doesn  t matter . you bought an older model for  digit when that was a deal . with new prices on material and manufacturing methods , they can sell new ones for  digit . that  s including better updates parts . no one will give you  digit for yours . and i  m not here to shit all over your post . i  m here to inform you that if you really want to sell it , you  ll have to take more of a loss . i  m also here to make sure other people don  t over pay for things . and if someone pays  digit for this , they are over paying .

6. look up " which cherry mx switch should i get " and also i recommend getting a keypad  macropad with interchangeable switches if your budget is low and just in case you dont like the switches you choose , i bought the amusingkeypad pro and it works fine for me but i switched to gateron clears .

7. this was already posted . someone mentioned that there is a possibility of an extra digit   digit  off down the road , similar to last year . yet , many of the items may be sold out by then . so grab what you like if you feel it may not be available . also those normandys are great , the ones on clearance don ' t have the same soles as the updated ones unfortunately .
