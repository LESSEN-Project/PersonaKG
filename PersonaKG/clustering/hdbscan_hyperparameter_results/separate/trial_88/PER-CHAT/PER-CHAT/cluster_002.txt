1. it does a good job at being a shooter , the single player is just an after thought , i really hate when games don ' t have a worthwhile single player mode to them because some weird reason most develpers probably don ' t even know but just go along with it because everyone does it . i am not a fan of multiplayer especially not online i don ' t know i just don ' t like it . so splatoon went in my opinion from interesting to it is a good concept . it is just focused on multiplayer and the single player seems to have no replay value

2. i liked the books , but they ' re not great , i agree . they ' re easy to read , which is part of their appeal . i do like the large number of characters and how they keep crossing paths , often times without realizing it . i do find the plotting and backstabbing interesting , and the mystery of some of the schemes so you don ' t quite know who ' s is telling the truth or lying or is simply being an ass , it ' s more obvious in the show , so it takes away some of the mystery and guessing . i do like fantasy . i read the lord of the rings trilogy as a kid , and another couple series that i absolutely adore redwall , and the wheel of time but i consider those truer fantasy than got , but maybe that is the appeal of the show . it ' s fantasy , but also somehow more relatable , more realistic , in a way , so it ' s not as " hardcore " fantasy , if that makes sense .

3. ok so for me origins story really disappointed me the combat was great and what not but the levels and and story killed it for me . the story was good at first but as soon as the order of the ancients came into play it just got repetitive , find info track them down kill them repeat . i would do a mission and it would say be one level and then the engines would be digit levels higher sometimes . in odyssey the story doesn  t feel like that to me , it feels different . i prefer kassandra over bayek just better character in my opinion . and i can really appreciate how much variety it gives me in options to level up . oh and i like the new kind of abilities you get instead of what was in origins . just ask if you would me to elaborate on this more .

4. yes bones is great , and so is chekov . i think kirk , spock , and uhura could have been chosen better . overall , the kelvin timeline is not at all what i want from star trek . too much action , and not very interesting or thought provoking . but , it is keeping trek alive , so there is still hope for better quality . my favorite of the digit is beyond , followed by digit , then into darkness .

5. yeah , the potato faces bug me , as far as i can ' t tell races apart very easily in oblivion . but honestly , my biggest complaint is the voice acting , it takes me right out of character anytime i hear a voice . i will get through oblivion , i love the story , and the quests i ' ve done so far are fun , but like i said there are aspects that just drive me nuts . not that skyrim is perfect , it ' s just much much better in my mind . but because i ' ve seen a lot of morrowind is text based i feel i still might enjoy it . and i know most fans see it as the pinnacle of the series . it really makes me wish i started playing es with morrowind , not skyrim so it won ' t feel like a completely different game .

6. although i love clannad and code geass with all of my heart . they arent flawless . and i dont think its good to keep saying to yourself that nothing will beat this anime . because then you ' re making it harder for yourself to find a really good anime . i recommend going in every anime with the thought that this could be you ' re digit  anime . this way you can enjoy more anime .

7. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .

8. idk , i  m able to relate to nearly every message and character in the book . halliday  s created the most immersive  video game  in the universe and yet it  s so much more than that . people get lost in it .  the missing millions .  all just because he wanted people to like what he liked . and that somebody like wade who had quite literally nothing but passion and skill for the same things was able to beat his game . i think cline wrote every character perfectly , being able to understand their plights , i mean even sorrentos character was compelling , somebody you really wanted to hate . the references were insane . i didn  t even grow up with the old school games but the attention to detail was incredible . in an era where aaa titles don  t even come with enough content for digit month , cline was able to imagine up a place where everything was under digit platform , the whole world shared halliday  s creation , gunter or not . free learning , unlimited content , whatever your hobby was , it was in the oasis . i  ve never wanted something to be as real as i do the oasis . but the themes hit home too . the problems with being overly connected , letting the real world pass you by . the want and need to not let corporations rule the world . i just think it  s amazing start to finish . i understand liking something and later feeling differently but man , this book , i don  t think i  ll ever get tired of .

9. i think the movie is better than the series mostly because the movie used the lyrics

10. i ' m actually still just on the side of liking it , but it ' s getting tougher . gaping plot holes , uninteresting storylines , painful characters , terrible dialogue , such poor consistency of any in  universe tech that i have to call most of the sci  fi elements one big continuity error . and that ' s not limited to the newer films . just started watching the original trilogy after tlj , and think i have to accept they ' re just sci  fi films for kids . i think they have some really great core concepts to work with , but then the actual stories that are told in the setting get ruined by the issues above .

11. strong story and a solid world is all i want , took a chance to play battlefront digit recently and while it plays well and everyone is dressed up like they ' re in star wars , it doesn ' t feel like star wars

12. that was a brilliant game . i remember playing that when it came out  2000ish ?  and thinking that video game graphics couldn ' t possibly get any better . still think that gp4 is the best f1 game ever made apart from possibly grand prix legends .

13. i see what you mean . i ' ve never played reach ' s multiplayer so i can ' t say much about the problems you mentioned , though they do seem pretty bad . personally my main draws were more from the single player modes , especially campaign . i thought the alien invasion story was actually quite good , since it showed how massive and powerful the covenant was , and how ill  equipped the humans really were to fight them . it was definitely more grounded and military  based than the other games , but i personally liked that sense of desperation and scale the setting gave off .

14. tbh there are a lot of 2d games that are better than hzd , such as super mario bros digit and digit . i ' m not saying this game doesn ' t have its niche fanbase that will replay it people such as yourself , i ' m saying it wont be the sort of timeless game that continues getting new players into it years and years after release . it will instead fade into obscurity . the reason it wont age well is , as i mentioned , the fact that it ' s a copied and pasted open world format in an already overrsaturated genre . and it ' s boring .

15. steven moffat is a good writer , but seasons six and seven were still bad and annoying . the long game is good , you people are just mean . same goes for in the forest of the night . mel is actually really endearing . the only truly bad seven story is dragonfire  silver nemesis is fun and delta is a good concept with a bad execution . amy and rory leaving was more of a relief than anything . i liked them , but by the end they ' d been fully subsumed into the aforementioned annoyingness .   x200b

16. fellow xbone player here . i played about digit hours of bf1 and after about digit hours in bfv i honestly prefer it ' s gameplay for the most part . it ' s lacks content and it ' s fairly buggy though not game  breaking for the most part , but we ' re finally getting a frequent flow of maps now , and the bugs aren ' t as bad as they used to be . now ' s probably the best time to get into it , before you get too behind on unlocking weapons etc .

17. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .
