1. whenever i miss something my so says she refuses to repeat it , and i get very annoyed . it  s entirely irrational and totally my fault . but i try my best to make her happy , after all if she makes me happy i should do the same .

2. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .

3. well i ' m sorry you had those experiences , but i feel like people tend to notice and remember bad things far more prominently than nice things , maybe something to do with it ? i don ' t think basic kindness is gone , i think it ' s more that with all the horrible shit in the media we keep being bombarded with , it ' s easier for people to just shut off . maybe all people need to do is to work on regaining their sense of compassion . either way , hope you manage to surround yourself with nice people in future

4. i was born under the lucky star to have that face that just reminds you of other people , we all know someone like that . anyways , people typically say wow you look like so wine i know , i than reply with well yeah i ' d hope so . took my parents seven attempts to get one i have digit other siblings usually is a shocker on both fronts .

7. it takes up a decent chunk , but i find myself gravitating back towards british tv . stuff like friday night dinner , it crowd , and other various shows . then again , a lot of action  y drama stuff is american . i ' d say i watch about digit  american tv .

10. best value for the money for a novice is the players pure x cue . seyberts they will prolly run you 180ish with digit . 75mm i believe ldc shaft with a kamui soft tip on them . i have been using mine for digit months and i have nothing but good things to say . you can also buy the shaft separately or any other shaft which i think is a good option as well for you if you really like your butt . me personally i like to look at and touch all different butts

11. take a walk in a botanical garden and smell all the plants horseback riding if you have someone to lead your horse tandem skydiving whale listening cruise play a game of seek the blind person ' s version of hide and seek , hiding no longer required rock clinging gyms seem like they could be done by feel , or maybe with a spotter to tell you where the grips are weightlifting , cross fit , swimming , or jogging if you have a buddy who can lead you

13. One of my favorite things is black curtains.

14. that sounds rather tricky , because ultimatley i would think your not going to want lots of male muscle in the long run , you ' ll need a certain amount of fat to your shape . at the moment im 176lb ' s with a fairly feminine frame but im working out a lot . im trying very hard not to build too much muscle and just tone up . i dont want my biceps or calfs to get any bigger for example . i could be totally wrong but i would think you need to gain some fat , but keep working out while putting the weight on to keep it under control . if you suddenly put on 20ib worth of muscle you going to look far more masculine .

15. depends on how old you were when he left . if you are digit now then he probably couldn ' t handle the responsibility of being a dad , which isn ' t your fault . if you are digit , then you were probably a temper  tantrum tornado of tumultuous temperament resulting in your dad saying " fuck this " , which is just a little bit your fault . the bright side being you ' ve survived digit years without him , so there ' s that .

16. yes i had crushes , but this isn ' t about crushes . children , especially digit year olds and younger , don ' t have the mental capacity to identify themselves as any sexuality . hell when i was digit i barely even knew what sex was . no matter what anyone says , i ' m gonna refuse to believe a 4th grader has enough mental maturity to call himself gay , bi , trans , or lesbian and know what they truly mean . i ' m betting digit  it is probably something they heard or were influenced by an outside source . i have nothing against gay people but come on this is ridiculous . a child this young should not be calling themselves gay . they should be playing with legos . atleast wait till you have started puberty to decide that . crushes are one thing but openly being gay as a digit year old is another .

20. well micro does have 74k subs . you can ' t expect everyone to be a grower . most of them are probably interested in growing and want to but are in an illegal state or country . it is going to be hard to have a scientific talk about growing with other people unless you are using a different forum . macro has some okay growers from pictures i have seen , but then some of those grows also just make you shake your head in disapproval . i don ' t mind helping people diagnose their deficiency if they are sitting there wondering what it could beusually ends up being a ph issue if it is hard to tell what the deficiency is and have been looking it up online .
