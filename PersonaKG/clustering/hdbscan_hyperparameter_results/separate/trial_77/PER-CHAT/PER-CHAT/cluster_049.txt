3. i haven ' t heard of that before . it might be you using scorestreaks while the camps need you to only use the maddox . try no scorestreaks and that might work . it sounds like the sort of thing you get in a new update .

4. hey man . i ' m sorry , but one thing you will find out about growing is that the hardest part is getting a nutrient schedule that fits you and the strains you grow . with the list of companies i gave you , it might be easy to figure out what i use , but how much i use is the tricky part . what would you consider a big company ? llc vs inc ? i may be considered a dick for not giving away my schedule that only needs minor tampering based on strain , but to me that is my intellectual property . i am willing to help people with their schedules , but i am not willing to give them mine , nor will i recommend a specific product i use unless i think it is the only product available that is suitable for mmj . if you ever need help with a nutrient schedule that fits you or what your plant needs , lmk i ' ve messed with quite a few different companies . i haven ' t used roots organic , botanicare mainline nutrients , gh maxi series , cyco and nectar of the godsi quit growing in soil before they came out . one thing i have found makes a difference is using fertilizers formulated specifically for marijuana . one thing i would recommend is using advanced nutrients sensi if possible for soil grows along with other nutrients , and connoseur a and b for your base nutrients in hydro .
