11. i think there is too much blur in the foreground , you can  t really see it  s a leaf anymore . it  s gives a cool effect , but i think if you wanted it to give it a more  nature  feeling , the leaves in the foreground shouldn  t be that blurry .

15. i ' m actually still just on the side of liking it , but it ' s getting tougher . gaping plot holes , uninteresting storylines , painful characters , terrible dialogue , such poor consistency of any in  universe tech that i have to call most of the sci  fi elements one big continuity error . and that ' s not limited to the newer films . just started watching the original trilogy after tlj , and think i have to accept they ' re just sci  fi films for kids . i think they have some really great core concepts to work with , but then the actual stories that are told in the setting get ruined by the issues above .
