2. admitting there is a problem is hard . fixing it even harder . your kids are likely in school full time . perhaps there is a way that you can find an after school program instead of a daycare . or , a dayhome . an hour or two in the afternoons probably won ' t affect your children negatively as a they are more connected to you by this age and can identify right from wrong and tell you , and b an after school program is guided by professional people and c less costly than full time care . i am a mom to a half day kindergartener digit and a digit mornings a week preschooler digit . i would need to find evening or weekend work to save myself from childcare costs being enormous , so i choose to wait until they are schooled full time . do you have any flexibility with your job ? perhaps you could drop off and pick up and return to work if necessary when she returns home . i ' m getting off track . i can ' t think of anything you ' re doing that isn ' t gentle , kind or thoughtful and coming from a place of love . i know my husband works long hours for our benefit and i appreciate the hell out of him for it . you are a good person and it sounds like she does need help in the form of a doctor or counselling for ppd . just keep coming from a place of love when you tell her you miss your partner in crime and that you want her to be happy , and all that growing old together stuff . i would beg and plead with my husband to come to counselling with me if i thought he needed it , but if that ' s likely to make her angry i just don ' t know . maybe if you guys are close with her family you can discreetly discuss with a trusted family member that you are worried . maybe they are worried too .

3. okay so this comment is a little different than the answer your looking for but it kind of fits . i worked at a resturaunt as a server and had a manager who was really mean all the time and had such an attitude problem . she would piss off the guests in my section often and let them leave pissed off to write a bad review , on numerous occasions . she would shoulder check me and make fun of me in front of people and yell at me on the floor for something that wasn ' t done by me , wasn ' t even in my section and had literally nothing to do with me . and she has left me in tears often because of how badly she treated me . she also made a lot of really horrible calls like choosing to not tell me about guests special requests and letting them get mad at me for not being prepped on how they prefer things . they ' re rich assholes and prefer their experiences where they don ' t have to communicate the way they want things . which is completely opposite of how we treat the normal guests . but i wouldn ' t know that unless she taught me that . so she ' s made me look like an idiot on a couple of occasions . one night it was really busy and the sushi chef was behind so i had to wait a really long time for a roll for an appetizer . this table was very high maintenanced and picky so they were pissed . i asked the manager to move it along and talk to the table and she ignored me . finally i talk to the sushi chef he usually prefers no contact and i find out that the lines i put in on the computer to distinguish between apps and entrees just didn ' t show up . so i draw them on the paper and ask him for the roll asap . the manager should have been doing this because i needed to get to my tables and run my food . then i tell the manager about the problem with the specific computer and how it has been giving me trouble again . it happened at random since the very beginning of me working there . she gave me a horrible response about how there ' s nothing she can do about it . it my head lady , i still have the number of the posi support team in my phone from my old management job and i know that you can fix it . again , in my head . so i ' m upset because she had no regard for the happiness of my table . had no regard for the problem with the computer that was causing a lot of issues . and had no regard for helping me out which is her job . but again , she ' s a bully . so im in a hurry i ask the sushi chef for the entree roll and he hands it to me and i drop it at the table and apologize over and over again . in my head i ' m like i ' m just ganna split this sushi roll off the bill and tell them at the end i paid for it . i wasn ' t even going to ask the manager i was just ganna pay for it myself . so then i realize he hands me the wrong sushi roll and when the entree sushis come up its wrong because he gave me an entree one for app . so the sushi chef is fighting with me tooth to nail and i ' m telling him what i need and he ' s just saying no . and in my head i ' m like how can you fight against this . this is for the customer we need to fix the mistake and talk about it later for the happiness of the guests . i tell the manager i need her help again and she starts yelling and screaming in my face about how i should know the difference . so i said out loud " the sushi chef didn ' t know the difference either . it ' s busy . i need my roll for the table there should be no arguing about it " . so i basically undermined her at that point . then she pulls me to the side to say that i have no right to fight with her , i was acting like a child and tried to threaten me with the owner . whom was sitting right in front of the sushi station and didn ' t even offer a helping hand to get the problem solved efficiently . then i ' m so fed up i start literally crying . saying i don ' t care was the owner says at this point i need the help when there ' s an issue and instead all i do is get yelled at . then she says we ' ll talk about it later . we never did . i worked there for a year and had a lot of shifts and was really good with the guests and always had compliments . about a week later i came down with the flu really bad and kept showing up to work anyway . i was literally throwing up in the bathroom on between tables for days there . i called out once because no one would cover me and i needed to get better . i even gave them ample amount of time to motivate someone else to come in . then i went to work for a couple days again . and i was getting worse . finally it was so bad one day that i had no voice was throwing up with diarrhea , had snot continously dripping from my nose and could get my swollen eyes to stop tearing . so i called out . and the next day this bitch had me fired . they fired me . i loved that place . i loved the people i worked with . i loved the kitchen crew and the guests . i have never been so sad about leaving a job . i have also never been on bad terms with a job before either . but her awful professionalism to handle situations in a correct manner for the guests directly resulted in me losing my job .

4. when having sex with my last girlfriend startet , i also had this problem digit or digit times . my problem is that sometimes my boner would disappear a soon as my girlfriend took her hand of my dick . i found out that this is linked with stress , at the beginning it was harder because it was embarrassed by it and my girlfriend startet to think it was about her body and she is unattractive to me . with even more pressure now it hasn ' t worked out again . because my ex girlfriend got really emotional at this point , i needed to tell her the truth . this was definitely the decision that ended this problem . because i already knew that it wasn ' t a problem with my body . i already feelt comfortable getting sexual with her . but as soon the point of putting on the condome comes , the slight fear overcame me , that these erection problem will lead her to believe she isn ' t sexy to me , which she struggled enough with at the beginning , because of her beeing digit years older . next time we startes having sex , my erection was there until the short moment of putting on that comdom . again i was worried about all the things that were talked about it and i stell feelt a little bit of embarrassment . and she did exactly the right thing , she calmed me down and just continued the same was we did before the condom . and it took some time again and we gave each other time and arousel by foreplay until the problem didn ' t accrue anymore . after that day it never happened again . i do see suspect some parallels with your post . and i can only suggest to you , if you want to have a chance of having sex with him , forget your plans . sit down with him and i tell him that it is ok for you it doesn ' t work out with penetrativ sex . by taking away stress factors for him , you make it way easier for him to hold his erection . also non penetrativ sex can be even more fun and it can help him to feel not so stressed before sex , when you can give him the feeling , of you beeing happy and satisfied . it would be pressure for every guy , if his girl is rarely in the country and on that rare occasion erection problems arise . knowing that you definitely want to have penetrativ sex is extra stressful . i think he knows you wish for that . and surely would like to fulfill it to you , but try to help him get more comfortable first . when you both try it viagra his stress won ' t be dissappearing . he will get depended on these for sex if you don ' t get rid of psychological boundaries first . when they are gone , you will be finding way more sex in the future .
