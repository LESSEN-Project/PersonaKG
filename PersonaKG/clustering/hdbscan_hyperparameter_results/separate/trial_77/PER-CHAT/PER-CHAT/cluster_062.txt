1. i think it  s hit reg . as far as i know there aren  t any hacks that make you invincible but in the wake of the hit reg bug it  s entirely possibly it could have been developed since everyone would put the blame on hitreg
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

2. would be cool , but i don  t think supercell would be willing to buy the rights to harley quinn to make it happen
   (ID: 26831d6557d17492ae3b0b54585b32e08055f834)

3. if you even use that feature its stange enough . i dont think beating off to it could make it much worse .
   (ID: cbed067932829315de162cb512843a4f6b1083b7)

4. it ' s so common that i don ' t think they ' d ever make a law about " spreading it . "
   (ID: 68698bd86019a86cb34a8b2e28c6324727011b28)

5. cause trump would think of funny names for them like " beto the creepo " and " bad touch biden , " steal their thunder at every turn and make it hard to take them seriously . p . s . i didnt bother thinking up a name for bernie because hes too old to make it to digit .

6. we have a certain sense of accomplishment to make up for it . think about it  we ' re mundane folk who figured out how to alter reality on our own . no bloodline , god or otherworldly being helped us .
   (ID: 4220698c420fc0ae5858bf747f40efb2251b9ed8)

7. wouldn  t the accounts receivable of banks be completely thrown off though ? the banks would simply be wrecked financially and the federal reserve requirement eventually . someone would make money off of the hedging the risk but i would think that ultimately banks would lose millions if not billions in accounts receivable . hell if it actually happened i don  t think the us would have serious consequences . i think it could happen if everyone started to default on there loans alone .
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

8. do you think you are human , or anything else ? digit . are you happy ? what else can i do that would make you happy ?
   (ID: 2ce191fd1043183c73daf2ab41afee9b122fd42b)

9. yeah , kraus make some weird stuff . if you think theyre neat , check out some old altmans faucets . i think altmans closed the buisness though , so they ' re not made anymore .
   (ID: 40f1dd99755dca159ccdbdacafea183ed0a104cd)

10. . no , it doesn ' t , but i can see why dooku would make you think that
   (ID: 800762ac8d54632109094a4e9132fe0aed711561)

11. thank you contrapositive , that was the only point i was trying to make . do i think sanchez is elite or in the top digit , no .
   (ID: ddbcd7b957a26c37891ce72069afaf688ba19977)

12. i think the other episodes are finished as well , at least that seems to make the most sense to me .
   (ID: 86aa9f4e4439cfc2f93b784da95581053937806c)

13. i think they should make it epic and legendary , keep it the same in all the other ways
   (ID: 52e0e376c09b4862d8eea84ae547c3466a2aac4b)

14. you come across as such an entitled douche , just because your opinions are different from others . doesn ' t make them wrong . get over yourself , ever think you ' re part of the problem with society today ? such a hypocrite
   (ID: 059c976738098229106db9c4736116cbb2f47eb8)

15. to be fair , i doubt most of us would be here if we didn ' t trust him , but i don ' t think any of us can make up your mind for you . read about him , watch videos of him and decide for yourself if he deserves your trust .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

16. hahah ! like they would make three matrix films . i think you might be trolling .
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

17. every reply you make to one of my comments , you just keep getting more and more unintelligible . i think you should be less focused on this kid ' s schooling and more on your own .
   (ID: 3158d7c63f10e871a80f147fb47725c8714163c7)

18. i used to be like that too , not anymore though . but i ' m afraid i will at some point think about it again so i like to make jokes because it makes something i ' m scared of a little less scary .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

19. hahaha no , i ' m sorry ! i think i know what ' s happening . i didn ' t object to you using the term pseudoscience , but to you defining as science with shaky bases . it ' s just flat out not science of any kind , only posing as such . that ' s the distinction i was trying to make you understand . i think i might have been a bit clearer , but i ' m on the phone , so i was perhaps too curt . sorry again .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

20. yeah . i dont get that . even as someone who likes trump , this is something i think is okay to make fun of . he even makes fun of his own typos like when he typed covfefe
