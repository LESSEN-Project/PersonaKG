3. tbh you have a very good class for pvp right now . i just leveled my stamblade up to digit this past weekend and jumped into cyrodil on him . lots of success . i have played a mageblade and i have cp cap so i have a slight advantage over you , but with the gear setup there are plenty of good combinations and the right skills slotted you shouldn ' t struggle too much . just avoid jumping the 531s all buffed up , pick off the 100s and 200s cp guys riding their mounts or oblivious on siege . once you get a good rotation picking on the little guys , then move to the big boys . if you are running 2hand always keep rally up ! it will save you !
