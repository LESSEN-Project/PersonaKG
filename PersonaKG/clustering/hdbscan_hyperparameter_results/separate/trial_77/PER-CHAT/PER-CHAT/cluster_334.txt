3. i haven ' t tried myself but there is a split screen " machine " in the yard which is basically where you start the game . then from there you select what type of game you wish to play . i said earlier i think but there ' s no single player game as such . more like a small selection of missions but i think i completed them in a couple of hours if that . think of it as a complete multiplayer game and then you won ' t be disappointed .

4. that was a brilliant game . i remember playing that when it came out  2000ish ?  and thinking that video game graphics couldn ' t possibly get any better . still think that gp4 is the best f1 game ever made apart from possibly grand prix legends .

5. give us some quotes from an obscure video game that you think you ' re the only one on the internet that knows about it , and we have to guess what the game is
