4. in my opinion , you not only keep people who made these mistakes , you utilize the experience as a preventive measure . everyone screws up . you don  t manage by fear  it sends a horrible message to employees . people who make repetitive mistakes despite appropriate training and coaching , however , should be allowed to find other employment as should people who are indifferent and unapologetic about their errors . people who screw up big things usually feel horrible about it . hopefully , the hr manager will now be a cheerleader for caution and security and that may be a better outcome than replacing them .

6. so many talk about climate change because it ' s cool and do a couple of meaningless actions that make them feel better about themselves . if you truly care then don ' t have kids , that has a real positive impact on climate .

8. it could be enforceable though , we don  t have all the information . they could have security , this could be closer to lighting and security and that  s why it is designated for women . i have no idea why people seem to have such a problem with this , if it is your wife  mother returning to her car late at night wouldn  t this make you feel better ?
