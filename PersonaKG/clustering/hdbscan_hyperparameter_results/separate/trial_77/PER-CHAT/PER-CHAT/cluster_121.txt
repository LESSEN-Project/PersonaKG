1. you  ll go through about an hour or so of practicing the moves on the ground with the guys who will be strapped on to you , they never once talked about what to do if you wanted to back out , so the thought was never in your mind . when you get up in the plane , they  ll talk you through it while you reach altitude . when you reach altitude , you don  t have much time before they pretty much throw you out of the airplane . it was fun , i was excited to do it so i was never scared of it .
