4. i  m really open to anything , preferably something light  comedic and from stage . i want to do something that is not over done . the only requirement is that the piece is not something overdone , for example i wouldn  t do something from meryl streep just as her pieces are constantly being used by students similarly , i wouldn  t use a monologue from a chorus line . i want something that my professor hasn  t seen before or something rarely done .

16. what you really want to do is find out what exactly is the source of your back pain . it could be a rib out of place , a rotated hip , twisted tailbone , bulging disc , etc . then you can start exercises to target those . if it ' s just generic sore muscles , then you would benefit from strength training to keep those muscles in shape .

17. to the men of reddit  we really don ' t want to see your penis , which is why we hide it in orifices thanks

20. i have no idea , but i really want to know now i would assume so , coz it ' s just like different breeds of cats or dogs reproducing together . tho it might be that the dragons are all too proud to do that , and want to keep their bloodlines pure
