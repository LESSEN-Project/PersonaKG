1. i ' d say no . but i think a lot of it is personal bias or what one would prefer to watch .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

2. why is so hard for me to think of original things to say or do ?
   (ID: c5b665e8ba18adb2125a557bd8ecbb0654907c67)

4. i wouldn  t say your original post came off as humble . i didn  t think it was arrogant though . all i have to say is , if the women that you  re talking to desire you more when you  re being a jerk , they must have no self  esteem .

5. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .

6. you might think we ' re done . but no matter what you say , we will complete this dungeon . if rocks fall and yolnaak dies , so be it .
