1. i do not believe in the anthropomorphic view of god . i think that everything has a reason and the reason that the universe exists is god , but that god is likely nothing like what we could imagine , that it doesn  t listen to our prayers , and that there is likely no afterlife . perhaps god resides within the universal constants or something completely whacky compared to established religions . so theres a lot i don  t know or have an answer to , but i do think there is a reason that everything exists and that is what i believe . although i am hopeful that i am wrong and that there is an afterlife and some spirit in the sky that cares about us simply because its a lot less bleak then simply dying and decaying . i also have a lot if respect for the culture and morals that religions establish

2. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !
