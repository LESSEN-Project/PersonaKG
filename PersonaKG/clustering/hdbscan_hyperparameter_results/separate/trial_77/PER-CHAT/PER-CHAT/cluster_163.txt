8. exactly , you ' re not here to entertain me , but this post was meant to entertain whether or not it ' s for easy karma is a different matter . this is the first time i saw this , and judging from all the up doots , i ' d say i ' m not the only one . nothing is original because someone is always going to say it first , all that matters is how and when you do it .
