Total from this dataset: 5

1. a sect ? or maybe just call it by the name of the group . i think namenerds is more about names for people or characters or pets , rather than words in general . you might have better luck on another subreddit .

2. some would argue if a company has interviewers who get off on asking overly technical questions you ' d be better off not working there . just something to think when you choose to grill people with random unrelated  to  work algorithm questions .

3. i have many hobbies . if you are inferring arguing with you is a hobby of mine , i can assure you it is not . i just think you ' re wrong , and you clearly are unable to handle people disagreeing with you , as evidenced by you telling me to get a new hobby .

4. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .

5. i think you are an upstanding member of a higher functioning society . i agree with you on all points . and i greatly appreciate that you have replied to people disagreeing with you . it ' s just a shame that none seems open minded to it .
