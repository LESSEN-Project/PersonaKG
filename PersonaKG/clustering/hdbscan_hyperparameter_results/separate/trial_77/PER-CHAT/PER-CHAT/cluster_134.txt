4. this happened to me the first time i took the test . the only thing that helped me was to find something else to occupy your mind . whether it ' s a tv show you binge i rewatched the office , a new workout i started walking  stretching  and spinning more , or something else , just find something where you can kind of let your brain turn off for a bit . do that at least once a day . once i started that , i mostly stopped perseverating on something i couldn ' t change .
