1. i hate when i hear about girls who say guys suck in bed so they have to fake an orgasm . its so hypocritical . they are literally the reason he  s bad . like if u fake an orgasm , theyre basically telling him  good job . keep doing that . its great

2. i think your problem begins when you state " i would be a good boyfriend , " and proceed to list off all these other reasons why you ' re supposedly " amazing . " i ' d say you ' re your own worst enemy here .

5. yeah . its good but here ls a lesson i learned for communicating online . you never know who is on the other end , so never say something you might regret . what if your parent uses reddit and gets into an argument with you ? total exaggeration but you get the point
