10. have to be honest , if i saw you in passing i ' d assume you are a " queen " who has all her stuff together and plenty of suitors . i guess this is a reminder to me that i can ' t assume anything , even if someone looks perfect to me  i just never know how they are feeling inside . thank you for sharing !

12. i know that ' s how it happens , but the placebo effect is effective sometimes . i ' m just saying that somebody is very religious will have more chance of believing they are being healed . so more chance of them actually improving .

13. i dont know if this is cheating since the official album version has vocals , but the anthology version of " eleanor rigby " with just the orchestra is amazing . better than revolver ' s version imo

15. sorry but i know nothing about modding . do rtdl emulations exist already ? and if so are they laggy like you said ? or is it just laggy when trying to mod ? anyway , keep up the cool work !

16. i know they are different , i just didn ' t know if they are different versions of the flash or something . for example you can buy ' the flash ' pops from the tv show . you know this because the logo at the top of the box reflects this . i didn ' t know if one of these flash pops in the picture are from dc universe online or something . i cannot find any info on the reason for the change in logo to just release the same pop , with a slightly different costume .
