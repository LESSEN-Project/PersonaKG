1. much more difficult , the initial barrage is much more intense and han will kill ewoks on his turn . you are out geared , out zetaed and with far from optimized team . i ' d say maybe with digit tries you could get it . if you have the crystals to spare and the sanity to withstand hours upon hours of waiting for perfect rng i ' d say fuck it , do it . otherwise just wait digit months . do you intend on using him in the hsr ? if not , there is no difference in getting him from digit to digit star .
