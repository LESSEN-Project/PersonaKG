6. you ' re pretty self  congratulatory about your relationship , but the examples you give further down are far different than the struggles some people have in their relationships . failed exam ? not getting promoted ? that ' s life . if you have to pat yourself on the back for staying with someone through that then perhaps you have a different and privileged lens . my read on this thread is that their partner has persistent deep rooted issues that aren ' t improving despite ops best efforts and support . it can take the relationship beyond saving , and it ' s important to recognize that and take care of yourself   if all other options have failed . so revolution outcast ,  digit for the advice from half  elfbard .

7. im digit and a recovering alcoholic . alcohol has ruined my life . most people drink so technically yes . this is something that makes you ' stand out ' but dont con  notate my words here , it makes you stand out in the absolute best way possible . maybe itll never create an issue in your life if you get drunk a few times , but looking over here from the other side of things , it only left me broke , with ruined relationships , guilt and shame . onward brethren i wish you the best outcome of whatever your life story has written . iwndwyt

10. this is true . add to the fact that our entire media system tends to be owned by very few people and those same few people often own parts of other corporations . what results is a media system that becomes nearly incestuous , promoting other parts of itself sister companies , subsidiaries , etc . at the expense of doing its original job reporting accurately . tl  dr  our media companies are all conglomerates , we ' re turning into a real  life idiocracy .

11. probably because like a lot of people , you can ' t see any breaks or you quitting in the future , because you have to work to continually sustain  afford your life . it ' s a seemingly indefinite commitment .
