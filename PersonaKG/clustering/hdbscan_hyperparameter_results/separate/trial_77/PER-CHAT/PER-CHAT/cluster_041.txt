7. it ' s been a really rough year for me and it ' s so encouraging to see jack so happy and kind . what i love most about jack is that he really seems to care . i get a feeling that he has less of a " youtube persona " and more that on youtube he shows off a true energetic and happy side of himself .

8. the problem is that if you love someone , you really can ' t settle for just being friends with them . you really can ' t . it hurts . i ' ve been in this situation multiple times , and i can completely understand someone being frustrated by this , but you have to consider the possibility that it hurts to love someone who doesn ' t love you back . i hope that cleared something up !
