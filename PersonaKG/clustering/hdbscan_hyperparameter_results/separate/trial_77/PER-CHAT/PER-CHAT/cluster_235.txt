1. these people are the definition of selfish . they don ' t think anything about their grandchildren , because they don ' t give a shit about them . they care purely for themselves .

2. i just don ' t see how you are allowing yourself to go through the torture of bible camp . maybe you don ' t think it so bad , but i cringe of the even thinking about being forced to go to a place where i ' m surrounded by people who have completely different ideologies as i .

3. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?

5. i agree porn isn ' t the healthiest  most ethical of things . but i don ' t think anyone has ever used the pornhub app to kill a room full of people because his penis was feeling extra tiny that week . priorities .

6. i don ' t see why people think the subject of abortion is funny . it ' s like saying sids or miscarriage is funny . none of those things are .

7. after reading a lot of mmo forums and seeing a lot of crazy things yes , i do believe he was serious . if you think people don ' t have that viewpoint , you should put aside your own bias .
