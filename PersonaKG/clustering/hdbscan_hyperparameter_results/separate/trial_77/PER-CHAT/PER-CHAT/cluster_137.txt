4. i  m sorry , but it does have to do with religion . it was largely a rejection of paganism by the levites that brought it to the forefront of judeo  christian  morality  . it was reinforced throughout greece and rome by the spread of christianity and wedged its way through northern european society by way of brute force and religious indoctrination . it may have started as a cultural phenomenon , but it only held on through the passing of religion as if that was ever a passive process , but that  s a totally different conversation . to argue it has nothing to do with religion is as intellectually dishonest as it is historically inaccurate .
