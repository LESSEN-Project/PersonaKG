3. england are very good at starting things , bands , tv shows , arguments , wars etc and brits have a unique way of doing things which seems to work . maybe it  s our personality , humour , mindset who knows but you can  t deny that a lot of good comes out of it .

4. wear the toughest full plate you can get your hands on and find a mudcrab . let it hit you over and over , casting healing spells to stay alive , or burning through low level health potions . save frequently , as this can sometimes cause issues with crashes though this has been very rare for me and because you may occasionally get attacked by something more formidable when you ' re not expecting it far more common . there ' s a good spot downriver , east of whiterun that i have used several times for this . you may also want to have a shield with you , as this is a good way to level block as well .

6. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .
