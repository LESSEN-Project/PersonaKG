1. yeah i agree , i kinda expected more of a  hows the internets work  kinda stuff , not  let  s laugh at conservatives who were laughing at liberals .  i get it  in the us a lot of grandmas are proper , god fearing conservatives and their email forwards and facebook tags would reflect that . but my grandma still sends me  satan thinks you won  t forward this to three people you love , jesus has faith folded  hands in you  type shit .

4. most of your critiques  praises are based off the film ticking  not ticking your agenda . bisexual warrior queen ? lol mmkay . people love valkyrie because shes an awesome character , period . not because of her briefly hinted sexuality from a deleted scene .
