1. that ' s honestly worse to me . none of the dozen people in the household noticed the kid was gone , or if they did none of them said anything . usually in big families the older kids are at least partially talked with watching the younger ones . several people dropped the ball .

4. congrats on your progress . i should do more sports myself , but i absolutely dislike jogging , i imagine people staring at me and judging me , how did you get yourself to actually do it ? also why do you dislike jewish velociraptors ?

5. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself

6. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?

8. did anyone else see the espn headline that said " digit black head coaches were fired this year ? how do people come up with this shit to complain about .
   (ID: e84ec39cf97c9609b6feb31cbaab5faf551f372d)

9. i ' m a go ahead and disagree with you on that one as many people have already said the kid is digit and should already know how to treat other people property regardless and the kid did offer to pay the whole digit so op let him of easily .

10. if you don  t enjoy it and find no meaning from it at all from reading the book twice , then why are you attempting to force yourself to enjoy it through people who did ? if you didn  t like it then that should be the end of it , no ?
