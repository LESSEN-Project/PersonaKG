2. since you ' re asking this ill assume your digit or younger . sleeping with her friends might work , but it ' s a stupid idea i learned the hard way . if you ' re in the friendzone doing anything else will be a waste of time .

3. if the fight isn ' t going your way don ' t be afraid to run . there are times when what ever you do it won ' t be enough to save your intended target so run . if you ' re out of commission for digit  seconds while dead that ' s valuable time you can be regrouping at a fob or prepping your allies for the next fight . it works pretty well and always recall your drones if they are getting destroyed by flak or pd cannons .

4. the entire premise of the movies is that they are in our universe , in a galaxy far far away , a long time ago . so if it ' s set in our own universe , then the same physics must apply . okay , if the same physics must apply , then there shouldn ' t be any force and so the movies shouldn ' t be made . oh and it ' s the same physics so lightsabers can ' t exist . their residual heat would cook you alive if you wielded one . oh , and light speed . yeah , that ' s stupid and should never have been added since we can ' t travel faster than light . any of the movies can be picked apart for its lack of realism . so many hooks in the other movies were added for simply making the story move in a way they wanted .
