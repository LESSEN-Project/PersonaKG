1. nah , it doesn  t suck . i actually really like it . i feel like it  s something everyone can relate to , and while it is personal to you , almost all of us could probably pick up on the meaning without your explanation .

2. i have to agree with regenboog as you progress through your transition you will feel more comfortable with yourself and your femininity will come through nauturally . clothes are a different matter , if you are pre hrt , its really about how confident you are .

3. hey man you do you , but your story makes me feel a lot better about taking a quick sniff and then putting them back . haha . i felt really guilty about it and never let myself do stuff like that again .

4. something that relates to a talent or a goal of theirs , especially if it ' s a little bit beyond them . for example , if they like drawing , get them some really nice pens or paper , so they feel both validated in their craft but also inspired to do more .

5. getting up from bed to pee . i just feel really lazy . i end up holding it until i actually have to go bad

6. how are you ? well , now that you ask my hemorrhoids are acting up again and i feel really constipated today . so when i leave the room it is probably to take a shit .

7. i feel for the man , i really do , but i figure if someone that old living with someone that sick still goes to work every day , there ' s a pretty damn good reason for that in their minds anyway and she probably thought leaving him in a cafe was better or safer or kind than leaving him at home . my knee jerk reaction was to condemn the wife for her actions but reading the whole story i really feel for them both .
