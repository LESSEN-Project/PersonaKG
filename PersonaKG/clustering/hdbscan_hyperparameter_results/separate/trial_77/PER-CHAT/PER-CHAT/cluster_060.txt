3. i was thinking something similar . it was difficult to see the way a lot of the americans think . it was also hard to not respond to any of them . what would be the point . my words won ' t change the way they think .

6. whenever people find their way here they always think it will be like " the one that flew over the cukoos nest " with lobotomy and ect though electroconvulsive therapy is not that medival and in reality greatly assists those suffering from long term depression , it is literally like a whole new person comes out . not lobotimized , more like a medical miracle . plus the media only focuses on the dramatic rather than the relatable , tragically .

7. it is . i think it should stay that way , though . it should cost either less stamina or be nearly instant instead of its current state .

8. i think a lot of this comes down to the definitions of coercion and seduction . yes , in seduction the idea is to do your best to be enticing to someone . however , this should not be confused with a bending of their will or a manipulation . coercion is doing whatever is necessary to achieve a desired response from someone else , including putting extra pressures on them , which can be easily done if the coercing party is in a position of power , whether that is physical strength , employment , or status . seduction is like giving someone all green lights , coercion is like trying to take the steering wheel .

10. sorry you had to see that . has it shaped you in any way ? or do you think or act differently because of what you witnessed ? sorry if the questions aren ' t posed appropriately . genuinely curious about your experience if you ' re cool with it .

11. i think there are a couple , softwares and stuff you can use through pc . but this is the only  vanilla  way of doing it off the top of my head
   (ID: 0f6c6c4bd3531c7f028b4bf901123522dd67c300)

12. i used to be an extreme example of this . i ' d assume intercourse meant he loved me and ultimately wanted to marry and have kids with me . thank god for guy friends setting me straight . main reason to disclose and have some sort of talk is to filter out girls who think the way i used to . they may not be stalker psychos but were simply raised with a certain set of beliefs and have peers who share them .

13. same way as gru  have someone else do it before i even think to
   (ID: 4220698c420fc0ae5858bf747f40efb2251b9ed8)

14. i don  t think you can find yourself that way . it takes deep thought .
