10. they why has the whole logo changed at the top of box changed ? marvel bobble heads do not change like this . for example , you have the punisher funko pop . there are a few different versions . the marvel logo remains the same , but they just put the different version in in brackets by the name . ie ' the punisher thunderbolts '

12. ah yes , the worldwide  feared british nukes would totally scare russia into submission , it ' s not like russia has c  300s that are proven to be capable of stopping nato ' s balistic missiles or anything like that . also , if russia were to produce just one more tsar bomba  class nuke and drop it on top of the british isles , the uk is gone and so is ireland , the northern part of france , the benelux and possibly parts of nothwestern germany .
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

   (ID: 44f5ba2e2e79c07f77ae334e708119f166a6aca0)

20. stumbling through the club , the lights strobing so i can ' t see where my feet are planted and it feels like my body is being chopped up into different sections , and this songhttps    just blaring . finally unable to keep my balance , i accidentally pitch forward , i fall down . and someone turns up the music .
