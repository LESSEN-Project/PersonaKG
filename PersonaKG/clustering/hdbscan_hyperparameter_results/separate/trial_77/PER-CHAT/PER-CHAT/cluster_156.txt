2. from what i understood is that you ' re wife is basically boycotting you in bed for weeks at a time . you should know that according to the hadith , the angels curse her until dawn for that and she is constantly sinning . your ' fantasy ' about getting a second wife is not haram . allah has made it halal for a reason , and if you can fulfill the requirements , go for it ! otherwise , this can be reasonable grounds for divorce . allahu ' alam .
