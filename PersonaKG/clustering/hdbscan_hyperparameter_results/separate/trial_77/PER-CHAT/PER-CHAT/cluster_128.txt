1. when people ask me to do this , i explain the coupons are based on what you purchase , so there is no store card . they can sign up for their own if they want . end of story .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

4. it was mostly just talk , and they acted like they were showing what the people want , even though a lot of people wanted pewdiepie to be in it , or the whole jake paul suicide forest ordeal .

5. people seem to hate seeing other people talk about themselves on all social media platforms these days . mentioning your own projects  streams  blog posts  youtube videos on your own god  damn profile is now seen as extremely spammy by a lot of people . i have no idea why there has been such a shift in what is now appropriate to post about on one ' s own profile . i say , it ' s your profile , talk about whatever you want to talk about . promote she shit out of yourself , and give the people who want to bitch about it , a giant middle finger .

6. literally this . like do you want it to get to the point where people are detained for four years ? or sent to hard labor ? or killed by the thousands ? no . that ' s why we gotta call this what it is and put a stop to it for fuck ' s sake .
   (ID: 3adf883c491ca030d52ee22ed62e166c87ed0d5e)

7. what the fuck do you want me to do instead ? go outside and talk to actual people ? pfft .

8. nah . you two are obviously looking for different people . you want a first date hookup and she wants something more long term . at least you were blunt and now you both know how the other feels .
   (ID: 90779ea1e5aa2ec3ed3a1fa6b99a8207c0d66d3e)

9. this is absurd . people who want to drive just drive . public transit complaints , like the other guy who replied to me said , are from people who want to take public transit but are put off because it is dangerous , fucking stinks , and compares jarringly bad to boot if you ' ve used trains in other developed countries .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

10. i want all the sex with all the people and im cool with however they want ti do it . i use to get a lot of it , its one of the worst parts about leaving the world and starting my own society of one where nobody judges you or takes all your stuff and makes you homeless .
   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

11. i use this subreddit for fun . this topic wasn ' t marked serious . if people want to overanalyze a comment , that ' s up to them .
   (ID: 68698bd86019a86cb34a8b2e28c6324727011b28)

12. apparently i am the one who needs to grow a backbone , when everyone here can ' t cope with someone not giving them what they want . honestly , some people .
   (ID: fe56409176d2a6089f323227d5b07061f851d63b)

13. ever country shows certain degree of hypocrisy . when there are so many people in a single country , long term rational decisions are tough to take as humans tend to give more weightage to short term experiences while making decisions . also in democracy leader who want to come to power again , it ' s easier to take actions which seems sweet for short term . that migrant worker construction  worker most probably , isn ' t gonna vote .
   (ID: a168763c82b90dc18ccbbd57533eec2e49d17dc7)

14. it ' s amazing how long the list of shit people want is , it ' s never ending
   (ID: 50043497a219924fd275a92e5dadb6e04bac5936)

15. no shit . blacks are basically a protected species it seems . they do fuck all as a people besides crime , of course , yet you can  t even stare wrongly at them unless you want some problems .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

16. why would you want to hide your personality ? i see it as expressing your true self to people , because i have been liying to people for too long . on the other hand there is the argument that , well accourse it ' s just a hobby and that people shouldn ' t care what hobbies you have , but lets be honest , who ' s personality hasn ' t changed because of the fandom ?
   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

17. makes me wonder why those people never injure themselves on purpose . it ' s a doctor ' s job to fix them . why would they want to take that opportunity from them ?
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

18. kendall , and because people want to fuck them
