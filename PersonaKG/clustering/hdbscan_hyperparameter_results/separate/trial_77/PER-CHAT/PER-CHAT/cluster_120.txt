7. awesome , i ' ll be sure to innerfidelity out . i doubt i ' ll end up buying new headphones now , i like the hd599s and ill see if listening to them as you said opens my eyes a little . but the explenation of akg and beyerdynamic will be super helpful when i inevitably do decide to buy another pair thanks for the help , once again

8. not sure about these specific parts , but something i always bear in mind is that official accessories hold their resale value far better than any third party parts do . if you do end up selling on your kit , it ' ll be a lot easier to sell it with the official grip .
