Total from this dataset: 251

1. my father taught me to always hold a door open . for people . it is in the guise of manners . we as well mannered people you and i both will do things for other people that are nice . i hold the door open for people , pull out a chair , help you put on your coat , carry your bags and it is all because of good manners . if i were to do the opposite  walk through the door without holding it , leave you to carry all your own bags etc . would you feel that i am being rude ? i don ' t know because i don ' t know you . maybe you would feel angry that i am just looking after myself . maybe you would feel happy that i wasn ' t assuming that you needed my help . but i know that i would feel rude . the way i was brought up was to help people and to have good manners . that is probably why benevolent sexism happens , people really feel as though they are doing the right thing . as for the calling people honey or sweetie , i am with you on that . i get called that by old ladies " oh aren ' t you a sweetie " that guest at my hotel . but if someone were to say in a certain context i can understand your frustrations . like a lot of things i think there is a line that you cross when you act too familiar . but don ' t be embarrassed for you , be embarrassed for them for not knowing correct social etiquette .

2. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .

3. you need to be assertive about this . the template for an assertive statement is " i feel  when you do   , and i wish you would    " in this situation you could say " i feel sad or maybe uncherished , neglected , abandoned , or lonely ? when you don ' t get to know my family , and i would like you to come to thanksgiving dinner and talk to them " please learn this and use it . it must be said calmly and conversationally without expectation of changing his behavior . you are clearly stating your emotions and the behaviour of your ideal mate . if he still refuses to change his behavior , then you should decide if you can visit your family without him for the rest of your life .

4. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

5. i suppose i have some perspective in a way from your girlfriends point of view as i think my girlfriend has similer feelings as i ' m still close friends with a guy i slept with the guy and i where friends long before i should add and it was a one time thing i know it kinda makes her uncomfortable so i try to take in to consideration her feelings about hanging out with him such as i would be with him alone but shes okayish with it because she trusts me .   x200b  so i guess what im saying in your gf case she must feel pressured by her ex into keeping contact and feels terrible about it , i say just try and support her as dealing with abusive ex partners can be a rough experience

6. he ' s digit years older than you and you ' re gonna have a miserable life ahead of you if you stay . you gotta worry about yourself first . you do what you think you need to do .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

7. to justify spending the money i make , i ask myself " why the hell do you work so hard " it ' s to spend my money they way i want . why do you work so hard to give someone else a comfy life ? they didn ' t take your tests or experience your stress . you have no obligation to pay for someone else just because you make more . also , you ' re not her ex . you ' re you . be you , don ' t try to be them , they split for a reason . to answer your question , i say don ' t compare yourself to someone ' s ex . you can either feel guilty , or you can go broke .

8. yes she is very close to her stepmother . you asked about our relationship , we have been in a de facto relationship for about digit . digit years now . i have been doing what i can to comfort her and be there for her . i took her out to lunch today i actually wrote this post on the drive home to take her mind off of things and get out of the house . at the moment she is ok then bursts into tears at random times so all i can do is hug her , tell her i love her and let her cry it out . when she was told she cried and then asked to be left alone for a while so if she needs some space i think she will tell me . thank you for the advice , there is a lot there to take in so i will have to read it a few times . her stepmother still might pull through and beat it , but all we can do at this stage is hope for the best . thank you again for helping me understand and giving me pointers on how to approach this .

9. let them know you ' re genuinely sorry , then step away and give them space to process .

10. me . all my life . i  ve embraced my sensitivity trough , i  m not ashamed of it anymore . you can learn ways to use it to your advantage . i actually believe we are meant to be empathetic , all of us . wishing you the best . please take care of yourself . much love .

11. it sound that those people in your life are holding you back and that isn  t good for mental health . i  m not saying you should get rid of them but certainly make them aware that your life is more than chores or work and everyone needs a hobby and shouldn  t have to hide it .

12. nta  i mean it is a dick move to break up over text that way especially while someone  s deployed . however , i don  t think that matters given that he was an abuser and a deployment would give you a chance to leave him without him reacting violently , not letting you , etc . his reaction of threatening to hunt you down says everything about him , what  s he going to do ? beat you ? kill you ? you don  t need such a horrible man in your life . maybe it  d have been more respectful to do it over video or phone i guess but that also just would have opened you to more abusive traumatizing behavior from him , probably would have been worse to hear it in those ways rather than text anyway . i  m sorry for what you  ve gone thru and the decisions you  ve had to make here . as for your friend , does she know how he  s treated you ?

13. honestly be i  d not say anything , ignorance is bliss but nta tbh if you told him although i  d rather live in bliss and not know it  s over all better to be told hurt and move on just be direct about it but be kind if you get me

14. on your third date , hump him awkwardly at a phish show . it ' s the only way .   x200b  raves are a special thing . i wouldn ' t bring someone around who made me feel awkward a third time . and there ' s nothing wrong with keeping looking for someone who has long term potential or at the very least is more compatible now !

15. i mean you could just ask if he wants to hang out just the two of you , and if je suggests more friends to bring take it as a hint he doesn ' t like you like that .

16. some people like to compartmentalize certain parts of their life and its completely natural . if you warm up to them and show you can really vibe this can change .

17. hey there , i know you have gotten some good advice and i know you have gotten some sketchy advice . im about to give you middle of the road advice . lol . i dont think you need to have some long drawn out serious " come to jesus " talk with your boyfriend . a simple statement like you made should suffice . if you say no more sex without a condom that should be fine . you dont even have to be mean or demanding about it , just make the statement , as i think you already have and then just make sure that the penis never touches the vagina without a condom . you can put it on for him , you can have one ready or close by , or just ask him to put one on . i think if you make too big of a deal about it that it will kinda of put the blame on him and it is digit  his fault but its digit  your fault too . not that i am trying to make you feel bad , that kind of stuff happens sometimes . if for whatever reason he doesn ' t want to play along then a more serious talk is required , but i don ' t think the first conversation about it needs to be too over the top . i know as a male that if i were told no more sex without a condom , i could take that at face value and move on without a big long discussion about it . i ' m hoping your bf is the same way .

18. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

19. honestly i think you should go get a makeover and try focusing on your own beauty . i could see how that  s irritating and tbh i don  t even know how you would begin to deal with that but maybe ask her to tone it down with talking with you or maybe find another outlet for support ? idk if i felt this way i  d get my hair done and go shopping maybe get laser hair removal just feel good for yourself .
   (ID: c502154cdae9232a9351bdc0e55d2030d75a8094)

20. if i were to stay with her , i would try my best to give her attention back and be the best boyfriend i could be . that  s not how i could see myself as an asshole . the way i could , would be me losing my patience and leaving in two months .
