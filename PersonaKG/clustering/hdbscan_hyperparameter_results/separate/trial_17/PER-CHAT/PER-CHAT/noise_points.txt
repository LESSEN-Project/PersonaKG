3. triangulation would be , worse case , one parent and the child siding against the other parent re the same child . your marriage has to be rock solid and discipline and responses should be discussed and prepared for ahead of time . the child needs to feel safe . so , just like most little ones , if you  re not responding they  ll ll go to your spouse and vice versa . communication and open discussions with both parents and the child are essential . i can not recommend jarrett  s book enough . jarrett  s book gives specific examples

10. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?

12. i always arrive super early to stuff because i  m anxious about being late , so i got to starbucks like digit minutes early . this is obviously just a casual coffee date , i met the guy online , wanted to get to know him irl . i order a drink and sit down to wait on my laptop . the guy arrives digit minutes early and comes to greet me and asks if i want a drink . i say no because i already have one . he suddenly gets really upset he can  t buy me a drink . keeps asking me to let him buy one , or even weirder , kept offering to give me money for the one i already paid for ? i just keep saying no , it  s alright , i  m a grown woman lol . so he gets a drink and kinda sulks for the rest of the date , like keeps giving one word answers , doesn  t ask me anything . as soon as i finished my drink he asked to buy me one and i said i actually needed to leave . it was just bizarre .

14. nah i didn ' t really give a shit excuse my language about obama . i voted for him , but he never got my feathered rustled like bernie can . bernie stands up there and says exactly what i would say digit  of the time . obama talks like someone wrote it for him or he wrote it himself the night before . i believe other people like me are ready to make a real revolution with bernie . i never felt that way , not one second for barack .

15. because the heat of the sun , and the amount of water and salt and all the time that it ' s been there . there is more water and more area affected by that than in your glass of water . although maybe it ' s an interesting experiment if you put lot of salt in a small container , you heat it up and when you ' re gonna smell it , you cover you head and the container with a towel . if you try it , let me know what happens .

19. as far as changing faces go , i think the recent idea is political correctness run amok in regards to harriet tubman . if the treasury dept . really wants to honor this important woman , then create a much needed bill in a new denomination . and make sure she isn ' t frowning .
