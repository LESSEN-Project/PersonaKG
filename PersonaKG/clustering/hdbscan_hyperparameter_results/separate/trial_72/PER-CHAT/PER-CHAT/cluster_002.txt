SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 34

1. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .

2. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path

3. digit you don  t have to meet him if you don  t want to . lots of people never really get closure , and that sucks , but really what is the goal here anyways ? you could easily exchange longer messages over email or something and give him closure that way . digit why are you so concerned about the image he has of you ? are you hoping that something will be rekindled ? otherwise i feel shattering that image that he has of you will probably just help him move on and you won  t have to hear from the ex again . digit even if you do meet up , you don  t actually have to reveal any information about yourself that you don  t want to . just keep it vague . there  s nothing wrong with just broadly answering  i  m taking out some time to figure out my life , i  ve grown out of x interest  etc . if the subject of what you  re doing these days comes up .

4. most people have some form of guilt built up especially if it ' s a recent occurrence . if you raised the concerns and genuinely wanted to unfold the truth and try to fix things i can ' t see a reason he would continue the affair .   x200b  if you ' re that concerned once you ' re together , get him in a quiet space where you both have timesomething like a car and ask if you can take a look at his phone . straight up , no gimmicks , just say " may i go through your phone to make sure we ' re both on the same page . you should be able to tell right away if he has something to hide .   x200b  however , be careful because this could stir something up that wasn ' t there in the first place . this brings us back to the main point , that being straight forward is always better than snooping . no questions asked if i was dating a girl and she snooped through any of my personal effects the relationship would be done .

5. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart

6. i suggest offering to do it for him with a sock , and setting aside a  special sock drawer  . people have weird sex things , and you learn them as you get to know them better and better . if you  re honest , you probably have a few of your own weird  things  . a . m . i right ?
   (ID: afb309c0f8d875957ab1e2c406a762b6127668b6)

7. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

8. that i can understand . i communicate with him whenever he visits , or i would give him a call once a month . but i would agree that i don ' t share my feelings with him .
   (ID: 011a531fc3f706d76441a0f95cc8091fd4453dd8)

9. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .
   (ID: 6f13975ce6a8747ec3d0e2207b9ef86d80a28713)

10. you do what it takes . if doesn ' t hurt him for you to fantasize . if you tell him what you just told us , it will bruise his ego .
   (ID: d06e7949138d7c04b968c15f3dd6f37d07c5a670)

11. i don ' t think the issue here is that you asked for his last name . maybe you should just take his words at face value  that it ' s taken so long to actually meet up , that he ' s lost interest . but to answer your question  i personally don ' t usually like to give out my full name to someone before meeting them because of social media stalking . i mean it ' d be pretty hard for anyone to stalk me anyways because i don ' t use my full name anywhere besides facebook and my setting for that is pretty restricted , but still . also why did you feel the need to know his full name anyways ?
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

12. what you ' re telling me sounds like he doesn ' t care and it makes you feel bad , so leave him . you deserve to be cared about . don ' t let anyone tell you what you care about isn ' t enough .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

13. bad break up ? if so you got to let it go . if not , then go outside and explore somewhere where people are accepting , like a sports bar or social clubs or something where you can add to peoples conversations

14. people with special needs , intellectual disabilities and autism aren ' t often good with hints . tell him it ' s time for him to leave , it will probably be more a lot more comfortable and less stressful for him than trying to figure out why you ' re acting strange and different to when he first arrived .

15. i am sorry if thats completely wrong what i am gonna say , because i don ' t have experience . but wouldn ' t it be possible to stretch your skin slowly before engaging in penetrativ sex . maybe take some extra 10min before , where you stretch and work the skin back slowly with some lubricant . sure this may not be the most sexy thing to do in the middle of a heated moment with you so , but a serious partner should be supportive when it just during the waiting period . if this doesn ' t work , you can also find sexual pleasures without engaging in something like penetrativ sex , where a retracting foreskin is required . a oily handjob over the skin could probably make me come even without having direct contact to the penis glans . and if you are into butt stuff , this could be the time to explore some new ideas .

16. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .

17. hey there , i know you have gotten some good advice and i know you have gotten some sketchy advice . im about to give you middle of the road advice . lol . i dont think you need to have some long drawn out serious " come to jesus " talk with your boyfriend . a simple statement like you made should suffice . if you say no more sex without a condom that should be fine . you dont even have to be mean or demanding about it , just make the statement , as i think you already have and then just make sure that the penis never touches the vagina without a condom . you can put it on for him , you can have one ready or close by , or just ask him to put one on . i think if you make too big of a deal about it that it will kinda of put the blame on him and it is digit  his fault but its digit  your fault too . not that i am trying to make you feel bad , that kind of stuff happens sometimes . if for whatever reason he doesn ' t want to play along then a more serious talk is required , but i don ' t think the first conversation about it needs to be too over the top . i know as a male that if i were told no more sex without a condom , i could take that at face value and move on without a big long discussion about it . i ' m hoping your bf is the same way .

18. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

19. i dont believe anyone truly gets over their first love , its an internal battle but you ' ll eventually realize you love the idea of him rather than the person . the biggest thing i noticed is even when you were madly inlove with eachother , you were always going to him , mentally and physically . you seemed to be putting more into the relationship than him and thats not a good thing . a healthy relationship requires balance , obviously sometimes the scale is tipped but it takes you both to balance it back out . my advice is to live in the moment rather than the past . its not uncommon to miss him , frankly it would be inhuman to completely try to erase him from your memory . what you need it more balance , but for yourself . dont let your emotions and memories tip your scale , keep your new memories and your new emotions in check on the other end . meet new people , focus on your school work , and ensure you ' re traveling forward rather than backwards . he has moved on , maybe not with the best intentions but you need to move on as well . try to open your heart to the possibity of him being happy without you and you being happy without him . if you can both realise you ' re happy without one another , you will finally have some closure . a stepping stone to happiness is forgiveness and remorse . know what you did to his current relationship and see what you can do to fix it . i hope you can take something from this . best of luck .

20. i don ' t really feel like he holds me back , but my life isn ' t the way i want it to be living with him . i ' m gonna say the same shit everyone else says , i do love him and i enjoy being with him . but lately it doesn ' t feel the same . he ' s a good person but i feel like i don ' t really like him anymore . maybe it ' s my mindset but i feel like we don ' t have fun or enjoy each other ' s company . but if i leave i know i ' ll miss him and be sad . i ' m not going to go jump on another guys dick .
