1. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

2. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .

3. cut your loss and move on . obviously easier said than done but sitting around wondering what you did wrong , why she would do that , etc . is only going to make the hurt last longer . just do your best to forget about it and maybe try something easy like tinder to keep you distracted . you don ' t need to use it for sex or anything unless you want to but talking to girls on there is super easy . keeps me distracted when i am hung up on someone .

4. you have the right to be upset or angry , or any other emotion you are having right now . your wife needs to know exactly how you feel and take ownership for causing it your wife should be willing to do anything for you that would help you build that trust back up . no more expectations of privacy , no more hidden anything in her life . she needs to be an open book . look at her bank account , check her on  line presence , monitor her calls , get all of her passwords , and  or whatever you feel is needed . then you need to work on regaining that trust . if this is going to be a life sentence for her , then end the marriage now . you need to work toward her having privacy again some day . just not right now . there is no such thing as too much communication in smarriage .

5. she needs to get out of her mind that she is being  forced  . nah , fuck that shit . i rather have my family be mad at me than see that pos . part of being an adult is looking out for your wellbeing cause most the time family doesn  t understand that . good luck .

6. first and foremost you ' re doing great already . to some extent a stubborn stressed woman in the third tri is going to require you to roll with a lot of punches no matter what . it ' s entirely possible that what she needs most sometimes , fair or not , is a punching bag to let off some of the steam she has to keep repressed with nearly everyone in her life . my best advice otherwise , try proving to her you ' re doing what you can by getting her to expound on her feelings rather than trying to refute them . she says you ' re not stepping up to the plate ? fine , instead of arguing , ask what you could do better . write the list down , check the items off or at least make progress on them and report back within a couple weeks and ask the same question after . it ' s not a contest or a way to show her up , it ' s an exercise to show in an enumerable way that you ' re doing the best you can not just to be a dad in general , but to address her specific stress points . it ' s important that it not become a contest of any sort . you may have to do it over and over , or different variants for different issues but if you can show her that you ' re addressing her specific concerns instead of just doing what you believe to be responsible which is great , again i applaud your efforts and preparedness it can go a long way to relieving some of her stress on that specific issue , proving commitment to her and validating her feelings .

7. relax and remember she is a little girl . you are supposed to love her , but not in that way . know that if you had tried anything , it could crush your family . relationships will break apart . your family will grow distant . your parents would be shattered . your sister would be scarred forever . as an older brother , please try to remember the role you are meant to play in her life and try to forget any thoughts you have about her .
   (ID: d8492ac2e05f869f3bd79bafc9f32c603a615e59)

8. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

9. plan b can mess with your period . i would suggest taking a few pregnancy tests , and if they all of most come back positive go see a doctor and have them check . theyll be able to check her hormone levels over a few days and give you a better idea .

10. i can relate , when i was dating this ome girl earlier this year id rather hang out with her than do anything else , she just made me happy . heres the thing if you hang out with them too much there eventually gets to the point where you get bored of them , lose your interest in hanging out with them . i know i know you might be saying that you wont and some people can be like that and never get bored of them but incase you do take a step back but not to far back , they ' ll think something is up when in reality you jusy want to create distance to rekindle the flame of loving their company . thats my opinion atleast

11. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .

12. you wont she ' ll most likely tell you she just wants to be friends and then if she was ever worth it at all will follow through with that .
   (ID: 0501bf1e5cd313190bb4590a1c677057b15a6e47)

13. sounds like she  s too shallow to understand your pov and what you  ve been through . personally , that trait alone could make or break a relationship for me .

14. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .
   (ID: 7928bd3c3e727c94ff476240a27ed7199d92d666)

15. if you like her go for it , forget what other people think and spend time with her . if you ' re interested show it ! respond to the winks with a smile , funny face , another wink or whatever you feel like , respond to her messages etc . if you dive into the situation you ' ll be able to find out what ' s going on . also don ' t get friends involved , even if she has . it ' s generally a disaster waiting to happen .
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

16. you know , i  ve been at that point in my life where i wondered why i had so many failed relationships . but then i realized all of them had one thing in common . me . there  s a reason why we pick the partners we do . go to counseling because you want to be the best you that you can be , not because she made the call . go for you . i hope you do it .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

17. i feel like you don  t really have a right to be angry at her in that regard since as you even said you cheated on her digit times due to bad friends so why would she not be concerned about you going out doing certain things ? in this case i think it  d be healthier to break up so that you can use the lessons you learned in a new relationship where there  s not so much trauma to undo . you  re a better man now , you won  t do the shitty things you did in this relationship again , but getting your gf to trust you completely again will be at best a monumental task , at worst impossible . if you don  t wanna go through with all that entails , then i  d really recommend breaking up .
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

18. try to think about how you want her to feel about your exes . that  s how you should handle it .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

19. tale a day . sit down and talk . spend all the time finding something easy to talk about . don  t let her leave . if she gets mad tell her why , explain very clearly why you  re sitting her down and just talking all day . let her know that you are just worried . this isn  t her problem alone , it  s very much about both of you and you need to make her understand that the main reason you get in a relationship is to help each other and be happy . take all the time you can without hurting your own mental health and spend it with her . i hope you and your so will get past this and go forward even happier than ever .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

20. first thing , get closer to her . become friends so you can test the waters and see if it ' s something you want to get into . if not , you gave a good friend who you care about alot . if yes then you can try to date her and that ' s even better .
