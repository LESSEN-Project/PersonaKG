8. love has a different meaning for everyone i suppose , because everyone thinks love is definable by certain words . not me tho , i think we can ' t define it . we can only feel its presence or absence . then again , just me blurting out some spiritually enlightening nonsense as always . love is so multiple meanings . love is so call  it  what  you  want . so free , you know ? such a wordless mess that has everything from suffering to healing .

12. it ' s easy sometimes . when you don ' t see anything in yourself anymore , others become a beautiful story . a beautiful piece you get to experience . and when that ' s the only beauty there is , it ' s impossible to not love them more than oneself .
