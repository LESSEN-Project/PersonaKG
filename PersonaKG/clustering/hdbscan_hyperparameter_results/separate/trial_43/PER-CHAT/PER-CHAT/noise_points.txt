1. science doesn ' t have to give any explanation , but it could point out the reasons why someone is ' messed up socially ' which would be the first good step towards change . better than the typical religious explanation which is something like ' you need jesus in your life ! that ' s why you are messed up ! let ' s pray together ! ' and ' purpose ' in life ? that ' s easy . it ' s whatever you decide it is . sure , it might be hard deciding , but in the end it is still your choice to make .

2. why does everything have to be about race ? why can ' t people be happy for who wins and ignore their skin color completely ? i don ' t get it

5. yeah . some may not agree but politics up to and including who is in office have absolutely no direct impact on my day to day . i am not in a tax bracket where any of it would matter .

6. i ' m going to be very clear , this isn ' t why newbros leave . sure , maybe newbros trying to get into pvp , but not all newbros leave because of this . eve has a community spanning to the extreme of the spectrum . there are players with great attitudes and are willing to help a newbro out and help them learn the game . some people like 1ronbank and other rich people raffle off millions if not billions of isk worth of stuff to everyone , including newbros , because they feel like it . this is one side of the extremes . the other side are the people who are pessimistic as fuck and just blow off any newbro who tries to communicate with them . people like code even if you guys are funny and cool at times , suiciding newbros every chance you get does turn people away contribute in this catagory too but not as much as the guy who sits in rookie help or help and just gives smart ass answers and makes other people feel like they are never going to get any help in a game this big not that i ' m saying to be tender with them , but telling someone how to effectively use drones isn ' t that hard example . these people who just act like ass hats because they are " ballin ' " lowsec pirates are a scourge of eve . there is nothing wrong with going through lowsec  null  wh  highsec killing shit , but be a good sport and have common human decency while you are doing it . i can ' t stress this enough .

7. i don  t mean morally , i mean for safety . they could easily be mistaken for a walker and killed . i know the point is they look like walkers but it  s not like everyone else knows that . not to mention the whisperers are not friendly

8. oof , i fucked up . for anyone who hasn ' t read that horrible series , the guy has this problem where he doesn ' t like to be touched , but the main character sort of cures that .

9. i am a parent . alas , he ' s digit now . but i never let other shit entertain him like that . i interacted with him . when he was a toddler he would make up songs about trains and other forms of transport when we were on our weekly train journey to my place . inside i would be dying because i ' ve been where you are but i ' d look up and pretty much every passenger would be smiling or laughing . i never needed to shout at him or slap him . ever . he was a great kid . guess i was lucky .

10. really now . i have worked on ocean prediction models that are needed for better weather forecasts , especially hurricane intensity , and how to find people lost at sea . i can give you hundreds of examples off of the top of my head on why i think your first statement is wrong .

11. hmm . i never thought about it like that . it seems as though i ' ve been out scienced again . i guess this is what they mean when they say " scientist will admit when they ' re wrong " .

12. why doesn ' t the second one work out ?

14. good thing i didn ' t click on it . i usually never click on stuff people send me on here , because it ' s safe to assume the worse . i ' m going to block him now .

15. i don ' t dislike kids as a general rule there are of course exceptions and provisos but i don ' t like responsibility and obligation . cats i scoop a shit box and throw dried food into a bowl for , but then i can fuck off for hours and hours and no one gives a shit . i mean , it stands to reason if you want to do your own thing , you don ' t saddle yourself to a being that depends on you for everything for survival .

16. i take down the giant tarp behind the building and reveal that it is a giant tank . i climb inside where i find me and ethawesome is there because he was the first injured being healed by my medic . i load the barrel with my wet racks and prepare to launch my first missle . i see that i happen to be aiming at the man himself , and to not ruin his perfect day , i blow him up i to tiny pieces to feed to my adorable tuxedo cat . happy birthday brther

17. it ' s a beautiful museum , and you should all visit it . it ' s the home of howard hughes spruce goose as well . the museum ' s future has been in doubt due to tax debt in recent years . the immediate danger seems to have passed , but the museum could really use increased visitation . when i was there a couple years ago it was nearly empty , and i could stand inside the spruce goose all by myself .

18. my mom , because she ' s the strongest , most awesome person i ' ve ever met and i wish i can be like her one day .

19. yeah . in the beginning i got that , but as soon as a student took a phone out , i gave him  her a choice , give me the phone or leave the classroom . after a while , they got used to it . time wasted hassling in the beginning paid dividends in time saved later on .

20. i literally was talking about the meter but that  s fine we all read differently apparently . my point is it would make more problems than fix problems there are no problems with it if they took away the shot meter . you say it would add a skills gap but you could literally make the game skill  time played where i only see mycareer grinders getting mad , but removing a shot meter and as op said , removing fucking greens will make everyone mad and 2k isn  t that stupid
