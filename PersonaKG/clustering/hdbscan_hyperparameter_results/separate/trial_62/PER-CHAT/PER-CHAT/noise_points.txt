1. we could just take something the champion already says and just make it so you only hear it whenever s  he gets a penta . for example , most people know that zed says " the unseen blade is the deadliest "   you could just make it so he only says that when he gets a penta .

9. if someone  s tailgating you , just get out of the way if you can . stopping hard and flipping them off is only gonna make them angrier . if you can  t get out of the way , learn to properly brake check . you  re supposed to lightly tap on your brake , so that you don  t decelerate but your brake lights come on , letting them know they  re too close . if all else fails and they persist in riding your ass and possibly following you , then i  d say it  s okay to stop short . just brace yourself for a possible hit and a lot of yelling afterwards .

10. if your estate is insolvent everything you own doesn ' t cover the amount of debt owed then the estate is sold to cover what it can and the rest goes away . if your beneficiaries want to keep things , maybe a house or a valuable car , i ' m sure they can " trade " with the creditors for these things , but otherwise the beneficiaries won ' t get jack , and all your shit will just be sold off to pay the debts . edit for an example  i ' m poor and don ' t own much of anything . if i were to drop dead right now , the bank will get the car i ' m financing through them , unless someone decides to take up the payments , and my student loan debt just goes away .

11. you can . i did it all the time . i did it in disney world . i did it in chuck e . cheese , and one time this woman said " i know that ' s right " when i came out . i never got judged , but i always felt awkward . i guess it would depend how you look too . perception is key . if you look like a creep , people will judge you as such . if you look like a respectable citizen , then you will be fine

12. if i look at the architects i ' ve met  heard speak who have been somewhat successful , they were contrarians for much of their early careers . they did something different and found a way to stand out , and customers followed . i suspect these people knew very early on that their vision was different , and just dove in and made that sacrifice . as much as it pains me to say so , this is sorta the theme of the fountainhead . few books laboriously make the point about how bad most architecture is and serves up visceral contrarianism in the form of a crypto  flw biography . i ' m willing to bet that mockbee knew his shit smelled like flowers , or just didn ' t care . if you ' re that sure of yourself , then fuck everybody else and go for it . otherwise , architecture is just another job , and one that isn ' t going to pay that great . engineers , software , health care , those are the last jobs in the west that will bring reasonable salaries . the middle class is shrinking , find something that stays at the top of it .

14. nta . but , please don ' t change it only because narrow  minded people can ' t think beyond stereotypes . if you want to change it to better represent who you feel you are , do it . i ' m so sorry that you ' ve had to shave your beard and deal with negativity for no reason . it ' s a shame that our world is devolving rather than evolving .
