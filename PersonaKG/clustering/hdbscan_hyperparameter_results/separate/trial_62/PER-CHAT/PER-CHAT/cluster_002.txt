   (ID: dccaef8a6226163d8d10afb2d04eb5a7babea832)

9. cool , dude . you seem stable . yeah , so far you ' ve called me stupid , an idiot , a piece of shit , and a dick  man , all i did was post a comment , that in no way attacked you . but thanks to your anger problem , which i ' m guessing you got from your dad , you ' ve made this into a much bigger thing than it needed to be . but yes , how dare i be concerned about the seeming trend of cop  related civilian deaths in the country that i live in . so , you ' re right , i ' ll start packing for brazil right away . i was wrong to question police authority for the job they literally signed up for . so , we ' re done , right ? can we please be done ? ok ? thanks for wasting my time

10. i have to ask you why you don ' t look this up yourself ? you have to be on the internet to type and submit your comment so why not just do a quick google search ? one of the biggest problems in this country is that a lot of people do not research anything themselves . they simply wait for someone to present information to them . when they don ' t like the information they hear , even if it is true , they dismiss it and when they hear information they do like they accept it even if it is false . it ' s absolutely ridiculous how easily manipulated people can be .

11. why are you so stupid ? is it because i ask you to shut the fuck up while you are being condescending towards someone ?
   (ID: 0b3478daa0c3ecb398dde7764084e605d476d0ad)

12. super delegates you realise that  s the problem right ? i can read fine thanks , it  s my comprehension of you as a person that i  m struggling with . you actually defend this nonsense . your country is about as democratic as north korea
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

13. read  watch the fucking news . you sound like a total fucking idiot when you don ' t know what the fuck is going on around you and you make so many fucking stupid political statements when you don ' t fucking know what ' s fucking happening . don ' t correct me on something that you don ' t have a fucking clue about . fucking damnit .
   (ID: dadc9911849239b0d3b98ea480d7a3be43208f42)

14. you asked if i hate , i told you i do not . you asked why i vote a certain way , i told you to look to my previous answer of why i am a republican . you asked if my religion is involved , i ' ve told you that my religion teaches against the lifestyle multiple times . i ' m not sure what other answers you are looking for . again , i think you are trying to steer me into a certain wording that you have been preparing to exploit and i simply won ' t do it mostly for my own entertainment that it frustrates you
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

15. just don ' t talk politics ! i ' m a rascist , sexist , bigoted white supremacist , because i believe in free speech
   (ID: 7779353ef52866e4a25d663a52411bbd5af0e0a6)

16. ad hominem  so boring . you know you  ve lost so you resort to insults . by what other rationale does israel gain its legitimacy , according to you ? don  t bother answering  i got better thing to do .
   (ID: 25b8235c988cb167d94968ee893707e9c358cde8)

17. i was being funny .  shrug  it ' s friday  it happens . if your beliefs or lack thereof are dependent on what other people say , then you need to think some more before engaging in such discourse .
   (ID: b70c0c020fa60fd16329a7c04f4d71a7514815c1)

18. creation of the universe thats lovely , . the best you can do to destroy my point is " eat your shit " wonderful display of atheist morality right here .
   (ID: 67c9e09a0c4dab30b34127f2c96acedba2d75ec4)

19. posting about a game like every other redditor saying its shit  trying to gain karma on a site that doesn ' t matter . we get it the game is shit . move on
   (ID: 8277d18e51d35c7f025a7fbc5ae41a5067d41ea5)

20. since this platform is free for everyone to post and comment all kinds of things i won  t take your note on keeping my nose out especially from someone with attitude you possess . by all means you deserve to be called out and maybe you should take a note about changing your attitude towards others , because too much negativity is bad for everyone . i  m not american btw , stop assuming , looks like it  s not for you .
