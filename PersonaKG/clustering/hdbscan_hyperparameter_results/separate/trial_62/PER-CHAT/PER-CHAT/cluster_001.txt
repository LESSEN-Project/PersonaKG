1. nah , you should probably went easier with her . anyway , someone would still tell her that and it could have been worse .

2. you cannot control someone else ' s thoughts and actions , but you can control your own . he will never be who you want him to be by wishing and hoping . he may very well have issues and problems of his own . your first responsibility is to yourself  if you don ' t look after yourself you are of no use to anyone else . concentrate on your own health and well being . he will contact you again if and when it suits him . don ' t live your life waiting and hoping for that to happen . good luck .

3. are you dating my ex ? he was the same , completely unhelpful despite me laying out the best way to support me through my bad days . now i  m with a guy who actually listens to me and the difference is night and day . my mental health and productivity has skyrocketed . nta for breaking up with a guy that gets you down because he thinks he knows what you need better than you do . there  s nothing wrong with breaking up over text , either , especially when communication is an issue .

4. i  d still advise an inpatient program if it is that bad , ultimately we  re just a bunch of dudes on the internet , and there  s a reason why they are professionals . while i do not have your condition , i  ve been plagued by mental illness . they key isn  t to stop , erase , or remove it , but to cope , overcome , and live with it at least for me

5. fuck no don ' t let her be one of your bridesmaid ' s i ' d tell rebecca exactly how you feel and why you ' re not letting her be one of your bridesmaid ' s and leave it at that this is your day , don ' t let anyone ruin it for you in any way
   (ID: deb51648159c9d9d915a701d8f77ac885a29b9b4)

6. i can  t believe i just read that whole book you just wrote lol . but look i can tell you immediately why you don  t wanna give him a chance . bc you don  t like him . period . you just see him as a friend . you never even thought about dating him til your family said something . you never mention having some chemistry or any kind of feelings for him . and that  s ok . yea he sounds like a great guy but if you don  t feel a connection with him or get all giggle with him i don  t think it  s gonna work out . the best part of a relationship is the honey moon stage . i mean you could give him a chance but don  t get all stressed about it . dating is suppose to be fun . especially around our age . goodluck op

7. knock that bish off the pedestal . really , if you keep her there you  ll never be able to appreciate anyone else . including yourself ! ex is an ex for a reason .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

8. i know this sounds like a standard answer giving to everyone , but i know that its the best way . i know that because i also was in that position when you have lost so many of your friends , that there is no place to start , to regain them . put yourself out there , and with out there i mean really into the world of the people you want to befriend . when i needed a friend to go to parties with , i needed to go out alone , to find those with similar interest . and is definitely not so hard when you start building up confidence to go up ro people . most people don ' t have a reason to approach you when already having their social circle , so there is no was around for you to just start randomly talking with people that think may be symphatic . nearly all of the people i started talking to reacted super positve on that behavior . some may find it strange at first , same stick to that attitude and evem some of them will become your friensy

9. you sound like you are young with zero confidence . who gives a shit if he flips out . leaving him means you don  t have to deal with it . you really need to ask yourself why you love someone who treats you this way . if you really loved him , why are you posting for ways to make someone leave you ? it sounds like you don  t love him . you  re scared of him . you need to speak with a professional because a person who loves themselves don  t do things like this .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

10. i hope you  re doing okay . i am now in your shoes , and it sucks . one of my best friends killed himself digit days ago . when all of our friends are together it isn  t so bad , but when i  m alone all i can do is look at pictures of him and think about it .
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

11. most guys just go for it . if your super uneasy you can ask her first . i ' ve been asked before , it ' s not a total killer either . don ' t worry if it ' s not perfect !
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

12. i experience this even now . i think it ' s fine to think every now and then about your situation . it would be impossible to never think about it , but don ' t stay focused on it for a lengthy period , it ' s unhealthy . when i had a job in retail i caught the train home every night . friday and saturday nights were almost unbearable . watching groups of people your age socialize and have fun hurt bad because it would remind me how i ' ll never be able to experience it for myself . you can still find some people to hang around with , maybe from work or education . but i think we should agree that looking forward is the best thing to do

13. this boy is not worth your time . just dump him now and move on to someone that ' s not going to shame you repeatedly .
   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

14. stay strong and don  t break . you  ll be better off without her . kicking this will be like kicking a drug . you  ll be smacked with the urge out of no where . but trust me , you don  t want a relationship with someone who doesn  t want to be with you . no one wins . you got this .
   (ID: ba2b62efe335afb5002057a08f40c489849fc6cf)

15. the first thing you do is sop pestering her about how she feels . yes , you didn ' t tell her . yes , she found out and is pissed off . but this is a forgivable offense . as long as you stopped sleeping with your roommate before you entered the relationship with your current girlfriend you have nothing to worry about . trust me , the more you apologize the madder and more distant she is going to become . i have learned this the hard way because i ' ve been in your place with a similar situation . you already apologized profusely . do not contact her until she has dealt with her emotions and is ready to talk to you about this . patience is what you need now , not another angle on how to apologize even more profusely .
   (ID: 8f33db98a9fa29c8f9e44012d79de72291a29519)

16. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .

17. yta her relationship with him isn ' t your problem or issue . her relationship with you is . and it sounds like you damaged it , hard . can you imagine being raised by someone for digit years and counting and for them to not want to adopt you ? ouch .
   (ID: de9f62a8114c08877e3a53460027d9810f5f3912)

18. i cut myself today for the first time in awhile but only had a serrated knife which hurt a lot more so i didnt really get that into it . also made plans for my next suicide attempt . i haven ' t had any money in a really long time though so i ' m pretty much just window shopping for ways to make a charcoal grill with as little money as possible . i fall between screaming in my head to please let me die and begging for some kind of purpose . then i start to think of what being an actual person would look like and all i can think of is all the gross horrible shit i ' ve done . i really wish i could fall asleep in some happy dream and never wake up . i wish i could die and my body could live on and fix the world . i want good things to happen to everyone around me i just so desperately dont want to have to exist anymore .
   (ID: f46d1bfdfed7fc05bbe39789c092019944471e9d)

19. just be her friend . not the nice guy who thinks she should date him because he is nice than her current bf . treat her like you would a male friend within reason , of course . at the end of the day , she can ' t control whether or not she has feelings for you , but being a genuine friend with no alterior motives goes a long way .
   (ID: b8909f67c17becbd31e511b3482195ab3cead938)

20. nta  i mean it is a dick move to break up over text that way especially while someone  s deployed . however , i don  t think that matters given that he was an abuser and a deployment would give you a chance to leave him without him reacting violently , not letting you , etc . his reaction of threatening to hunt you down says everything about him , what  s he going to do ? beat you ? kill you ? you don  t need such a horrible man in your life . maybe it  d have been more respectful to do it over video or phone i guess but that also just would have opened you to more abusive traumatizing behavior from him , probably would have been worse to hear it in those ways rather than text anyway . i  m sorry for what you  ve gone thru and the decisions you  ve had to make here . as for your friend , does she know how he  s treated you ?
