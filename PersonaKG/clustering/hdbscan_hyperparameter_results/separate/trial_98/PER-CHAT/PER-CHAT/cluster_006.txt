1. should i be having an awkward conversation with my partner then ? i figured it was just a thing that happened to guys with a foreskin . he showers daily and his hygiene is otherwise fine but i do notice it gets kinda . gooey under there

2. i suggest offering to do it for him with a sock , and setting aside a  special sock drawer  . people have weird sex things , and you learn them as you get to know them better and better . if you  re honest , you probably have a few of your own weird  things  . a . m . i right ?

3. i can ' t really relate , i ' ve never had a guy do that , but dryness is never an issue for me , i ' ve only used lube with one person a couple of times and it wasn ' t very sexy .

4. me and my husband do anal fairly regularly and this happens every once in awhile . he always says  i know where i  m putting it , i know what can happen  and i think that  s the best response anyone can have . i try to make sure i  m cleaned out but sometimes uhh . shit happens . hope your dude figures that out . oh , and to answer your question , find a mature boyfriend

5. i  ve been doing it with my husband for almost digit years now and there  s still some discomfort when it sticks it in . keep it super wet . i  ve gotten to the point where i let that discomfort make me aggressive , if that makes sense . it makes it even hotter hahaha

6. i am sorry if thats completely wrong what i am gonna say , because i don ' t have experience . but wouldn ' t it be possible to stretch your skin slowly before engaging in penetrativ sex . maybe take some extra 10min before , where you stretch and work the skin back slowly with some lubricant . sure this may not be the most sexy thing to do in the middle of a heated moment with you so , but a serious partner should be supportive when it just during the waiting period . if this doesn ' t work , you can also find sexual pleasures without engaging in something like penetrativ sex , where a retracting foreskin is required . a oily handjob over the skin could probably make me come even without having direct contact to the penis glans . and if you are into butt stuff , this could be the time to explore some new ideas .

7. you could always ask your doc for viagra assuming you ' re healthy enough . there ' s not a way for him to say you ' re not experiencing performance anxiety , etc . there are side effects , and risks to this , and it definitely is in line with culture of , if there ' s a problem , take a pill to fix it . i personally have never used the stuff , but i have friends who have said it was like being digit years old and horned up beyond belief . beyond that , what other people said . blow your first load , give it a bit , and go again .

8. do you enjoy getting fingered or licked ? woman can do that , are you gay ? now that is a little atypical but assuming he likes to fuck you , he ' s not gay .

9. just relax . masturbating is supposed to be fun . how could it ever be fun doing it the way you ' re doing it ? how is it possible not get off from your own mind creating things and scenarios , that you sexually desire ? i ' m just gonna say " bullshit " everyone loves daydreaming about sex . so if you can ' t turn yourself on mentally  don ' t enjoy doing that , and you also don ' t like porn i call bullshit again why the fuck are you even trying to masturbate ? are you sure that ' s what you ' re doing ? i ' m just fucking with ya don ' t get all butthurt now lol of course you can ' t orgasm . in order to get " off " you first have to learn to get " on " masturbation is a natural fluid process , one that shouldn ' t ever take this much effort . you ' re fucking yourself from fucking yourself . stop it .
