1. but killstreaks are what seperates cod from other shooters , the fun is getting rewarded for being good , if u aren ' t being rewarded by getting good op killstreaks then why do u play ? for the objective ? it ' s mostly a casual pub game and this is what cod should cater to , if u want to play the objective so much then why don ' t u play gamebattles and league play ?

2. it  s not the fact that players can kill you more it  s the fact that it  s just an easy source for kills because you could be build battling somebody only for a play to fly through the build and kill the both of you and it  s also easy for players to fly up right to the top of the map and wait until late game to come swooping down and kill you for the win

3. i think people should play for the enjoyment and not just to win another uhc  like if you want to play dirty there ' s a cutclean game in digit minutes .  it should be for the audience .

5. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .

6. bad players will be bad . gating isn ' t going to fix this problem . good players will want to learn the game and will use resources to do so and no amount of artificial blocking is going to solve it . co  op and practice are so stupidly easy that they don ' t teach you the repercussion of a lack of proper laning , how to teamfight , or really anything that you list as a problem .

7. i ' m going to be very clear , this isn ' t why newbros leave . sure , maybe newbros trying to get into pvp , but not all newbros leave because of this . eve has a community spanning to the extreme of the spectrum . there are players with great attitudes and are willing to help a newbro out and help them learn the game . some people like 1ronbank and other rich people raffle off millions if not billions of isk worth of stuff to everyone , including newbros , because they feel like it . this is one side of the extremes . the other side are the people who are pessimistic as fuck and just blow off any newbro who tries to communicate with them . people like code even if you guys are funny and cool at times , suiciding newbros every chance you get does turn people away contribute in this catagory too but not as much as the guy who sits in rookie help or help and just gives smart ass answers and makes other people feel like they are never going to get any help in a game this big not that i ' m saying to be tender with them , but telling someone how to effectively use drones isn ' t that hard example . these people who just act like ass hats because they are " ballin ' " lowsec pirates are a scourge of eve . there is nothing wrong with going through lowsec  null  wh  highsec killing shit , but be a good sport and have common human decency while you are doing it . i can ' t stress this enough .

8. you complaining about free rewards ? it  ll get better and more competitive as you grow within the game . i assume your still very new at swgoh and are clumped with people who are probably not that into it the same way you are .

9. interesting to see how a lot of people think posess is op , yet you consider it underpowered . i guess you just have to read the comments saying it ' s op to see what potential it has

10. it ' s the reason i don ' t play . every match comes down to whoever can spawn shit in front of them the best . it ' s stupid .
   (ID: fc6c3ec28ba94863f194a369963dafcc58044bc7)

11. true . eitherway , they need to change it considering how other op other legend ' s passive are . i hate having to not play it just because of the passive alone .
