2. i was working a food line by myself , and we got a rush of like 9ish small groups , and in the middle of me running around trying to make everything , a woman came up to the counter complaining that i didn ' t cut the crusts off of her son ' s sandwich . if that had been instructed , i would have done so , but i wasn ' t informed that she wanted that , and i was busy as all hell . the dark part of me wanted to hurl a knife at her and yell " do it yourself bitch " but i just asked to wait a few minutes , and i would give her a free sandwich , without the crusts . thankfully she shut up after that , but fuck , i wanted to yell at her .

4. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .

5. if you paid  50k , then you made a shitload more . if you  re that well off , you can contribute to society  to the people who make your burgers and change your tires . it  s not just about you and what benefits you get . imagine if you were disabled and couldn  t make even close to the income you do now . you know you could be successful if you had a chance . but you never will . the reason minimum wage is so low is because the government is supposed to subsidize the difference .

6. the company i work for pays us to go volunteer a few times a year with a food bank we work closely with and donate to and what not . the fuckin nerve of some people that come in there is unreal . you have the super nice and just down on their luck people that are super appreciative for anything you give them , and for helping load it into their cars and what not , then you get the giant pricks who make you put digit bags into their brand new car , then when you get there they open up the bags and start taking out vegetables and whatever else they dont want and demand you bring them back inside and give them extra cake or sweets , or whatever they choose then flip out when you tell them that ' s not really how it works .

7. well you gotta remember they have a job to do , and something as simple as that seems pretty minuscule to you but is a big deal for the employee , boss , and establishment .

8. you gotta spend money to make money  you get what you pay for . the better you treat your workers , the better your company will run .

10. do you ever notice that the secretaries and paper pushers in those kind of positions are a bitch insensitive ? here they are notorious for not giving you all the information you need so you go do something they ' ve asked you to do and come back and then they said oh did they tell you you need to blah blah blah no they didn ' t so then you got to go do something else and make another trip it ' s crazy

11. here ' s a recent experience of mine at the checkout . these oblivious bitches just stood there chatting , sort of including the cashierwho wasn ' t interested in their stories but too shy to tell them to get fucking moving , for a good digit minutes . notice the arm blocking the conveyor so i can ' t even unload my cart . even when i pulled out the camera and took the picture , they didn ' t clue in at all . i wasn ' t in any hurry so i just waited to see how long they took . when they finally moved along , i made sure to ask if they were sure , and didn ' t have any more stories to share ? and yes there was a lineup behind me .

12. tax cuts should be used as a reward for the ' job creators ' who do their fucking job . i don ' t see any around these days .

13. then they lied to you , mate . it is literally illegal to fire someone for an injury . in fact the employer is legally obligated to pay sick leave .   the only way they would be sent home would be if they were illegal immigrants and have no contract . lots of them are brought in as independent contractor and they are cut loose pretty much whenever .   and it does reward the hard working , but you also need to be smart and work with the proper papers . just look around you and see the massive number of people improving their living conditions . as i said again . if it rewards the hard  working then migrant farm workers should be rich as fuck . but it doesn ' t . it works the people who are working in the right industry with absolutely no correlation to how hard they work . especially relative to those outside of that industry who work hard .  can you name another structure with this rate of growth ? go ahead . what is growth have anything to do with it ? i have not said anything about growth . i am simply pointing out that it is a myth that capitalism rewards the hard  working .

14. i hate to tell you but i have two businesses , i give a shit what the customers think they ' re lucky to have someone do the work they ' re too lazy and stupid to do .

15. yeah fuck them ! i don  t know how it can even be legal to pay somebody as low as fucking  digit . digit to deliver ! i drive all the way across town to go to mcdonald  s in the middle of the night and wait in the drive  thru line for fucking ever and then kindly and quickly deliver the food with a smile on my face just to make fucking digit dollars and some change ! i feel robbed ! i feel insulted ! i  m seriously done !

16. former supervisor of a corporate movie theatre . i used to not care , but it did bother me when customers would leave bags of wing bones , open containers of ranch all over the floor , etc . if you sneak something in , you sneak it out because it  s so disrespectful to the ushers mostly teenagers who get paid slightly over min wage . we weren  t legally allowed to check bags , so if i suspected someone bring something in , we aren  t allowed to check . so all we can tell them is  please throw it away or put it in your vehicle .

17. so you are going to stiff your server or bartender for a policy that they have no control over ? you are going to accuse them of crime despite the fact that rounding to the dollar is very common and they have no control over it ! then don  t go to restaurants . we are not in charge . we are not stealing from you . we take your shit , kiss your ass and bring you your food for less than minimum wage because society has decided we get paid out of the kindness in your heart . and you would stiff us because you decided that the policy my restaurant you chose to go to has a round to the dollar , just to the dollar , policy ? because i have no choice in the matter , you fuck with my life and my rent and my bills ?

18. stories like this infuriate me . i don ' t know what gets into these entitled , self  righteous people ' s minds that makes them treat wait staff like subhumans ? it ' s as though they don ' t understand that wait staff are not only fellow humans but also not responsible for pricing , food preparation , plating , store policies , or most of the things that happen in a restaurant . they ' re simply the middleman for every other department in the facility . they work their asses off trying to make a living and your experience pleasurable ! i have much respect for those servers that can maintain their composure when faced with people like this . tl  dr . fuck that bitch !
