1. so why is it the democrats can do it with proof and they get shrugged off , yet one person makes a fake claim about a republican with no proof , the media runs it for weeks , investigations ensue , and suddenly he is the evil racist ? welcome to america where the left didn ' t care about facts , only their ignorant opinions .

4. that  s your opinion . and as far as i  m concerned my opinion you can believe whatever you want . we aren  t talking about beliefs we are talking about classifying science vs pseudoscience !

5. why do you keep brining this back to race , how does saying that most people who have been alive on this planet had no real impact lead back to " you are ok with more black people dying than any other race " . you are obviously making some connections that i am missing . all individual lives are an acceptable loss so long as the human race survives . i don ' t care about other people losing their jobs , i don ' t care about other people dying and having family members die . i only care about the people i love and the survival of us as a species . i see you added a um , ' gotcha ! ' at the end there so please enlighten me as to how i specifically said i would support blm .

6. because calling a debate with an intelligent person " cat calling " is the only way to justify running away to your fans   there , i elaborated your reasoning . you seem to lack the ability to expand your thoughts .
   (ID: a338329f614b2c3eb4dd145b3eea7f677369e428)

7. you have only proven that you do not know what you are saying regarding this subject . may you never know what it  s like to be forced to fight a war or be put in a cage . are you a brit ? still mad about the american revolution ? imperialist twat , how funny .
   (ID: 4776f36398122cafa421393accf6939d82603a44)

8. read  watch the fucking news . you sound like a total fucking idiot when you don ' t know what the fuck is going on around you and you make so many fucking stupid political statements when you don ' t fucking know what ' s fucking happening . don ' t correct me on something that you don ' t have a fucking clue about . fucking damnit .
   (ID: dadc9911849239b0d3b98ea480d7a3be43208f42)

9. but all these things will still happen under socialism . tis is a problem of corruption and conflicts of interest of people writing the laws that enable things like this .
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

10. not commenting and commenting are the same thing . you imbecile . you fucking moron .
   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

11. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

12. you know maybe if you actually procured some arguments instead of literally autistic screeching you ' d fare better .
   (ID: c6f05f0d1c575c6421168d1ec5282731f1335c84)

13. ok , so the post in question was  what evidence is there that male privilege exists ? i am in no way saying we should put out a bad product . but i am saying that none of you or i are biologists and really don ' t know how hard it is . regardless the fact that they didn ' t start until later is bad . how is that so hard to get . i ' m literally not bashing . why are you even defending it ? it ' s not your fault or anyone ' s here . is it that bad to get the word out ?
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

14. oh yea . you continued to harass me by posting comments like this . don ' t act like a fool dedicatedsloth . old people are not always wise . example  dedicatedsloth . i said to end the drama . you continued it . so you are harassing me kid . stop it kid  i am older than you !
   (ID: ac53f9ce173965984299f3686335a39bc2a5810f)

15. and you ' re the type of person who thinks so highly of themselves they can ' t even understand a simple joke . get your head out of your ass .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

16. wow a trumper yeah if you voted for him your a racist moron weather hillary was a bad candidate is imaterial and if you think democratic socialism and socialism are the same thing just shows how out of touch with reality you are . hopefully one day you ' ll go back to school and try again
   (ID: 0def2b70456d7a000d0e2b3611ac80cd2990e21c)

17. yeah , there is no stigma , and your response speaks far more to your issues than to anyone elses . please don ' t try to tell people what they should and shouldn ' t decide they want when all parties have all the facts .
   (ID: a97bb0d0211a340588db770f6b8b5fd394d26db9)

18. why ask a question if you ' re going to incorrectly assume the answer ? i know you were trying to be sarcastic , but it just comes off as smug . i ' m sure you could convince me and others of your argument if you actually tried , but that doesn ' t seem to be your goal here . if you do want to engage in meaningful discussion , i ' m all ears .
   (ID: f3f34b7b903c833de2625265da4585abdc86ab7c)

19. you probably don ' t have a clue what it entails . calling one out for stupidity while the biggotry and sjw ethics almost drips down your comment . not knowing what mgtow entails , but still judging upon it . do you get triggered by your own stupidity too ? or only when you think you can respond to it . i didn ' t call you sjw , though your reasoning and choice of words indicate you are , a raging one at that . so , if you wanna argue about these topics , start to learn how to read and understand . idiot . you know these subs are regularly vacated by raging sjw ' s that can ' t accept that people disagree right ? pretty much what you are doing .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)
