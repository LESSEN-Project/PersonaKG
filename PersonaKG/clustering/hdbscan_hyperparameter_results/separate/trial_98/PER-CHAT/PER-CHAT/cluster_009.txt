1. you clearly want to pursue her so i don ' t know what you want tbh . on the one hand you could be looking for " devil ' s advocates " who ' ll tell you to go for it  you ' ve basically provided your own options regarding that , looking for people to validate your opinion . on the other hand , you could just be genuinely thrown off by the situation and won ' t mind advice , just as long as it ' s constructive . so playing devil ' s advocate . just go for it op , there ' s probably trouble in paradise , she ' s feeling dissatisfied with her current relationship among other things in her life work stress etc . so why not take the opportunity and " swoop in . but real talk . no matter the circumstances , my stance is " you don ' t mess with someone who ' s in a relationship . coming from a person who ' s cheated once and has been cheated on a few times , its a dick move unless you ' re some callow bastard who doesn ' t care . talk to her and clear out the boyfriend issue before taking it any further  it ' ll save you the trouble in the long run .

2. it ' s a big mix of stuff but time is just one component . youtube is full of really socially intelligent folks that know how to help you navigate heartbreak . finding the right advice along with finding healthy distractions is key . you have to acknowledge your feelings , while at the same time giving yourself liberty to feel different emotions through other activities and diversion . you have to delve into healing while at other times work on suppressing certain emotions since they are not all constructive and sometimes even accurate . stay social . don ' t be afraid to hook with folks . i personally recommend tripping on molly , mushrooms or lsd to create an experience that could heighten your sense of how beautiful consciousness is . it sucks to say , but pain is a very helpful tool for progress . some people use it masochistically to self sabotage and wallow in a cycle of victimhood , self pity and depression . you could instead use pain to turn around and help other people , perhaps hold yourself to higher standards in important ways and above all use this opportunity to learn more about yourself and how to become the best friend to yourself you could possibly be .

3. well the good news is that you don ' t have to have sex with anyone with whom you don ' t want to . also , stop listening to your family and so called friends who tell you that you ' re unattractive . that ' s just ridiculous and you know better . meet people in real life which is what you prefer anyway . i do too and go ahead and be picky ! it ' s your life  your body and your choice ! one thing though is that there are plenty of people who are attracted to you . whether they admit it or not that ' s another thing but it ' s true . your friends are your allies . trust them but also trust yourself . there is someone out there for everyone . you must believe that .

4. what she is doing does not seem particularly troublesome . i mean it just seems like she is changing in ways that are really freaking you out . from what you have said i would let it slide as long as he isn ' t violent , extorting money or raping her . i mean as long as she is happy and not getting hurt right ?

5. you ' re not a bum ! the fact that you came here to post this means you still have hope ! honestly , i was feeling down like you too , but then i stumbled upon guide to purposeful success and it really helped me find a purpose in life , which i am pursuing every single day now , and it ' s been great ! hopefully it can help you too .

6. hon , you need to think about yourself here . i know that can be hard , especially if you ' re a giver by nature , but it ' s true . if you don ' t feel safe , comfortable , and respected in your relationship , you won ' t be truly happy . and that may not seem like the end of the world now , but it will in time . eventually , bitterness and resentment can start to grow and you ' ll find yourself hating the person you once loved . if you don ' t think you can be happy dealing with his bipolar disorder , it ' s ok to move on . it ' s better that both of you find partners you can truly be fulfilled and happy with , even if it means going through some pain first .

7. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

8. don  t worry about those digit b  s . i  m going to be a senior and as of right now my gpa is at digit . digit , i  ve not taken a single ap class and have made a couple bs as my final averages . you know whether or not you can achieve as in a class and if you did your best and still made bs , it shouldn  t matter because you tried your best

9. you know , i  ve been at that point in my life where i wondered why i had so many failed relationships . but then i realized all of them had one thing in common . me . there  s a reason why we pick the partners we do . go to counseling because you want to be the best you that you can be , not because she made the call . go for you . i hope you do it .

10. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .

11. oh , honey . sending hugs . can you ring a friend for a chat ? you need to speak to someone who knows your worth . i hope it gets better or , if not , you find what you need . good luck .

12. long ass post but i ' ve read every single word of it . congrats on your successful transformation . leave while you can . you are still young and have a long way ahead of you . i really hate manipulative person and hope you find a better person . but i would suggest telling her about the divorce in advance if you don ' t want to hurt her too bad but even then , you wouldn ' t know what type of shit she ' ll pull . it ' s going to get better from now !

13. try to think about how you want her to feel about your exes . that  s how you should handle it .

14. it sounds like your family might  ve discussed him and pin  pointed reasons to not like him . i would ask your parents what  s up , considering you guys are adults and have been together for quite some time , there has to be a reason behind it .
   (ID: 7a73be2c4f82c4292cb459bd36b591a2c015d967)

15. apologize if i come off as an asshole , i  m trying not too . but if you truly love him , stop wasting time . for both of you . because the more time goes on , the more you going to resent each other . and hey sometimes it isn  t meant to be , no matter how hard it is to break it . if you  re feeling this way , your affectionate love for him his gone . and it happens . don  t feel bad for falling out of love , but feel bad because you  re dragging it on when you and him could be out there exploring and finding yourself . time heals all , but you have to start the time . i was kinda in the same boat was with a girl i thought i  d spend the rest of my life with , and she told me a quote i  ll never forget .  anon , i may be the love of your life , but i  m not sure your the love of mine .  and that shit killed me , but made sense at the same time . sorry if it was a lot at once , at work on break , wanted to get it out as much as i could .

16. i don ' t really feel like he holds me back , but my life isn ' t the way i want it to be living with him . i ' m gonna say the same shit everyone else says , i do love him and i enjoy being with him . but lately it doesn ' t feel the same . he ' s a good person but i feel like i don ' t really like him anymore . maybe it ' s my mindset but i feel like we don ' t have fun or enjoy each other ' s company . but if i leave i know i ' ll miss him and be sad . i ' m not going to go jump on another guys dick .

17. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

18. don  t try and spare his feelings now if you  ll probably destroy them later . do you think the relationship could end because of this ? or that you might get so attracted to another man you could cheat on him ? either of those would be worse than saying  hey , the baby talk weirds me out , could you stop ?

19. idk if i  ve had this problem but it sounds extremely similar . this is what i did  what it sounds like to me is that you constantly have judgements hanging over you . it sounds bad too if it  s everything you say or do and i  ve been there . think , is it your thoughts or is it just thoughts you think other people are having ? if it  s the second one , relax . it  s better if you think about nothing or what  s going on during your day or whatever . just don  t think about what other people might think of you because that is going to affect every single one of your actions . i hope i somewhat helped .

20. invest in resident relationships . getting to talk and have legit friendships with my residents makes the job so beyond worth it . i love walking out on my hallway and see digit  of my guys just shooting the breeze and being a part of that fills me with so much joy . also , i don ' t know how you ' re school ' s residence program is structured , but reach out to whoever supervises yoyour staff . they can be a listening ear or give you better advice on how to handle the stress . and as for encouragement , you aren ' t alone ! most ras or at least all the good ones struggle to balance these things . give yourself some grace when you mess up and remember that this job can be a great experience .
