1. isn ' t this type of controversy and reaction to a manager ' s decision exactly the type of this that shows how the team is valued ? klinsmann seems to understand that he will be fired if they don ' t advance , to the point that i think he will be upset if he isn ' t fired for not advancing . of course , i could be clouded because ld being left off makes sense to me .

2. for those asking ' why theo ? ' for  20m    x200b  giampaolo ' s digit  digit  digit  digit requires a very unique type of fullback . ideally , giampaolo ' s fullbacks are able to speed down the sideline to provide width if the left  right midfielders decide to step up and attack . speed ? check . skills  passing ? check . giampaolo ' s fullbacks also need to be technically sound defensively when playing up the field to negate a counterattack and create counter  counterattacks for milan . technically sound ? check .   x200b  the biggest negative with theo is his decision making . while that ' s fair , he shouldn ' t have to make too many decisions in giampaolo ' s system . also , he ' s very young , and has a great lb mentor . room to grow .   x200b  lastly , i think there ' s more to the  20m figure than we ' re led to believe . e . g . relations with madrid , more players coming , etc .   x200b  welcome theo !

3. i mean if he thinks he deserves higher wages and can get it elsewhere he just might . plus we don  t know how well mahrez will play in our system . it  s in the realm of possibility . maybe unlikely at the moment , but i hope to have this set of attackers for years to come . barring when aguero goes back to independiente

4. in my opinion , this is just damage control and he should have spoke about this right after the game , not four days after . the panthers organization , his agent , and family probably told him to sort this out or else he ' ll be known as the asshole who injured pettersson . i don ' t think he is sincere in my eyes , the face he made when he slammed pettersson was the face of intent . didn ' t even give a shit about what he did , just kept on playing like nothing happened .

5. that is funny because i thought this is professional hockey ? i think i would be worrying if i was newell brown . you have plenty of right handed shots in each game , why not give other players a try with the main pp unit ? baertschi shouldn ' t be entitled to anything just because he has some chemistry with horvat and boeser .

6. it ' s pretty clear suso and hakan don ' t fit giampaolo ' s system , and will without a doubt be sold . the next question for me is do i want kessie  biglia starting ? that ' s also a no .

7. watch it again . its after he turns and runs . listen to them talk about it , as well . not even close . and if he had called it and thats what caused kozma to break off , why do him and holiday look at each other like a couple of bumbling idiots immediately after ? regardless of how you think of that particular call , instant replay would be of huge benefit to all teams in the mlb .

8. i wouldn ' t mind it , but the captaincy is such a poisoned chalice that expectations will be raised unrealistically high for him and it pretty much guarantees he ' ll be the scapegoat next time we exit a tournament . i quite like him so i ' d rather the media doesn ' t destroy him .
