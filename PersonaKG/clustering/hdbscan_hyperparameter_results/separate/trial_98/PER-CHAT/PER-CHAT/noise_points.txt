2. well even if that ' s the case , it ' s sort of hard to just take control  analyze your own subconscious without professional help . this was like a few months ago . i guess my biggest fear relationship wise is becoming that father in the movies who is so thrown into his work , that he never makes time for his family which causes them to drift apart . this could be something else or just something petty . i mean i won ' t tolerate something that ' s obviously worse like cheating or something but i ' m not sure how to " fix " my issues in terms of attraction unless professional help is called upon i guess . i think it could be way worse though .

4. i hate saying that when i was digit and had no idea what i was doing , i did that with our van . burning hot water hit my stomach and arm . 2nd degree burn and some light scarring on my stomach still digit years later . don  t fuck around on this one .

5. i  d be most excited for a full f4 team  doc doom , and not technically new champs but i feel like some mcu versions of characters like sw , drax , gamora , and others would be cool .

6. constantly creating problems to push things in their direction . it ' s even worse when they have some greedy goal in mind like buying a second house and need you to do some shit for them .

7. are we gonna get sane or not ? the wait is killing me . having said that , we need digit  digit more signings to be competitive and for squad depth . our squad as a whole is very poor in depth . we lost robbery , james , hummels , rafinha over the summer and have added just lucas and pavard so far . plus our backline is still not very convincing if you ask me , and roca would be ideal to shield the defence . i wish we had gotten idrissa gueye who is pl proven but it is too late now .

11. how many dads do you have , considering you ' re using the plural form of " dad ?

13. genetics . i ' m a strong believer in the nature side of the nurture argument . i don ' t think that upbringing has no effect , but probably digit  digit  imo . human domesticated animals are bred to exhibit certain basic behavioral tendencies , and i think people in general follow the same pattern . there is probably an evolutionary advantage to being a certain kind of jerk here and there , so it keeps on being relevant in the genepool . or if you ' re cynical like myself you consider it prevalent .

14. yeah that was a bitch move . like i understand about oberyn and i really liked him , but don  t take it out on a girl , and that  s a dumb strategical move anyways . the only reason i say this , is that it gives me more of a conclusion and satisfaction to see that someone we know is ruling dorne . if they end with , yeah dorne is ruled by some prince , i  ll be slightly more pissed at the show that i  m already very pissed about .

16. a guy on my street used to try to drive us to school all the time and one of my friends used to go with him all the time . my friend always in the newest clothing , shoes , new phone , all that . well one day dude offered me a ride to school and i accepted when i was running late . during the ride to school he stopped in a neighborhood and told me  i will blow you for  digit  flat out said that . so me being like digit and this guy like digit are now face to face and he wants to blow me . i thought about it for a second , kindly declined , he tried to persuade me with more money but i again declined . in hindsight , its really gross to think about it and it still bothers me sometimes knowing a good friend was letting him do it .

17. yeah . help is one thing we lack here . most people can ' t understand the whole thing . and the ones who do , doesn ' t know how to help . and the organisations there to help aren ' t very effective either . it ' s nightmare to have depression here . speaking of which , can you describe what made you get out of it ? i ' m kinnda looking for answers myself .

18. none right now . i started over since my old university wouldn ' t release my transcripts when i moved since i got a withdrawal penalty . i don ' t think i ' m gonna be able to graduate in four years because i ' m behind academically in my major . mechanical engineering there ' s a lot of perquisites i have to take before i can even take the classes i need to transfer . so i think when i transfer i ' ll probably spend a good digit years at the university . or digit years at the community college getting the credits and appropriate classes i need to transfer . makes me me wonder if i ' m out of my league trying out mechanical engineering . at my old university i got into the engineering program , but from what i recall about it that , i barely understood what any of my professors were talking about . i mean i know i can do it , but to it four years , while balancing a part time job and other things , idk . but idk , maybe im miscalculating . i ' ll take another look tomorrow .

19. reading this back i seem fucking insane but it  s not really how it reads i guess ? there is definitely only digit me not digit  a phobia but it might be ? basically i will be a normal functioning human being but sometimes my subconscious voice will feel estranged from  me  . what this means is that my subconscious would go  hey what would happen if i were to make you do this ?  and the i  ll have to think really hard not to do it . it feels like there is digit people in my mind and the other is trying to control what i do . or it could be compared to the devil and angel on your shoulders . for instance i  ll be walking around somewhere and my subconscious will go   what if you were to scream maniacally at the top of your lungs  or  what if you just ripped a massive fart right now in the midst of everyone  and i  ll literally have to go  nononono nooooooo  to blot out this thought or i  m petrified i might actually just go ahead and do it . at the same time i know there is no way in hell i  m ever going to do this . my mind is against me occasionally and it sucks . i promise you i am digit  a single mind and a normal person .
