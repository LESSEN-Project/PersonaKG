1. this turn one is auto concede from odd rogue since the only aoe they really have is fan of knives . then for the late game i run two doomguards , two digit mana digit  7s and leeroy to finish it out . i ' ve found it to be one of the stronger aggro decks but there are a lot of digit or digit card combos . all i did was throw digit digit mana heal boi and digit ghouls into regular zoo .

2. sorry i didn ' t mean rarely activated . i meant it ' s rare to have digit or more negative effects on at once . especially with vero cleansing . but yeah i do see the benefit to her 2nd skill . but i ' m also interested in getting my dragons team to auto . i don ' t think changing the lead will result in an auto ready team . is there a monster i have that would really help me out . su perhaps ? or maybe throwing verad into the line  up .

3. artanis is a good one to base him on if he ' s a tank . i ' m thinking if he ' s an offense he ' ll be more like diablo or illidan .

4. any double shiryu teams for akainu ? edit  this team worked for me . it isn ' t too reliable , it ' s shiryu what else did you expect grinning  face  with  sweat but can get the job done . 2x shiryu raid doffy  any slasher with sockets preferably str sws zoro the one that negates str dmg  psy usopp ship  coffin boat . maxed specials on usopp and zoro are the best things to go with here . sockets were not needed . but lvl digit bind despair would help i guess . strategy  none . your healing basically reduced to zero , so avoid extra damage  focus on getting shiryu up by the 5th stage . use zoro whenever you feel like it . basically he ' ll be used only if you ' re unlucky with shiryu after akainu ' s revive to buy another turn . use usopp as and when required . as is the case with zoro , usopp is to be used if shiryu fails to kill akainu in the first digit turns ,  even then he ' ll buy us one turn only . so all in all , it ' s rng dependant . but can help you get that one gem if you need it here  now .

5. ultra necrozma malamar is probably more consistent than this . you have way too much going on . i also don ' t see why you run ditto since you don ' t run metang . also you need digit ultra balls

6. i got angelica , destina , carrot , and tieria . should i re  roll or just go with this team ?

7. i used my generic gem on void and he is a god , so good for longer fights like mini bosses or bosses in aw .

8. you ' re getting way too focused on weird combo ' s here , kt would be a very weird card to run in this class since it ' s focused on keeping minions alive not sacrificing them , and even if it could have some great combos i don ' t think it ' s worth running a card like kt for that doesn ' t work with the deck . this is one of the things that needs some playtesting to see how good it will be , you can ' t expect me to make a card that everyone can agree on is balanced .

9. use the wa as much as possible , i did an uchi playthrough and i ended up using it until i got onikiri and ubadachi , the wa will do significant damage as long as you keep dex up and plus it up . also , if you  re running a dexterity build which i assume you are infuse the uchi with a sharp gem and it  ll scale with your dexterity better

10. chi brew is better for single target  with serenity , and eventually when you get digit  set and a higher ilvl and class trinket let ' s say average digit  you ' ll want to run chi explosion  ascension for multi and single , as it just gets easier to manage with very little difference in dps . i might be wrong about the last bit as its been a while since i ' ve gone and played ww , mostly brm at the moment . the most important thing to remember is that this is a game , and   you have to play it my way or not at all   personal preference takes precedence over min  maxing unless you prefer to min  max and like doing as well as you possibly can .

11. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .

12. abq even aqb would be great if you ' re someone like jalter or scathach with high hits on b . course if you ' re gonna crit with the arts it ' d be best to go qba . can see all the values

13. buy the winston one . if you don ' t play pharah , it ' s easier to wait , since you ' ll never see her , whereas a hero you play a lot , you ' ll end up seeing a lot more and get more overall enjoyment value from .

14. interesting take . don ' t have cls . running the squad with thrawn currently . i ' m assuming the removal of thrawn and r2 and the addition of hy and ezra will benefit the overall synergy . you don ' t really need too many damage dealers as dn removes two per battle anyways . it ' s digit v digit basically and gk never dies when i play ai .
