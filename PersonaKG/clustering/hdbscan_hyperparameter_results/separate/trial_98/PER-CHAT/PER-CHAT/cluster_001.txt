1. i would like to think that certain future events could be dreamt about occasionally . but that ' s a different story . i think that this time it is more likely subconscious thing . there is stuff bothering me . either that or i was visited by an evil entity at least i go to heaven ? lol .

2. i  ve had these dreams where people get glazed over looks in their eyes , then they  explode  sort of and become these dark trees . i  ve had it long enough that an entire forest has been created

3. those " alternate life  dimension  reality " dreams always just feel like the " regular life " , but . enhanced . let ' s say everything smells and sounds more accurate , more intense . no unusual sounds or smells whatsoever . on another note , i can ' t recall what specifically happened in them , but i do remember they ' re some sort of " alternate dimensions " , where i made different choices or some things directly concerning me went a different way . e . g i ' m a drug dealer in some slums . when i wake up from them , i don ' t feel my body at all  i don ' t feel anything , i just see . i slowly open my eyes , and i ' m unable to recognize where i am , feeling like i ' ve been moved somewhere else , while it ' s just my regular , real  life bedroom . it takes me a good couple of minutes to realize i ' m conscious and awake in reality . what intrigues me the most about this is that maybe death is just a transition to another reality . i don ' t know . sorry for the poor grammar . it ' s pretty difficult to put this in words .

6. havent had this happen . keep in mind that a hallucination is not only visual , just any feeling you get that is not real . currently up researching this because digit increasingly scarier consecutive hypnagogic hallucinations within an hour have me scared to try to go to sleep

7. when i was digit i vividly remember this huuuge ant in my grandmother ' s carpet . my memory is usually pretty bad but i remember this like it was yesterday because of how much it scared me . looked like something out of a movie . but , of course , we don ' t normally have giant ants crawling around , and so to this day no one believes me
