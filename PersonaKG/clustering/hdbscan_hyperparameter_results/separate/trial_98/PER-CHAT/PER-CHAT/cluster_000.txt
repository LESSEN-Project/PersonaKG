1. now i ' m not gonna downvote just because i completely disagree with you , just could tell you in a couple years there could be some other group of idiots who don ' t even eat vegetables because would also be killing and say everyone should only drink water . whatever your ethics are , good for you , but don ' t try and force them into people .

2. obviously , the committee says it ' s safe . i don ' t believe them digit  but i also think the reports of " one gulp you die " are wildly exaggerated .

3. i understand that , but you can  t just replace digit  of medications with weed . if you could , that would be a medical miracle unlike anything the world has ever seen . i understand your point , and i agree that the prescription drug industry is one of the most evil things this world has to offer . that terrible industry is the reason why many people believe that you can just smoke weed or use essential oils to fix your medical issues , and it isn  t those peoples  fault . i don  t want you to think that i  m trying to be disparaging , because i know both of us have had very different walks of life , and we will never see things the same way . i  m sorry for the shortness and rude tone of my first comment towards you , but it  s very dangerous to say that weed is better than the vast majority of prescription drugs .

4. why don ' t we just dump amphetamines in the water supply ? isn ' t this pretty clearly a slippery  slope fallacy ? is there a real counter  argument to the ' better living through chemistry ' idea when we ' re talking about decisions individuals and their doctors make ?

5. ding ding ding . youre right . thats what i was trying to say . the gov thinks the nic addiction is more minor than a heroin addiction , so they ' ll keep nic legal and tax it to make money , because thats what governments do . however , they think heroin is more dangerous and would prefer to keep it illegal rather than tax it . seems like we ' re on the same page here .

6. sure , people eat that stuff all the time . and some of them get sick . you don ' t need to check the temperature of your food , buts leaving it out at room temperature isn ' t exactly a " proptip . you ' d be better off putting it in a low heat oven , or the fridge and then just nuking it gor a minute or digit .

7. well that begs the question , do you think cannibalism being illegal is the only thing preventing it ? if you could go to your local supermarket and buy some roast human rump , would you ?

8. people who bring about suffering like that are just sick . i eat meat , but think it should be put down as quickly as possible . that ' s just damn depressing .

9. lol . shp ? if not , yta . it ' s irrational and dramatic to say " i ' ve suddenly decided to stop eating this and if you do , you ' ll die " you do you , but don ' t force your opinions and they ' re opinions , there ' s no evidence to suggest eating fast food chicken will definitely give you cancer or guilt trip your loved ones .

10. i mean even the most ardent marijuana supporters must concede it makes people less active and lazy . what are you talking about ? sure , some pot smokers are lazy , but are they lazy because they smoke pot or do they smoke pot because they ' re lazy ? there ' s a lot of really lazy unmotivated people that don ' t use any drugs at all . how would you explain that ? maybe we could just blame video games or something else in that case ? some people are just lazy . you do know people of all professions smoke pot , right ? i ' ve smoked pot since i was digit . got a pilot ' s license , college degree , and have run my own business for the past digit years . just about all of my friends smoke weed and they have all been employed for decades doing just fine . they have spouses , are great parents , own nice homes , etc . you know what makes people less active and lazy ? being hung over . i ' d much rather my employees smoke weed at the end of the day to wind down and get to work the next morning well rested . you ' ve bought into the narrative that has been preached to you since birth . this , coming from a dare graduate lol .

11. you ' re ridiculous and making your whole movement look bad . do you want to know why vegans are seen as a joke to so many people ? because of the ones like you that are outspoken but can ' t form a proper thought .

12. that doesn ' t prove your point . if i fit it into my macros and am still physically active there ' s nothing wrong with it . it ' s not like i ' m loading up a potato chip sandwich every day and shoving it in my gullet while i watch tv . on the infrequent occasion that i decide to make a sandwich , i ' m gonna put some potato chips on that mofo . you ' re acting as if any human that decides to consume an item that ' s not healthy is suddenly the fattest of the fat and the highest of the stoners . that ' s just ignorant .
