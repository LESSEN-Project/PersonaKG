3. yta her relationship with him isn ' t your problem or issue . her relationship with you is . and it sounds like you damaged it , hard . can you imagine being raised by someone for digit years and counting and for them to not want to adopt you ? ouch .

4. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

5. yeah if you have a gut feeling you won ' t like dating her then don ' t . i mean if she wants to just be fwb that would be cool though lol .

6. " sucking it up " is a bad phrase to use imo . idk your life , but " accept " is a word that works for me . i am me , the world is the world . if you ' ve been sheltered , use every experience as a lesson that helps guide you in your journey exploring the world . going back to your bad trip , personally i think it ' s your body trying to tell you something . we have amazing , intuitive instincts that are buried within us but we ' re afraid when they try to tell us something . even if it ' s scary , you have to embrace what you feel so that you can get to know yourself a little better . baby steps are absolutely ok for this process .

7. absolutely speak to your therapist . you trust them . they will help you . you need to get yourself out of that relationship for your safety , physical and psychological . this is not a one  off occurrence .

8. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .
   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

9. stay strong and don  t break . you  ll be better off without her . kicking this will be like kicking a drug . you  ll be smacked with the urge out of no where . but trust me , you don  t want a relationship with someone who doesn  t want to be with you . no one wins . you got this .
   (ID: ba2b62efe335afb5002057a08f40c489849fc6cf)

10. thank you for the response , i  ve been considering whether she  s really worth keeping around anyways . it  s just so hard to cut out someone who you  ve known your whole life .
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

11. hey . firstly you need to speak to someone be it a doctor or the samaritans , someone . secondly why are you looking up reasons instead of looking inwards and seeing what the actual issue is . do you have depression or something that maybe people around you don ' t know how to handle ? what kind of person are you ? are you kind ? thoughtful ? generous with your time ? empathetic ? honest ? nice ? these are all traits that people like . or are you selfish ? negative ? deceitful ? apathetic ? narcissistic ? irresponsible ? egotistical ? you can change your behaviour and your characteristics . you are not always going to be the person you perceive yourself to be now . everyone has the potential to change and grow . believe in yourself . only you have the ability to make yourself happy . don ' t depend on others to validate you . mind yourself .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

12. knock that bish off the pedestal . really , if you keep her there you  ll never be able to appreciate anyone else . including yourself ! ex is an ex for a reason .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

13. the first thing you do is sop pestering her about how she feels . yes , you didn ' t tell her . yes , she found out and is pissed off . but this is a forgivable offense . as long as you stopped sleeping with your roommate before you entered the relationship with your current girlfriend you have nothing to worry about . trust me , the more you apologize the madder and more distant she is going to become . i have learned this the hard way because i ' ve been in your place with a similar situation . you already apologized profusely . do not contact her until she has dealt with her emotions and is ready to talk to you about this . patience is what you need now , not another angle on how to apologize even more profusely .
   (ID: 8f33db98a9fa29c8f9e44012d79de72291a29519)

14. try to think about how you want her to feel about your exes . that  s how you should handle it .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

15. you know , i  ve been at that point in my life where i wondered why i had so many failed relationships . but then i realized all of them had one thing in common . me . there  s a reason why we pick the partners we do . go to counseling because you want to be the best you that you can be , not because she made the call . go for you . i hope you do it .

16. yeah this is bad man . very bad . that ' s emotional cheating . it ' s legitimate cheating . you ' ve known for a while that your wife loves attention from men . this is problematic . i think the best solution is separation and possibly divorce . you said it yourself , you feel like the bond that you had with her has been broken . don ' t think twice about it because christmas is around the corner . your wife is a cheater . she requires validation from other men that aren ' t her husband . you were there every night after work for her when you were newlyweds . it ' s never good enough for her . you deserve better , op .
   (ID: 8f33db98a9fa29c8f9e44012d79de72291a29519)

17. cut your loss and move on . obviously easier said than done but sitting around wondering what you did wrong , why she would do that , etc . is only going to make the hurt last longer . just do your best to forget about it and maybe try something easy like tinder to keep you distracted . you don ' t need to use it for sex or anything unless you want to but talking to girls on there is super easy . keeps me distracted when i am hung up on someone .

18. the unfortunate thing with being human is that despite our radical free will , we can only choose for ourselves  not others . i ' ve been through young love and know its inexplicable potency . however , first love won ' t necessarily be your best love . in situations like this , the more you try to force things , the worse they will become . a few words of encouragement about your sexuality  gay and lesbian relationships occur among many species of animals in the wild . there ' s nothing wrong with what you ' re feeling or who you ' re attracted to . i think what makes people uncomfortable about it is that it inherently presents a challenge to the privilege heterosexuals have and are generally unwilling to reflect critically about . although you don ' t want to break up , try to stay strong . the best thing you can do is let her know that you love her and are there for her if she needs you . i wish you both the best .

19. if you want my advice on what you should do now , in your present situation . keeping in mind that it is just that , my advice . i ' d say you should first make peace with yourself and the situation . accept that you can move on and live a healthy , happy , productive life full of love and positive relationships if you never speak to him again . this is vital . it ' s the single most important thing you can do right now . search your soul . be strong , and realize that strength . then , tell him you ' re sorry for trying to force his hand , but you realize that you can ' t continue this way . then walk away . it sort of speaks to that old addage " if you love something , set it free " if he wants to be with you , truly wants to , he ' ll figure it out . this will accomplish digit things for you . a you ' re absolving yourself of his blame for ruining the other girl ' s life and you ' re removing a card he can play later . let me explain that a little better . say you don ' t take my advice which , again , is your choice and you keep up the ultimatum . in digit days , he chooses you and the two of you continue your relationship . no relationship is perfect . everyone fights . everyone has bad days . everyone feels annoyed  irritated by their partner . and everyone wonders if they made the right choice . this is what you ' ve given him  a great big if . one he can idealize in his head . " oh , itssodifficult is being such a bitch right now ! othergirl wasn ' t ever this bitchy  crazy  irrational  werewolfy ! i bet if i ' d stayed with her , i ' d be so much happier now " that ' s a seed you have helped plant , and every time there ' s an arguement or disagreement , it grows , as does his resentment . and if he stays in touch with or reestablishes contact with othergirl , she is the one who consoles him . she becomes the one he can talk to , and their bond strengthens . this isn ' t a great way to go about establishing a healthy relationship , set aside the fact that manipulation never ends well . b if he does decide you ' re the one he wants , making that choice is now his . and he now has to do something to get your attention  win you back , which is , i believe , under the heading of " needing to prove " something to you , yes ? so it ' s a two birds one stone type deal , whereas now all he has to do to win you over is say " yep , i dumped her " c you ' ll renew this relationship on equal footing . that ' s important if you actually have hopes of this relationship lasting . sorry for the wall of text .

20. i have been in a similar situation . you just got paroled my friend . look at it this way . you can be happy now . that relationship ? that was never going to happen and your attachment was just going to make you more miserable as time went on . now you finally have the opportunity to find someone who will make you happy . you  re like truman burbank stepping out of the studio and into the real world .
