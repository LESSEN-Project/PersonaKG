1. i don ' t disagree . i ' m inclined to believe there was some affair seeing how terry has never publicly acknowledged it , and bridge clearly has a grudge against him , but i don ' t know how much of the story is true , and neither really does anyone except from the people involved .

2. how can you be committed after just a month . most guys date more than one girl at a time . personally after a month i start cutting off ties from other flings , but you ' re a fool if you think you ' re the only one in the first month

3. an old radio control model airplane kit . it was a kit i had sought for years and they were extremely rare . today , i doubt there is a single one left . i had wanted to build one and fly it for close to a decade . the kit was brand new in a mint condition box . it was an estate sale for an ww2 veteran and his widow was obviously still quite shaken by his passing . she had marked the kit at  digit . it was a collectable kit and worth close to  digit , digit . she had no idea . i forced her to take  digit for it . that ' s everything i had on me at the time . she was crying and her kids were crying when i told them what it was worth and forced the money into her trembling hands . i did build it and flew it for several years . i retired the plane and donated it to a local vfw in the mans name in digit .

8. nope nta . as a chef i see this waaaayyy too much . people looking to  cheat the system  to get things for free i blame corporate chains but that  s a rant for another time . so from me to you , thank you for not letting her get away with it because it  s an ah thing to do , it  s not like i get my food for free

9. i like that the mcmahons never ask someone to do a move that they wouldn ' t have done themselves . shane took some pretty crazy bumps against kane and angle .

10. blood diamond . i had no idea that was going on in the world until i saw that movie . truly saddening and disturbing to see how persecuted those innocent people were over a rock . now anytime i see a diamond in a store window i wonder if it  s a conflict diamond .

12. i ' m not overreacting at all . you are right about hutton not performing up to par , and you could be right about having the full roster , but knowing newell brown , he has always had a left handed shot in the slot , even last year . here is a good watch on why this method is so effective

14. why would you want to hide your personality ? i see it as expressing your true self to people , because i have been liying to people for too long . on the other hand there is the argument that , well accourse it ' s just a hobby and that people shouldn ' t care what hobbies you have , but lets be honest , who ' s personality hasn ' t changed because of the fandom ?

15. their videos section ? you can click on the categories to go to  uploads  , so it  s all their videos in chronological order , if that  s what you mean .

19. uh now i see why the president of uber left lol , " blaming system for being too harsh " , i think the last thing i want is a sex offender in a car with a single woman drunk from a party going home . i don ' t think the problem is the system the problem is trying to justify the numbers turned away , if you make a pretty serious mistake then you should blame yourself aka dui , 3rd degree manslaughter , any accidents handicapping a person , child related sex offence , rape , molestation , etc . i rather this check still be in place then have anybody like this slip through . even with the system we still have rare cases of the driver being innappropriate or another .
