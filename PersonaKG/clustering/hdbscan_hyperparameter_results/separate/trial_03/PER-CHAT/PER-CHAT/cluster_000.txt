1. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .

3. since this platform is free for everyone to post and comment all kinds of things i won  t take your note on keeping my nose out especially from someone with attitude you possess . by all means you deserve to be called out and maybe you should take a note about changing your attitude towards others , because too much negativity is bad for everyone . i  m not american btw , stop assuming , looks like it  s not for you .

4. i  m arguing because you say stupid things and can  t accept the fact that your post is not fun , smart , or helpful . you argue like a child and need to learn that not everything you say matters . you don  t want to argue , don  t respond . your the one who posted a garbage post with moron comments . you get off reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

5. yeah , there is no stigma , and your response speaks far more to your issues than to anyone elses . please don ' t try to tell people what they should and shouldn ' t decide they want when all parties have all the facts .
   (ID: a97bb0d0211a340588db770f6b8b5fd394d26db9)

6. fair point and i fully agree with you , but you " should  have hidden paxter redwyne ' s username , or seek him out in the forum and inform him that you have exposed his opinion here . because as it is he sounds like an ignorant and may not even know . he deserves a right to reply and clarify his opinion  correct his mistake .
   (ID: 67ef96fb30756c49a9ffdff2579058eb2a3c1398)

7. you ' re exactly the reason trump got in . people like you will never learn . think you ' re always in the right . i think both sides are to blame . accountability  look it up
   (ID: 059c976738098229106db9c4736116cbb2f47eb8)

8. actually i only wanted to talk about you and not to you because i know you act like a child and knew the level of stupidity would reach all time high like this " conversation . but believe what you want , i don ' t care . i ' m done wasting my time here .
   (ID: 8bc3c38873da8df8d450deb17fd3c4a602037c65)

9. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

10. oh , clearly we are done . that much was obvious once you , in your arrogance , started your condescending name calling and telling me what my own opinions are and then saying they are wrong . as soon as you did that , i knew that i had no interest in discussing the topic with you further . so , i just left it the quite accurate , " opinions vary "
   (ID: b70c0c020fa60fd16329a7c04f4d71a7514815c1)

11. there ' s so much wrong in what you wrote . you obviously don ' t know anything about jesus . you probably never even opened a bible before . you just say what you decided , on your own terms , everything you wrote . you just hate trump so much that you got your head up your bum . you just did a paradox on yourself there bub . you successfully wrote a hate speech against people who you assume are hating on others . you hating on people who hate , so you hate yourself !

12. says the guy still in school whose posting history for several pages is almost exclusively about video games . seriously man , you ' ve got some real anger problems , and they come from you needing to accept something about yourself . i don ' t know what it is , maybe it ' s something as simple as a preference for the color pink . whatever it is , it ' s making you lash out in judgement against others . not only do you not have any room to judge others , it ' s just shitty behavior overall . make the world a better place man  love what you ' re going to love , and don ' t shit on anyone else for doing the same thing .

13. i think at this point your just upset that a little american boy has a different opinion then you and your trying to make me look like a dumb homophobic nazi
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

14. but the left has a ' my way or the highway ' mentality do you not even realize how biased you just were ?
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

15. you know what , you ' re absolutely right , it ' s mean for me to point out your errors  especially on a forum like idle heroes . i don ' t intend to discourage you or make you feel like you need to justify yourself . you ' ve taught me a lesson today and in the future , i ' ll know that pointing out someones minor mistakes , is not worth the effort and only upsets people . thank you for taking the time for the back and forth . peace .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

16. quite an angry individual really . did you want us to just agree with you and not have an opinion ? you post the comment as a discussion when you should have posted it as a whinge !
   (ID: f5763a92443387c5141c5b5c8482139d272a2034)

17. lets take a moment to appreciate how much you assumed i implied from my accusations of your implications . have fun with your lesson in reading into things
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

18. that ' s a very shallow assumption . also you can ' t tell me i can ' t . you ' re not even contributing any ideas related to the thread so why are you here anyway ? to put me down ? you ' re wasting your time . i got what i came for which was a little bit of light shed on a subject that i was more curious to learn about .
   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

19. why does it matter how i respond to you ? your argument is invalid .
   (ID: 4126a6a9d5a548a6bed5e0c4992792b1c10f2b92)

20. so tell me child . how much joy do you get out of this ? and it seems as though you ' ve forgotten there is a world outside of america . where left and right wings protest peacefully , intellectually an through many generations . you seem , perspectively through your comments on this thread alone . like nothing more than an imbecile , a child , an idiot . i hope you come to learn one day that there are benefits to all sides of the political compass . and if your narrow . you ' ll only lead to a narrow mid which in all cases . is simply , useless . good day
