1. not similar at all . gamecocks are a different breed . a breed that accepts our failures , champions our successes and moves forward after fucking up , as we have in this game .

2. hearing loss . i can  t hear lyrics real well , and anything with high bass hurts . i enjoy instrumentals , so i tend to listen to video game music when i  m in the mood for it , but it  s not very often .

3. you get to the center of the galaxy and it is nothing . the game pulls away and you end up in another galaxy with all your stuff broken .

5. you should get the " rank " back from the game if a cheater is banned but the game would show a rank up without you getting a win or draw . there ' s also the chance you derank to a cheater then after they get banned you ' ve since lost more " elo " so the " elo " you get back doesn ' t rank you back up

10. overwatch . the game currently has too many ways to stop a player from playing  stunlock and all that . took a while for me to realize what it was about the game that was making me so angry , but i haven ' t been back since . sometimes i kinda miss it and want to go back , but then i see a play of the game or highlight that involves so much stunlock it hurts , and i decide not to .
