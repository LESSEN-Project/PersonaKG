2. it ' s just where you ' ve smoked copious amounts of weed and then later on . you feel like you ' re gonna pass out . sometimes you do . sometimes you barf . but all the time your face goes white . like whiter than white esp if you are white so all your mates tease you and point shouting " you ' re having a whitey " it ' s not great . i had one a few years back in a pub and fainted upon a family having dinner . very embarrassing . not to be recommended .

5. i don ' t know that i would . this seems like a free lie detector test to me . i ' m sure this is going to be unpopular opinion but if you know this you and they don ' t know you know then why not leverage that to your advantage and get obscure information out of them .

6. i get why some people don ' t like the casting choices but why not give them a chance and at least watch some of their performances which by the way i can ' t find much for anya

7. it was my first rda too but i now have several more . it is really the best though , i only use the other ones when i want to do flavor comparisons without having to re  wick . i never thought i would be a cloud chaser but it sure is fun to get some dense fog going with the mxv4 , and the flavor is really great as well .

9. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .

10. you can get the back embroidered to say " proud dad " or " best father " or something like that to avoid anyone getting butthurt on him having it . the nex can do it or a shop in town . if you know any prs they may be okay with doing the embroidery for you .

11. louisiana . i don ' t get why cities don ' t understand this makes the whole place look bad . would i want to visit and spend my money in a town that lets their police act this way ? that ' s a hard no .

12. that  s easy i got a digit not long ago and i  m not wasting my time and i know your gonna be a little infant and call me scared but look up my stats redpandaforce2 . i really don  t care about you nor your pathetic need to call me out just get better clips if your trying to showboat champ .

13. thats completely unethical and if anyone found out , it would ruin his career . im not saying that you should attempt to do such a thing , but knowing that you got blackmail on him may give you the feeling of a bit more power over the situation . im sorry you had to deal with such a terrible therapist and your feelings are totally justified . perhaps you dont feel like you want to be a part of the dating scene for a while , but there are guys out there who do respect women and will respect your needs . the only reason i mention dating is because i imagine it  s easier to have s . o . you can talk to about your emotions than not . mutual hate makes for a great friendship anyways

14. since you ' re asking this ill assume your digit or younger . sleeping with her friends might work , but it ' s a stupid idea i learned the hard way . if you ' re in the friendzone doing anything else will be a waste of time .

15. i ' m just a little sleep deprived . you ' re right speeding is a crime . i never cross the speeding limit but i ' m saying there ' s a lot of silly reasons cops pull people over for and the first instinct and innocent civilian would get it is to flee after seeing those i timidating lights . that ' s my point of argument .

16. personally i would say that altair and edward would be the last ones standing . kenway , being a pirate would be prone to fighting dirty and altair was trained from the moment he could walk , if my memory serves pun totally fucking intended , would , and should absolutely kick ass . personally i think that altair takes the cake but it would be a pretty close call .

17. how many more companies are you talking to ? do you really think it ' s between these two companies ? there ' s a problem in decision theory called the secretary problemv that has parallels to your situation . might be worth reading , if you ' re so inclined .

18. the twitter situation was the very first question that dan asked seguin . i didn ' t get the impression that seguin was butthurt , more just surprised that he asked the question . i also didn ' t think that dan did it on purpose . dan is a jerk because he doesn ' t care enough about their guests to remember something like that . oh , and once he figured it out , he mumbled " oh , steers and queers .

19. i think this goes a little unappreciated and xbows only could be really enjoyable i think .

20. let ' s be honest though . we all know what would really happen you get to the ice cream freezer at the gas station , reach for the klondike bar , then go " holy shit ! they have choco tacos " then buy one of those instead .
