1. it happened about a year and a half ago . i am unsure if i could still do so . looking back on it now i wish i had right away . then again i didn ' t quite know what was happening . you hear about it and know the stories . outside it seems so simple but inside it is just a cluster of confusion . i definitely did not feel black and white about it . i was in shock about it and actually just didnt let my mind process it . not to mention the extreme victim shaming and drama that was ensued by my ex over it . the prioritizing of his own feelings . he callrd it " what you did " and how could i have done this " to him " . it distracted me from really ever doing anything about it . and yeah , it was a big thing in my life . still is . i ' m still dealing with it . i found out recently that this guy has another case against him apparently . if i speak out it would help the case . but i am trying to heal . and i ' m currently unsure if i pursue going to the authorities what will happen . will it reopen everything . make it worse . will everyone turn against me again . will i lose the little friends i have left . will i feel worse ? will i find closure ? i will have to tell my parents . now that will just open up more wounds and i am already swimming in lacerations . i am just unsure if i have the strength to survive all of those factors . and until i find that strength i have kept quiet . but then on the other hand i am beginning to feel that if speak up i will find more strength and maybe more closure than i thought i needed . i don ' t even want to face or him or ever see him again . because this guy made me believe that he really cared about me . the lies he told me . if i ever see him again i don ' t know how i would react and i fear that as well . part of me still cares for the part of him that he pretended to be . so it still scares me that i might feel those feelings if i ser him again . for me its hard to let go of that person because i really needed the person he was with that mask on . and i fell for it . ah i dont know . but i do know that hes young . and capable of getting better at being that way . so something needs to be done so he doesn ' t do what he did to me to anyone else , or worse .

2. did you ever talk about it ? with someone close or a professional ? i mean i was in an abusive relation once , took me a couple of years to get over the most troublesome aspects mostly because i acted like i was ok . but i ' m in a happy relation now . i ' ve just been really open about it with my partner and she knows that there are things that trigger me . she tries to help me with it . it ' s nice to have a partner .

3. i understand this so much . i ' ve still got attachment disorder , and when i was younger i was always sort of happy that i didn ' t trust anyone . it made me feel like i had a superpower . never trusted anyone , and never expected anything beyond the worst possible reality from any situation or outcome . i built this huge protective wall around myself . now , at digit  something , i miss the human interaction of plain ol ' friendship . i even hold my husband at arm ' s length because there ' s still this part of me that refuses all attempts at real intimacy . and therapy is ok  i can at least tell my therapist about my ' trust issues ' , but i don ' t think i ' m capable of being ' cured ' .

4. thank you . i don ' t blame myself in a way that isn ' t realistic . i blame myself for not being aware of the warning signs of what happened to me . that ' s about the extent . i don ' t harbor any unhealthy emotions and though i suffer mildly from ptsd i am conscious enough to work on my issues . with that being said . yes , i am still with my boyfriend . the truth of the matter is that he simply isn ' t emotionally mature enough to understand the depths of what had happened . i did threaten to break up with him . the first couple of times he said it to me i didn ' t stand up for myself . i don ' t know why . but the last time he said it i really stuck it to him . i realized that if he thinks this way i can ' t possibly marry someone who will think like that and i told him that . i also told him i will happily leave because i know i wouldn ' t be suffering a loss if that ' s the way he is thinking . for the first time in all the time i have known him he stopped and gave me a very heart felt apology taking accountability for his lack of sympathy and understanding . quite frankly , a lot of other things were said . but it was true and i know he meant it . this is still a red flag for me . if i am suffering from something in the future , am i going to have to be the one to walk him through it too ? just because i am more emotionally equipped to handle ? he ' s not a horrible person . but he is selfish in his thinking . and he is emotionally sheltered . after digit years i am starting to wonder if i want to be the one who does all of the picking up .

5. ugh . a whole family of narcs , that  s me . nmom has six siblings and an nmom of her own , and for the last forty years it  s been a hot steaming mess . this uncle won  t talk to this aunt . these aunts won  t talk to my mother . grandma won  t talk to this son . they have they little cliques and mean girl groups and after fourth years of watching this nonsense it  s all in another language , but from my vantage point it  s still nonsense i get weary just thinking about all the energy expended in this family all hating each other for years . my mother refused to do have anything to do with her brother because she went to grade school with his wife and my aunt used to tease my mom as a kid . stupid stuff like that . it  s like these folks don  t know about forgiveness , or how to let go of resentments or hostility and the only way they communicate is via anger . lots of anger . it  s such a tiresome way to live .

7. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers

8. no you handled it well . i would of done the exact same thing . think of it this way  if he did kill his self and you didn ' t inform anyone , you would feel a lot worse . you ' ve done the right thing . you ' ve broken up with him and told several people so now it ' s their job to look out for him . not yours . you are free .
