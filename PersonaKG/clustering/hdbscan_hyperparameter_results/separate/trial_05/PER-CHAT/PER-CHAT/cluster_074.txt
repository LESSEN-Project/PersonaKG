SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 13

1. it takes me forever to memorise numbers so i can see myself having to check my number , however i wouldn ' t shove my phone in someone ' s face and tell them to copy the number from the phone .
   (ID: f8771fc63bc4c52bb04b2e71d4aefe7bf406c65c)

2. as a brit , i don ' t do this . it probably has something to do with me being a bit fat .

3. the hold music is really terrible . it ' s hard to imagine who thought that was a good idea or why . i end up muting my computer between calls but then when i alt  tab sometimes i miss a call .

4. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?

5. i only do that if a close friend is trying to take a picture of me when i ' m not paying attention .
   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

6. i mean , sometimes i just really don  t want to talk to anyone , even if i  m on the internet doing other stuff . talking to people can be exhausting and not everyone can handle being in constant communication with multiple people . i  m ignoring my best friend as i type this because i just want to be left alone right now , but it doesn  t mean i hate him . if i were to send that brief  hi  i  d be committed to a solid hour of giving another person my undivided attention when i barely have the emotional reserves to scroll mindlessly through memes . some of us are introverts . some of us are depressed , or busy , or have people in our lives with issues that we need to prioritise over a friendly conversation . honestly i think the way we  re constantly a press of a button away from everyone in our lives has given people unrealistic expectations about how much attention is reasonable .

7. like how i just responded to someone who replied in a similar way , its not necessarily a bad habit . i was just taught that it wasn ' t good to do a lot . i say dont worry about it . i personally dont care if someone looks up or down while walking . just do you dude !

8. because when you ' re in rome you do as the romans do . unless you ' re obviously a tourist or you don ' t speak english at all , i think it ' s really rude to go out of your way to speak in a manner people around you can ' t understand . my wife does this to me in spanish when she wants to talk about someone we see while we ' re out or whatever and it annoys me to no end .
   (ID: f39e591889b6331bd255039773030c1b50c7e201)

9. i ' ve lost  digit in fair games , but it was fun so i don ' t regret it . i dropped my wallet and someone snatched it and i lost  digit . and i ' ve lost probably  digit  gambling in vegas . whoops .
   (ID: 7a0302ed354e54bfa45e1de27055f29421f91f29)

10. ehh no that  s not quite what i  m getting at , i know what you  re talking about . like someone looking off in the distance or distracted while talking , that  s not what i  m referring to . i  ve seen several people who talk with their eyes closed , like speak full sentences with their eyes closed . or they look up while their face is facing you . it sounds bizarre but if you know what i mean then i bet you agree it  s annoying . idk why people do it . some strange social phobia maybe
