Total from this dataset: 6

1. oh , i still say israel shouldn ' t . but you wanted a answer from the left so i gave you one . me being from the right doesn ' t mean i ' m unable to give a left answer .

2. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .

3. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .

4. you don ' t know your history ! there were no slaves in latin america ? btw your " atty " answers your question !

5. why do you think you have a right to hold judgement ?

6. if i woke up and found out i was sustaining your life because it would be the right thing to do . people have many rights to do wrong things , but it doesn ' t change the fact that it is wrong . having a right does not morally justify every circumstance . and there is a difference between action and inaction . taking an action to end innocent human life is always murder .
