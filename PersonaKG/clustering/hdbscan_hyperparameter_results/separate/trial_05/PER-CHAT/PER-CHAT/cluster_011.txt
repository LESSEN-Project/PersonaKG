2. genjo  digit genjo had inquired on possible peaceful resolutions , and both paviche and dani scoffed at the idea . though , genjo had encountered the orks before , and he knew how difficult they could be . peace didn ' t always mean not fighting , it could also mean all fighting for a better cause . genjo would have to enlighten these orks . perhaps he couldn ' t stop them from fighting , but he could redirect that energy for a better purpose . that was an idea for another time . for now genjo would just listen on as dani and pastel both asked their own questions . dani ' s was more practical of a question . though genjo already knew the answer . having faced the orks before , he knew how destructive they could be . pastel , however , asked a question of oddity . it was almost as though she didn ' t want to help . perhaps she ' d need enlightenment too . all should do what they can to better the world , even if others are more qualified to do so . after a back and forth between pavi and a newcomer , lady ward , on whether or not to let pastel become a meat shield , a woman named delilah would enter the tent to further the debrief and speak of what the true job was . essentially it was a search and destroy mission . find daggartooth and end him . genjo wasn ' t too sure this type of plan was necessary , but he ' d keep an open mind . he didn ' t want to kill , but that didn ' t mean he wasn ' t prepared to fight . the team would also get a bonus for retrieving stolen goods from a group of pirates called the sororitas . this stolen tech intrigued genjo . what could it be ? how was it stolen ? what dangers did they pose ? and what happens should they remain lost ? however , genjo would ask the questions that meant most to him .  " i have but two questions . these items that you wish us to retrieve , what are they ? and what benefits do they have ? i merely wish to understand the importance of them . "

3. the class sat in rapt attention . it was military history , one of the few breaks the soldiers  in  training got from endless physical exertion . chris had entered in a huff . several heads turned . the retired colonel that stood behind a tall wooden podium glanced up at him , but said nothing about his late arrival . instead , colonel yoshimi resumed his lecture .  we can  t go back to those days .  he told the assembled cadets . chris scanned for a spot . he found an open chair next to private sturm . she always saved him one  she liked to joke that she was his mother . chris wanted her to be something else . she gave him a sly grin . her eyes were full of a sort of merciless mirth at his late arrival . she  s going to give me shit about this for weeks . chris thought as he made his way across the room . yoshimi  s voice droned on in the background .  after the columbian conflict , the last few free states finally ratified the unified earth treaty . can anyone tell me when the last nation , yucatan , signed the treaty ?  the colonel scanned the room . no hands were raised . dozer sat down into the empty seat near private sturm .  hey , kara .  he whispered . she gave him a smirk . he saw her eyes flash . he felt his blood rise . kara sturm raised her hand , her smile growing ever larger .  yes , private sturm ?  colonel yoshimi asked , looking at her from the other side of his thick glasses . why the old man didn  t just get eye surgery , no one could guess . it was even free now after the anders healthcare and ethics bill was passed . father was thrilled about all of the attention his bill got . chris thought . mostly , though , he enjoyed the attention that he got .  i think that chris knows the answer .  kara stated with a giggle punctuating the statement . chris shot her a dirty look . her playful eyes made it impossible to be mad at her for long . still , chris hadn  t even heard the question . yoshimi looked at him .  well , private anders , i suppose that ms . sturm is probably right . you did see fit to be late for my class , for the fourth time . do you know the answer ?  no you old fuck , i don  t even know the question .  no , sir .  he answered . all of the others  eyes were glued firmly to his face . he felt their judgment radiating through the room . this just wasn  t his day .  so , then , answer this  yoshimi stated , shaking his head in disappointment ,  do you enjoy running laps or are you simply incompetent ?  chris felt his teeth clench tightly . he held his breath . the room was filled with scattered giggling . after a few moments of silence , colonel yoshimi exhaled long and hard .  well , private anders , it appears that you  ll need to answer my question at a later time . the class is ending now . at least you made the last ten minutes .  with that , the retired officer turned off the massive projector that displayed the day  s assignment . chris hated school . a few minutes later , the cadets filed out into the hallway of the massive structure that the staff called the  grotten academy of military sciences  and the students called the  almond  . the structure itself was shaped like a massive circle . where the nickname had come from , no one was sure . it just was .  what the fuck , kara ?  dozer asked the blond as they left class . she flashed him another smile . instead of answering , she asked   have you finished the strategic analysis of the riss  k incursion scenario ?   riss  k  was the short hand name for the aliens known as  riss  kkari  . they were an ancient empire that bordered the human colonies charybdis  iii and scylla  ii . there was some question as to the exact nature of their society , but most experts thought that the insectoid  like aliens were organized into a strict stratum and had a hive mentality . there had been several flash fights along the fringes of human space . for the most part relations were stable if somewhat tense . still , they made the most likely galactic adversary and thus were the subject of the xeno  studies and warfare assignment . the assignment that i haven  t finished . chris thought with a sickening dread . he had chosen to do an extra two hours of training in the gym and forgotten all about it . fuck .  uhhh  . no , not yet .  he said . kara shook her head .  dozer , can  t you get anything right ?  she asked . chris opened his mouth to answer , though he wasn  t sure he had an answer to that .  you  re just lucky you  ve got me .  kara sturm continued , her sly smile returning . suddenly , a set of pages appeared him her hands .  here , i wrote this last night . i figured you  d need one .  chris looked down at the papers .  a technical analysis of ground warfare against riss  kkari assault forces  was written in bold font across the pages . beneath that , it read  by christopher anders  . chris glanced up at her .  kara , i can  t take your work . it wouldn  t be right .  she shook her head at him again . there was a strange look in her eyes . dozer wasn  t sure what it was .  look , chris , you  re already going to be running laps until tomorrow morning for being late again . if you miss an assignment they  ll make you run until kingdom come .  she said flatly .  so just take this .  she handed the papers to chris .  now get your ass to class , you can  t be late again !  with that , the blond turned and walked away . chris anders watched her go . soon , she disappeared into the throng of cadets moving to and from their classes . things never let up here , that much was obvious .  thanks , mom .  he called after her . i need to get my shit together . chris decided . then , he headed off to his next class .
