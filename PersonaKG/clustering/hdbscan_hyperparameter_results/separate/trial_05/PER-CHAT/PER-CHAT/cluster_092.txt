3. instead of tucking me in to bed as a kid with the whole " don ' t let the bed bugs bite " deal , my mom would kiss me goodnight and say " you can do or be anything you put your mind to " and i think hearing that every night developed my confidence and strength for the rest of my life so far

4. yes i think he did do i think he is a good president , no . did he do a good thing in that situation , yes . i think you are taking this post in the wrong way . also , it  s absurd to say not giving up your net worth isn  t a sacrifice , just straight ridiculous . bill gates has made it his mission to help unfortunate others if your trying to say he hasn  t done enough to be rewarded you are just acting silly . that man has made it his mission to help others . and regardless anyone who has been president of the united states has made a huge sacrifice for their love of the country . don  t get it twisted i  m simply stating celebrities get to much praise for simple acts of kindness .

9. as a teacher , i have usually had the lower echelon of students in my classes . it is fairly frequent that i ' ll be cussed at , most of the time because i did something the kid didn ' t like . i ' ll just reply with something like , " why thank you john smith , that is the nicest thing anyone has ever called me . i appreciate that compliment , i really like you , too " sometimes it pisses them off more because they don ' t have control over my actions . after all , when cussing out a teacher , they usually expect an explosion from the teacher , which classmates will film to make vines or other social media videos . most kids will usually realize that they aren ' t going to win and just mutter a " fuck you " and then go back to doing something less inappropriate .
