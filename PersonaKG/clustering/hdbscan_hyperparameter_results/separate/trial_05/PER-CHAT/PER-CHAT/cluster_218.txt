1. eating smaller amounts isn ' t the hardest thing in the world if you eat the right stuff . things you " can ' t live without " you will still miss most likely but will find other wonderful things instead . rip pizza eating right in a controlled environmental is easy , eating right elsewhere is hard . so the restaurant put fries on your plate even though you asked them not to ? not an excuse to eat them . meat is awesome forever . ok i knew that already but it ' s still true .

2. just hear me out ! taking time to really think about what you ' re eating is connected to whether or not you ' re living a happy life . that ' s why i think it ' s really important . so , there are animals that are carnivores , right ? you know , like lions , cats , and vultures . you won ' t find meat from carnivores like that at a restaurant . why is that ? because its too smelly to eat ! it ' s disgusting ! listen up , guys ! cats are too disgusting to eat . are we on the same page so far ? on the other hand , have you heard of a fish called " sweetfish " ? sweetfish don ' t eat bugs . they only eat algae . they ' re vegetarian . usually fish guts are too bitter to eat , but sweetfish guts are delicious . it ' s because they ' re not carnivores . so with that logic in mind , all the meat we consider delicious is from herbivorous animals ! cows , pigs , and chickens ! the better their food , the better they taste ! which leads us to this conclusion . humans would taste gross because they eat meat ! well ? how do you like the conclusion i came up with ?

3. there are some foods that need to be cooked that are otherwise toxic , quinoa for example . the ' cooking destroys nutrients ' thesis , although often true is irrelevant . you can eat eat a greater quantity of steamed broccoli and recieve the same amount of micronutrients as a smaller quantity of raw brocolli

4. define too little . are you eating digit ? digit ? digit ? digit ? generally i follow the belief that starvation mode is bullshit and would ignore it and trust your body but there are certainly plenty of people who think the other way . i only eat once a day and the number of people who tell me i ' ll lose weight and feel better if i have breakfast drives me quite barmy sometimes . your body is actually quite smart , listen to it . do try and eat good things though , especially if you ' re eating far under . vitamins are important !

6. where do we start .  what does intelligence have to do with the right to live . pigs are smarter than dogs . which one is it ? does intelligence matter or not . if it doesn ' t , then why did you bother saying that ? yes , intelligence matters . human lives matter more than insect lives , to the general population at least .  dogs would be owned only by people who really need them who decides what really needing them means ? is it only for guide dogs ? no therapy dogs ? no comfort and stress relieving dogs ? if you ' re lonely as fuck and depressed , you can ' t get a companion , treat it well and love it , no you have to kill it because dog food is made of meat ?  in effect we would save some acres of rainforests that would have been used otherwise to feed the animals those dogs eat . so we shouldn ' t even feed them now ? we should just leave them to die of hunger or being killed by another animal anyways ? which will happen , because predators eat prey . simple as that . humans are the only animals with the capacity to choose otherwise , and it is a choice , not a requirement . also , you think they eat the fucking rainforest itself ? as in the trees ? or the plants , because if everyone was vegan , we would eat even more , right ?  one doesnt need a dog to survive i don ' t need a phone to survive . i don ' t need electricity . i don ' t need to wipe my ass after i take a shit , but i do it . why ? because life is not solely about survival , and if you think that , i don ' t know what you hope to do in your life .  would you slaughter a goat for your dog yourself ? if it were him or the goat , i should let my dog die for a goat ? a goat who will probably die anyway , being killed by one of countless predators as it is prey . dogs are predators . i care about him , he counts on me to live . i don ' t know the goat . it ' s just a goat , i ' m not going to die or have my dog die for it .  i bet many vegan pet owners would go sick from the sheer amount of death they caused . show me the argument . show me a movement saying that pets should be slaughtered . i don ' t care if the opinion is held by vegans , doctors , monks , or fucking talking trees , just show me that any collective group of people other than you has come up with this abomination .

7. if you try and eat a little something at meal times even if you  re not that hungry then that might prevent you going all out after you  ve gone a long time without food . you  re probably a lot more hungry that you realise

8. hunters do not ask anyone else to adopt thier morals . hunters are not compelled to kill by tenet but by choice , there are plenty of times i ' ve sat in a blind had a few beers and never touched my bow as deer wandered by . i can say that i didn ' t even try to kill anything today when i get back to the lodge and no one will say that i ' m not longer a hunter . my bet is if you say to a group of vegans that you just a little bacon today or a bit of scrambled eggs this morning the reaction will not be as favorable .

9. i love food . i love almost all food . i can cook very well , and have a deep and broad knowledge of food . but you know ? i still like shitty hotdogs , kfc mac  cheese and rainier ale . my appreciation for the nice stuff doesn ' t dilute my enjoyment of the cheap stuff .

10. yes , that ' s why i said responsibly . red meat isn ' t going to kill you or shorten your lifespan if you do it in moderation .
