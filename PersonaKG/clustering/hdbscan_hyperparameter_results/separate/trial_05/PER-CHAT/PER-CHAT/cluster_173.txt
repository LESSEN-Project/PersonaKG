1. don ' t think that ' s the case . this mentions nothing about an injury here , just the marine ' s takedown and then how he was restrained . the robber was put in handcuffs , with no mention of needing medical attention .

2. of course i don ' t fucking think that . i ' m just trying to point out that the whole " he could ' ve just got an illegal gun on the black  market " argument is bullshit . if in the future there is a gang driven black  market for semi  autos in nz the gangs will need to be very careful about who they sell them too , and a some neck beard 4chan weirdo would almost certainly be told to fuck off .

3. i don ' t understand your point ? are you ok with having someone kick your ass for jaywalking ? if not then we can agree that vigilantism isn ' t permitted .

4. see now you are just trying to bait me into political arguments . i ' m not biting . i will not be commenting on comparisons to school shooters , real  world terrorism , etc . it is insensitive and unfair downplay the severity of these actions so much that you can compare them to a tv series . these are real lives being effected not just characters on a show .

5. doesn ' t the hypothetical intruder think that about you ? why should they be allowed to take your life ? will you not defend yourself ?
   (ID: 74058c90ada3aae7a59703064acbf3ced38f3681)

6. or , this will blow your fucking mind , the guy drove away in a panic because there was gasps a shooting ? also my point still stands about them assuming the hate crime , what if it was a muslim and they assumed it was isis ?

7. i agree . especially a punisher rear slide plate cover . unfortunately a prosecutor can turn anything around and convince the layperson of wrongdoing . from what you saw with the young guys . officer how many hours do you spend in the gym ? how many hours do you practice with your firearm ? so it is more important for you to be stronger to carry more ammo than to be proficient with your gun ?

8. in objective reality , herding children into groups of thirty and having them close their eyes while they pretend to psychically communicate with a deity , does not do anything at all to prevent gun violence . it doesn ' t really do anything at all , period . it ' s pure political posturing and religious exploitation of children . i completely agree with this .  also in objective reality , instituting reasonable , nuanced , and tested gun control policies is strongly associated with reduced firearm  based violence , homicide , and suicide . these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . this statement is technically true , but misleading . let me quote relevant part of scott alexander ' s essay   " gun violence " is the wrong category to use here .   suppose that you went to your doctor and said " i keep having headaches in my bed at night "   your doctor says " you should sleep on the couch .   you ask your doctor " and that will solve my problem of having headaches "   your doctor says " no , it will solve your problem of having headaches in your bed "   this is a bad solution , because although the problem was phrased as " i have headaches in my bed " , the real problem is just headaches . if we get rid of bed headaches at the cost of causing exactly the same number of couch headaches , that ' s completely useless .   " gun violence " is a category much like " bed headaches . some criminologists very reasonably propose a " substitution effect "  that is , if someone wants to commit murder , they ' ll use the most convenient weapon they can get your hands on . if that weapon gets banned , they will substitute the next most convenient weapon , and so on , rather than just deciding not to commit any more murders .   so suppose there were digit , digit gun deaths in the united states . the government bans guns , it is miraculously successful , and gun deaths go down to zero . sadly , by a total coincidence there are also digit , digit more knife deaths .   this would not be a good outcome , but if we ' re looking at " gun violence " , we could hail it as a victory  " gun control reduced gun violence levels to zero ! our plan has worked ! hooray "   so if we actually want to look at effectiveness of policies , we need to be measuring something else , like the total homicide rate . another wordy essay from scott alexander in which he spends a lot of time analyzing studies of gun control efficacy and comes to the conclusion that australia  style gun control , if implemented in the us , will probably , maybe , tentatively , reduce deaths somewhat . maybe .  these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . i am not a usa citizen and second amendment is not relevant to me , actually .  when you consider objective reality , there is no argument . there is no debate , except over the details of the gun control legislation that we ' re going to enact . if scott alexander didn ' t remember to consider objective reality , then his advice isn ' t worth consideration . frankly , scott alexander ' s analysis is much more nuanced than " there is no argument " claim . there clearly is an argument , and pretending otherwise is delusional . if you have specific rebuttals of points made in the essay , i want to read them . claiming someone does not consider objective reality does not constitute a proper argument , though .   x200b

9. ok , i get the point of this and i  m sure it would help clear this up with some people but , if you force a man to get pregnant and carry the baby wouldn  t it be going against their consent thus making you the rapist in this scenario ? i  m not trying to put down somebody  s experiences with this but that sounds really morally wrong . not that any of the other stuff happening isn  t . i  m not trying to say something against this i  m just arguing morals .

10. no there are plenty of checks in place . you know most serial killers never break any other laws and are otherwise normal people right ? every legal gun owner has to go through a background check .

11. still my point stands . shooting someone because they  re that desperate is wrong . you should never shoot someone unless you are physically in danger . somebody might be that desperate , just let it go just get your shit insured .

12. this is strong logic to me . even if a gun  toting robber invades my home at night , he ' s going to shoot at me as soon as he sees my gun . i don ' t need to bet on my gun skills beating his gun skills . i ' d rather just live , you know ? i ' ll take my chances on my night stick .

13. i mean sometimes if there ' s a car on fire on the road or there ' s been an accident then if someone uploads it to like their social media saying avoid the let ' s say m25 there ' s been an accident ? i mean going in and filming dead bodies and injured people isn ' t the greatest move but what if your just taking a video of something while passing by ?

14. i understand but it seemed that your question didn ' t make any sense . a cop will give you a ticket if you break the law even if what you ' re doing makes sense as is safer than following the law . a cop will give you a ticket if he doesn ' t know the law or is having a bad day . your question doesn ' t matter , hypothetically or not . you do the best you can and try not to break any laws . sorry if i became outraged because i really wanted to understand and answer the question and really thought that i had , and it frustrated me that i didn ' t .

15. oh riiiiiight . i forgot that we are in a time where black people getting shot for no good reason but needing help or being not white is hilarious .
   (ID: c28c39847d1ec88851aadf063f6e8baf4594b35c)

16. yea , you didnt answer the question . a drunk guy is held responsible for his actions if he is drunk and has sex with a drunk female . a drunk female cant give consent because shes not in her right mind but a drunk male is supposed to be in his right mind enough to know that the woman is too drunk to give consent . its a double standard that is ridiculous and you can down vote me all you want for it . but just answer the question , thats all i ask .

17. does that include someone shooting heroin ? correct , i would not report someone to the police for shooting heroin .  you wouldn  t report that person for their own well being ? sending them to prison is not good for their well being . so again , i would not report them .  what do you define as a victimless crime ? a legal offense to which all parties consent and no party is injured .  instead of getting all defensive like a little soyboy you could have answered my sincere question . um . okay ?
   (ID: 7c5209c3b827e0de0cd436466f80ce09b615606b)

18. i can understand why you ' re uncomfortable but i think the term rape gets thrown around too much sometimes and this is one of the times . would this have been such an issue of he didn ' t cum in you this time and just did what he normally would do ? i think the issue is more of him just not being careful about pregnancy not about the sex itself right ?
