2. two or three times a month i dream about very dirty public restrooms , or stalls with no doors , or toilets up on pedestals . these are extremely vivid and realistic dreams and i remember several details about most of them . i didn  t know how common it was until my dad said he had the same dream , so i did a google search and it turns out it  s fairly common . something about being insecure and vulnerable .

4. tough to say for sure . could be bi , or just genuinely curious . also sounds like you ' ve got some underlying fluidity to your gender identity or expression that warrants some exploration . you ' re asking questions only you can really answer purple  heart

5. it sounds pretty conflicted to me , it felt wrong to discuss your feminine side but equally you hated some masculine traits . right now that doesnt make you either or and thats okay if you can put your hatred for your male traits in context to feeling more feminine then potentially it might be some dysphoria , then again you might hate big feet because you can never buy the right shoes . i think you have some more self exploring to do , to see whether you are really comfortable with the idea of being feminine  female , when you do you will notice any big red giant flags saying " wrong " or maybe like me you will not .

6. that sounds like it could be a feminization kink . if these fantasies are just about the bedroom then it sounds like you just have a kink . but for some people they find out they want to live full time as a woman through fetish crossdressing . i guess what i ' m saying is  it ' s totally possible you have a feminization fetish but it ' s also possible you could have other factors that lean you more towards being trans . being trans is more about the day to day life and how you and the world around you perceives you .
