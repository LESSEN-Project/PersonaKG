SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:

Total from this dataset: 5

1. is there anything i could do or say to her that would make it easier without it being too weird . we have only gone out once and i feel like asking her how she feels about me leaving would be too soon right now . like i should try and take her out again and see how it goes ?

2. in that case , greet her and chat up . you can assess the friends interest in the same time . why do i feel like a wolf ? i don ' t know . it ' s probably because i read something about this in the game .

3. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted

4. if you like her go for it , forget what other people think and spend time with her . if you ' re interested show it ! respond to the winks with a smile , funny face , another wink or whatever you feel like , respond to her messages etc . if you dive into the situation you ' ll be able to find out what ' s going on . also don ' t get friends involved , even if she has . it ' s generally a disaster waiting to happen .

5. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .
