2. not a great living but definitely a lot better . you do realize that mose of europe believes in a livable wage , not a minimum at least in the uk i know they do . i believe you are the one with a skewed perception . you grow up hearing " america number digit " so much that you believe it . since you like to throw your own heat , allow me to retort . from your post history i ' d assume you lack a level of empathy considering you told one person they are in america because nobody else would hire them , and your first comment ever is able not being able to love your own child because it ' s disabled . if you want to continue to sling mud at my heritage and mentality go ahead . i ' m not the one who got offended about a simple joke .
