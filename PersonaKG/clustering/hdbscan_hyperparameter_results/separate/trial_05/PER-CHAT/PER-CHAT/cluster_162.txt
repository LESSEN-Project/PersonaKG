3. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .

4. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

5. may i ask what exactly do you believe in so i can procces how different it is from my speculations or any other of religious people . what exactly do you believe or care to believe as an agnostic atheist ?

6. funny how you haven ' t actually been able to make a logical counter argument . you ' re just saying " you ' re wrong " without the logical backing that i have . then the " boo hoo whatever dude ! you ' re , uh , just like , uh , a flat earther dude " really , i am ? i ' m literally just like a flat earther ? that is your brilliant counter argument ? that saying it is wrong to promote a lie is exactly as bad as lying ? that is what you ' re telling me ? do you . do you realize how incredibly stupid you just made yourself look ? you just made yourself look like a clown .

7. One of my favorite things is posts  metaphysical pseudo science.
   (ID: 6ea82786a74ccdc85dc1fddd809a575aa4e4efcf)

8. i ' m a christian . i believe that jesus preached for us to do things like love , be compassionate , generous , and honest . as such  i believe in evolution and human  caused climate change , because the proof is overwhelming . i believe that being gay is neither evil , nor a choice . god created gay people , just as he created me . he loves them , too . i refuse to believe that god would be so cruel , as to set gay people up for failure . i believe that money and religion cannot mix . either you serve god , or you serve your greed for money . not both . there is no such thing as a racist christian . there are plenty of racists , though , who call themselves christian . if you truly love christ , you love your fellow human , no matter the ethnicity . i sincerely wish that the many cinos christian in name only in the world would recognize their own hypocrisy , and denounce dogma , when it clearly causes suffering , inflames hatred , or requires hefty lying to oneself .

9. i agree that hubris is one of our species ' flaws . i myself am a religious christian , and i while i do think we are special compared to animals , i believe in scientific proof , before dogma . accordingly , i believe in evolution and climate change , too . there is all the evidence in the world , that gays are normal , and not to be hated . the church says many things i disagree with , so i choose only to follow the stuff that lifts us as human creatures . you know what i mean , right ? don ' t steal . don ' t hump anyone else ' s wife , or your sister . do help people out whenever you can . be honest . be fair . call out liars . etc . basically , if it improves the quality of life , i ' m in . if it tells me to harm someone   like , " let ' s go hate gays ! "   i ' m out .

10. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

11. I am athiest.
   (ID: b5e15026c378d181e66e2b38bfc245705510a727)

12. ' god ' already has a meaning . do you want me to start calling keyboards ' christmas ' and my car ' the virgin mary ' ? you ' re not saying anything with any meaning whatsoever . the scientific method isn ' t about ' fitting in ' baseless preconceptions . i ' m sorry if you ' ve heard my response before ? i ' m not sure what you mean by it being a ' standard ' response . it ' s how i think , not how i was told to think .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

13. i have no beliefs at all . i deal with facts and reason .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

14. you describe parts of a thing called scientific method , and do it rather well may i add . by earlier description it may have occurred to some flat  earthers that they are wrong . i often watch odd youtubes and such about things like that  it doesn ' t mean i believe in them , it just means i find them entertaining
   (ID: e57ef54aa6b4e23fcfbf5b034403be21a86f9700)

15. . let people do what they want to do unless they are not really harming others . i do not think most of the christians spread hate against the other people . what do you gain if you deny god ?
