1. if you ' re good at it or have an interest . i found a job where i laugh every day and love what i do . could have made a lot more elsewhere but that is my measure for success .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

2. any profession he wants . he should do what makes him happy . whether it ' s the money that makes him happy or the work itself it will just make everything easier .

3. aussie here , so what i ' m about to say may not apply in the us , but going around to talk to sparkies face to face is worth digit resumes you send out . do the leg work .

4. telemarketer . if they can sell well , it would be pretty simple to have a low level secretary scan the approved calls and type out the critical information . consulting , if they have extensive previous experience in a field , reviewing projects can be quite valuable . public speaking . people will hire him to talk about how he overcame is hardship even though he only overcame it because people are willing to pay to see him talk about overcoming it . kind of a self fulfilling prophecy all for the entertainment of others by capitalizing on his disability . basically a modern day freak show with better pay , to put it in less politically correct terms i am sure there are other jobs that can be handled depending on exactly his level of disability . does he have any slight motion in extremities ? has he learned any systems for people with his disability like eye tracking or other controls like head or breathing based or speech based computer controls ?

5. in toronto theres a company called fix it females that higher mostly women but they want ppl who are ' ' experienced ' ' even though a lot of them aren ' t , but apply anyway say you have painting experience . best way honestly is to be a helpelabor at sites , sweeping , passing tools , moving what you can etc . and you gain experience through that . tbh like digit  of construction crews your ganna experience peverted guys cause most of them are rough around the edges high school drop out type guys so you gotta find the right crew

6. you ' re probably better off talking to a career counselor , or going to a job centre for this kind of thing . you can also check out the book , " what color is your parachute " , for general career advice .
   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

7. apprenticeships ! you can work and get a degree at the same time . you do it with a company , you get a reduced salary , but it means you don ' t have to pay anything , and you get experience in the workplace . you do come out of it with a degree in whatever field your apprenticeship was in
   (ID: c1af2a10f968ba6f52d825dbf8fc9b8210db72ba)

8. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .

9. fuckin hell i guess . cheers to you for your choice of careers , you are a champ .

10. i just want to work on developing strategies that make money . focusing on development and especially ai and ml . it seems like the closest thing to a well paid " problem solver " , plus the feeling that i could " create " money for myself was something i ' ve never felt before and feel regardless of what happens in life , as long as there are markets , you could be somewhat self sufficient . not sure what role that would be called though , they seem to go under many names or none at all . i just want to prepare myself to " get in " to any position to start .

11. glad i can help ! exactly what i thought when i decided to go in accounting . yes , there was a lot of work that i needed to do when changing career paths , but i am must happier and love what i do .

12. it would be helpful to know what kind of job it is and what you would be doing . also , what went on in the past when you did a similar job that you burned out ?
   (ID: 1ebb4643f7e1e4d41ee2503d9b5d94ed0224c96b)

14. i worked like this for a while digit years or so , and liked it . bosses understood we had to have breaks every now and then and we did when we wanted to . i do not think it ' s too bad , each brick  thing moved being less than digit kg and you can do the work how you like , it was more freedom than in most of my it work most bosses didn ' t know what they were talking about . so basically , i didn ' t see negatives  you got   from bosses for doing " hard work and not complaining " is good in any later work you like  apply . if you don ' t get decent wages then that ' s a different issue altogether .
   (ID: e57ef54aa6b4e23fcfbf5b034403be21a86f9700)

15. that ' s what it was like for me , maybe the business was dodgy , maybe not though because my other friends who worked in other businesses experienced the same thing . maybe i was unlucky ? but it can affect people in big business .
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

16. support for people with intellectual  learning disabilities and asd . pay is good spend my days , going to cinemas , swimming sessions , arts and crafts classes , etc . i feel completely out of the rat race my job is literally to help people get the most out of their day . you don ' t even need any specific qualifications either you just need to be a nice person .
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

17. i want to be tabe when i grow up
   (ID: 6212c082850f067a67618ad2a3b9f8ed336590f4)

18. just apply , you don ' t need any experience . you apply , they call you in , you take a test , if you pass they do an interview .
