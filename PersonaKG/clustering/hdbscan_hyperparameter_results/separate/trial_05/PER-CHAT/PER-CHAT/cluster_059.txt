1. i had a similar face with lsd , where i just wanted to trip at every occasion . because i never had a single bad experience , only beneficial ones . thsi phase ended after digit or digit months , my mind needed a break and i didn ' t want to trip even when there was a great opportunity . for me the craving for acid feelt different than to any other drug , it wasn ' t like wanting to recreationaly better my mood like with any other drug . it feelt more like having discovered something new , where you can ' t wait for your next time doing it . it feelt like when i got a new video game for christmas as a kid and after an hour , when my parents made me go to bed , i couldn ' t wait to explore it more the next day . but after some time this always stoped , only to be rediscovered years later . the same feeling was attached to lsd after my first spiritual experience . and the same way it got more and more unexciting until i stopped using for a year or so . and this wasn ' t hard to do , it just felt right to stop now . when the spirit of adventure came back i started tripping again . even if lsd helped me a lot to learn about myself like nothing else could even come close . thinking about my usage in honesty is only possible during times of abstinence . your post sounded similar to my concern at times of frequent use and your concerns are important and nothing you should be avoiding , especially when using strong psychedelics . i could understand my frequent lsd use after it ' s ending and also be ok with having those phases because i never feelt my frequent use was damaging . i would even say such phases are welcomed by myself , when they feel right again . do not rely on what i wrote . this surely isn ' t the only reason for somebody using lsd so often . if you think your desire exists because lsd lets you be happy when you feel depressed , confident when you are shy or just lets you be the person you want to be , but aren ' t capable of otherweise . thats how damaging and addictive behaviors start . lsd may not be addictive in the ways other drugs are , but it surely will make you dependent , if used to escape your sober self . i can ' t tell you what ' s best for you , just go with what feels right for you . just be sure to honestly think about your consumption . when you understand your behavior better , it comes easier to stop or continue . since lsd does not have a physically addictive side , the reason for an addiction arises from your mind . stopping or continuing depends on the reason why you are consuming in the first place . but if you are in doubt , its better to take a break . you probably wouldn ' t have asked here if there isn ' t something worrying you about your usage . i can only tell you that i personally say that frequent lsd use , is one of the least damaging drugs , if not pushed beyond what feels good . just take some time to really organize your thoughts , minds and goals . be honest , follow what feels right for you . lsd is exhausting for your mind , some time to think may offer you what you hadn ' t capacity and time to find out during the time of constant tripping .

3. compulsions we love have a way of becoming obsessions we hate . you ' re impulsive , have better things to do , and are probably just very very young and not getting out enough . date people , go to social functions , go to the gym , do actual drugs like normal people .
