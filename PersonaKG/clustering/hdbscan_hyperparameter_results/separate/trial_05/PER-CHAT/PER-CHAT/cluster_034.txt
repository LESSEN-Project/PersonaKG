1. maybe i am just bad at using them but my experience has been they don ' t help a lot with deer while bow hunting . if you can ' t get close with out one they are not a silver bullet for fixing bad sneaking , add to that they get caught on everything until you get used to moving in them and they get warm . that being said they are uncomfortably good for hiding from people . we had a rather large fellow bring his double xl curvy lady out to the woods for some public private time . they started getting undressed about digit feet from where my buddy and i where sitting in on a hill . they freaked out when we got up to walk away because , neither of us wanted to watch what was about to go down .

2. i think that ' s a really great approach , and it also highlights another thing . a lot of responses here have suggested i ' m a spoilsport for saying that prepping isn ' t just about guns and ammo . and that ' s fair enough , i guess i literally blog about ' sensible survivalism ' , that ' s kind of boring in a sense , but i ' m definitely not suggesting that prepping can ' t be enjoyable and enriching even if it ' s not about the guns primarily . you ' ve highlighted that with your examples of learning new skills and experimenting with cool science . it ' s definitely preparedness because you know how to make useful things out of your surroundings  but it ' s also just as enjoyable for you as going to the gun range is for many people , because you ' re getting to try new things you enjoy whilst bettering your own abilities . so yeah , i really like that you find enjoyment in different aspects of prepping ! thanks for the comment , man .

3. i can see flak jacket and camouflage being crutch picks a crutch is a choice that is not the most efficient one , but makes things easier for the user . something is a crutch when there ' s a more powerful , harder  to  use solution  think low risk low reward versus high risk high reward . " crutch " is not a synonym for " overpowered . camouflage is not a crutch as there is no other option concerning hiding within spot flares besides smoke , and those defeat the purpose of hiding . flak  juggernaut is not a crutch because the only other way to reduce explosive damage on the fly going prone is stack  able with said specs . my advice is to get better at locating enemies without the use of flares and minimap . even a walking enemy makes a fuckton of noise in this game , as does the sound of somebody spawning . the moment that hidden enemy gets an ally is the moment where you can easily figure out where the enemy is hiding  the new spawn is almost guaranteed to start running away from their ally .

4. having ts on in the back ground shouldn ' t affect the way you play . if it ' s too much trouble , then perhaps a different alliance  corp would be better for you ? fly safe .

5. some of that stuff looks great but i ' m not sure it ' s all going to fit in a 30l rucksack like the one you ' ve linked . you ' ve got at least 60l of items by my estimation , and it will be very heavy to carry once you include water bottles .
