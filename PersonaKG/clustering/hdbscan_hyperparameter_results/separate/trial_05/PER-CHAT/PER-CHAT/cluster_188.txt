1. maybe when it goes on sale . it will be like every other new game i buy , play for a month and then come crawling back to gta like a lost puppy . are you going to jump on rdr2 ?

2. my first game was probably wii sports , as i didn  t get a wii until digit when i was a bit older . and when it comes to flash games , there  s no telling .

3. overwatch . the game currently has too many ways to stop a player from playing  stunlock and all that . took a while for me to realize what it was about the game that was making me so angry , but i haven ' t been back since . sometimes i kinda miss it and want to go back , but then i see a play of the game or highlight that involves so much stunlock it hurts , and i decide not to .

5. give us some quotes from an obscure video game that you think you ' re the only one on the internet that knows about it , and we have to guess what the game is

6. that was a brilliant game . i remember playing that when it came out  2000ish ?  and thinking that video game graphics couldn ' t possibly get any better . still think that gp4 is the best f1 game ever made apart from possibly grand prix legends .
   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

7. i ' ve still never seen a physical release of any shantae game . are they specific to certain regions ?
   (ID: 2ac4d2cea574e655d7fdb1ab9b4886989929ca96)

8. darksouls was the most challenging game i ' ve played in past decade , and imo is one of the best games ever made , so hyped they might remaster it next year . as an emotional wreck of a human being and welding a heart so deep one could say it ' s . the dark , the game and stories of the npcs really hit me hard .
   (ID: 95c90f0b7430996843a42a4f365667a13e4c2eb5)

9. my mom says ,  it  s because you  re on that game all the time .  while that  s partially a factor , i  m on the game so i don  t go into mental breakdowns every night

11. i nominate bird box as tribute . never has something that  s been so shoved down my throat  oh my gosh youd love it !   scariest movie ever !  disapointed me so hard . how did they get so many a  b listers on this mediocre film ? the dialogue was meh , they never showed the monsters which , you can do that . if your suspense is really good which this wasn  t . and that ass pull character growth where it took this woman five years to love these kids through flashbacks was lazy writing ! . but maybe i  m just jealous , cuz netflix hasn  t touched my psychological thrillers .

12. solid picks . erased is ridiculously good , time travel isn  t a done enough genre if you ask me . attack on titan , baccano , durarara , and cowboy bebop are some of my other favs .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

13. i ' d have to say ori and the blind forest . it ' s such a beautiful game with such a beautiful soundtrack . the story is told with few words and more visual story telling . that game never fails to make me shed a few tears , even on the 5th playthrough . it ' s not playing a platformer , its living the trials of ori and it just submerges you so well that i ' d have to say it ' s my all time favorite game .
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

14. i don ' t see a superman game being challenging enough considering how over powered he is . i would go with beyond game .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

18. maximum carnage  this is no different , as i play this game every single week . it ' s my favorite game on the console . it ' s usually at least a once a week game for me , or as a filler or pickup game if i have some time to kill after work or before supper .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)
