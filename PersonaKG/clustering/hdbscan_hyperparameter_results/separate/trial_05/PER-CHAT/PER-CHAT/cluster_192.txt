1. hmm . good point . my argument seemed to be a bit flawed . i guess it  s just down to the amount people use and nothing else . or is it . i guess imma have to come back to this topic at a later date and think about it a bit more

2. lol , you can wander around with in the sanctioned playpen of ordinary consciousness , and we have some intoxicants over here if you wanna mess your self up we  ve got some scotch here and some tobacco and red meat and some sugar and a little t . v . and so forth and so on . but , these boundary dissolving hallucinogens that give you a sense of unity with your fellow man and nature are somehow forbidden . this is an outrage ! it  s a sign of cultural immaturity and the fact that we tolerate it is a sign that we are living in a society as oppressed as any society in the past .

3. i said it affects everyone differently multiple times . which means  some people can have negative effects and some people don ' t . what else is there to say about it ? i told you that your peers at college will be suggesting this to you because they don ' t experience these things . a lot more people who use weed have positive experiences than those who suffer while using it . plain and simple . it ' s also a drug that needs much more testing to understand it . if you want to talk to your friends about it in school you ' re going to either need to simply decline or educate them on current studies about the drug . they aren ' t going to just stop using weed as a remedy because you said it makes your dad ' s delusions get worse . people without any severe mental disorders aren ' t going to care quite frankly . i ' m not trying to be mean at all but i know stoners and i know young people . you ' re not going to have luck if you are looking for people to acknowledge something they like to do for fun is not good for them . you are perfectly entitled to not use thc regularly and disapprove of it as a form of medicine , but other people are entitled to use it and approve of it despite its negative effects on some people .

4. . so you ' re saying it would become too popular ? honestly , me , i don ' t care . about it being legal or not . i ' m going to get stoned either way . and if it was legal , and everyone did it . shit . that would be awesome . imagine the scene , you walk into your local grocery store and everyone is slowly pushing the carts piled with microwaveable tv dinners , snack foods , and pineapple i say that because it ' s the best damn stoner food around . each passing glance to a stranger , you are greeted by half massed , red eyes with that stupid stoner grin . you know that they know , and they know that you know . everyone will be blitzed all the time .

5. i ' m fresh out of high school , and i hated when people would do this . or brag about how they only smoke the ' good ' weed . granted i know there is a difference between mid grade weed and high grade , just shut the fuck up and smoke it . it ' s pot , it ' s going to get you high regardless . why do people feel the need to brag about such things ? shouldn ' t weed unite us ?

6. why does what you do in your free time have any bearing on what you do at work ? in your mind , is it impossible for someone who likes to get high to refrain from doing so at work ? if you drink beer or alcohol , how is that any different ? should having a beer at home disqualify you from driving a forklift at work the next day ? these are genuine questions .

7. i mean even the most ardent marijuana supporters must concede it makes people less active and lazy . what are you talking about ? sure , some pot smokers are lazy , but are they lazy because they smoke pot or do they smoke pot because they ' re lazy ? there ' s a lot of really lazy unmotivated people that don ' t use any drugs at all . how would you explain that ? maybe we could just blame video games or something else in that case ? some people are just lazy . you do know people of all professions smoke pot , right ? i ' ve smoked pot since i was digit . got a pilot ' s license , college degree , and have run my own business for the past digit years . just about all of my friends smoke weed and they have all been employed for decades doing just fine . they have spouses , are great parents , own nice homes , etc . you know what makes people less active and lazy ? being hung over . i ' d much rather my employees smoke weed at the end of the day to wind down and get to work the next morning well rested . you ' ve bought into the narrative that has been preached to you since birth . this , coming from a dare graduate lol .

8. oh boy lol . i don ' t fly anymore , but no i wouldn ' t ever fly under the influence of anything , even cough medicine . it would be very irresponsible for people to fly while stoned or under the influence of any substance . the reasoning is pretty obvious . you misunderstood my statement about employees . of course they should be working sober . what they do in their personal time is really none of my business although i mostly employ writers who work from home so i don ' t really care as long as their work is to my liking . my point was , if they are going to use a mind altering substance after work , i ' d rather they just smoke weed instead of drink . weed doesn ' t cause hangovers during work hours . i ' m not advocating people get stoned or drunk during working hours . you are just buying into the narrative , that ' s my point . you have these stereotypes about pot smokers that just aren ' t true , but you are still perpetuating them with zero basis in fact . there are plenty of motivated and successful people who smoke pot during their personal time .

9. who the hell started the idea that making cigarettes more expensive would get people to quit ? that ' s not how addiction works .
