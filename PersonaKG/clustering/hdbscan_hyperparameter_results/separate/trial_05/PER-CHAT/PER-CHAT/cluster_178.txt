1. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .

2. well , you didn ' t add a " serious " tag , but i ' ll give you a serious answer anyway . i ' ve done a fair amount of research on this . all adults   the ones with the money   hate school fundraisers . the idea that gives you the absolutely best return is this  you send a note home at the beginning of the year explaining that you know everyone hates school fundraisers , and you are therefore going to dispense with that nonsense and instead request " direct giving " include an envelope . ask parents to donate the amount of money they would otherwise be wasting on wrapping paper , cookie dough , and other crap they only buy to placate their children . you will end up with substantially more money than if you actually sold the wrapping paper or cookie dough . if you ' re dead set on holding a fundraiser , try the " original art " one . find a company that prints original art on random things mousepads , t  shirts , coffee mugs and does school fundraisers . they will provide your school with all the materials . each kid draws a picture and then goes around to family  friends and tries to get them to buy a mousepad  t  shirt  coffee cup featuring their original art . it ' s still a terrible idea , but at least you get something your kid made instead of some awful cookie dough .

4. i know you ' re going to get downvoted and are using hyperbole , but that may not be bad for them . not a " forced labor " kind of thing , but something designed to show them the value of work . maybe they could help build a park or something like that .

6. maybe a local charity would help the most . for example , you could set up a charity to pay for girls to go to college who couldn ' t afford it . it could inspire others to do the same in their towns .

7. that ' s a great retirement plan , do charity work for kids , make things with your hands and smoke weed . if i could be so lucky when i ' m their age .
