1. well they ' re not . it ' s not like they kill or anything . terrorists and mental health issues kill , and i guarantee that any mass shooting would have the same number of fatalities , if not more , if it was carried out with a knife . gotta protect our guns above all else ! serious question  on this sub , surely we assume everything ends with  s by default right ?

2. really , i have to thank you for the exchange we ' ve had . i intend to share it with as many people as i can . my friends all over the internet , my peers at work , and all the folks i have contact with on social media . i plan to share it with strangers at every opportunity . and you know what , those folks will share it with their friends and acquaintances . it will go far and wide . on and on . all over the country . look back at the lengths you ' ve stretched to bend reality because of your obsession with guns . the facts you ' ve attempted to dismiss because they don ' t square in a gun nuts head . the reality that americans kill eachother with guns more than any other developed nation . that america leads the world in mass shootings . keep hunting your hogs as the world looks back at you with disgust and pity . i should feel sorry for you but i don ' t . i have common sense and you do not . this is the last time i ' ll be responding to the nonsense you post . just know that you ' ve provided me with enough evidence to convince all those that have yet to be subjected to the garbage you and your ilk spew to reject it on a logical and factual basis . sleep on that . like i said earlier . thank you . your posts are nonsensical and increasingly bizarre . you have confirmed to me and to all that i intend to share this exchange with lol , which is a hell of a lot that gun nuts are real and are preposterous . so in love with the ability to create death that the essence of living is total lost to them . thank you . you have gone beyond proving any point i wished to make . once more . the gun control lobby have nothing to fear from you and will soon see their advocacy pay dividends because of crusading sophists like you leading the charge .

4. good god , stop watching red dawn . as much as you gun nuts want this dystopian fantasy to happen , it newer will . keep masturbating about how you intend to march on washington as the rest of the world looks back at you with pity and disgust . when the biggest worry in your life is finding the best parking spot at work then shut the fuck up . you are not oppressed . there are folks around the world with real reasons to pick up arms , you do not . as you read my post from your ipad or smart phone , look in the mirror and attempt to convince yourself otherwise . you can ' t . i live in the real world with real worries . no fucking hypotheticals . wife and kids , shitty job , bills , ailing parents and asshole coworkers . where the fuck do you people find the time to worry about the fucking apocalypse ? an apocalypse that will never happen . jesus .

5. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
