1. i think you should just look over joseki that you encountered in your games . if you feel like you got a disadvantageous sequence in a corner , go look up josekipedia , and see what you could have done better . that ' s all . if you play something often , you can also check wether it is joseki . who knows ? maybe you got used to play a slightly sub  optimal sequence . i heard someone that the path to progress goes  learn joseki   understand them   forget them , the last step being the most important .

2. im waiting for kunimitsu and negan , and i know several pros and cons . pros are you know the most of the match up , move , what safe and what can be punish . cons are sometimes you do wrong input for example yoshi ender i always use with f3  digit but some times i mix that with miguel button input . also , having your brain expand the size of the entire roster , sometimes i found myself think of all the move i use when i fight those character , for example like if i fight yoshi , i would expect my opponent to only use what i also used but nope he use other tech so i find it difficult sometimes . sometime you you underestimate your opponent because you know most of the match up , and other than that , you can mix some move into other character for example yoshi didn ' t have savage but you think he has cause you play most of the roster . in short it can confuse you .

4. no , in normal  raids you have a lot more personal responsibility . you can ' t just afk through the fights . it is a helluva lot more fun than lfr . you should try playing each of those specs through lfr a few times . get a feel for how you ' d perform in a large group setting . lfr might not be " real " raiding but it ' s close enough to give you an idea . tanaan , lfr and mythic dungeons can get you into normal raids easily , then from there you ' ll go to heroic and mythic raids , ofc . race only matters if you ' re going for extreme feats like world first . play what you want to stare at for hours on end .
