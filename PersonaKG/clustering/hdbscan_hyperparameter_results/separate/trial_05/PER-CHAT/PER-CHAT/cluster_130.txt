1. even the new tim comes as a gift . and no one claimed that this is more than a slight refresh . nobody has the reason to complain , especially when the new parts are going at the old prices .

2. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets

3. wow a company going a safer route to make money . look man the thing they did with star wars was scummy , and how they fucked over respawn and vis . but at this point the memes have become stale now and we ' re betting a dead horse .

4. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

5. the 3gb streaming stuff and hdtv channels are more like upscaled dvd but thats marketing for you . the average viewer just see ' s a clearer picture and is happy their not bothered about digit . digit hd audio and amazing pic bluray can produce . ive even heard people say some blurays are crap because of the film grain . im sure physical media will be around for along time to come because film makers are still going to want people to have the option to see their movies in the best possible way . as for the next generation , if my 7yo son watches a streaming movie and enjoys it the first thing he will ask is " can we get this on bluray " so there is hope
