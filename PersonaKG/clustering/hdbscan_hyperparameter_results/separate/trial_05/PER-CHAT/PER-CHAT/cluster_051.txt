SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 5

1. due to a motorcycle accident , i have a huge scar across my head i was wearing a helmet . i was really self conscious about it and it stopped me from interacting with others . you have to just say fuck it and put yourself out there and let the person you ' re interested in make their decision . don ' t try to cover it up and just let the world see it . there is no way you will be concerned with it digit  of the day every day and pretty soon you will come home and realize you didn ' t even think about it all day . that will be the end of it .

3. i don ' t think this is lying . i think this is something personal to you that you didn ' t feel like sharing , and that is ok because it is no one else ' s business . if you wish to tell them in the future you can say you didn ' t want to tell them before . but you don ' t need to explain yourself , like i said it ' s your business . not a lie .

4. i don ' t think you should feel embarrassed . as far as i understand , you didn ' t really have a choice back then and your friend will probably understand this . i think he ' ll mainly be glad you ' re doing fine now .

5. stories might be believable if you just didn  t say  and everyone clapped  then you have a potentially believable story .
