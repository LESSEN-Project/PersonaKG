6. i can answer this despite being an english speaker . it ' s because you haven ' t been taught that cuss words in other languages are just as bad . we never snuck around our parents to say " mierda " , unless of course you ' re spanish , so yeah . it ' s just that it wasn ' t drilled into your head like it is with your own version of the word . like americans using bollocks

7. love saying  yeet . mostly cause you can just emphasize different parts of the word , plus i ' m just a loud boy  o so it does me good . hate  the word ' hate ' in all honesty . too hurtful of a word , i just say strongly dislike or was mediocre . hate is such a strong word towards some things people just dislike .
