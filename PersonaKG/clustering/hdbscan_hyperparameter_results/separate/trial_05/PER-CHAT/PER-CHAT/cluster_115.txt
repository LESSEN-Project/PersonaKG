1. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?

2. so this is a  premium  snap you would have to pay for ? i still don  t understand why anyone would pay for that .

3. it really makes customer support queries much faster . i find it way more useful than some of the banking apps i use , because all the text and information is automatically saved . you don  t have to go back and forth with different systems and phone numbers and juggle all the information as it  s all there .

4. i saw tons of things from reddit that were stolen and put on to other sites and i heard a lot of people talk about it , so i downloaded and fell in love with the app . i ' m probably most active on teenagers

5. One of my favorite things is privacy.

6. ok that  s actually pretty great the , means they  re integrating more and more sources . i hope they will enable linking up of various national transports to make cross border trips much easier too . maybe they feel they  ve already covered the majority of the terrain they needed to ? i  d say there  s also the issue with some transit providers simply not having any api integration . on another note , have you seen anyone take advantage of the maps extensions much yet ? i know uber was there and then they removed themselves and opentable can book tables with yelp having some integration too .

7. offers the option to share music through facebook messenger i admit i don ' t know the full story behind the apps , i read the article though . i suppose i could have been more specific . i have no clue why these apps would need read access , writing is fine , that makes sense its a one way street . read and write access though ? why ?

8. but what about rebuilding the world ? why do you think they introduced so many new communities ? " your world is about to get a whole lot bigger "

9. i like how it shows me what i want to see . i follow subreddits and most of the time that is all i see stuff from no weird or annoying crap also political discussions on reddit are better it seems .

10. could not agree more ! both yelp and tripadvisor are driving me nuts with this photos and reviews thing . maybe apple can implement a system where it controls and presents its own photos  reviews whereby third parties then fill in for missing data and countries not served ? i suspect these things will come in time , including the ones you mentioned , though apple  s methodically iterative approach sometimes does take more than a while .

11. personally , i have had nothing but problems with streamlabs obs . i prefer obs . i still use streamlabs browser for the addons they offer , but slobs looks terrible in my opinion . sorry i dont have an actual answer though .

12. it ' s a fun little demo to show people your watch , but i don ' t think it will improve the way you play at all . the ui is a little confusing , and the data updates a too slow for my liking . the only other thing you can do besides find portals is normal hack them , which can help you get gear easily , but is useless in the long run .

13. i ' m about to buy one  want to know if you found anything really fun to do with it ?
   (ID: 80d504f68f5028edc4d8e5926e3a2a93b0c84d8f)

14. i have both insta is better for friends , but i like reddit more because i learn more here
   (ID: 87173aaf55980a77c94bd30c851c39fb0b52ff2e)

15. make it easier to do things without an address or phone number .
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

16. nice list though duplicating some of the requests earlier to the normal maps app . i  m sure if they bring them then they  ll bring it to both this one and the maps app . on another note , i recently submitted most of this feedback to not just the apple feedback site , but also to eddy cue as he  s the svp of maps among many other things . you might wanna do so too so it likely gets better prioritized as imho few from the teams read our postings here .

17. don ' t feel like i can be entirely myself with a product that is designed to keep you hooked and online . plus the fact that you ' re being seriously tracked by the evil zuckerberg . facebook is one of the most unethical companies out there , why would i trust them ? i deleted whatsapp too because of him .
   (ID: 5bb6e2d4db1d5ccf3a1f430564735551dfb4c28b)

18. i just don ' t understand why anyone would want that instead of physical keys
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

19. yeah , true . there are so many worse companies . just the first thing i thought of . it ' s great for talking to my friends and family all over the world as well as promoting myself , but i hate to see how people are addicted to it and over use it as well as whatever privacy stuff they violate .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

20. is it weird that i have no idea what spotify is ? i mean i know it ' s a music thing but that ' s it . i don ' t know what it actually does . is it a social networking thing or do you just buy stuff from it ?
