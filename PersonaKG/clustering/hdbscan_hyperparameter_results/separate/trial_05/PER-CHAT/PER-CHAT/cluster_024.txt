2. i can honestly say , what i only encountered very nice folks , while exploring the wasteland ! did couple of very fair trades and after each one , i also was dropping a little  gift  like food , drinks , ammo i don  t need etc . for the person , and always had some gifts in return ! it  s amazing and i  m pleasantly surprised , how friendly people are !

3. no problem . hopefully there are more like you in the world . fair play to you for wanting to brighten up a strangers day . another thing would be leaving post  its on mirrors in public toilets telling the next person how great they look  have a lovely smile  fabulous hair . or if you are out to dinner and it ' s really good , specifically ask to see the chef and give them a tip . i don ' t think they get them very often .
