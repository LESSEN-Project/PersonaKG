3. i have had very similar experiences with edgepark though i never ended up ordering from them . just the short list   i only mentioned interest in the omnipod . digit weeks later , received approval letter from my insurance . they had requested rx from a doctor my pcp , not endo without my consent .  misquoted my benefit level to the point of not believing my insurance company about how to code the rx  tried to tell me that they don ' t like to fill the omnipod rx without also filling dexcom  when i cancelled the order after both me and my insurance company yelling at them , the order magically appeared again digit weeks later . went to byram , no issues , very pleased .

4. last time around it took digit minutes . but this is an outlier  usually you need to book your appointment first thing in the morning to be seen at some point in the day . i think it  s worth mentioning that we have private healthcare too . so if you have the cash or good insurance you don  t ever have to wait . london , uk .
