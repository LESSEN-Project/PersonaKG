1. sure it ' s avoidable . kids can be very reasonable if you know what you ' re doing and address the problem correctly . let ' s say your young child does something wrong , and you spank them . do you think they really understand what they did wrong  why it was wrong , or are they suddenly behaving because they ' re afraid of being spanked again ? fear based discipline like that can often create kids that are better at hiding their bad behavior around authority .

2. every reply you make to one of my comments , you just keep getting more and more unintelligible . i think you should be less focused on this kid ' s schooling and more on your own .

3. when you ' re learning to swim , do you jump into the deep end or do you work your way down ? well it all depends on your parents mood at the moment .

4. by god its a little baby . what country sends babies to school ? i ' m not judging per say , if that ' s what your country does that ' s fine . it just seems odd from where i ' m sitting . then again my kids came to work with me from the age of digit to digit when they started school . you probably think that is weird .

6. i ' m not sure how much it has to do with the time and how much it has to do with who your parents are . kids around me were doing plenty , i just had an overly controlling parental situation .
