1. seriously . this is nuts . the article says that prosecutors will seek the maximum penalty for the guy involved . how can they look themselves in the mirror and believe this is the right thing to do ? it is barbaric . sure , he is clearly no angel . but that doesn ' t make this anything other than a travesty of justice .

2. what i ' m wondering is how is taker able to move that well only digit months after a full hip replacement ? wtf my grandpa hada fullhip replacement and the surgeons told him not to do high intensity and  or jump at all . and then this man is here giving people old schools and jumping clotheslines .

3. at first i was thinking why would you put him in that situation , that can ' t be safe . after watching his reaction i ' m think what a judgemental prick i am . that was awesome to watch .

4. i think it is folly to claim religion or faith are at issue here . you think that without religion this person would not have done this ? the issue is humans are animals and they do some nasty shit . i watched someone set digit people on fire the other day , watched the police shoot a guy in the back and watch him bleed out , watched kids killing insects with glee while their parents watch on , seen soldiers throw puppies off cliff along with many other acts with degrees of nastyness . i don ' t think in most cases these were performed acting as gods right arm or with any religious intent . people do shit because they want to and would probably find an excuse or reasoning to justify their actions . that guy kills because of god , others kill because they play too many video games , others kill because it makes them horny . we are all missing the point . humans are nasty , disgusting pieces of shit and are all capable of horiffic things . its just some people do it where the rest of us don ' t religion or not

5. yes , it was incredible . particularly given that the ferrari f310 was an absolute dog even in optimum conditions . schuey had irritated the hell out of me for the previous couple of seasons my flair will probably tell you why but nobody could deny his genius after that digit season .

6. why would he risk it ? because hes in the fucking nfl and hes famous . rich famous people can do whatever whenever they please and we let them get away with it because theyre so much better than you and me

8. i remember reading somewhere that this ' stunt ' almost went horribly , horribly wrong . the piece of wood coming off of the track was not supposed to get that close to his face . should it have been any closer he would have suffered one hell of a blow to the head . tl  dr  this dude is the man , man .
