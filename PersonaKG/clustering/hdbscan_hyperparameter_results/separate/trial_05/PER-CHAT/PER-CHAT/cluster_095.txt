2. in defence of adventure time , i have never seen this orange thing , i feel you miss the point . have you ever seen young kids play ? they are random as fuck . get one to tell you a story and they will tell you about a girl whose best friend is a giraffe and they go on a voyage to buy a dress but they meet a witch who turns the dress into a wolf so they have to go to the underwater cave to get a special sewing machine . in this respect i cannot see that it ' s that far off the target audience . sadly like the fan boys hanging on to the super hero characters of their youth cartoon network has no obligation to keep things relevant to a market that is technically no longer their target . every time the selection of cartoons change i get pissed about it . but then in time i learn to see what ' s good in pretty much all of them

3. this poster is a f  kin nightmare . it looks like it ' s tying to appeal to every single child , with all their favorite characters , and yet it looks like a live show of sorts . you can ' t use those characters in a live performance or an advertisement for all i know without the copyright holder ' s permission . but what the hell is it ?

7. i just started watching the dragon prince . only on ep digit , but it ' s already shaping up to be pretty epic . great visuals and storytelling , likable characters , awesome world building , it ' s just awesome all around . one of the creators of avatar the last airbender , aaron ehasz is on the writing team on the show as well , so one can draw a lot of parallels between the two shows . not too violent , but not too tame , so perfect for a kid your son ' s age . and no annoying voices in the characters , so you won ' t need to claw out your ears . it ' s just good clean fun for the family .
