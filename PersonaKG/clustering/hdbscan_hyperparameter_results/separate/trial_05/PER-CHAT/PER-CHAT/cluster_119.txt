1. im diagnosed with anxiety and all i have to say is a couple things . i used to have panic attacks everyday . it was the worst years of my life . there is no way to get rid of anxiety . everytime i see someone ask " how do you get rid of anxiety " i just tell them my story and say there is no way . ive had it for so long that i get used to it . im aware its not going to go away . i listen to music , that helps . i meditate , hard but helps . i paint my nails and chill .

2. my mom has depression and diabetes . the depression causes her to neglect her physical and mental health . she frequently ate things that were high in sugar without caring and slept all day and most of the night from a combination of the depression and astronomical blood sugars . i really had to grow up fast and my twin brother and i spent a lot of time by ourselves , left to our own devices . i had nobody guiding me through how to do adult things but still had to figure it how to accomplish them think going to the dmv , getting my first job , or even things as simple as grocery shopping for our family , i always get really nervous when i have to do something new . i feel like a little lost kid again whenever i have to do anything outside of my comfort zone .

3. i totally understand . i have add and many times my parents at mad at me for stuff and i don ' t know why . then later it hits me and i ' m like shit this is totally my fault i ' m an idiot . i don ' t blame my parents at all for getting mad . many people with mental illnesses don ' t recognize there ' s a problem and that just makes it so much worse . all i can say is i hope everything turns out of for you and your brother eventually

4. maybe i ' m coming off as too depressed . i wouldn ' t say i ' m officially " depressed " i live my own independent life . i go to school in a major that i love . i workout digit  digit times a week , i taught myself to play guitar , i fly  fish any free chance i get , i love hanging out at winery ' s , i love to cook for other people and i love to just be outside . today i did a ten mile bike ' n ' hike . the problem is , is that i do most of these activities alone or with my guy friends . i don ' t know though . maybe i do need some form of therapy and anti  depressant . the main issue is , it would mean i ' d have to tell my parents . i don ' t want to admit to them that i have a social anxiety that comes from fear of initiating a conversation with a woman . my dad made a joke the other day that he thought i was gay because i ' ve never brought home a girl from school . i took it personally . i don ' t know why i ' ve built this up to be so much harder than it should be .

5. one of the biggest errors our little human brains make is assuming people we know are the same from day to day . many people do not understand the episodic nature of depression . i strongly encourage you to mention to a friend of parent something like " this may be out of left field , but between you and me , i ' ve been feeling kind of blue lately . i know i don ' t show it , but i guess i could use a little extra support at the moment " say it in a way that feels like your voice . saying it out loud is scary , but surprisingly therapeutic in and of itself .

6. that ' s where i need to be . in a space in my head where i can ignore it or walk away from it . i ' m hung up on being angry that he gets to treat people however he wants without consequence . i honestly don ' t know how you didn ' t react with your father behaving like that ! i ' d have been terrified ! it ' s nice of you to still help him with his medical treatment even though he certainly doesn ' t sound grateful . i can see that having boundaries is important . i guess i need to know what mine are and stick to them at all times . i don ' t know if having cptsd is what makes my emotions take over when he does these things . something to talk to my psych about i suppose ! thank you so much reginaagnon , your kind words help more than you know ! red  heart

7. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !
