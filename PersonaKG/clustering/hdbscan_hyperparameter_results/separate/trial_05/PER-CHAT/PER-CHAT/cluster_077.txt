9. ok . though a subreddit is only as strong as its hallowed parameters , and is only as worthy as its erudite membership , one still seeks that spark of humanity , that intangible whisp of a soul existing beneath the unyielding tradition of syntactical perfection . tragically , one would be on a fool ' s mission , and would be reminded of his folly in a manner most brusque . in a way , such bitter truth is its own reward , sharpening the rose  tinted myopia of the naive optomist so that he is able to alter his path before it leads him off the precipice .
