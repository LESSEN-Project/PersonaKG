SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 6

1. i was massively overweight for the majority of my early life and got bullied for it to an extent , not to the point of trauma , but enough to motivate me . it ' s like a really painful band  aid that people like to put back on you and then rip off again , but you just need to eventually sew up the wound yourself so they don ' t have a place to put that band  aid anymore .

2. you can comment on height probably because people . ant do anything about it so theoretically you shouldn ' t feel bad about it . over weight people can do something about it so in theory it makes them feel worse . just a guess through .

3. everyone  s there to improve , most people who know this aren  t paying attention to anyone else and most likely enjoy seeing other people there to better themselves . imo anyone who shames other people for trying to do that is just an asshole

4. i see . i feel people want others to exercise to conform to their standards using health and physique as a dumb excuse rather then caring about someone being happy . ofcourse it is different when someone is obese but you get the message . also , many sports are boring and gyms are full of toxic shits anyway .

5. literally ' ' fitness is not just a hobby , it ' s a lifestyle ' '

6. but we shouldn  t say that being obese is okay as a society , but if you want to stay fat thats your choice but you shouldn  t spread fake ideals
