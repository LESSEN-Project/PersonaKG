3. yeah it was very quick but this one was pretty painful . but once you start you have to keep going so just persisted with the pain . they told me they were putting the power up but that was it . nothing to say that there was a chance of burning or damage like i experienced . my brother was telling me to try and push for damages but i would be happy with just my money back . i don ' t know if i ' m looking at this the wrong way regarding the damage that has been done .
