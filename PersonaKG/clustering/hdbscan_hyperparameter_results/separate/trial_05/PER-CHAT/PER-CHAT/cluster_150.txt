1. no mans sky always were a good game . you suckers just say it is  was bad because the creator overhyped it and lied about some features . blame the creator . not . the . creation . thats not just about nms , its about every fucking thing  your wife died giving birth to your child ? blame yourself for making her pregnant or dont blame anyone thats just one example . and also the game became really good after those updates . fuck you . haters gonna hate .  digit

2. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

3. tbh there are a lot of 2d games that are better than hzd , such as super mario bros digit and digit . i ' m not saying this game doesn ' t have its niche fanbase that will replay it people such as yourself , i ' m saying it wont be the sort of timeless game that continues getting new players into it years and years after release . it will instead fade into obscurity . the reason it wont age well is , as i mentioned , the fact that it ' s a copied and pasted open world format in an already overrsaturated genre . and it ' s boring .

4. that wasn  t me who said that lol . i played the shit out of the first destiny . every dlc , did every raid , all of it . the game is absolute shit . i understand that that  s my opinion , but i truly do not get how people like that game . didn  t even waste my time buying the second one . so disappointing that bungie abandoned halo for this garbage

5. no one is getting what i ' m saying tbh lol . people are just saying things without even reading descriptions on the game .

7. so the fuck what if i don ' t have more time to dedicate to something that didn ' t grab my attention ? why do you feel the need to defend a game or convert people to be fans of it ? that kind of attitude is just annoying . if you want to convince me it ' s good , tell me what is so amazing about it oh and why are you talking about the witcher ? that game was okay , nothing special . .
