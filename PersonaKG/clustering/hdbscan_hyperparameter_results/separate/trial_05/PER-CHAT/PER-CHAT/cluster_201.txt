SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:

Total from this dataset: 9

1. i get the feeling from what you  ve written that she  s saying this to make you jealous . i think you need to tell her that you  ve been thinking about it and it  s bothering you that she seems so hung up on her and talk about where you want to go from there . do you want her to stop seeing this girl ? do you want the communication to stop ? i think you need to decide what your ideal situation would be in regard to their current relationship . make sure she knows why you feel like this and how it makes you feel when she responds so quickly . if you guys are hanging out together why does she need to be constantly texting this other girl she used to date ? it  s not like they were only friends  you said she was in love with her and it  s inappropriate for her to still be this involved with her . i don  t know if this is useful advice but it  s what i  d do if i were in your situation . best of luck .

2. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

3. usually i hate when someone goes through other peoples phones , but when you have that gut feeling you have every right to do it . unfortunately for you , you found something very bad . she blows you off all the time and yet has great convos with other men ? pictures ? compliments ? seems to me this is very much cheating . run .

4. i ' m sort . of in the same boat . except mine doesn ' t go as far as telling me about new guys ! in my opinion that almost seems like she ' s trying to see if you get jealous .

5. sounds like a rough situation , if s is really obsessed i guess not doing anything don  t help , so you got to take action . i would suggest telling s you don  t like her , and hope for the best .

6. definitely say something . call her , though . tone can be kind of difficult to determine through text and you don ' t need want to give her any more reasons to push you away even more . " hey , insert sister name . how you doing , casual chatting , blah blah blah . i need to talk to you about something . i feel insert everything you just told us . i know it ' s your wedding and you can do whatever you want , but i ' m starting to think that you don ' t even want me there . if not , that ' s fine bc you ' re kind of being a bitch and i could do without all the cross country trips . if you genuinely want me to be a part of the wedding , then act like it and maybe ease up a little bit " . feel free to modify to your liking .

7. yeah that ' s ridiculous . you ' ve been dating for less than a month and she constantly pesters you ! like jeez when did she start , week digit ? you ' re nta in this situation , i think a sit down discussion about it is definitely needed tho

8. i suppose i have some perspective in a way from your girlfriends point of view as i think my girlfriend has similer feelings as i ' m still close friends with a guy i slept with the guy and i where friends long before i should add and it was a one time thing i know it kinda makes her uncomfortable so i try to take in to consideration her feelings about hanging out with him such as i would be with him alone but shes okayish with it because she trusts me .   x200b  so i guess what im saying in your gf case she must feel pressured by her ex into keeping contact and feels terrible about it , i say just try and support her as dealing with abusive ex partners can be a rough experience

9. then tell her that . in a nice way . it could start as simply as ,  do you mind asking me before you plan to invite your mom to stay over ?  she may also benefit from getting a more substantial friend group in your new area .
