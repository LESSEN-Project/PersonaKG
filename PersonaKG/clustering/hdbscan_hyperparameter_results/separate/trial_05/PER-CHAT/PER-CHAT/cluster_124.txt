   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

3. lgbt doesn ' t have my best interests considered . any group has potential to become a hivemind , so i ' d like to avoid that as well . asexuals seem like they should go their own way , but many feel they belong with the other minorities .

7. it  s not offensive , never said it was . and again , i  m not against sending a message , it  s how that message is sent . my concern is that they will overdo the strong independent female personality , just for the sake of it , robbing the characters depth and transforming them into a trope . it would be as boring and lifeless as a generic male power fantasy .

8. i didn ' t how much of one until the show .
   (ID: 3cc69335d54dfe26e103753b56ad7268563823e2)

9. no , but the stereotype is filled and this movie seems to be leaning very heavily in girl power bo peep not a soft woman any more . they didn  t do that with jesse , they just introduced a great character that was female . this is forceful feminism and it  s achieving the opposite affect . that  s what he  s saying . now stop being defensive .
