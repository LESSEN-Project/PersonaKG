1. a lot of people complain about this episode because they think it  s specifically geared to appeal mmj fans . truth is , you don  t have to know about it at all to find the episode entertaining . i thought is was pretty damn funny

2. why is there so much hate for that scene ?

3. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show

5. it ' s still on ? i would have never known . i don ' t pay attention to them nearly as much as people who claim to hate them do .
