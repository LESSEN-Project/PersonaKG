1. i enjoyed how you became self  aware toward the end of your post . parents are just humans , figuring it out as they go along . difficult kids teach you a lot very quickly , and make conflict with docile children feel like a walk  in  the  park .

2. this is enlightened . complaining is not the same as soliciting advice . so often a child ' s minor complaint about something gets a response telling them what they did wrong , just making the kid feel bad .

3. itt everyone has parents that yell at them for trivial things , proving that we ' re all in a matrix and a part of the hive mind

4. judging by your response , youre probably a terrible parent who doesn ' t take the time to enforce standards of good behavior in children , and instead says ' thats just the way kids are ' and lets them run around batshit crazy being a fucking menace .

5. they always signed us up for whatever activities we wanted to do hockey , baseball , figure skating , dance , etc . and made sure they brought us to every single lesson or game . not only did these activities teach me so much about goal setting and working with other people , it showed me how to support the people you love .
