1. my suggestion is that you should jusrify the desicions she makes based on beauty . for instances the more beautiful they are the healthier . there are uncountable ways to justify it like magic , culture , sport , economic competitiveness etc . you can make your character ' s perspective more poetic or funny . example  instead of saying " your nose is too large . you can say something like " you can ' t beyond your own nose .

4. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .

5. coming from a girl who everyone assumed my whole life as " rich " sometimes it ' s not actual individuals that hold money , it ' s the family . my family has money , but they don ' t pay my bills . the only expensive jewelry i ever have received family bought  gifts  which is just likes purses , scarfs , etc . so she may be struggling just as hard as you are , her struggle just may look a lot more stylish thanks to her family . just a thought ! btw  i dont date " rich guys " because digit  are jerks so she could also feel that way !

6. it seems like in the beginning of the series her face was narrow , but as it went on it grew wider and wider like she had some sort of plastic surgery .
