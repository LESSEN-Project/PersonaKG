Total from this dataset: 12

1. shark . i ' m more likely to survive . crocs kill quickly , a shark will most likely just take a bite and move on once it realizes humans don ' t taste good .
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)

2. i ' d probably take my chances . i mean we live in a world where living things must kill and consume other living things for survival , so , how much worse could it be ?

3. I am arachnophobic.
   (ID: 60d49a425809d6f450335028a75a5202d3b84678)

4. it would not be a bee , it has the advantage of only having to learn how to float like a butterfly , and conversely nor would i fight a sword wielding butterfly . i reckon i could take a beluga whales so long as it comes into my neighborhood .

5. mortality . i thought of mortality as a distant subject which happened to only others when i was younger . i was a naive kid for sure . lately i ' ve been surrounded by loss and it ' s readjusted my attitude to some things .
   (ID: 25a3a19690cf520ebb090d792f9aab864cc59254)

6. i ' d eat a human . i ' m not sure if it would by gamey or tender .

7. ankylosaurus . 8m long walking tank with a goddamn siege weapon for a tail .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

8. i had philophobia . i don ' t know if i still have it . it ' s basically the fear of love . i have it because of my parents . i had to watch them constantly argue . their sick relationship and the fact that they hardly ever showed any signs they loved me , caused some brain damage to me and now i usually can ' t listen when somebody is talking about love , especially very traditional love . i hate family as a unit and i hope i will never have children . also i find newborn babies disgusting because they are kinda a " a fruit of love " .

9. the moose attack is what taught me to fear any and all large animals . probably explains why i feel so unnerved near horses  no antlers , but they could still wreck my innards in an instant .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

10. i  d guess humans wouldn  t exist , since the rise of mammals would probably not happen . mammals would still be little , focused on survival on a land dominated by dinossaurs or some kind of dino  birds evolution . i doubt dinossaurs would remain so large , with food scarcity hitting them at some point .

11. well , if you stand under the wrong tree a pissed off drop bear might get you , but a snake will only strike at you if you startle it when close enough that it doesn ' t feel like it can get away  like if you ' re crashing through the bush chasing one or two terrified people . i ' d be at least a little concerned , but then , i ' m not a murderer . if i was a victim , i ' d take the chance of a snake bite and leg it at the first opportunity . i save my ' everything in australia will murder you ! ' stories for my kiwi husband and friends  it makes me look like a badass when i tell them about how i killed an eastern brown with a shovel or found a redback in my bed .

12. i have a bug and spider phobia . it started when i was a kid and woke up with a huntsman spider on my face . this is not a good phobia to have growing up in australia . so far , the most success i ' ve had at dealing with it has been moving to a country with less bugs new zealand . it ' s not so much overcoming it as running away from it , but it means the panic attacks are much less frequent . they still happen , one time i found a weta in my house and i didn ' t know what it was because it was the first time i ' d seen one and i was in such a panic that i locked myself out of my house trying to run away from it so i could call a friend to come and deal with it . in my panic i apparently thought it entirely logical to trap it in the house so it could be removed and i ended up having to get a friend drive me to my husband ' s office so we could bring him home and he could let me back in the house and remove the weta for me .
