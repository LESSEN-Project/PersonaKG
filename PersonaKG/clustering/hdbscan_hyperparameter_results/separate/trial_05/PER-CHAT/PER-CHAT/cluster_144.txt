1. essential  what is a double double ? if you know what this is , you ' ll blend in well . just pronounce " about " like " a  boot " and pepper your words with the occasional " eh ? "

2. i love introverted conversations . we just get other introverts and it ' s not a problem because we know it ' s awkward and we can just ignore it and not judge each other . so tell me , what did you eat today ? was it tasty ? what ' s your favourite name for a cat ? what colour eyes do you like the best ?

3. " how did you learn not only how to speak but also go through the entire name change process and no one noticed "
   (ID: f2cec4af782c7d455288420e90648dc9c6d12538)

4. One of my favorite things is hearing strangers.

5. i ' m not sure if this is the most effective technique but i just try to be honest . i ' ll ask for them by name and then ask if i ' m pronouncing that correctly . if someone asks how i got their number , i say it ' s from a list that the campaign has , i ' m not sure how it ' s compiled .

6. if you call me , please tell me your name . i can ' t distinguish voices aside from male  female . when i pick up a phone , everyone sounds alike . i imagine if morgan freeman called me my brain would label him ' generic male ' . and yes , i ' ve had entire conversations with people without knowing who they are because i ' m also socially awkward and past a certain point , it becomes too awkward for me to ask who i ' m talking to .

7. i just say hey to people i know , try to make conversations of needed , this avoids awkward attention , because i just look like a normal human , talking and laughing , but little dot hey know

8. most the time i can give them the right one but if im not sure i just say i ' m colorblind so this could be completely wrong , and if you want to find out what kind of colorblind you are there ' s a test on enchroma . com that you can take that will tell you

9. stop explaining it and start having fun with it . i know a bunch of people that do have at least some form of stutter .

10. if you just met them like at a party ,  tell me about yourself  is a perfect opener that allows people to take it where they want . if you have developed some rapport , asking about people  s brothers , sisters , and parents  remember their names , and if they sound positive , ask what that relationship looks like  would you say you act more like friends or are you the protective sibling  . if they sound negative , venture elsewhere or play it safe and ask something more open ended like ,  who are you closest with ? who do you tell stuff that nobody else knows ?  the provocative questions like that last one is a gambit and can either turn people away or build intimacy quickly .

11. i found an article about it on the web  and another in psychology today  the trick is , with a few polite questions and comments , to start a more meaningful conversation , but stick to appropriate topics such as  the weather . the person that you want to talk to . talk very little about yourself . people love to talk about them selves . once they are talking , ask questions like  what do you like to do for fun  or  for a living  also , study non  verbal cues , like facial expressions , and body language . if someone points their face or feet away from you , they may not want to talk . another thing to remember is that it  s just for enjoyment , and to try to get to know someone . don  t put too much pressure on yourself to get it right every time , nobody does . this includes neuro  typicals . it  s difficult for many people , not just autistic people . i think , however , as an autistic individual , that if you approach the matter analytically , that you may have great success at it .

12. first of all , people can dress like whatever they want . this is a free country . nobody likes sjw tumblr  cucks and nobody cares if you ' re offended . second , if a child has a nut allergy , they should just tell the person with the candy . i ' m sure they ' d be more than happy to give them something they can actually eat . finally , as someone with autism , do not engage in their conversation . that ' s fucking dangerous . i will talk about batman for several hours if you let me . just pretend to be mildly interested and politely end the conversation when the child starts droning on . that is all .

13. learning the sign language alphabet . i know it for bsl and asl , it takes digit minutes and is a useful skill to have in general . often when i bring up that i know it , people ask me to teach them how to introduce themselves , which is fun . i once had a short conversation with a deaf woman and it was amazing . she was excited to see me trying , and helped me learn a few phrases

14. lol , if you go to the airpods in settings themselves , the a2x models are always 2nd gen , a16x are the old generation . i was myself confused by this too until i checked apple  s website . here in asia , everyone is wearing them and talking to them all the time , not awkward to do likewise at all . did you try talking louder and in continuous voice without too much background noise ? that almost always works for me . if it still doesn  t work , make sure to try to retrain her voice or resetting the id . just by getting into the habit of offloading some of the repetitive tasks to her you  ll def prepare yourself for ios digit and shortcuts automations which i  m sure will become super handy . the user guide in apple books also has some useful tips . don  t give up and keep trying , hope it works out for you as for me it  s been great so far ! smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

15. i hope she shocks the hell out of you and knows sign language im in college learning it and it is one of the best things ive ever done for myself . hearing aids ideally arent a big deal but im curious so i wonder , do you have photos of you wearing them ?
