Total from this dataset: 6

1. i feel like a lot people don ' t know what a neutron star is let alone how dense they can be . it ' s not common knowledge .
   (ID: 89e5ffcdc3b9c2cbc19f7274b7643ce26a8e2bbd)

   (ID: b6567f005c34603036e6119544386ff4f12ec3a9)

3. i hate how they all say  leave a like it really helps me out  like i get it , i do , but it  s really annoying .
   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

4. i hate when people doesn ' t understand that an elementi has not the same properties in every molecule he ' s in . shouldn ' t otherwise your mouth explode when you put salt on food because of the sodium ? or oxygenated water be good to drink ? this is simply pure ignorance , even middle school teaches you this

5. oh i do . i let people know right away that they are dumb for asking a question when we both know they already know the answer . why would you want to force a conversation with someone ? do you enjoy bothering people ?

6. because when i get asked if i read or like books , i always saw i do . because deep down i know i should read and it  s embarrassing to not know a book title or author . that  s why people get mad . dude , if you know you have a grammar problem and you dislike reading either accept your non existent interest to learn or start reading . it  s not hard . i hate when people say they love reading but can  t name a single novel or book .
