1. thanks a million ! just to pick your brain a little more , my flatmate has pokemon y , he told me there is a way to carry over stats when breeding . is this right . i may have misunderstood what he was saying though . edit  i am aware of nature and characteristics . but we were talking about defence stats and things .

2. yes , crushing is only available after you have completed the game but also gives you the cheats needed to get through crushing .

3. does the pokeball plus contain a single mew for a single save file or can mew be put into multiple save files ? also , if i reset my game with mew in it , is it not possible to get it again from the same pokeball ?

4. yes but it  s so rare i  ve been on here since the start and i  ve only seen like two and that was months ago . after some research it  s a very very rare drop from somewhere , hence why i thought it would in the dev room due to its scarcity

5. yeah , shadow claw is one of the best moves for pvp and gym  raid battles , and you can ' t get it anymore . that ' s one of the most sought after pokemon in the game . congratulations !
