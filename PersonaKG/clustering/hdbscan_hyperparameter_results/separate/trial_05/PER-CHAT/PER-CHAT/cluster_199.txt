2. bad break up ? if so you got to let it go . if not , then go outside and explore somewhere where people are accepting , like a sports bar or social clubs or something where you can add to peoples conversations

5. alright i  m gonna be brutally honest . quit lying and bullshitting to your self , and be you . i looked at your history and read this post idk what you did or what you want , but the biggest thing to success will be accepting everything and not lying to cope . afterwards it  s a easy path of going out of your comfort zone and changing lifestyles . if that  s not possible then you need to live so your happy . you can live in the wilderness in alaska alone for example if you hate humanity so much . personally i would love to do this but i still have other goals that require me around humanity

6. being single does suck . i ' ve been single my entire life m16 . i usually cope by hanging out with friends . i know i ain ' t the best looking , nor am i fit . but yeah . i get how you feel . life does suck that way . whenever i feel down about being alone , i usually think " i ' ll find that person eventually " some day you will . just continue doing what you like , and hang out with your friends

7. well like i said , you and your circumstances . d ' you think if nothing happens tonight you ' re gonna feel less shitty tomorrow ? i hear you , i once had a casual hookup happen pretty much directly after a breakup . fun at the time but i didn ' t feel great about it afterward , but then that ' s just me . you know yourself better than i do and you seem like a person of conscience . i think you ' ll do what ' s gonna make you happiest .
