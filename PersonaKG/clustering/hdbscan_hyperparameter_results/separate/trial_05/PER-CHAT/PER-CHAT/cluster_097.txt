Total from this dataset: 10

1. as long as they keep putting out seasons ill still play . i love seeing new skins and the live events , even if i stop finding the game fun ill still keep watch over the map and the item shop because i dont want to miss a thing

2. what part of the game is this or is this an edit ?
   (ID: 420a86ecfb9d645349db591746d0cdeba4b68f37)

3. no , because i like the game just enough to keep playing at least until there  s more dragon ball super or something and even then i might just stop playing for awhile . i won  t quit until i stop having fun and so long as i have battles with people where the timer is at digit , we  re both down to one character and everything is gonna come down to the next move , i  ll keep playing . when things get too easy or hard for me to do , i  ll stop

4. you complaining about free rewards ? it  ll get better and more competitive as you grow within the game . i assume your still very new at swgoh and are clumped with people who are probably not that into it the same way you are .

5. the game is too big to die . with all those mods , you can even play just terraria for your entire life . maybe the hype might die and player base will be lower but i don  t think it will die .

6. probably current patch apart from very minor changes . they rightfully so don ' t want to change the meta a lot right before such a big tourny .

7. it ' s not the game it ' s the fact every post is them thinking they are clever with a new name .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

8. the large roster . a year ago i was afraid the game would end up having almost the same size of a roster as brawl did .
   (ID: c378ee827fb7d26c7ea685ec1dc451bf264b0151)

9. same as the other guy , i have thousands of hours and feel the same way . however the dota digit community still begs for new content constantly , even if the content is just a treasure full of cosmetic hero sets .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

10. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .
