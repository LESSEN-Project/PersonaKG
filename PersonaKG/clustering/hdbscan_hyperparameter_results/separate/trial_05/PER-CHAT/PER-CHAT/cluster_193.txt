1. just started my second year and my old friends ditched me cause the thought i was weird , and they didn  t have a good rep so people think i  m a douche

2. so how do you meet new people today without walking up and talking to them ?
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

3. definitely know how you feel . it sucks big time . but i  ve learned that those kind of friends aren  t real friends . i tend to only have digit or digit close friends who i do stuff with  activities that require other people such as going to the cinema or jamming . all my other  fake  friends , i just don  t expect anything from them . if they invite me out somewhere , fine . otherwise i try not to give a shit . and truth be told , i can  t really stand being around them for too long . helps with the not giving a shit part . hope you feel better soon . xx

4. if you throw away your friends for not sharing the same political views as you , then you were never friends to begin with
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

5. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .

6. i believe meeting people isn ' t hard , but bonding is . so best advice is to genuinely be happy before you meet someone . listen to music that makes you feel good . this isn ' t necessarily your favourite music , just something chill . for me what a wonderful world by sam cooke works .

7. it ' s quite possible that your friends are assholes . but it might be useful to take an objective look at yourself . is there any aspect of your personality or behavior that could be off putting ? when things calm down , perhaps you could talk with one of your friends  try  understand why they did what they did . or speak to someone else entirely who knows all of you .

8. nobody should ever feel this way . it hurts me that your  friends  would tell you things like that . i would take some time to find a new friend group . if there is a counselor or someone on campus , i would utilize that resource too . you don  t need to feel alone . you have a bright future . i  m sorry this is happening to you .

9. sounds like you had it rough in hs , sorry to hear . i did to , but eventually you grow up and realize none of that matters
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

10. well it looks like you took their advice the wrong way . talking to people doesn ' t necessarily mean you have to act like someone else . to be honest , everybody is really insecure in high school . chances are that if you don ' t have a horrible personality , you ' ll be able to find someone with the same interests as you .
   (ID: dc000fb877b86a0bbd3d65fe6040b512b4f5b042)

11. you do need to suck it up eventually . at the end of the day you ' re the only one in control of your own happiness . this seems mean but it ' s the truth .
   (ID: a5abb0fc49ef940b208bd33b46b6b669a13fc83f)

12. introduce yourself to everyone . don ' t do anything that might leave a bad impression .
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

13. well again , not to take away from your problems , but everyone has them . even those that seem to have all their shit together are dealing with something . hang in there my friend .

14. thanks for the detailed response back i  m really the same way a lot of the time  i really only talk when it  s important to me and try to stay comfortable wherever i am with a calm attitude . i would rather observe than participate . it  s hard for others to  read  a person who acts so chill i don  t think being late would really affect someone else feeling uneasy around you  it  s not necessarily a  flaw  but could be misconstrued as being confident you  ll be okay if you  re late . i would definitely try to stop being late . you wanna be seen as putting in as much effort as everyone else . also , help out your coworkers ! especially the new ones  being the big kid on the block is intimidating especially if they don  t feel like they  re meeting your standards . ask someone who seems to be nervous around you for help to figure out nyc mass transit and see what happens  they might start to feel more comfortable . try to be a little less chill  most people are uncomfortable around others who seem to be confident in their silence because it kinda makes you seem like a stranger . try to observe others around you  are they asking questions often ? are they talking amongst themselves while you just observe ? what can you do to relate to them ? incorporate yourself into other peoples  lives and i think you  ll see a big change . in regards to meeting a girl  you should remember that women want to feel calm with their man  don  t try to throw out how chill you are  instead just show them a different side to you . as a first date do something really actively fun and faster paced like roller skating or an adult jump house . if they have strong opinions on something you kinda feel indifferent about , join along in their fury if it  s not that big of a deal . just little things to make you more relatable . relatable is the key word here for sure ! good luck

15. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

16. it sucks if you have friends who dont care enough . there is sadly nothing you can do . your friends either try to improve if they want to be worthy to be called " friends " or you have to group  soloq with other guys .

17. i know this sounds like a standard answer giving to everyone , but i know that its the best way . i know that because i also was in that position when you have lost so many of your friends , that there is no place to start , to regain them . put yourself out there , and with out there i mean really into the world of the people you want to befriend . when i needed a friend to go to parties with , i needed to go out alone , to find those with similar interest . and is definitely not so hard when you start building up confidence to go up ro people . most people don ' t have a reason to approach you when already having their social circle , so there is no was around for you to just start randomly talking with people that think may be symphatic . nearly all of the people i started talking to reacted super positve on that behavior . some may find it strange at first , same stick to that attitude and evem some of them will become your friensy

18. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .
