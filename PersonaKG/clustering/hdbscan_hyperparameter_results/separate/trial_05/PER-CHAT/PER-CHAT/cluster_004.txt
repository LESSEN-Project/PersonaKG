1. i agree , they were quite trigger shy about embracing some of the more overt comic conventions that they believed wouldn ' t translate well to live action .

2. but the kids among to different parents so i don ' t understand the comparison of white kids have clothes and black kids don ' t . also , where did the mother get clothes from ? she must love right there . toddlers run around in diapers at home all the time when it ' s hot . they are typically the ones who strip themselves . lol . i got bored and stopped watching before the end . guy seemed to be trying very hard to push a narrative .

3. honestly , i feel that way with winter soldier as well . could  ve been a ten minute clip of steve and bucky sitting down and reminiscing over a cup of coffee and the larger plot would barely be affected

4. woooozzzaaaaaa i need a drink . so distance and travel time and logic went out the window ? also you couldn ' t even give us one fucking scene between jon and ghost ? you sending your loyal wolf to valhala and don ' t even pet it ! the fuck but to think d  d fuckers fought for digit seasons for a fucking white polar bear because they have such a hard on for meaningless bullshit .

5. jeez , and i thought i had to much free time on my hands . why would anyone want to watch them without the context of the game ? that seems so weird to me
