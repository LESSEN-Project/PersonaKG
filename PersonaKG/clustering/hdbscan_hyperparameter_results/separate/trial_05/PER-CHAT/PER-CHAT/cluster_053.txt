SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 5

1. i honestly think it  s super sketchy whenever someone doesn  t have a profile photo . like okay ? you get to pick and choose people through their photos , but they don  t get to do the same to you ? and sometimes they even say stuff like  can  t put my photos up because of work  some other ambiguous reason  . like who the hell are you that people can  t see your face ? and if that  s the reason , you shouldn  t even be online dating . as for your guy  like how likely is it even that some criminal will be looking for him on a dating site ? social media maybe , but dating site is a damn stretch . i say leave it . he seemed to heavy with the pet names too quickly so cringy btw , especially since you  ve not even met . and i definitely wouldn  t want you to introduce him into your kids  lives . i feel like you sensed all the red flags already , but just needed some confirmation from other people . don  t get too hung up on this one guy that you  ve not even met yet  there will be other men out there that are less sketchy and more open with information about themselves .

2. i  m pretty sure my neighbor is into some hardcore drugs as the cops have stopped by quite a few times . weirdest thing is seeing home move next door and being this completely normal dude to now being a crazy drug addict . i remember the first time i met him he was really nice and we talked about music for a while while i was cleaning my car . fast forward to a year or so later , i got home from work late and he was walking by and he tried to shake my hand and wouldn  t let it go as he told me that he was a nymphomaniac .

3. sure it would be creepy if the guys were random strangers . but op hasn ' t specified that . it could just be people she knows . in view that , i think it ' s alright . quick to jump to conclusions aren ' t we !

4. even though there  s potential for drama to be created here , it  s pretty hot so i guess i  d do it if the guys was attractive
