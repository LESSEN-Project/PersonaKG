6. irrespective . i allot  digit  digit for money above the taxes etc . a tip is not a guarantee , it ' s a weird custom that only applies to certain industry workers . why do baristas get tipped but not mcdonald ' s ? why restaurant delivery but not amazon or post service ? i ' ll partake in the custom because it ' s a social expectation , but i have my equally arbitrary rules for how i ' m going to pay it .

12. it ' s not wrong , but it ' s sad . you should strive to have more self control and let people have less power over you . is it wrong to call someone a racial slur ? of course . do people do it anyway ? of course . should a car hit you when you ' re crossing the street ? no . do you look both ways before your cross anyway ? hopefully . you know there are going to be people who will say things to intentionally upset you . the best weapon you have against that is not letting it bother you .

18. it  s hard to say without knowing what kind of relationship you have with your boss and how the question was delivered . on the optimistic side , perhaps he or she is genuinely interested in understanding how you like your job so improvements can be made . if you  re paranoid and  or pessimistic , you could be left wondering if it  s a subtle , passive aggressive attempt to threaten you so you work harder .
