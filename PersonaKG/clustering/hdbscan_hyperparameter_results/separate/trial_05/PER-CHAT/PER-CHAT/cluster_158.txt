2. no one has to tolerate speech that attempts to invalidate , ostracize , or incite harm . if it  s a  witch hunt  , the very nature of the statement implies that something is untrue . if that  s truly the case , the person in question has the ability to force an injunction and charge in a civil court for the tort of defamation . if the statement is true , then yes , absolutely , no one has any obligation to engage with a person who has demonstrated antisocial , inegalitarian behaviour . also , you need to actually reply to people  s posts directly . replying to your own post doesn  t give specific people a notification .
