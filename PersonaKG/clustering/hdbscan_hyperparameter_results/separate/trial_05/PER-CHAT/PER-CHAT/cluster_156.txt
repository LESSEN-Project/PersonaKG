Total from this dataset: 14

1. is there a difference between transgender and transsexual ? is transsexual considered to be an insult ? i ' m genuinely curious . all this gender talk frustrates me sometimes , there ' s so many genders and no one talks about sex  what ' s in your pants , or whether its there naturally or artificially . that ' s the thing i care the most about when it comes to romance and sex as a gay guy .

2. i disagree with the others here , queer is perfectly fine to use . it  s clearly based on the context when and where it  s even potentially offensive . if you want to be more specific and sensitive  queer identified  is a safe bet .

3. i have this problem too . my trans best friend and i refer to each other as " tr    ies " all the fucking time because we both understand that we ' re doing it to take the piss out of actual transphobes . but then i really have to try hard not to refer to other trans people like this . it ' s really bad lol basically , you ' ve just gotta surround yourself with people who aren ' t going to use that language . we automatically pick up and appropriate the language of those we surround ourselves with something something egotistic in  grouping .

4. well , if we accept ourselves  just as we are  then nobody should ever work out because you  re changing your body , put on make up because you  re changing your physical appearance , wear clothes because you  re covering your natural body , or change yourself in any way because if you do , you  re not accepting yourself just as you are . everyone  s perspective of self acceptance is different . some people don  t believe in getting butt lifts or boob implants , some do . regardless , people still get them . people getting packers is trans guys accepting themselves as who they are a man . hypothetically , and assuming your a male , if you were in an accident and lost your dick it  s happened to many guys , you wouldn  t do anything to help yourself feel better about the loss ? i mean , since you should just accept how you are now . i do recognize that i sound very condescending in this comment and i  m not going to deny it , i  m just trying to counter argue and use your logic against you .

5. well , its been a while now and nobody got it , so here ' s the comment again with slightly easier to read formatting . you ever met a gay person ? or asked them about their experiences growing up in abusive atmospheres with people using language like this ? up until very recently this kind of talk was pretty common , and it shouldn ' t be tolerated just because it ' s " some guys down the pub " . fuck that . all it takes for this kind of crap to be perpetuated is people like you who dismiss it as " pub talk " , and " banter " . good job there , i hope you ' re proud of yourself . read the first letter of each sentence .

6. that ' s not pc . it ' s applying a term to people who don ' t need them . i am man . i am a not a cisgender male who identifies as a man . i am a male . have been since the day i was borng . period . you don ' t need ways to differentiate me from transgendered people .

7. in my teens i wasn  t very sensitive to the subject . definitely use derogatory words and definitely wasn  t befriending anyone who was openly gay . but then i moved to ann arbor to work at my aunts bar and the very first two friends i made where gay but i didn  t know for like a month . that really opened my eyes . these two are amazing people , and after talking to them i couldn  t believe all the hate they have to face day in and day out . and i used to be apart of that . i can  t believe i used to think and act like that to another human just because of one difference . i will never use homophobic terms again and i pray that everyone in our society regardless of sexuality will receive the respect and happiness they deserve . i will always stand up for love for the rest of my life

8. either you were born with organs of a male or a female do you not ? like you could identify as whatever the shit you want but you have one or the other , no ?

9. that is so homophobic !

10. i ' ve personally faced violence for being a transman more than once , and i live in a really bigoted place filled with truly awful people . i totally get where you ' re coming from  the point of my comment was actually to point of that transmen face their share of issues with being trans . most commonly , in my experience , misogyny that reduces us down to genitals and the use that men can have for them .

11. my opinion on the subject tends to piss people off to begin with  i hate it that any single group has been indoctrinated by judeo  christian hegemony and then adopts it as if it  s their own bias . african , afro  caribbean , and african americans are the unfortunate prime example , but it also extends to native and aboriginal peoples across the world . the british , spanish , dutch and french came in , installed  buggery  and  sodomy  laws which criminalized homosexuality . the european dominion of the overseas territories brought with it puritanical religion which became deeply entrenched and persisted  in most cases still persists to this day . i wouldn  t blame these communities for a second , most of them had third genders and  or never had a prohibition on homosexuality until white people told them to . and the rest is history .

12. i think you ' re overanalyzing this pic , op never said anything about men or women , he probably meant something along the lines of " from ' having a penis ' to ' not having a penis anymore ' " , without mentioning gender , sex or self  identity , this is literally only about losing a dick , it doesn ' t matter if it was an operation or an amputation also this is a meme about a tv character , why on earth would you be offended

13. hell yeah ! preach ! just one correction tho  transgenderism isn ' t the right word . it ' s just " being transgender " . the term has a lot of baggage from people using it as a slur so for the most part we avoid using it unless joking about people being dick .
   (ID: 77e0b8c51dfb89ff57bd838b86ee4d78a9fe856f)

14. i understand intersex . i get transgender . you wanna be the opposite of what you are . you identify with being the other sex . i ' m talking about people who claim they are neither . no , you were born with a vagina or a dick . you can ' t be neither just because you fucking feel like it .
