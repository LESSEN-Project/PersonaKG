   (ID: 13429813198f2aaef97e18644aa776da323f48a1)

2. that trailer tagged along into the spiderverse about that dog running away and then finding its way back home was completely spoiled by the trailer . like it shows absolutely everything . even the resolution . wtf .

3. well , i too do not want any spoiler . but that ' s just life in the internet man . there will be spoilers . just finding a way to combat this rather than staying inside a cave until your screening time .

7. yeah most of them may be a little tricky . found that putlocker usually has everything if you don  t mind streaming them . just started the indiana jones movies on there last night .

10. man , i feel you , i prefer watching the anime too . i ' ve found out the hard way . if you search anything up about naruto , you are guaranteed to get spoilers . generally avoid discussion videos bc they dip into manga territory . this subreddit ' s rules are pretty good with spoilers , just avoid anything tagged with spoilers .

11. if you don  t enjoy it and find no meaning from it at all from reading the book twice , then why are you attempting to force yourself to enjoy it through people who did ? if you didn  t like it then that should be the end of it , no ?
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

12. no . why would you ? would you read the last chapter of a book if you haven ' t read the rest ?
   (ID: 5147e830e7cfa538d6990a8699ad6462b57cfb52)

13. i know it ' s perhaps a " you snooze you lose " but lately got spoilers it ' s exactly that . i mean i understand if someone doesn ' t want to get spoiled the weekly episode if he can ' t watch it right away , but if you didn ' t start watching by now you can ' t expect to browse around the internet without encountering some spoilers on way or another considering the popularity of the show , even in real life there ' s not one week without me hearing some got reference at work or whatever . the best way to go at it would be to binge watch the shit out of shit asap over the weekends and there you go , no more worries .

14. for me it depends on what else it would be , for example lord of the rings sounds interesting .
