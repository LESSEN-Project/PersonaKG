SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 7

1. the same way you deal with any fear , you face it you understand it and you overcome it usually by sheer force of will . when people begin to question ones gender fear of passing is very prominent however , until you are further into your transition it is incredibly hard to really tell how well you can pass or blend in potentially the fear is irrational , its takes effort to pass but being fearful about what may or may not happen will just paralyze you

2. we didn ' t tell them . they are in their late teens and they still " believe . they didn ' t outright ask but as they were feeling it out i said " mom and i believe because if you don ' t believe he stops coming and christmas without santa would be sad . not a greed thing but a tradition choice .

3. i hear you there . it occurs to me that because of how personal transition is even if i have someone to talk about it with it will always be something i do alone . i don ' t have trans friends to commiserate with about the tough stuff , or to share excitement with when cool things happen . the friends i do have can listen and empathize somewhat , but it ' s not quite the same .

4. if you do raise a child i recommend coming out to them to normalize it . of course , everyone has different comfort levels , but it  s just a thought . also , the only people that should know your gender identity are the ones that you want to know . if that list is just your husband , then that  s perfectly fine !

5. parents should never love their child or anyone else ' s any less , simply because that child is gay . it saddens me to think of your struggle . i come from a conservative family , and was raised very much anti  gay , but you know what ? when i grew up , and learned to think on my own , i realized that the bigots are the true evil in this world . i told each of my children that if i ever found out they were gay , that i would be digit  cool with it . as a parent myself , let me tell you that you need nobody ' s approval to be who you are .

6. he will find his own way . my sister still has a relationship with them but i am nc with my parents . it  s weird sometimes . but that  s what works for her and this is what works for me , and that  s ok . just give him hugs , and be there for him , because we have to choose our family very carefully  we were given such crappy ones ! sounds like you both are on the same page . and don  t ever give your ssn to anyone who asks . god , so many horror stories of nparents stealing their children  s identities and ruining their lives ! aack ! protect yourself !

7. probably a matilda situation . in my experience , your parents don  t have to tell you that you were unwanted and they resent you for it . kids are pretty intuitive that way , and if he didn  t know before then he probably knows now based off of the fact that they want literally nothing to do with their grandchild . but i bet the maternal grandparents will have more than enough love to go around !
