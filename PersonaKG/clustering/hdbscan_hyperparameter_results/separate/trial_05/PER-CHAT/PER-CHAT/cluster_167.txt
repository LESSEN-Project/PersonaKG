1. nah man , even if you put the scenes in chronological order it still has no plot . i  ve tried to appreciate the movie , but nothing happens . compared to other tarantino movies , even ones light on story like kill bill , it doesn  t hold up .

4. yeah , if a directors cut comes out that ' s digit  hours long then maybe . i know i ' ve crapped on it so far but ww , flash , and even parts of aquaman were good just wish dc would stop trying to race marvel and just make good movies .

7. i think the movie is better than the series mostly because the movie used the lyrics

8. das experiment . its so good movie but the trailer is absolutly terrible .

9. why ? it ' s a fair question . most old movies sucks .

10. pulp fiction . interesting directing but the plot as a whole was awful and the witty dialogue couldn  t make up for a lack of a sense of purpose . an issue i have with many nonlinear stories is that it detracts from the tension in certain scenes . it  s like when you  re reading a book and see that there  s still digit pages left , so you know nothing bad is going to happen to the main character .
