1. make sure you love yourself . be happy with doing things on your own and don ' t rush into anything without getting to know the other person well .

2. i think the worst thing you can do in a relationship is expect the other person to know what you ' re thinking , wanting , or feeling . i ' m introverted and keep things to myself , but i knew things were vastly different with her when i felt comfortable telling her my insecurities , dreams , and pretty much everything about me  i actually found myself wanting to share all of that with her . it may sound overly simple , but we communicated really well from the get  go .

3. forget about how you ' re supposed to act to be a man . just be you . for example , you ' re about to be of legal drinking age . you want a sherly temple at the bar while everyone else is doing shots and chugging beer ? fuck them . get your sherly temple and drink it with pride . trust me , it ' ll work out .

4. with people i know it ' s behavior because i can see it . there ' s nothing that applies overall , it ' s been specific to each couple and the individuals involved . with celebrities it has to be intuition , maybe with a dash of " no duh " thrown for the more obvious ones . the one i felt awful about was chris pratt and anna faris . they were so cute as a couple to me and then one day i random thought they didn ' t seem right together any more . i felt so bad for thinking that . within a couple months they announced their separation . come to think of it i saw amy grant and her ex husband perform together once and knew immediately that they were doomed . that was before i knew to keep those thought to myself and got an earful from the one person i mentioned it to .

5. let it slide off you . why would you care whether someone thinks you are unmanly or creepy . if they think so , let them think so . it should have no influence on you whatsoever . aren ' t you a man going their own way ? exactly doing that ? not caring what people think of the choices you make and doing whatever you want to do anyway ? that ' s exactly what mgtow is about for me .

6. wanted to ask this to my best friend ' s girlfriend who is also my best friend what she likes and doesn ' t like about me . i have trouble talking with her anyway because i ' m an awkward person . i ' ve tried to gain confidence , but it just never works out
