Total from this dataset: 5

1. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .

3. thank you for the response , i  ve been considering whether she  s really worth keeping around anyways . it  s just so hard to cut out someone who you  ve known your whole life .

4. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .
