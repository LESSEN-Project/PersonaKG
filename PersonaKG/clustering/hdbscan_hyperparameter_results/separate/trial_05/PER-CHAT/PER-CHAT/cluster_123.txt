4. the company i work for pays us to go volunteer a few times a year with a food bank we work closely with and donate to and what not . the fuckin nerve of some people that come in there is unreal . you have the super nice and just down on their luck people that are super appreciative for anything you give them , and for helping load it into their cars and what not , then you get the giant pricks who make you put digit bags into their brand new car , then when you get there they open up the bags and start taking out vegetables and whatever else they dont want and demand you bring them back inside and give them extra cake or sweets , or whatever they choose then flip out when you tell them that ' s not really how it works .

5. my mom once went to a popeye ' s where the service was really slow and there was bulletproof glass separating the cashier from the customers . the service was so slow that a guy who was waiting in line was able to watch a few episodes of daredevil in the amount of time it took him to get his food . my brother wanted to leave , but my mom had already paid for our chicken and she didn ' t want to trust the dumb kid behind the counter with her credit card again . the moral of the story is that you shouldn ' t go to popeye ' s restaurants in the ghetto .

10. i don ' t like anyone bagging my groceries for me , just the way i am . so when i see someone coming to bag it for me at the self check out , i turn them away . many times it is someone who is mentally challenged , probably often times i didn ' t even notice . either way , i don ' t want to be rude . i don ' t want them to think because of their disability i don ' t want them handling my food . so i say , " oh , no thank you . it ' s going to two different places " so they figure i need to pack it a certain way .
