1. digit the lady at the pizzeria said she would serve any customers who came into the shop but that she would not provide pizzas to a gay wedding . digit i seriously doubt the law would have covered her in this instance . no doubt she would have tried to use the law to cover her but i don ' t think it would have been upheld by any court . digit if she is really against gay weddings personally do you really think its right that she be forced to service a gay wedding or loose her business ? if you think its ok to force someone to do something they are morally against then i think there is something wrong with you personally . if you think its not ok for a person to make a living if they dont have the exact same values as you do , then again , i think that there is something wrong with you .

2. if she ' s insisting but let you pay the other times , let her this time . i dated a guy for awhile who paid for every single thing , which is super flattering , but when i told my mom she was like " you need to pay too ! just make him let you pay " so i felt weird about it . we are told we need to take care of ourselves first , to be independent , that we can ' t be " bought " etc . i think it ' s actually a good sign on her feelings towards you . while i ' m not dating that guy anymore , i offered a lot to pay because i didn ' t want him to think i was taking advantage of his kindness . i did finally end up paying for a few things here and there , which worked out because he never carried cash and i ' m a cash girl . i doubt this will be the new " rule " where she will always pay for herself .

3. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .

4. nah . i don  t think it  s really that big of a deal for her to go back and grab a couple of things while you are ringing up groceries as long as you  re not already done scanning and other people including you aren  t having to wait several minutes on her . on the other hand , i don  t think you were necessarily in the wrong . i mean , i understand your reasoning . if it is something that bothers you , you have the right to voice that . it  s probably something to bring up in the car on the way home or at home and not at the store , however .
