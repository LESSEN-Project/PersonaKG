3. if you can ' t try and keep up with them , let them go .   x200b  try to know what your capabilities are . there may be some times where you are actually left alone intentionally or unintentionally where you have to defend yourself for a short period of time against a horde or a big enemy . work a little bit against the tide when you find yourself in this situation and i ' m sure you will better yourself in some way . make a game out of it if you have to , and if you survive on your own for that time , be proud of yourself and reflect on how you did it .   x200b  be patient always . if the rusher dies , kindly remind them that this game works with teamwork  or don ' t even respond at all to them . my experience has mostly been them ragequitting after dying so i could go and revive the bot for extra help .   x200b  don ' t be mad if the group fails . keep trying . it ' s just a game  a beta version of the game , at that . it ' s going to need revision before it becomes a truly enjoyable and playable game .   x200b  edit  oh and always keep player outlines on . you can coordinate yourself to stick with the main group going at a better pace if you know where everyone is .

4. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .

5. i agree . once the achievement hunters get their aps , everything will be back to somewhat normal .  the only real bad thing about leagues so far are the pve commanders . yeah , there ' s a ton of them  but on the flipside , they probably really want to help . it just so happens they get overwhelmed with all the things they need to do . they may have been used to running with their guild then decided to try it out on the server . i once commanded our guild run in wvw and it ' s really different when you ' re working with your guild and when you have pugs with you . with your guild , you know what they are capable of so you always know what to tell them . with pugs , there are a lot of probabilities with them  are they upleveled ? because they might not survive the first clash . are they here just for the karma  xp  loot ? then they won ' t follow instructions if you tell them to " stack " , " blast statics  might " , and so on and so forth because they would be like , " whatever man let ' s get this over with "

6. my duo is incredibly good on combat pro , and id say he is better than me on builder pro . you just need to adapt to combat like he did , he pretty much knows by nature what buttons to press . usually on cp players tend to misbuild and panic . i can say you do definitely make less mistakes on bp . if you think your building is good just work on your aim . being the best builder doesn  t mean you are the best player
