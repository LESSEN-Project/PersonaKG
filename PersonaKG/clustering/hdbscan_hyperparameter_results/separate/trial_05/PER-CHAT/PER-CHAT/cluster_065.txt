9. if you are connected to internet i believe you get regular drops the only non tradable drops possible are handed out gold wrench for example which don ' t appear at this time , and achievements

10. no , it is not , but either way , this is a big step forward for google and the smartphone industry as a whole with apple out of the question because of their proprietary approach .
