2. here are some of mine  although not particularly scary , still pretty terrifying when you think about it . the " big bounce " theory what it states is that if the big bang occurred from nothing , then there will be no changing factor to make a difference in what is created when it happens . this means that when our universe ends and another is created , it will be created in the exact same way , with the exact same galaxies , planets , species and so on . if this is true , our entire universe is in an endless cycle of creating and destroying itself , and you will be born into every universe , endlessly . reminds me of this quote from the book the wheel of time   the wheel of time turns , and ages come and pass , leaving memories that become legend . legend fades to myth , and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again .  i ' ve read something about a " 4th dimension theory " a while back . ever played 2d games like terraria ? noticed how they cannot see anything besides fron what ' s front and behind of them ? well , it ' s basically the same thing with us . digit dimensional characters can ' t see us , but we can see them because we are digit dimensional . now , imagine if there ' s a 4th dimension . something so foreign to us , we cannot comprehend what it is . imagine if there are 4th dimensional beings who we cannot see or interact with , but they can see us . they ' re always there , watching us without our knowledge . and we can ' t do shit about it because we can ' t see them . and they ' re just sitting there observing and shit . i think that explains the goosebumbs we get when we feel someone is watching us despite being alone . i mean , what if god is a 4th dimensional being ? not really a theory , but just thought that has been nagging me for a while . i don ' t know what ' s scarier . the thought that we ' re alone in this universe or not . the thought of a species foreign to us existing somewhere we don ' t know yet is unnerving . or maybe we are alone , floating in an empty vast of dead space . arthur clark once said " either we are alone in the universe or we are not . both are equally terrifying " and here ' s something i thought about while i was high . what if there are humans in other planets ? terrifying thought . i mean shit , the scariest thing that we could find in space would be humans because you ' re not expecting it . i mean , imagine this . you have built the world ' s first most powerful telescope in existence . you ' re alone in your lab and you ' re thinking of testing that shit out because you ' re proud of your accomplishment . you try lenses on and you look up into the sky . you see a planet at the edge of the galaxy and you notice a strange figure standing in a weird looking structure . curious , you adjust the lens and focus , and then bam . there is a human scientist using their own telescope identical to yours and they ' re looking back right at you . what are yours ?

3. it would be overwhelming to articulate this subject , martin w ball does the best job at it look up your mate tom podcast with martin , one quote of martins there is just reality as it is  a unified being of infinite awareness that is playing with itself as an expression of itself . everything and everyone in all places and times is merely god interacting with itself , and it is you .

10. i get stuck in a place with no dimensions , it  s just darkness around me . i can see things , but can  t tell how far away they are because i have no frame of reference for their size . it  s really hard to explain . it  s almost like floating , but i have a feeling of being heavy , almost weighed down by something . i guess the best way to explain it would be emptiness , with an occasional object in the distance ?

11. digit weeks ago i got cross faded and became unresponsive . i entered what we dubbed  the abyss  and it was the scariest place  feeling i have ever experienced . it was basically like the place in get out or like being in a dark closet where you can hear everything but cant move or speak .

16. this isn ' t an answer , but i would like to have a time  machine so i could spectate any moment in history i would want . i said spectate because everything i would do in the past , even my presence , would influence the presentthe future . now , the answer is  battle of stalingrad or crucification of jesus .
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

17. that our universe is limitless . it never ends . we ' re floating in a small piece of rock floating in a never ending space where time means little . but one day , all of this will be lost . our species will die off , and the universe won ' t care because we are nothing but a small glitch in a vast world full of cosmic wonders that makes our small piece land we call earth seem small . the universe will die off someday , and it ' ll come when we least expect it . maybe tomorrow , maybe next week , or maybe a few years from now , who knows . the universe and everything you know will disappear and you can ' t do anything to stop it .
