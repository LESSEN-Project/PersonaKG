   (ID: eca32d278abf2524af02edbb3cc3041ed8b0b880)

2. not american either , and sure , sanders would have been a better option than any other candidate . as far as unemployment , i will admit i have not seen data about it however , i seriously doubt it ' s been lowered significantly without useless spending from the government . i personally don ' t see a problem with oppressing people who have done bad things before or believe in white supremacy . not sure what is the other type of oppression you mean . why do you believe people should own firearms ? do you seriously not believe there is danger associated with that ? what is this islam problem you are talking about exactly ? if it ' s extremism , it ' s really not exclusive to crazy people with islamic beliefs . this problem is due to mentally unstable people misinterpreting their religion and brainwashing uneducated people . have you ever had a real conversation with a muslim ? what is your honest opinion about how sweden should be handling muslim immigrants ? last thing , do you not see any problem with blatant lying to the press and population ?

3. it ' s funny that you have this ego centric idea that everyone that disagrees with you is a whiny snowflake baby , and you , the one that supports a reality tv star known for being a whiny baby , are somehow the superior man . i seem to remember a whole eight years of crying when obama was in office . the media did to him much worse than what ' s happening with trump . trump is literally just giving fuel for the fire . and honestly , i think of him as a distraction from actual governing . he acts out more when important things happening . i ' m crying not from dispair , but from laughter . you think he ' ll get a second term . now i ' m gonna sit back and wait for the ' beta cuck ' insults to start rolling in

4. as someone who stays outside the usa i can honestly say that i ' m not even surprised any time he says things like this any more . i should be shocked or embarrassed for him but i ' m way beyond that .

5. you should see his previous speeches where he essentially generalized the population of mexico as a bunch of rapists , murderers , and thieves . i can ' t figure out the exact reason , but this has to be a smoke screen . someone , somewhere is doing something diabolical , but we ' re fixated on trump and what he will say next . tl  dr illuminaughty touched my body .

6. lmao , yeah i ' m not racist , but fuck africa . just get rid of it , it ' s not needed !

7. im liberal and i dont bealive that solution for europe is just to welcome more and more refugees . we have to cure the cause not the consequences . i also bealive in death penalty . a serial killer is just a burden for a society .
   (ID: 11d16c1ced94665eed03bc34f590f8fafeed40d2)

8. could his terrible decision making and chronic lying and inordinate greed and hate mongering not infect every aspect of life in america ? i will stop talking about that guy and will actually stop thinking about him forever when he is in jail where he belongs . frankly , the fact that a person could commit this many freaking felonies with zero repercussions and still have people saying , " ew , can we just stop talking about him " let alone actual supporters denying that he is a con man and a criminal are a lot more remarkable to me than the fact that his behavior comes up every time the topic is " something stupid " or " something evil " or " something that needs to be changed  fixed " people who actually like america should be talking about it more . it will already take decades for us to repair the damage he ' s done so far . so yeah , he might come up in conversation proportionate to his impact on the world . if you would rather live in a place where nobody feels safe offering their opinion on politics , you could move to china .

9. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

10. what country is he the president of ?
   (ID: 130fa156e7a286a021dcdff2492d6048231cb82f)

11. amlo is just another stooge that protects and propagates the interests of transnational capital . he provides cover and a nice veneer while the capitalists go in and loot the natural resources , markets and labor of the country . much in the style of an obama or trudeau . i have no idea why you think anyone would care what time the asshole wakes up at and why you find this at all admirable . it ' s funny you would leave out the chavistas and maduro . why do you have such little political imagination ? why do you think your liberal tendencies are at all permissible in this sub ? are you another one of these white latin american men that has no problem stomping on the rights of indigenous peoples so long as capital accumulation processes can go on unabated ?
