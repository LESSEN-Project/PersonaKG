1. ever country shows certain degree of hypocrisy . when there are so many people in a single country , long term rational decisions are tough to take as humans tend to give more weightage to short term experiences while making decisions . also in democracy leader who want to come to power again , it ' s easier to take actions which seems sweet for short term . that migrant worker construction  worker most probably , isn ' t gonna vote .

3. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .

5. we all have those moments . even as a citizen there will be times that i hate my country . when it feels like nobody gives a fuck about you or your problems and struggles , you start to resent them for it .

6. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .

7. so frustrating , we know all this , we know how the system works , how politics works , how nothing will change because those in a position to make a change get paid not to , and yet people won ' t rise up , we need to start a fucking revolt !

8. depends on how patriotic you are . for example , there ' s some people who live here who hate america , and are ashamed of it . on the other hand , there ' s people who would die for this country , and get happy  teary eyed when they hear the national anthem .
