1. he must have been curious to see how big he can get this thing i don  t understand how that could happen unless it was on purpose . he also seems to know how to operate that thing too .

2. if it was just someone ' s eyes and you immediately start jumping to conclusions they are digit  depressed youd be wrong . but that ' s not what i ' m saying and that ' s not what happened . he literally said he was looking for a reason to kill himself in the title of the post . that combined with physical expression can give us enough information to go ahead and act on the side of caution . if you enjoy looking for tiny cracks in things good for you but what happened in that thread is a really good thing that shows how good humanity and the internet can be . to me it seems ridiculous to try and want to pick it apart for any reason .

3. not really . i always assume everything is fake until proven otherwise  in this case , on a personal level , it doesn ' t effect the sadness of it .
