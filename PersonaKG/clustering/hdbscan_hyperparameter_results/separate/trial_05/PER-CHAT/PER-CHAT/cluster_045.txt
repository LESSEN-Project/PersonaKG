1. people hate trenders because it takes a legitimate and real identity and crap we  re born with and turns it into a game . being transgender isn  t fun . dysphoria isn  t fun , even if your dysphoria isn  t that bad . i didn  t choose to be born like this , i would never choose to suffer like i have speaking of personal experience only . dysphoria sucks ass and it genuinely upsets me when i see girls trying take something that  s been a real challenge for me and thousands of others and turn it into a fun little game . i really don  t understand why you  re defending trenders . they  re literally just cisgender people trying to get some oppression points . they aren  t people genuinely questioning their gender because they aren  t in this category , people who can  t transition in any way , etc . they  re taking a label and exploiting it for their own personal gain . they  re going to one day change their mind and then the consequences are left to those who are actually transgender . if you want to see in a difference situation and circumstance why trenders are doing more negative than positive , then i  ll give you one . the people who are sad for a few days and say  i  m depressed  . the people who are a little nervous and say they have an anxiety disorder . or , those people who like cleanness and order and say they have ocd . we all know that mental disorders stem from the mind just like being transgender , our brains don  t align with our birth sex . you can  t choose to have a mental disorder you don  t choose to be trans , you choose to transition yes but you are born transgender . the people who label themselves as such when they have the littlest of symptoms are doing more negative than anything . same goes for here . girls who like boy clothes  etc . aren  t transgender . or those girls who are little or very masculine . just because they don  t like their boobs doesn  t mean they  re transgender . plenty of women don  t like their breasts . for transmen , it  s not only that they don  t like the lumps on their chest  it  s that it  s supposed to be a male chest than a female . our brains are telling us that it  s supposed to be a male chest , but our anatomy is giving us something else . then that  s when dysphoria kicks in and so on . the brain section is actual scientific fact . not some principle . there  s evidence of transgender people  s brains not aligning to their assigned sex . my brain is similar to my father , not my mother , because of the slight differences between the two brains . we are having a discussion here . i haven  t told any trender anything nor spoke to one and said anything bad . there  s no actual way i can ever  police  anyone  s identity . having an opinion is not policing . i  m not gate keeping either . i wouldn  t say this to an actual trender because i  d say it in a completely different way .

3. i . had no idea this was a thing . i am digit  a cat person . is this why some people are so aggressively proud of liking dogs more than cats ? i always used to wonder why people are so keen to shove that in my face .

4. how cute , you think you know a thing about what people go through . try being bullied and shunned to an extent at digit different schools , 3rd grade until i went to college . oh , and you would all collectively call me a normie because i have an intimate relationship . don ' t assume you know a damn thing about any person who posts here because you simply dont .

5. i think they ' re just not putting up with people ' s shit anymore . at this point it ' s like " i am who i am some fuck you if you don ' t like it ! " they just people to stop treating them like shit for it .

6. to be fair i kind of find it interesting . being a straight furry is like being gay in the world . we ' re made fun of , some people ignore us very small minority , but still , and its very difficult to find people you can relate to . so you won ' t find solice here . it ' s the world upside down and its sometimes fun to see what would the world be with lgbt being the majority . i know it can sometimes suck , but hey , being a furry is a choice unlike race or in some cases , arguably , your attraction . you have to put up with all the bullshit , but you can quit at any time .
