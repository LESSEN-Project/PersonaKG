1. ask him if there ' s anything he wants you to help him with . i ' m sure his doctors have given him plenty of information . diet and exercise are part of the usual therapy prescribed so maybe you can partner with him on one or both of those . you can ' t force him to do anything and sometimes suggestions aren ' t that welcome but support usually is . if the idea is his .

2. i  m sorry i can  t offer some kind of fix all solution for you . it  s a tragic thing  years later and my mother  s still stuck in her old ways . the only thing you can do for them is try to be supportive . as i learned , though , some people . they really just don  t want to get better . it  s a sad life to live , and it hurts to see , but there truly isn  t much you can do . patience is key , and if they can truly find it in themselves to seek a better life , then they will  it may take days or it may take years . overall , it  s just a question of ,  is it worth it ?  do you truly want to stick around through thick and thin , then the answer is yes . unfortunately , i believe you  re already doing all you can by being a supportive friend . maybe he  s not quite as far gone as my mother was , and a family  friend intervention could at least get the wheels turning ? other than that , i regret to say that i have no advice . best of luck xx

5. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him
