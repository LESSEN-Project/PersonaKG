1. no , the short  term outlook is that capitalism is doing fine and working as designed . sure , class antagonisms are becoming more pronounced and contradictions are heightening but the capitalists are doing fine . there may be an upcoming " market correction " or recession , but recessions are fine and sometimes good for capitalists . workers lose a lot during recessions , e . g . they ' ll accept worse working conditions , worse contracts , etc but the same is not necessarily true for capitalists . recessions serve as an excellent disciplinary device of the labor market and just because you ' re struggling , doesn ' t mean the capitalists are struggling as well . with respect to the socio  political institutions , sure there is some intermittent turbulence but they remain relatively stable , e . g . the democratic party of the u . s . is collaborating with the other major political party and serving as a bulwark against the more radical  progressive wing of their own party . capitalism is amazing at constantly reinventing itself , swallowing old contradictions and creating new ones their wake .

5. i would say that has some truth to it . shows and movies are getting more realistic and we realize that life doesn  t always have a happy ending but there  s still a story to be told . if look back to  50s   80s , almost every movie that depicts the future was very vibrant and colorful and everyone was happy . but in today  s cinema every time we see the future on screen it  s dark and dismal and destroyed . something to think about
