1. i don ' t believe the earth is flat . let ' s just establish this . but what is the explanation for people who do ? a is it some deep digit dimensional digit dimensional , digit dimensional , other dimensional , warped energy kind of view that would imply that everything is kind of on one flat spectrum of reality and matter sort of deal ? extending to the universe and consciousness etc ? not just talking about the actual physical earth but more like some kind of perception of it ? like some deep kind of belief system behind it ? or b do they actually believe that if you were to walk long enough there would be an end to the physical earth that we live on and that the " sides " aren ' t connected ? like you could get to australia and say thats where the edge was , but then to get to nz you would have to travel across the world again to the other side ? because if it is a i could possibly excuse them and probe more about some kind of dimensional and consciousness explanation and possibly keep an open mind but if it is b iv got not a clue what they are thinking . let ' s remind us all again  i don ' t think the world is flat . at least not the one we live in on a daily reality basis ! lol !

2. yes i can but you will probably make fun of me if i say it . i use my senses . it gets me through a lot of things in life and not just listening to the ' smart ' people that try to get me to believe something that they want me to believe in . when i look around the world i can see that it is flat . i have never ever seen anything with my own eyes that makes me think the earth is round . that ' s why i believe that the earth is flat .

4. same here . my study of religion led me to conclude they were all manmade . the way that i see it we all have certain drives for meaning , for purpose , for morals and certain emotional needs getting over the fear of death , wanting to reconnect with dead loved ones , wanting a sense of meaning in life , etc . and religions each navigate a way in which they can fulfill these human desires . and i think that the religions out there today are still in existence because partially they tended to fulfill these the best .

5. heaven is everything you ever wanted , a feeling of contentment . hell is all your worst nightmares and fears replaying over and over again for eternity . essentially brazil with more lava and less palm trees .

6. you ' re asking the real questions . the fact that fire isn ' t real is the way we know the sun is flat .

7. honestly , i don ' t know . i ' m agnostic myself so i believe that there ' s just no way we can be sure of anything one way or the other . i wish i could suspend my sense of reality enough to fully believe in a heaven . i would seriously love to just know for sure i was going to see my grandma again one day .

8. after personally experiencing dmt , i am very convinced that there is an afterlife . when you are at this place , you have memories of before you were a human . try to take back those memories with you is like forgetting a dream .

9. i ' m not an atheist either but the more i learn about space , the more i can ' t believe that our earth was created the way the bible says . because w t f there are over digit billion galaxies in space that we know of . the bible has all these answers about how god created everything and our one planet and who even wrote those ? are they oc or were they added by one of the million people who have translated  rewritten a bible ? but has nothing to say about the massive expanse full of billions of other galaxies that stretches further than any one person could travel in their lifetime ? i wonder if i ' ll ever figure it out .

10. you get to be a ghost for a while , then its lights out . but i only believe this because i find it comforting to believe there ' s something non  permanent after death .
