1. oof , as a woman i suggest you not to spoil women that much , some of us get used to get all we want and then it ' s really hard to get on track again . not my case , i made clear to my boyfriend we are equal and he can count on me as much as i can count on him . i suggest you to talk to her and give her an ultimatum , you should take care of her but she ' s abusing it and not thanking what you do for her . obviously you need to change this , and don ' t have any kids for now , neither more pets or expenses . that wouldn ' t be good for the kids or you .

2. ahhhhh . that  s not okay . i mean i get that there are stay at home moms and all the power to them , but to rely on someone to keep you fed and clothed and then treat them like shit . i am a stay at home mom . who works a full time job out of our home as well as a part time job for a family member  s business . i might not have lunch packed for him every day , but he has food to eat and a decently clean house and love and respect  which i also have . it  s kinda sad for your ex wife tho  she hasn  t been able to let go and enjoy her life because she  s too busy being a shit .

3. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

4. sounds like she  s too shallow to understand your pov and what you  ve been through . personally , that trait alone could make or break a relationship for me .

5. long ass post but i ' ve read every single word of it . congrats on your successful transformation . leave while you can . you are still young and have a long way ahead of you . i really hate manipulative person and hope you find a better person . but i would suggest telling her about the divorce in advance if you don ' t want to hurt her too bad but even then , you wouldn ' t know what type of shit she ' ll pull . it ' s going to get better from now !

6. you know , i  ve been at that point in my life where i wondered why i had so many failed relationships . but then i realized all of them had one thing in common . me . there  s a reason why we pick the partners we do . go to counseling because you want to be the best you that you can be , not because she made the call . go for you . i hope you do it .

7. cut your loss and move on . obviously easier said than done but sitting around wondering what you did wrong , why she would do that , etc . is only going to make the hurt last longer . just do your best to forget about it and maybe try something easy like tinder to keep you distracted . you don ' t need to use it for sex or anything unless you want to but talking to girls on there is super easy . keeps me distracted when i am hung up on someone .
