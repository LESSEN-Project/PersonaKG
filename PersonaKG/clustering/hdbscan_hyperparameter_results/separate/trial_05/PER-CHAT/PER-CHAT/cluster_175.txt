SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 32

1. digit you don  t have to meet him if you don  t want to . lots of people never really get closure , and that sucks , but really what is the goal here anyways ? you could easily exchange longer messages over email or something and give him closure that way . digit why are you so concerned about the image he has of you ? are you hoping that something will be rekindled ? otherwise i feel shattering that image that he has of you will probably just help him move on and you won  t have to hear from the ex again . digit even if you do meet up , you don  t actually have to reveal any information about yourself that you don  t want to . just keep it vague . there  s nothing wrong with just broadly answering  i  m taking out some time to figure out my life , i  ve grown out of x interest  etc . if the subject of what you  re doing these days comes up .

2. i don  t have any words of wisdom i am just sending a hug . that must have been so painful for you and i understand how hurt you are on so many levels . i am sorry you had to hear such unkind , untrue and vile words . hold your heart close , let it beat , you deserve love and you deserve better than an ignorant , spiteful woman .

3. if you are trying to make witty comments , wear shirts that look nice , and make eye contact with other people at work , that is called socializing . if you are intimately touching , kissing , or attempting to see this person outside of work or work related functions then you are crossing a line . reassure your boyfriend about your attraction to him by telling and showing him . tell him gently and lovingly that he has no reason not to trust you , and you hope he can figure out a way to do that . then let him work on his trust issues . you are not in charge of his emotions . if he can ' t learn to trust you , a relationship evaluation is in order .

4. the other comments are kind of mean . you aren ' t obligated to be friends with anyone and it doesn ' t seem like you guys are being mean to him . as long as you continue to be polite you won ' t be an asshole . i also don ' t think its clique  y to have a group of friends you regularly hang out with . i would just continue to be polite , and maybe if he keeps signing up for your breaks say that " actually his name , we usually all eat lunch together . we aren ' t asking for you to switch the time you take your break at all ! but because only x amount of people are allowed break at once , could we coordinate a little better so that i can still eat with your friend ' s names ? "

5. i  m sorry this is happening to you . i know how this feels and i can tell you it  s never good to have a crush on your best friend . i hope things work out for you .
   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

6. if you just kind of brushed him off at first or just nervously laughed you ' re kind of screwed . he thinks he ' s " wearing you down " at this point . just tell him no and do not explain why . just say no . if he doesn ' t get the message , it may be time to talk to your supervisor about it .

7. oh jeez . honestly . my recent ex has said so many horrible things to me not one sticks out on my mind anymore . just the most recent horrible things . the last thing he said before i blocked him on everything was that my therapist was being paid to be nice to me . one thing that stands out the most . he called my rape " what you did " . he calls it " what you did to me " . he said that because of it i was vile and disgusting and he says that i need to take responsibility for it . he also posted it all online only he changed it to make it seem like i was cheating on him . and he said that digit  of the memories he has of me in the last five years are filled with misery . when i tell him what he ' s saying is absolutely horrible he responds by telling me that i ' m being disrespectful . and that i dont know how wrong i am . he said i shouldn ' t be allowed to be in a relationships with anyone . i don ' t deserve it . that he feels sorry for me because i dont have any sensibility . he even went as far as to play the popular card . everyone likes him better . blah blah . its all really horrible stuff . hes lucky that i dont believe him because that stuff can really break a person . i mean really break someone . theres so many other things . digit years worth of horrible things . i didn ' t realize how bad they were back then though . i think back then i believed them . now i dont because i know hell say just about anything to make me feel worthless .

8. he was trying to wife you i bet . also out of curiosity . how old are you and what ' s your " number " if you had to guess . i ' d like to guage what you think is more than your fair share compared to mine
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

9. i learnt that one of my closest recent friends digit months just wanted to go out with me   we ' re in a weird place now

10. well heres my opinion , the guys probably very paranoid of you cheating on him , im not saying you would but thats what it looks like . heres what you need to do , if you want to stay with him id explain how hes the one and hes over reacting . tell him that you need some breathing room to do whatever you want but that youll always come back home to him . you should only unblock the guy when he understands to give you space . if you feel like things arent working out anymore because of trust then youd definitely be in the right to break up with him . thats what id do atleast

11. i always arrive super early to stuff because i  m anxious about being late , so i got to starbucks like digit minutes early . this is obviously just a casual coffee date , i met the guy online , wanted to get to know him irl . i order a drink and sit down to wait on my laptop . the guy arrives digit minutes early and comes to greet me and asks if i want a drink . i say no because i already have one . he suddenly gets really upset he can  t buy me a drink . keeps asking me to let him buy one , or even weirder , kept offering to give me money for the one i already paid for ? i just keep saying no , it  s alright , i  m a grown woman lol . so he gets a drink and kinda sulks for the rest of the date , like keeps giving one word answers , doesn  t ask me anything . as soon as i finished my drink he asked to buy me one and i said i actually needed to leave . it was just bizarre .

12. you . you got what i neeeeed but you say he ' s just a friend
   (ID: 7ed1ff576cc7dc77750ed5f15461eb3ccdb52a7a)

13. so he is name  calling and spreading gossip ? that tells you a lot about the person he is . it doesn ' t say anything about you . just be honest about what happened .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

14. sorry man , but he has a gf already so you can ' t do anything about that . you need to let go and just respect his decision .
   (ID: ab38d3f31156c0cca1babe826c83025e8694eca2)

15. i ' m curious about this too . its a lose lose situation . say some guy comes and asks for it back since you didn ' t want it . he takes it . now another bigger guy comes up to your cell after that and says where ' s my candy bar ? and you tell him you gave it to somebody else who said they gave it to you . now he ' s like i don ' t beleive you , you ate it and you are my girlfriend now . or possibility number digit . dude comes asking how you liked his gift . you politely decline it and then he gets offended you didn ' t want it . or refuses to take it back . and still makes you his girlfriend . man i ' m to small of a dude to go to prison . i need to learn how to make shanks
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

16. he is trying to pimp you out . i suggest you tell him that his friend can ' t come over anymore . you need to put your foot down because if you don ' t , your going to be sleeping with all of his buddies and whomever else .

17. " riley " i ' m sorry your day turned to shit . the crappy thing about fear is that it isn ' t always rational and when caught off guard it is difficult to act rationally anyway . i had a similar experience a few years ago which helped me decide i was buying a car so i didn ' t have to wait at bus stops and i have the guy half of my land line number and the other half of my cell . to this day i wonder why i didn ' t just say no . or maybe i did and he insisted . i cast it as a lesson learned for the future . sadly he got on the same bus as me and i got got off and doubled back to another route .

18. i used to date a guy that would do this to me all the time , as petty as it sounds i would purposely not make plans to hang out and when he  d ask to hangout i  d say that i already made plans with a guy bff . only took a little while for him to start paying attention again . also a push up bra helps

19. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

20. don ' t talk to that guy any more dating is hard
