1. well lets don  t be defensive now im not fighting for if minecraft is bad or not but i think its a experience that every child needs to experience but there are better ones for us now . and no i have been playing the game for years and tried the last one too . but im a creative person for commands and buildings so idk about the survival part .

3. it depends . if you have friends with the forest , it ' s really fun . doom is more fast  paced and difficult comparatively .

4. nah the only challenging monster is behemoth and it ' s only because of the weird mechanics . great game don ' t get me wrong on of my top picks of the year , but compared to mhgu that came out on the switch it just doesn ' t hold a candle to the amount of content .

5. i think its fun to find a corner of the map and gun down as many as i can until the storm comes . especially when theres challenges and cool rewards involved . i never play the base game normally so i never faced any of the problems everyone else was having . i just think its fun shooting guys which im not good enough to do normally

6. man i wish i didn ' t get so motion sick playing pavlov . this looks awesome . i ' ve found that if i jog in place while i ' m moving i can stave off the sickness for a while but it does catch up to me . otherwise i ' d be playing all the time .

7. lol ! i liked it a lot , especially the sense of isolation and vulnerability you had playing as a regular soldier rather than a spartan . it also reminded me a bit of metroid prime , which is one of my all  time favorite games .

8. oh , totally . that level is spookier than most any survival horror game i ' ve played

9. all of them are as weird as each other to be honest . it ' s just the newer ones that seem weirder because nobody grew up with that particular set of myths .

10. well i liked it . but then i have been replaying the game this week !

11. i beat this game in one night a few months back for old time ' s sake . one of the best nostalgia trips ever .
   (ID: c378ee827fb7d26c7ea685ec1dc451bf264b0151)

12. i have not played the first game . but i hear the second one is a massive improvement over the second one . it has gotten some pretty nice reviews .

13. i see what you mean . i ' ve never played reach ' s multiplayer so i can ' t say much about the problems you mentioned , though they do seem pretty bad . personally my main draws were more from the single player modes , especially campaign . i thought the alien invasion story was actually quite good , since it showed how massive and powerful the covenant was , and how ill  equipped the humans really were to fight them . it was definitely more grounded and military  based than the other games , but i personally liked that sense of desperation and scale the setting gave off .
