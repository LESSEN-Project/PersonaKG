1. my friend was in a similar situation . his parents are british but they moved to south africa and had him there , so although he is a uk citizen he wasn ' t classified as a local student for the purpose of uni fees . you could always try germany . you could study for free at public german universities as an undergraduate . good luck !

3. i am the first in my family to go to college . i did ok but should have done much better . my dad worked to pay off my school through a small business he started . he paid until junior year when he got cancer . at that point i got loans . i came out of school with about  19k in debt . not bad but not zero . that seems like a small amount of debt but i hustled for digit years throwing everything extra i had at it . then i got married . i hated that i brought that burden on my wife . you never know what may be coming . will your car break down ? will you get  keep a job ? will you have tremendous medical needs ? you can get hit by a bus like anyone else . my advice is this . go to community college and get an associates degree as cheaply as possible . then go to college for your bachelors degree in a field you like may not love and that has some demand . if you do that you  ll never worry about a job . good luck

4. i  ve said it before but treat college like a digit houweek job and you  ll do well academically . you  re about to get a ton of time and that can make you think you can do it later . make a schedule . do digit hours a day of studying , writing , and assignments and you  ll do fine .

5. does it have potential to make money tho ? my own biggest regret is going to uni . i recon if you could make money without studying you ' re better off working cause in ten years what ' s gonna matter , you or your family ?

6. so people who earn great wealth should not be able to pass that on to their kids ? isn ' t that one of the main reasons we work so hard , to make a better life for our kids ?

7. more context is needed . it  s not uncommon living with your parents in countries with weak economies . many times , entry jobs don  t pay nearly enough for someone to self sustain

8. if it bothers you that much , think about it more like this  your parents are rich , you ' re not . you don ' t have to take their money if it makes you uncomfortable . if you ' re old enough to move out go for it . tell em you want to succeed on your own merits , then try it .

9. i ' m going to say the same thing i say in every thread  the driving test is , by definition , a test . to prepare for it , do the thing you do for any test and study only the material you are going to be tested on . that info should come with a little booklet you got from the dmv when you got your learners permit , and outlines everything you need to know on it . if you get any one of the things outlined in the booklet wrong , its probably a demerit towards you passing . good luck !

10. i would definitely say for you to go for it , however i would try something other than minecraft at first . minecrafts popularity on yt has gone way down and it would be better off to start with something else that is a bit more popular . like beamng or something . but it is your call on what you want to start out with .

11. what are you studying ? if it ' s not something you can take to the marketplace and secure a job right away because of your education you may be wasting your time and money . also , if you are going deep in debt for your education beware .
