3. maybe you are dating the wrong kind of guys . no , not all . not all guys are even remotely the same . not all men are even aggressive at all . maybe digit in digit are aggressive enough to pitch a shitfit these two . you managed to find them both . this isn  t something wrong with you , it  s something wrong with them . overly aggressive men also tend to be passionate and whimsical . it can kind of  sweep you off of your feet  . they also might make you feel  safe  because their possessiveness feels like you are being protected . in reality , they are the ones that you need to be protected from . just about any grocery bagger or cab driver would do better . have someone hook you up with a mutual friend that is not your type and give it a whirl . this is the type of advice that i would give my daughter , and i  m not saying any of this to be mean . last time i gave this kind of advice i got a lot of nasty replies . i mean , what does a man know about men , right ? this is for the op .
