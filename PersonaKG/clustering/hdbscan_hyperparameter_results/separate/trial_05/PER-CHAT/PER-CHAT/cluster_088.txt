1. i think buying a large rv and just driving around the country would be cool . but not just going to tourist areas . i ' d want to see how different people live differently . that or work a bunch of different jobs to get an inside on how things work eg . be a care salesman for a month so learn how to buy a car better

2. it really depends on where you live . some places require behind the wheel experience prior to getting a license , and the amount varies . do you live in a city with public transportation ? do you have friends or access to uber to get around ? what about a bicycle ? i would recommend trying to calmly talk to your parents about these things . maybe let them know that you do not want to move out the day you turn digit , but you will need certain freedoms to agree to stay . please don ' t speak angrily or sound like a threat . just explain what you want and listen to their side . maybe you can get a compromise .

3. thank you ! i  m in my digit  s  when i was a teen i moved by myself from a place you don  t need to know how to drive to another city where you don  t need to drive . i  m just now getting the motivation to learn , so i can eventually go wherever i want !

4. well the moc only helps you with getting trade prices for gunrunning vehicles and the bunker unupgraded doesn ' t make you any money if you buy supplies , you just break even , not even considering staff cost , so your best bet is to make around 2million and buy the equipment and staff upgrades and then you will make 135k each time you buy suppliesthe staff will cost more tho , but that shouldn ' t be a big problem

5. there are many alternatives to driving , and to say you can ' t afford not to drive is ridiculous unless you live outside of the city or the commute is immensely far .   x200b  biking is a great alternative , you will have to leave home a bit earlier but you can avoid the traffic so in some casesdepending on where you live it can save you quite a bit of time . obviously you need to take conditions into account but there are many snow rated bikes and clothing that people take advantage of .   x200b  public transportation is in every city and whether it be a bus or train there is a way to get from one end of the city to the next . i know it ' s easier said than done but if you can wake up a bit earlier it can save you the headache of totaling your vehicle .   x200b  again , depending on where you live there are many transportation apps like uber that are fairly reasonable and even if you just need them to get you over a certain bridge or past a certain point and you can walk the rest of the way is great .   x200b

7. first of all , the night before have all your running stuff out and ready to go , runners , and all of your clothes . i would suggest putting your phone or alarm somewhere where you have to stand up to grab it and turn it off . it took me a while to get accustom to getting out of my bed in the morning but i promise you get used to it . your body is also just warming up and blood needs to flow so stretching is a must , maybe start at a walking pace , leg raises e . t . c . as for where to run , honestly when i first started i couldnt run very long and i went a few blocks over and turned around , sort of did a loop . once i got comfortable with that i ran every side street , up and down until i got to the end , then came back . i started doing it in reverse , then i expanded out of my neighborhood . its good to change up the scenery to avoid getting bored . now i run all over my city and i love it . for winter its a bit tricky but do your best to work with what you have , use an old jacket to avoid sweating and sticking up your nice one , use old sweaters and a scarf . i used normal running shoes and slipped a couple times but hey , get back up and keep going , you ' ll be okay . roads are usually more clear than sidewalks . once you have money for a membership just go to treadmills , i know that will be 100x better in winters . try and help your mom out around the house , shovel the walk e . t . c in exchange for a gym membership . but please remember to always always always stretch , it will help in the long runpun intended .

8. beyond how much money you need , there are some other things to think about . furniture  don  t try to move furniture across the country . look for a furnished place to rent  first , or better yet , stay with family at 1st . you  re barely going to be there anyways . clothes  take your favorite outfits , and enough to get through about a month without washing clothes . you aren  t going to have time . your favorites just because i already know that while you won  t wear them again , you aren  t ready to get rid of them just yet . stuff  ditch it , unless it  s something you want to save forever . money  not enough information in your post . are you looking to get your own place when you get there , or can you crash at family  friends house for a few months ? you  re going to make more money than you have time to spend once you get started . you  ll be able to get a really nice place in just a few months , but you won  t be there much .

9. if the foundations of your house crumbled , would you just say  fuck it  and remain there ? if you live a while away from the jobs , borrow the money to buy a secondhand bicycle and ride it to the nearest town , and to see your friends . the littlest steps are often the biggest . you  ll get there , i know it  s difficult , but you can get it .

10. watching documentaries , listening to lectures , and researching topics that are of interest to me . the same things i spend my time doing now but i ' d have an expensive apartment , wear expensive clothes , etc .
   (ID: 22f14b68675078048f36403bb14291f2d10864a3)

11. exactly the same as i do now . i do what i do because it ' s right , not for reward .
