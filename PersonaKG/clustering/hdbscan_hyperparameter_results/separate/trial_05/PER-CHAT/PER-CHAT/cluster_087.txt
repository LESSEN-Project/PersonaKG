1. hypothetically . would you really need to launder it if there  s not more  illegal  money coming in ? cause you  d have to use some of it for a front to actually launder it . but why not just keep it in cash ?

2. wouldn  t the accounts receivable of banks be completely thrown off though ? the banks would simply be wrecked financially and the federal reserve requirement eventually . someone would make money off of the hedging the risk but i would think that ultimately banks would lose millions if not billions in accounts receivable . hell if it actually happened i don  t think the us would have serious consequences . i think it could happen if everyone started to default on there loans alone .

3. you know what would happen you said to all of the billionaires " hey big bank account boys i ' m going to need to you to hand over everything you have so that overall you ' re only able to be worth digit million dollars " they would say " alright let me just get that to you right after i move all of my assets to another country that ' s not going to steal my money and possessions that i earned , oh wait a minute now that i have my assets and myself out of the country you cant tax me and you ' re now losing millions in tax revenue "

5. more like nothing will come of it even if they doanything . what can a poor person actually do ? i struggle to buy ramen noodles . you think any politican is gonna listen to me compared to the poeple bribing them ? no amount of angry phone calls will do shit . what am i supposed to do walk to washington and picket infront of the white house ? that will also solve nothing . the people in power get to make all the choices . we can vote , and i do , but that obviously does nothing in the long run when things are this bad . digit . digit percent just apathetic my ass .

6. as much as this would be great , it  s still a lot of money . as if we already don  t get robbed every paycheck anyways yknow ? granted there are things our taxes go to that , aren  t really beneficial . but it  d be a rough time i think . what about you ?
