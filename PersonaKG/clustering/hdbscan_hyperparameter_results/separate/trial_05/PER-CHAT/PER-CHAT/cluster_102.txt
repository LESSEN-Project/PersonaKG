3. depends on where your mind is at the time . how was your day ? are you happy ? sad ? angry ? how much acid ? what kind of trip are you looking to have ? have you ever dropped acid before ? are you an experienced cosmonaut ? there ' s nothing wrong with dropping acid alone at digit pm . as long as you are doing the drug and the drug isn ' t doing you
