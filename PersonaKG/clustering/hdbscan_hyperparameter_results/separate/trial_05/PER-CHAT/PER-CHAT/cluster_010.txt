2. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

4. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .

5. youre probably just paranoid . you dont even notice the mistakes you make . going to the same position each round , doing something " obvious " . most of the time you dont even need to know where someone is cus its obvious . if you face a wallhacker you can still outaim him . however if the guy has an aimbot it doesnt matter if he sees you or not . he just holds down lmb and you die
