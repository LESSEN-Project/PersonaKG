1. One of my favorite things is /new.
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

2. i think it  s just a weird trend to place things there . i can understand why they did it .
   (ID: 74d9c413c2cf59d223d7510b599edf6b6b1df3a2)

3. doing something reasonable ? you ' re on a rant subreddit , if you don ' t want people whining perhaps you should unsub

4. i work in product development and while i haven ' t had any moral dilemmas nearly as big as these , there are often issues to consider . what if i can design a better widget , but our factory can ' t produce it so we would have to outsource it ? consumer gets a better product , profit margin might even be higher , but we decrease internal production and hurt other employees . it is kind of funny how the phrasing of this could cause reddit to hate or love it . stifling innovation seems to clearly be a bad thing , but there is tons of hate when people hear about companies that close their factories and produce goods elsewhere . if your new product is different enough , it is possible that the current factory can ' t be modified to produce it without basically gutting the whole place . even then your workforce has no experience producing the new item , so if you want good quality right away , outsourcing the manufacturing of the new design is the only viable solution .

5. i prefer for comic book worlds to remain mostly static . i ' m not totally against change . without change , dick grayson would still be robin . however , i don ' t like when characters have been one way for their entire publication history and the writers change them for the sake of " diversity " . that ' s lazy and insulting to the fanbase . if it ' s really so important for them to include more minority characters , then they should write new and interesting minority characters . it would be so much better if riri williams were to fight alongside tony stark rather than in his place . have amadeus cho join the hulk family along with rick jones , jennifer walters , and betty ross . it annoys me when writers basically say to their audience , " oh , you ' d prefer to read about johnny blaze rather than robbie reyes ? too bad . johnny ' s gone . robbie is your only option . " i wouldn ' t mind these new characters if i still got to keep the old ones . you can always count on brian michael bendis to ruin everything . the only good thing that man ever gave us was jessica jones . other than that , everything he ' s written has been trash . he ruined iceman and turned iron man into a digit year  old girl because he ' s a terrible writer who can only continue to sell books with pure shock value . marvel is a pathetic shell of its former self and i ' m not sure it will ever recover .

6. well that ' s actually a problem . i go incognito to watch porn and when i close i lose the page , and forget the name if it was a good one . its sad and i need to find a new one every time . if i bookmark i feel weird when i go over over it
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

7. as far as changing faces go , i think the recent idea is political correctness run amok in regards to harriet tubman . if the treasury dept . really wants to honor this important woman , then create a much needed bill in a new denomination . and make sure she isn ' t frowning .
   (ID: 130fa156e7a286a021dcdff2492d6048231cb82f)

8. or the new apu ' s or the innodisk thing
   (ID: 7bd4f8e2f55f684df651b44f2faa8769031fc782)

9. his creator  owned stuff is fine . it ' s when you give him someone else ' s creation to play with that he can ' t be trusted . chances are he ' ll kill off your favorite character and replace them with a new one that either has zero personality or his just so annoying that you actively root against them . otherwise , he ' ll just spit on the continuity because it ' s getting in the way of the story he ' s trying to tell .
   (ID: 17d6f5fb6fdd1b0ceedb5ec118276bdbb72a462f)

10. this is the reason why i sort by new !
   (ID: 4167b7bc7d40ac86ca6b492ac0bbaefa992711f6)

11. i am new on reddit , so is it bad that it is made with mematic ?
   (ID: 5a15ba0aaa5a6e6f9e3a2db25befda6ec40a9b88)

12. what makes you think i might not already have ? the dt should not be compelled to post the images , fine , but you either do or do not . all it takes is a few seconds to unblur that ridiculous compromise they went for . it makes as much sense as censoring swear words with asterisks and grawlixes , we all know what they are , don ' t treat all of us like children .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

13. yeah exactly . i personally don ' t really like the new design myself , but if people do , perhaps there ' s something there that i may have missed out on . perhaps some cool new feature i missed out on that makes it better than what ' s already here . i mean , if it ' s not broken , why fix it ?
   (ID: 57e23377d2e20446272558e1ff75f7e0cf1b0049)

14. why don ' t you do something about the rampant amount of censorship on the platform where mods can censor you , insult you and ban you for no reason with no recourse all the while manipulating what news millions of people do and don ' t see
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

15. i am of the opinion that there are bots  stupid people that go through and downvote everything new
   (ID: 1f135ff98983a673a19c956d41be6fdeca8513e4)

16. at least it ' s a new bottom
   (ID: 41d66f92509db20d202cca3f348509c6cd25586b)

17. i have to agree honestly . as much as i like skins with different styles , this new mentality of " i dont like their hat , get rid of it " and " make this character blue because i said so " is so uncalled for
   (ID: 8f5b0c902ce9c2bf19ecdb9205cb3d9f2a7c14fa)

18. you expected something different ? are you new ? yeah , you ' re new . once you ' ve been around a while digit  years under different accounts , it won ' t surprise you much .
