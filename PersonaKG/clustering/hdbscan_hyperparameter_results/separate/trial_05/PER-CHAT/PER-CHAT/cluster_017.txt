3. buildings going up in the urban areas , but some still stalled that were started when you were last here . fancy hotel district in saigon is being gutted as they actually begin digging for the rail  subway project . kids left and right have digital devices and are online , and dropping international pop  culture references and awareness of the world beyond the borders not much , but a positive move . , the government is in the middle of a strange immigration crack down , making visas and work permits a pain even for those who ' ve been here , contractually employed for years , anti  china sentiment still exists from the oil rig fiasco , and finally , the fucking phenomenon of the " beer club . a " beer club " is pretty much a hybrid of a bar and a disco , and they are really popular now , springing up every other day , it seems . it seems to be more socially acceptable to go to a " beer club " than a bar or club , though it is pretty much the exact same thing . but people are going , dancing , drinking , etc . despite my confusion with regards to the nomenclature , i ' ll take any embrace of nightlife as a good move in these parts . source  have been here since the last time you were , living in a few different cities .
