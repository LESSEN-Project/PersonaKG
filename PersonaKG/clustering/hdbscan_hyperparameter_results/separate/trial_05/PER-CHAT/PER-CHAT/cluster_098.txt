1. chinas navy is absolute dogshit and they know it , if they were to go to war with nato their naval imports would stop because of naval blockades , which would cripple their economy . also , china simply cannot produce enough food to feed digit , digit billion , which means another famine would start if their naval imports were to get cut off . as you already said , china has wayyy too much to lose and honestly not much to gain from a world war .

2. north korea ' s goal is state survival . they believe nuclear weapons ensure that no country will attempt to remove them . they will likely never use them under the current system , barring a direct attack from another nation potentially . even then it is questionable .

3. it depends on the quality of us and international intelligence . it ' s clear that we aren ' t sure exactly where all their military sites are , making it more difficult . either way international powers could defeat the army i imagine relatively quickly , as despite large numbers of military personnel in the nk army they lack basic supplies  equipment . they could of course do a lot of damage to south korea with their artillery , and possibly conventional forces the latter is unclear .

4. it seems rather unlikely that a full  scale war will happen . no one knows for sure of course , but north korea ' s ultimate goal is state survival beyond anything else . the us will respond to any attack with the destruction of the regime , which is something they don ' t want to deal with . the concern is that if the us strikes thousands will die , and we will be left with a major refugee crisis .

5. there probably won ' t be a ww3 in the old world , but the us has been slowly going back to isolationism , stocking up on weapons and is basically preparing to go against the whole world in my opinion . on the other hand , russia and the eu have been improving relations and are more or less dependent on each other the eu  economy quite literally depends on gazprom . also , russia has also been getting quite friendly with a lot of middle eastern and central asian countries , so it is possible that a large war breaks out , seeing as how the lines are pretty much drawn .
