1. you wont she ' ll most likely tell you she just wants to be friends and then if she was ever worth it at all will follow through with that .

2. first thing , get closer to her . become friends so you can test the waters and see if it ' s something you want to get into . if not , you gave a good friend who you care about alot . if yes then you can try to date her and that ' s even better .

3. i can think you should be honest with your feelings . i say with experience and to ignore or overlook it can be more destructive than anything else . if she genuinely likes you , she ' ll come back . if it ' s just the physical stuff the friendship will fizzle out . that ' s the worst part though . fwbs ruin good friendships most of the time .

4. i can relate , when i was dating this ome girl earlier this year id rather hang out with her than do anything else , she just made me happy . heres the thing if you hang out with them too much there eventually gets to the point where you get bored of them , lose your interest in hanging out with them . i know i know you might be saying that you wont and some people can be like that and never get bored of them but incase you do take a step back but not to far back , they ' ll think something is up when in reality you jusy want to create distance to rekindle the flame of loving their company . thats my opinion atleast

5. heres what id do ask her out one more time , if she says she has things to do without giving you a time where shes available then yea you did kill your chance . other than that , im sure youll find more people youll have a shot with

6. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .
