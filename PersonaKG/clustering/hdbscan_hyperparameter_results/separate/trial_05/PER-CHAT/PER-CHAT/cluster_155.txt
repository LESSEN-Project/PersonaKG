SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 7

1. not eat too much salt and get better sleep . sometimes a good adaptogen helps to keep the serotonin flowing , like rhodiola rosea . all in all it ' s usually an atrophied muscle you have to exercise . just like how people are full of shit when they say they can ' t run , focusing , socializing or managing can be learned because the brain is very plastic . just stick to subjects you enjoy and work to empathize with other people and listen to their stories . some people are simply boring or self centered , but there are also a lot of interesting people out there . like good books , you have to seek them out , and stick to being around them and then over time socializing because rewarding because there is commonality between you and the person you found . indeed , the beginning requires getting out of your comfort zone and making the effort . it is so worth it though .

2. a few things . clean your room . exercise every day . eat a non inflammatory diet . lots of veggies , legumes , lean meats , nuts with few carbs and no bread . take adaptogens like ashwaganda and rhodiola rosea to combat depression , anxiety and enhance cognition . meditate digit  digit minutes a day take a lot of initiative to contact people . work hard on yourself to be better groomed , behaved , mindful , successful or generous . fix your inner dialogue so your inner voice is more friendly and affirming and guides you to do things that you benefit from and allows you to move on from your mistakes .

3. there is no point doing anything . it all requires too much effort to even start , and why bother doing it because it ' ll have no effect and nobody will care . nobody cares anyway . might as well just go to sleep and not wake up . life would be easier for everyone if you ' re not around because you ' re just trouble for them , they have to look after you . everything you want to do , there ' s someone who will be better at it than you . if you do anything , people will find out that you ' ve been faking it all this while . but try to smile and make jokes anyway because that will make people like at least the appearance of you .

4. i do not lack the needed intelligence . i know i could lose some weight im not obese but just close to overweight with a bmi of about digit . digit . i don ' t really want to be appreciated or liked for having a good physique or expensive clothes but for who i am . unfortunately my generation grew up to be materialistic . i feel like even if i do shit to grow my self worth and confidence i just try to conform to society which kind of makes me angry inside . it seems it is more important how you look like then who you are nowadays and it is igniting some kind of fury in my mind . i understand being fat for example is unhealthy but even then , why wouldn ' t any one be able to love you for who you are .

5. love yourself enough to know that you ' re perfect the way you are , sounds corny i know . but once i changed my perception of myself , everything becomes a lot better . i become a lot more confident when i talk to people , i gain more friends . confidence is that one thing that makes you hot . but i stay humble , because there ' s a lot i haven ' t learned . you can like yourself a little too much , no problem with that . but don ' t think that you ' re way better than everyone else .

6. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else

7. well i always walk into a room with my head held high and with purpose so i start off looking like i belong  have confidence . really watch how you present yourself , use your body language to exude confidence . one thing i try to do but is so hard is to make eye contact when speaking with others . when interacting with people , i try to stand still and not fidget with random shit like my hair , phone or whatever because that comes across as being anxious . one thing i do which isn  t the greatest is i act cocky and borderline conceded . it makes me feel better and people who know me know that i  m not being serious . but sometimes you really do start becoming this person you  re channeling .
