SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 5

1. i  m not talking about your initial comments , i  m talking about the whole conversation . and during this conversation , you  ve been all over the place . you  ve told me that you  re just giving me food for thought and i shouldn  t actually change what i  m doing , then you blatantly told me you  re telling me to change what i  m doing . you  ve called me apathetic , then you  ve told me i  m taking it personally . i should stop reading into your comments , but you get to interpret mine however you want . now you  re saying you enjoy disney movies , but you draw the line at writing quotes on the board . that  s not where i draw the line , and i  m sorry you feel that  s wrong . we could discuss the meaning of that song and why i specifically chose that lyric , but i  m not really wanting to open that can of worms with so many other things already on the table . what you  re not seeming get is that i  m not trying to do any mixing . i  m not making grey , as you suggest . i  m keeping the two issues entirely separate . and the definition of apathy is showing a lack of emotion or an indifference . i am telling you that i have thought a lot about my stances on these issues and am far from apathetic .

2. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .

3. i dont see how my attitude is hateful . ive never said that i hate all incels or thought of them less than anyone else . ive only said that they sometimes have radical ideas . how could you possibly know what i want ?

4. i am following the rules of this sub , and spreading out my posts . none of my posts have had the same core point nor were they copy and pasted versions with each one being written completely originally and from scratch so i am not spamming . i am providing detailed arguments of the lore , and discussing those arguments with others here . and in the process i have remained respectful to those who disagree with me , despite several trying use insults to make me back down . an echo chamber is not healthy for the community . and if you want me to leave the subreddit completely simply because you disagree with an opinion on the lore , that is exactly what you are promoting .

5. i mean , its your call . if you wish for me to stop posting these i respect that . but may i ask what qualifies as high content then ? this is an entire essay written about the characters on the show . yes , it has speculation about why characters acted the way they did . but all the events listed happened in the show and ultimately were just a different way to view the shows events . there is a lot that could be said about these posts , but them having low  content doesn ' t really make much sense considering how much longer , more detailed , and how much more i discuss the lore then many posts on this sub .
