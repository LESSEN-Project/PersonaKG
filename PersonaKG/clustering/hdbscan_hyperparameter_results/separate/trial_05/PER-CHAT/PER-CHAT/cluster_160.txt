2. some people are raised in a fashion that they never developed the want to have kids . instead they see it as any other decision in life and look upon its downsides . usually they end up turning away from it

3. i  m in the middle . i wouldn  t get one because i don  t think i  d be able to live with myself . i have a lot of issues with the whole  my body my decision  outlook and believe men should have some input on the situation assuming it  s theirs because it takes digit to tango lady but ya to have an abortion simply because you don  t want it is morbid . use a condom

4. it ' s hard to give advice because everyone handles this sort of thing differently . we went through three miscarriages , but they were all before our first child , so for us , there wasn ' t any question of trying again . for some people , it helps to start trying again right away . some want to wait for awhile before trying again . it ' s probably best to give it some time , for your wife to get back to normal physically , and for you both to heal emotionally . make sure she knows you ' re there to support her , but don ' t smother here either , give her space if she needs it . and always keep in mind , that unless she has an underlying health problem which it doesn ' t sound like is the case since you already have two kids , miscarriages are random occurrences , and aren ' t likely to happen with the next pregnancy .

5. this is a truly horrible situation as a single dad i can ' t imagine what i would do if i lost one of mine . my heart goes out to you .

7. for some the shittiness is worth it to have a kid at the end of it . plus , brains tend to protect us by diminishing the memory of how shit the process was . there  s also some women who have  unicorn  pregnancies and feel mostly fine the whole time . maybe the woman got pregnant by accident but can  t or won  t abort . the existence of babies doesn  t disprove the fact that pregnancy can suck worse than you think it does . you think i  m arguing because of my  hurt feelings  ? lmao . i  m arguing because i disagree with your views on something you  ve never gone through . imagine if i told you  broken bones don  t suck as much as you make it out to be , stop complaining  but i  d never broken a bone whereas you had . you  d think i was full of shit . where did i say pregnancy is the ultimate suffering ? honestly at this point i think you  re just being stubborn and contrary for the sake of it

8. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

9. i dont want kids , because i can barely take care of myself as it is

10. she is violating the child ' s body by having it torn up and sucked out of her . she is using the child ' s life as a sacrifice to her convenience . yes , slavery is always wrong . in a perfect world this wouldn ' t be a problem in the first place . but in the real world i choose the lesser of two evils . taking an innocent life to prevent your own suffering is wrong . please be intellectually honest and stop using the fringe cases as an excuse to justify the common occurrence . they are definitely worth considering , but even if they were justifiable , it doesn ' t mean the others are . i am pretty sure i have heard every reason that pro  choice advocates have for abortion . and so far , they don ' t change what i see as a very simple truth . it is always morally wrong to take an innocent human life . and , though you are free to disagree with my view on morality , i can ' t think of anything worse that one person could do to another . saving innocent life  saving bodily autonomy .

11. i ' m gonna throw this out there because you didn ' t specify  birth control . still cheaper than children .
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

12. i ' m sorry to hear that . that can ' t be a good feeling to live with your entire life . i know it ' s a bit harsh but yes , there should be some personal responsibility directed towards not having kids if you don ' t intend to care for them or raise them . but i also feel like the kids are not at fault and it ' s not fair to punish them for it either .

13. i guess my solution is that when a couple feels like they ' re ready for a child , they apply to the government and they get one . they could also have their own kids , and if they felt like they had a kid but couldn ' t take care of it , they give it away to the government as well .

14. while i like the grand notion of basically forcing certain breeders to become virtually extinct , this may fare better for the other side . many people don ' t want kids and still can ' t get sterilised because they don ' t have kids . kind of a paradox . a really dumb one . some who end up with kids end up resenting them . i believe if those who truly want this treatment can get it , a large portion of bad parents would be eliminated before the deed is done .
