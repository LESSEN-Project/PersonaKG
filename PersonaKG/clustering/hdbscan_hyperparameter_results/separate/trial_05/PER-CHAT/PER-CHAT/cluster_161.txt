2. choose your poison that ' s a nice test to give to people that are literally incapable of telling good from evil , because you made them in such a way . doesn ' t sound very flattering about god ' s character , is it ?  christianity at least imho is a soothing white lie i prefer calling it opiate of the masses . it helps one notice both great utility as a painkiller and horrible side effects .   x200b

3. i agree digit  people who are like ' god helped me study and pass my exams ' or ' god saved me from a car accident ' are so brainwashed . once people realise it ' s themselves that are in charge of their destiny , they decide their own morals , actions etc and not some invisible sky daddy , the better we will all be .

5. its not moral to believe that the fall justifies all the bad stuff , it just caused it to happen or was the kickstart i suppose . i do believe that adam was made from dust and eve the rib . the snake , in my view , was satan in the form of a snake , or talking through a snake . i read the bible in a metaphorical way . of course many things are taken literally like the earth flooded folks who arent christians , thats their choice . i would never say  go burn in hell  to anyone regardless of age , beliefs , or gender . many good things come from all corners of the world too . there is a misunderstanding between atheists and christians though .

6. nobody who actually cares about historicity can take the idea of hell seriously . but since belief in it is so prevalent , i guess knowing it was a translation blunder is a unique vision .

7. no , that ' s it . i ' ve heard that line of reasoning in a thousand ways . the only way evangelicals can explain bad things happening under the watch of a supposedly benevolent and all  powerful god is that we don ' t always know what his ' plan ' is , but there ' s always good in it somewhere .

8. i know i ' m a bit late on this but . if you want a good book to read to disprove the bible or give you a better understanding of why lots of us aren ' t fans of it , then you got to read this one the bible turns out the best way to go about it would to just read the whole thing word for word and then think about what it actually teaches . it ' s full of horrible things that if they where to be done today , we definitely wouldn ' t want to be making a belief system based on it .

9. a lot of my extended family believe gay people are going to hell even though i ' m pretty sure one of them is gay . but yeah , i don ' t believe that .
