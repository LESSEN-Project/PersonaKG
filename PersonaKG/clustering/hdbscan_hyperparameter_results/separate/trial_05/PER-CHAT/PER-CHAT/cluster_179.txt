1. this post is actually a pretty good start . whether you realize it or not , you ' re reaching out . now you need to go to a doctor , or a therapist , or whoever you feel comfortable with , and tell them all of the things that you have told us here . i ' m no doctor , so i can ' t say one way or the other whether or not you actually need medicine . but that ' s all the more reason to go talk to a real one . if you really do have depression , you might need meds . you wouldn ' t leave any other disease untreated , right ? as for the girl in the pic , i ' m guessing you look nothing like her . the hard reality is that you probably never will . everyone is different . you need to stop comparing yourself to other people , because you ' re only hurting yourself more . chances are , that girl has insecurities of her own . everyone does . but you can ' t let it control your life .

2. i gotchu bro . you may be asking yourself , oh no what do i talk about ? when approaching a girl . no worries ! as another user mentioned , get on board day is a great opportunity to meet a girl that has a similar interest as you . you dont have to tell a joke or have some jaw dropping awesome first line , you can literally just ask  how long have you been into topic ?   what is your favorite thing about topic  keep in mind that not everyone will click and if it doesnt , dont tell yourself that youre bad with girls . i promise you that there are guys you could try to be friends with and it wouldnt go so well either . why ? because not everyone is going to click , i promise you that i wouldnt click or be friends with almost digit  of the guys in my classes if we tried to be friends . it  s just because people are different . so don  t get down , go out there , be confident , be yourself , and if you fail , get back up , dust yourself off , and try again ! you got this ! p . s . none of the bad interactions will matter in digit years when you  re as happy as can be with your s  o good luck bro

4. ah i gotta try badoo . im more like a dating person not just getting laid and that ' s kind of a set back i guess . though i keep changing description and add photos everyweek on tinder with not luck

5. i  m not a troll . you think anyone who isn  t asian can immediately relate to what you go through ? that  s why i  m asking this sub for perspective . i really just don  t understand why it  s such an issue . economic success will get you practically anywhere you want . on average , you all have money . if you think you  re too ugly to land a date , get plastic surgery . you  re too fat ? hire a personal trainer . dress poorly ? buy better clothes . you can afford it . who gives a shit about how your race is represented in the media ? you think other races are drooling over black guys because hip hop is the most popular genre in the country ? nah bro . economic power is all that matters

7. hey , first off , i wanna thank you for being real with how you feel . and congrats to losing 90lbs , that ' s absolutley insane ! the first thing i thought of was the concept of " stinkin thinkin " and how our mind sometimes plays sick games on us by saying we are " not good enough " in reference to tinder , , , anyone can make a profile so why would you deny yourself the opportunity to have one if you want one and try it . you may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome . but it starts with you making one and knowing that if others can have it , you can too . also youre so young that you can bounce outta this mindset . first i would take your chance on the girl you want . ask her to the gym or something , and if that doesnt work , go in on the tinder and try what have you got to lose ? nothin , but a mindset that needs updated . im sorry if thats harsh because i do empathize feeling that way , because ive been there but ive found the way out too by putting one foot in front of the other and takin that chance with a girl . i believe in you bruddah

9. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

10. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them

11. just ask her  random question . if i asked you if you  d date me , would you ?  or something like that . don  t make it seem like you want to date her , just like a funny question .

12. because most dudes myself included are clueless on how to be romantic .

13. my opinion , go out more . not to a bar or club more like a social event at the park find someone whose doing something similar to something you feel passionate about . ex girl jogging in the park go join her keep her company ask like how long have you been jogging here ? then improvise from there obviously ask her for her name just dont make it the first question so you seem interested at her hobby aswell as herself . next try to get into the friend area yes i know you don ' t want to be here but this stage is where youll learn the most truthful information about her . next start sharing life moments you wouldnt tell most people just think before you say it so it doesn ' t sound like extra baggage for the person . eventually youll know when to ask her on a date
