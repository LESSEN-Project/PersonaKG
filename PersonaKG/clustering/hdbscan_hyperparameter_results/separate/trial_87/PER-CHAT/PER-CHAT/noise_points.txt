6. " hello ! you ' ve reached the timeline branching center ! please state the current year where you are and a quick summary of major historical events in the 20th or 21st centuries . " " mark ? it ' s me , i mean , you . from the future . " i hear my own voice over the line and cover the mic with my hand . " what the hell . bob ! a are we getting calls from this timeline ? " " don ' t talk to bob ! that idiot ? he couldn ' t tell a wormhole from a black hole . he ' s fire us for taking two hours for lunch . " " what ? why would i take two hours for lunch ? " " oh yeah . i remember being confused too . well stay on the line and go to lunch now . we might as well get this started . " i signal to my coworker that i ' m heading out and sneak my headset in my pocket . as soon as i ' m outside i put it back in my ear . " alright fine . prove you ' re me . what ' s the password to my bank account ? " " whoa , this is weird . " future mark replied , " i remember asking that . crazy deja vu . my password was ihatemyjobhelp " " wait , was ? what do you mean ? " " listen , man , i can ' t tell you everything . i pretty much have to follow the script that the other future me said to me or else i might stop existing . all i know is you need to get to the west tower to save a lot of lives . " i hustle to the tower , a digit minute drive away that i pull off in digit . " ok i ' m here . " " alright this is gonna sound crazy but you need to go out back to the dumpster and get the stinkiest thing you can find , then put it in the intake fan . " " are you serious ? " " completely . hurry . lots of lives , remember ? " i find some disgusting , expired food in the dumpster and throw it into the fan digit feet up the wall on the other side of the alley . a few flecks fly onto my arm and i gag a bit . " gross huh ? good thing they made that fan easy to get to . alright now go to the park down the road . " i wait at the park and watch as people begin streaming out of the skyscraper holding their noses . after a few minutes the rate slows . " wait for it . " future mark says . suddenly there is an explosion on one of the higher floors , followed by a series of explosions on other floors . everyone begins running from the tower . " told you man , " future mark says in my ear , " you saved a bunch of people . sorry about the job . you hated it anyway . something better will come along . " the headset clicks as the call ends . i smile , then sigh and head back to the office . before i get back i pop the headset open and pull out the small , glowing quantum time chip . might come in handy someday .

12. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .

13. you seem to have normalized his shitty behavior at this point . there is no reason why you should be working full time  still taking on the domestic role . if you weren ' t working , sure . but that ' s just so fucking ridiculous and selfish , " tradition " be damned . it sucks you have kids with this guy imo . i think you should leave him .

14. lol i know that feel came to say the same thing . it ' s like having three people try and talk to you at the same time . your trying to focus on one but you end up trying to talk to all three at once and seem like your not paying attention to any of them . it is frustrating because i come across as absent minded , like i ' m not paying attention , and i ' m not mentally present . i promise i am doing my best . it just so happens that while we are having this conversation about what is causing that memory leak i am also thinking about how 8th ed is going to affect the 40k meta , weighing the pros and cons of . digit vs 6x45 , and trying to stay on topic and not wonder how the digit people just got out of that smart car out the window .

17. i don ' t think the complainers get it . the guy could ' ve retired and then there would no more new shows ever . the fact is , when he was terrestrial , he was a machine because he needed to keep high ratings to justify the costs . now that ratings don ' t mean as much and he ' s an older guy he ' s entitled to more time off . he warned everyone over and over and sometimes i think you won ' t appreciate the digit  day weeks until it ' s all re  runs all the time .
