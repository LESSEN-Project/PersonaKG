19. overwatch . the game currently has too many ways to stop a player from playing  stunlock and all that . took a while for me to realize what it was about the game that was making me so angry , but i haven ' t been back since . sometimes i kinda miss it and want to go back , but then i see a play of the game or highlight that involves so much stunlock it hurts , and i decide not to .
