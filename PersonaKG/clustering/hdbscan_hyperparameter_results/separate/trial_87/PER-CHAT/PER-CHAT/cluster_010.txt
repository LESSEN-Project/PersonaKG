18. i ' m a buddhist . the thing i admire about atheists is their sense of responsibility . there is no divine push that guides them to do right , nor is there an evil corruptor that guides them to do bad . there are no excuses for their actions beyond their own intuition . if you do good , it ' s because you wanted to . if you do bad , it ' s because you chose to acct poorly .
