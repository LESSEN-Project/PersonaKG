9. many subreddits have rules about what can be posted . you just have to follow these rules and find the appropriate subreddit for what you are wanting to post . some subreddits even have certain times that they allow certain things to be posted , it can be rather confusing . once you figure out which subreddits  communities that you like and want to be a part of it will be easier . one more thing , most subreddits have a minimum account age  karma requirement before you are able to post anything at all . so , just begin commenting on posts and gaining karma , eventually you will be able to post like everyone else . just dont ask the mods what the minimums are , this will likely result in a ban .

18. if you had read more of the comments and gained a little context , the user is able to post . it is just that their posts continuously get removed for one reason or another . there is a rather large difference between being banned and having your post removed .
