3. no , it had them stay in the neverzone during running with scissors , marco dies in the neverzone but star brings him back to earth , which somehow brings them back to earth . i think it was on fanfiction . net or ao3

8. i don ' t know if i ' m ready for the next chapter . i don ' t think my heart can handle it .
   (ID: 8764a223ca1af7d1792e76a58bf3b1209bf73ad3)

9. the rest of the poem is what i would call poetic . i think the piece functions with a degree of uncertainty without the last line . i think it takes away from the awesome that is this poem . after a few more readings , i might suggest dropping the punctuation but that is sort of whatever .
   (ID: 109fa004cbb85f6a703624f8b4393d7d7d685509)

10. well you don ' t get to know any more , because it is secret
   (ID: 8360c6d04ba11da7a727532482d78505e52a4150)

11. disagree  i think if there is profit to be made then digging in old landfills , dredging the ocean or mining asteroids in space  these elements will be recycled and re  purposed .
   (ID: 30506e41c4121e1e7573a25d4985de191de679c9)

12. whenever i hear that word , i think of some lady , covered in too much makeup , holding an ice pack between her arbie ' s style mudflaps sitting out on her front step , resting her pie out for all to see . on her vagisil .
   (ID: 720bf2762acb0f756492e6e40ae840126dae87ce)

13. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

14. depends on what they think i ' m gonna eat .
   (ID: de5db66359e6314e9bac24fd9a10ec1d49584c4f)

15. hmm . i don ' t think it can see its own reflection from there .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

16. i don ' t know what ' s funnier , his expression or yours . have an upvote .
   (ID: fe374743dd856c29f2117723cef01c1fdc3b3b5b)

   (ID: bd42a28607025a98ff2c7df361f815aea9ee3ea9)

18. me neither . i think op is high or something
   (ID: 800762ac8d54632109094a4e9132fe0aed711561)

19. don ' t think that ' s the case . this mentions nothing about an injury here , just the marine ' s takedown and then how he was restrained . the robber was put in handcuffs , with no mention of needing medical attention .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

20. why do you think that , is what i am asking .
