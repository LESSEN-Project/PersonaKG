   (ID: 93e92e6a7d8e94b12bcd450fad136ec14436f359)

6. ive done camming and it didn ' t seem like my relationship was that different from those around me . it was just a fun , well paying job where i happened to masturbate !
   (ID: 29b9b56e163cbfecbc98e83c436b436aca056a8c)

7. it was on reddit and someone said to some innocuous comment i wrote ,  i hope you die .  i could not see anything offensive or rude or even that opinionated in my comment . so i didn  t care . if anything it helped me . that comment reminded me that i shouldn  t take anything online to heart . if i offended or upset someone i would not like that  and i would apologise but if someone just wants to be a rude little fucker it has no impact on me .

   (ID: 01d4ddab8cb9e73e5e85941c592482da1b3c6bcd)

10. yeah i just use coins for all mine . i never use change for anything else so it  s like the money doesn  t count
   (ID: 6362531e71cf0653b3119ebe05583f7bbc6fb178)

11. i didn ' t have enough money for that gnosis fit for a month after i started eve . but then i never would have put all my eggs in one basket like that . somethings fishy . or just dumb
   (ID: 1885b01dd0970230fea2a9c9ae9c4eaeaceb59a3)

12. just off the top of my head . race is an optical illusion , bernie sanders doesnt like socialism as much as he likes attention , trump and chris christie are having an affair , and reddit is a cia project designed to gather psychological data on americans .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

13. do you mean like a show about your actual life ? or if you could just create your own show ?
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

14. you shouldn ' t you shouldn ' t hit anyone , but it ' s worse when you ' re obviously a lot stronger than them and it ' s not a fair fight . just like you shouldn ' t hit children as an adult .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

15. mate is very popular in chile , and it ' s getting more popular in the states . in seattle you can get yerba minus the actual mate just like you can tea at coffee shops , you can even get a latte version . not sure if they put milk in it in uruguay , but in chile it is popular to drink with lots of sugar and milk .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

16. i like how they put up an " out of order " sign , just in case someone actually tries to use it .
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

17. he ' s probably just doing it to look less like what he is in the wake of this new debacle .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

18. i take it that the crew are a comedy group ? is " crew funny " highlights of their " skits " or just some bonus behind the scenes of their creative process ? in any case , eating donuts purchased for someone else isn ' t funny or quirky , it just makes you look like a self  absorbed asshole especially in the jerk  like way amanda phrased it . p . s . i ' m also the last person to complain , but that is the wrong there in your sentence will .
   (ID: 808718709a1de9360ade79304c59728079eae812)

19. i wish i were joking too women dont tend to talk about how a loss feels or how it ' s not just a loss but more like the death of a dream . " be lucky for the kids you do have " is not a consolation in any way .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

20. i didnt . i just pulled the old " sit next to them at the movies and put your arm around them " move . worked like a charm !
