3. why does it only apply to the 2nd amendment and not any other ? the founding fathers only knew printing press , do you think freedom of speech should apply to the internet ? i don ' t think so . there were also automatic weapons when the 2nd amendment was written .

   (ID: 17b8a304069d7530607e28f8e04d840e28be0d3e)

9. i don ' t think the average gamer could even survive a week in the woods , let alone survive not being corrupted by the marker , or killed my necros
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

10. considering that the atmosphere on pandora is carbon dioxide i don ' t think firebenders would be able to do much .
   (ID: 395865cc8932d0b3d13214bce052e8915f32835b)

11. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

12. because every product i used caused me dandruff , and one day i noticed that it stops when i don ' t use anything . i think that answers your question .
   (ID: 4dd03f320502247ea725348e21fe67168d7cf5f1)

13. would be cool , but i don  t think supercell would be willing to buy the rights to harley quinn to make it happen
   (ID: 26831d6557d17492ae3b0b54585b32e08055f834)

14. yeah . i see why some women don ' t but i think it ' s an important thing to at least attempt . lets print of cards and be weird together !
   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

15. this actually sound like an issue with the pc  mac  s hardware . you could check your activity monitor and see if the interface is initiating some type of search for new software , but i don  t think that  s what it is . turning off the internet is recommended for optimizing your daw . but who are we kidding . i don  t think many prosumers do . this isn  t a very common issue which is another reason i think it  s the computer  s ports .
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

16. speaking spanish in public so no one knows what i ' m saying is so fun . i do this in the mostly white neighborhoods i go to . i don ' t think everyone likes it tho lol

19. to be fair , i doubt most of us would be here if we didn ' t trust him , but i don ' t think any of us can make up your mind for you . read about him , watch videos of him and decide for yourself if he deserves your trust .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

20. i think i saw a video on youtube with a theory that seemed pretty convincing . don  t remember its name though .
