13. yes , it  s not rape . i personally believe you should always disclose that you  re transgender , even in short term activities like hook ups , for your safety . what if someone outs you to them ? what if blah blah blah . a lot of things could go wrong . there  s plenty of stories online where they talk about how they almost got beat up or killed because they disclosed they  re trans or forgot to or something . personally , as a trans man myself , i want to know if my partner or hook up is a trans woman . i wouldn  t be mad or anything last minute , but i would want to know .
   (ID: 3510b342268f3bc4c3f1e402201d7c565dfb7648)

14. so you pointing out that it ' s about race and gender implying that you want it to be true just because she is a woman and an african please provide a valid counter argument or fuck off with your faminazi sentimentality .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

15. what if the thing i want is the thing i need ?
   (ID: de62a0a330b0a7ca76d55a6702dcae5baf1c3cae)

16. i just want to be able to piss standing up in the woods . so convenient .
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

17. thank . why do you even want to know though ?
   (ID: 726c36ce13fa631676ed5053f62b0f5f7b61eb5e)

18. would you believe me that this is as cheap as a metal deck can get . i would avoid crafting this because more decks are building around aggro but if you still want to you can get away with not including level up and maybe throw in some pirates or murlocs ?
   (ID: 2dcd820eac167adf18c6706f1c0a26a39eb945be)

19. what you can do is try a new hobby together as newbies . is there something you want to start that both of you have no experience in doing ?
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

20. if they turn you down because of that then sue them for race and sexism . fight me if you want . but if that is the case then that ' s not fair .
