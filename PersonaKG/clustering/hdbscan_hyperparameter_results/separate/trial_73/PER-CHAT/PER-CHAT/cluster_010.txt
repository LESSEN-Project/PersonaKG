1. no private sc is worth it . you  re better than that . don  t let some dumb slut take advantage of you . she  s not unique . there  s tons of free porn out there . she  s not doing anything for you that you can  t go out and get all by yourself .

5. phone recording ? when i started , i used the record option of my logitech webcam . don ' t remind me of that . i can recommend all of the sound stuff i bought  but if you have a tight budget , you can probably get along without a zoom recorder  it is helpful not having to attach the cables to the camera directly , but it also is quite expensive . and yes , those umbrellas are what i meant .

6. yeah read about mlms before i went for it , still can  t believe i went for it . maybe i mixed up pyramid schemes and mlms , since they heavily focused on selling to actual customers to the point whereby i don  t realise that my friend is earning through selling me those  tryout  packages .
   (ID: af5ee378b1abffcc7a909dba267af824a56225d0)

7. personally , i don ' t see one . then again , it will never be a problem for me , as a partner is required .

8. interesting that it was the phrase itself that prompted the talking  to . they need to be careful they don ' t themselves get in trouble for an attack on expressing one ' s religious beliefs . it could turn out to be a bit of a minefield .

9. the texas chainsaw massacre remake . must have been six or seven , don ' t get me wrong , it was an awesome movie , but it got a lot harder to sleep after that .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

10. don ' t explain your life choices to anyone . your life is not debatable for anyone but you .
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

11. it really makes customer support queries much faster . i find it way more useful than some of the banking apps i use , because all the text and information is automatically saved . you don  t have to go back and forth with different systems and phone numbers and juggle all the information as it  s all there .
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

13. yes . don  t take it too seriously , but you learn a lot about yourself and being that close to someone can be very beneficial .

14. ah man i really don ' t care about it , what ' s the difference if it ' s on the holder or not . toilet roll holders are the most superfluous household fixture .
   (ID: 0fbaeef283f7b2090f763028c227ed73724f3e6c)

15. well , if you drive a piece of shit that you don ' t care about your car and own a dash cam , you can skip the police report and body work and collect the insurance money . or , if you really were holier than thou , you could tell them not to worry about the slightly scuffed paint and go about your day knowing that you are the one shining light in an otherwise dreary world . your gonna have to bite the bullet on this one  if i didn ' t cause the minor fender bender , then it ' s not my fault .
   (ID: 306fcce176e83db604dac17838eed1e669cd5a90)
