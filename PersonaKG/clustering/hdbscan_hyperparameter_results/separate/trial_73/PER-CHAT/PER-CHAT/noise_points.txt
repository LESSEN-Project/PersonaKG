2. not really . i always assume everything is fake until proven otherwise  in this case , on a personal level , it doesn ' t effect the sadness of it .

4. i hope you both are ! it ' s a good feeling knowing that you have someone who cares about you no matter what and accepts your flaws . knowing you can barely talk for years while you ' re off doing your own thing , but then when you talk again it ' s like no time has passed , that ' s a good feeling , too .

5. there ' s a reason " corporate drone " is a saying . eyes forward , yes sir . just shut off everything but your brain ' s section that stops you from telling people what you really think of them .

6. if we are quiet in a group setting it does not mean we are having a bad time . although it ' s a nice gesture , you don ' t have to constantly check on us . it makes us feel insecure and like we ' re doing something wrong .

9. knowing what you like isn ' t selfish at all . i know i ' m pretty much just a sub . my partner is a switch . some people are only dominant , some only submissive , some are switches , and with that some are still more dominant or more submissive or are only dom  sub in certain scenarios and the other every time else . it ' s like sexual orientation , your wouldnt be selfish if you were straight , or gay , or anything else , and your definitely not for knowing that you are a dominant and don ' t worry , not all guys are dominants there are plenty of submissive and switch guys too

11. i get that it takes time to design and fabricate a big and functional robot but . if i can get ar500 plate shipped ground for free or next day air for digit  . i can ' t imagine that the teams were so time constrained they didn ' t have time to hit up the ebay . thought i ' d add . i love the british bots by the way , i have since i stayed up late as a kid to watch them . i just find it humorous they are still using sheet metal . not claiming it ' s all british bots either a certain " aerospace " quality us bot looked like a shredded soup can too . hell there was even this one goofball that direct drove a weapon in 20fricking16 and it wasn ' t an antweight !

14. i ' m a small child again , like digit or digit , i ' m just doing my shit playing in the back yard , then out of fucking nowhere three dinosaurs are resurrected . but not just any dinos , the three from fucking power rangers dino thunder . they start eating shit and obviously since i ' m a small child in this dream i ' m powerless to stop them , and children can ' t run very fast what the fuck am i going to do if one decides to eat me . and obviously power rangers aren ' t real so none of them every show up . so here i am trying to find some place to hide from these rampaging dinos when suddenly one spots me usually the pteranodon and the last fucking thing i see before i wake up is that fucker staring at me like a hungry bird .

16. it ' s an alien device , it detects when people are wearing a tin foil hat and cancels out the foil ' s atomic charge . safe to say you ' re being observed , perhaps even selected for probing , good luck my friend . or it could just be a low voltage transformer for a doorbell or intercom , who knows ? best not take any chances .

17. i was just going to say , that design must have looked so futuristic at the time . americans saw the war ending , and then saw these leaps in technology and design . i ' m sure they thought that by the year digit we ' d all be living proper george jetson style .

18. literally this . like do you want it to get to the point where people are detained for four years ? or sent to hard labor ? or killed by the thousands ? no . that ' s why we gotta call this what it is and put a stop to it for fuck ' s sake .

19. funny you should mention that because i ' ve just came across his instagram account . i quite liked it the idea because , as a player myself , i got it where as my mrs , who doesn ' t know a spade from a club , wouldn ' t have a clue what that meant . however , my vision is more about targeting poker first and scaling up to a designer brand which has a subtle poker reference which everyone could potentially relate to it ' s simple . i ' ll do some more research but thanks for your comments i appreciate it !
