6. your reply made me think about it more . in another example , i guess if someone wanted to change their clothes for free at a gilded wardrobe they would just go to another person ' s house party . it ' s lazy , but effective i guess . i think i ' ll just visit a poh and get someone to make flatpacks for me there .

17. that ' s just statistics at work . if you have ever even glanced at the numbers to see how many planets are around how many stars around how many galaxies then the idea of any single phenomenon occurring once and only once becomes so unlikely it ' s borderline insane not to think there is life out there .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)
