3. if done right , a collection of vignettes can be incredibly engaging . suttree by cormac mccarthy is a prime example of this , or steinbeck ' s cannery row . one of the things that makes it doable is how the vignettes tap into the reader ' s humanity  there is something they can connect with . i think it ' s a cool idea . who cares if it ' s the in thing right now .

   (ID: aaee7c28c6f1f83a427cf3dccf635bb78656a19d)
