1. portkeys are a fairly common spawn if you have inventory space , just walk around a bit and they will come . as for the map , what you see is what you get . depending on how active local players are , there may be a discord group where you guys can get organized and share nest locations , ideal grinding spots , etc .

2. i used to take a couple hits from our gravity bong before going to work but it made for awkward interactions in the mornings . i would space out more often or forget what i was saying mid sentence . i had to stop to avoid drawing suspicion and just to function better .

20. no , but the stereotype is filled and this movie seems to be leaning very heavily in girl power bo peep not a soft woman any more . they didn  t do that with jesse , they just introduced a great character that was female . this is forceful feminism and it  s achieving the opposite affect . that  s what he  s saying . now stop being defensive .
