15. yeah i would definitely go to diagon alley if i could .  and once your kid starts writing you letters about the amazing experience they ' re having at school , i imagine you would relax a bit . that ' s true , but i would still keep in mind that kids are kids , they will ooh ' s and aah ' s at probably everything they ' re showed but they aren ' t necessarily aware of the danger surrounding them . take the basilisk or the dementors as examples , were muggle parents even informed about that kind of stuff ? because if so there ' s digit chance they would allow their kids to go back at that school , dumbledore or not really .
   (ID: a80b8bc356414690d849369456d68876c95d5518)

16. not necessarily , i  ve noticed that as long as there  s communication the manager is willing to work with you . however , since we have so many people on our team holidays is usually the  you have to work your scheduled shift  type of schedule .

   (ID: a1ba9b657b043ce2934cc0ae7b42c0a0bf3ba2fa)

20. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .
