1. i ' m not an atheist either but the more i learn about space , the more i can ' t believe that our earth was created the way the bible says . because w t f there are over digit billion galaxies in space that we know of . the bible has all these answers about how god created everything and our one planet and who even wrote those ? are they oc or were they added by one of the million people who have translated  rewritten a bible ? but has nothing to say about the massive expanse full of billions of other galaxies that stretches further than any one person could travel in their lifetime ? i wonder if i ' ll ever figure it out .

8. according to smirk boys mommy , they were ' black muslims ' . so which is it , israelites or muslims ? btw , that excuse makes zero sense  " a group of people were harassing us so we went and harrassed a different group of people that had nothing to do with it . exemplary logic there . and yes , i have watched the videos  there are several of them capturing it from different angles . i saw a large group of teenagers wearing their maga hats surrounding a group of natives who were there for the indigenous people ' s march and yelling over their song . also yes , the elder walked toward the kid who could have stepped aside or walked away . instead he just stood there smirking . i ' ve also seen the half assed ' apology ' by the archdiocese claiming that they will be dealt with possible expulsion . these poor picked on little christian kids  s were there for a prolife march  so why all the maga gear ? why aren ' t they wearing march for life hats or t  shirts ? and why were they at the indigenous people ' s rally instead of their own ? it ' s pretty obvious that they wanted to stir the pot and start trouble . well done kids . mission accomplished . enjoy the shit buffet you created for yourselves . i hope the stench of it follows you for years to come .
