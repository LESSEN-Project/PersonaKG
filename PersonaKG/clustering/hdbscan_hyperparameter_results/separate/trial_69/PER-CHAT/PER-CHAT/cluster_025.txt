11. our desire for things in this world cannot exceed our desire for god . it is a christian belief that who we are and the good we do stay with us in to the next life . you are still you and thus the good things that you liked in life are still part of you . if the creating of beauty through music , art , etc . is a good thing it will exist still in heaven . how we will enjoy it then , i do not know . the book of job is problematic on many levels . first of all it is a marriage of a folktale the prose beginning and ending with the work of a first rate hebrew poet who inspired by the folktale creates the bulk of the middle . the essence of the folktale is that god tests our faith . the essence of the poetry that suffering that we endure has a purpose even if we cannot understand or know what that purpose is . very small children may believe the rules and restrictions placed up them by their parents cause unnecessary pain and suffering , but parents often know it is for their good .

12. i know not from personal experience as i most definently do not do illegal things and have never done anything bad , but from what i head from my friend who read on the internet , a good way to do this is get some acid and a metal barrel , fill it up , and put the body in

20. tell him and see his reaction . if he is such a great man that wants to be with you , he should have no problem sticking up for you and making sure his family understands that that behavior will cease . if he reacts in their defense and does nothing , you know it  s not worth pursuing . mommas boys are a serious no  no for me , good luck .
