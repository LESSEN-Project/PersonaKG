4. k so that confirms i am one of those extreme outliers in rng that gets to just watch others enjoy rewards because all rares and chests this expac have ever given me are a toy and two weapon mogs . yaaaay gambling ! good on all of you tho for downvoting my comments regarding my actual ingame experience .

6. wicked is definitely not bad is just that i hate gold , if they could at least have changed the sigil to another colour , i would definitely buy it . but so far i will just wait for a good leblanc skin to come .

7. not sure what you meant by that ? i was just letting you dig your hole of assumptions until you finally called me a carnivore . felt good to throw that one back in your face .

11. good question , but i doubt that ruby and sapphire instantly becomes less mentally intimate when they choose to unfuse . and just ask greg about how both mentally and physically intimate a gem can be with someone without fusing .
   (ID: 164ef39b0b5e3089c409b28b5fc228cddb653bf1)

12. it ' s just so good .

13. here my fellow will smithers the description of this pack is just  minecraft is good and all , but it would be a whole lot better if there were more will smith themed blocks  .

14. maybe one day i  ll be good enough to sell my paintings . but for now i just either keep them or give them to friends .

15. i should of known that the prices for these pokemon ones were too good to be true . they are quite hard to get hold of here in the uk , so fraudsters have filled the gap in the market by flogging these fake ones . ebay will be on your side to and help you and get you a refund if you receive a fake , it is just a lot of hassle that is probably best avoided !
   (ID: 03bd0b4bb3465eba83e1c9a00af15f7b35f1ec6d)

16. good idea ! i might just have to give it a post .
   (ID: b1bca94f8857aebe93a83d1efba4600bf5b4109d)

17. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .

18. there ' s a few good youtube videos on it . watch mark kermode revisit on the film , where he feels more warmer to it . take a look at ' the philosophy of cloud atlas , how beauty will save the world ' and the in  depth analysis by ' the angry hippo ' such a shame the film is so polarising . as jim broadbent ' s character says " if you extend your patience for just a moment , you will find there is a method to this tale of madness "

19. ooh good point . just because something or someone has left you , there is still the emotional trauma left behind . i have no idea what that trauma would amount to when it comes to an extra sliver of someone else ' s evil soul inside another .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

20. life must be good for you , not talking shit in anyway . just saying appreciate it
