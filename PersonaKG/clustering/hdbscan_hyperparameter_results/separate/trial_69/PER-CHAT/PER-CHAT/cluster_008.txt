2. the humans are engineers and their goal is to survive until time runs out . they can use anything they want to do so except for sentry guns . the zombies are medics they need to kill every engineer before time runs out , and every time they kill someone they turn into a zombie as well . the medics can only use melee weapons .

3. if you  re in the position to not work , enjoy your friends as much as you can . it  s also a great time to find more about yourself as an individual , what your interest are and hobbies you might want to try !

4. my mom once went to a popeye ' s where the service was really slow and there was bulletproof glass separating the cashier from the customers . the service was so slow that a guy who was waiting in line was able to watch a few episodes of daredevil in the amount of time it took him to get his food . my brother wanted to leave , but my mom had already paid for our chicken and she didn ' t want to trust the dumb kid behind the counter with her credit card again . the moral of the story is that you shouldn ' t go to popeye ' s restaurants in the ghetto .
