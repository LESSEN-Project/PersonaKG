   (ID: 009af0be6850d8d1ff9d388a3c7f39f0f7727594)

   (ID: d1e6050d6d7638f6662249831925c3a9185f210b)

15. hmm . that  s funny . i thought it was the transphobic people who respected emotions over scientific research and proven fact , how strange .
   (ID: 9d6763f3caa1ca2559f1a3c525c70ffea81a61c2)

16. exactly what i thought when i found this . if it were that tasteless to let non  asians wear traditional asian hats , why stock them in your store for non  asian people to buy ?
   (ID: 6cb8904cf2faf74f712ddb1c620007fe43bf46df)

17. cory in the house . people should be forced to watch it , greatest show ever made , game of thrones ? no thank you .
   (ID: 09c182da66e9fb276d5bb24506e24997b2c988b0)

18. how the hell do people come up with this ? the thought behind it is interesting .

19. well there are very few black people , and we use it to refer to our other brown friends . and yes , it id illegal , since we do have hate speech laws
   (ID: 8a0d7d262d95d9c10d914ff3b70f342e066aee23)

20. religion will always be relevant no matter how smart we become or how advanced our science and technology become because that doesn ' t matter to people who turn to religion as a moral compass . religion provides some sort of hope for those living in hard times as well . obviously , large portions of mainstream religions today are pretty fucked up , but religion changes . so that ' s my answer without resorting to reddit sarcasm and typical " hurr durr religioius people stupid " answers . i ' m not religious , btw
