4. that sounds like a good reason for them to avoid water .

5. doubt it . it  s hard to catch stocks at their bottom . and their track record seems to suggest they  ll keep making mistakes . if anthem takes off it could be a good bump for them though . there are better choices for undervalued stock out there , like baba

6. yeah im good at math , have it next sem though . i do like this one girl . also have a lot of friends .

7. i like everything but rap . the feeling depends on the song and what it reminds me of buy it ' s usually good
   (ID: 9e778023eda5589ac577e3789edfd900d208edf7)

8. my first shot , they took a moderate amount of work with having to slice up the huge piece of skin i bought and having to cook them in the oven , then fry them . they are more like cracklins than puffy pork rinds , but i sprinkled some cajun seasoning over them and they taste pretty good

9. to me it ' s the other way . the good place  rupaul and anime . whe i notice he doesn ' t like it i watch them by myself
   (ID: ada1c58d3912eca495d67d2d0e9c955934d17ac3)

10. absolutely ! it ' s such a good show . watching the characters come to their own conclusions whether they be true or false is really interesting . if you like broadchurch , i recommend fortitude .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

11. obviously great depends on your definition of great . if you like social programs and high life satisfaction levels , you have scandinavia . if you like crushing everyone else with money , media , and military might then america is pretty good .
   (ID: 164ef39b0b5e3089c409b28b5fc228cddb653bf1)

12. you proved my point . you have no reason to hate america  americans . we have good terms with nz and you haven  t lived here , meaning you have no clue what it is like .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

13. thank you gunther  w for chiming in . i like the design concept of the coils but i kinda figured they might be " too good to be true " i ' m not sorry i tried them , but i really like the starre with their stock coils more .
   (ID: 6778aa4e3cf401044823c475db231fc0b1d0ff4b)

14. yeah you ' re good . if it ' s hitting high 80s use some software like afterburner to set a limit on it . you should be fine though .
   (ID: 1885b01dd0970230fea2a9c9ae9c4eaeaceb59a3)

15. remember , there ' s nothing wrong with playing both . drawing more cards is almost  bloody nekusar always good . if you ' re playing mono  blue bounce i ' d probably recommend going with both , since you can abuse both sets of triggers as much as you like .
   (ID: 3ec63b32347ee3c6c40243b31c1e207e926f7656)

16. yeah , perhaps  asshole  is too broad  someone who is nice to his gal but is a dick to other dudes , starts fights and so forth . some women like that action because it  s assertive although assholish . but then you have the antisocial who isn  t nice to anyone . that person stays single . you also have guys who are decent , civil , and assertive in a good way , until they lose their very short temper and get physical . that  s the most tragic
   (ID: 6409e8e0fceb3f9cf59ffcfb7e4f09f6f9fa57a2)

17. yea it sounds like you care about her . as long as she isn ' t fat that is . good luck with everything . i hope you realize how to love somebody for who they are on the inside and not worry so much about what ' s on the outside .
   (ID: 8a45584f421735874a74f108ab7578f85dee40cd)

18. seems like a good plan but the ammo depot and arms rooms aren ' t one in the same . also . that ' s alot of camo zombies .
   (ID: 5d850afd337787a97ade9b037c2a04f0cf830e83)

19. i like keeping a good girl .
   (ID: 3fb7fd62eac31dd8823db2c71d8359cdbbbe3399)

20. good question . seems to me like they might be able to answer quite a few of the questions around this case by discreetly placing a camera to catch whoever is desecrating the grave .
