1. not sure if you ' re being sarcastic or not , but it was just a question . i searched around and couldn ' t find much except what has already been mentioned . i figured i would ask the reddit community for their input . also i play on console , i don ' t think there are too many hacks out there to increase my magicka , but thank you for your suggestion .

3. i understand . i  m just not much of a lebron fan , so it  s hard for me . also don  t think he  s even close to the goat . best of this era ? sure .
   (ID: f90b0d899acf3c82adaa55fb250d0c7ea9eaeaf3)

4. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids

5. i think an article to secure freedom of speech should at least have a provision where you cannot lock somebody up for political reasons i . e . having the wrong political opinion or for offence  related reasons . that ' s just my view . i don ' t think governments should control our speech because then they inevitably control our thoughts . if a government cultivates what is politically correct , for instance , that tradition of speech becomes part of the very culture , and it restricts the scope of the consciousness .

6. losing partial  full control of myself is a scary concept that i don  t think is just limited to me . you do you tho
   (ID: 8ea8e4a00c3f2a64096e00bdbba0247e580cdb17)

7. don ' t think that ' s the case . this mentions nothing about an injury here , just the marine ' s takedown and then how he was restrained . the robber was put in handcuffs , with no mention of needing medical attention .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

8. i don ' t think others are wrong , per se , mine just works for me . the whole " faith " thing .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

9. probably similar to chyna with just the   opening   mlk day so maybe not opening the show graphic . i don ' t think there would be too much backlash with the whole innocent until proven guilty thing .
   (ID: c08743855177b68f06df5b7637db6f3e62f0baff)

10. i guess i just don ' t see where this is going ? i don ' t think a single person has agreed with you . maybe you should try it and post your results .
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

11. yes it would be , he already feels lonely for not having a girlfriend . what do you think his friends leaving will do to him ? you might just push him to complete loneliness and sadness . i too have never had a girlfriend and my friends are my emotional support so i feel him . he needs you guys please don ' t leave

12. the game is too big to die . with all those mods , you can even play just terraria for your entire life . maybe the hype might die and player base will be lower but i don  t think it will die .

13. sorry mate , i don ' t think your theory will find any traction . it ' s just not as funny as the prof . grinding them into candy
   (ID: 63d10997998d584afaae51f9374109eb470c1495)

14. i don ' t think looks matter that much   they aren ' t hiring you to be the hostess . if you go to one upscale place and get a test  try to remember the questions so that you can have answers for them at the next place . once you get the job , it is just a matter of memorizing the menu selections . stay upbeat   you can do this ! there is great money to be made .
   (ID: b59db07693bd6d890ec094bc28cb98d1e322c549)

15. i think you should have pride that you haven ' t slept around alot . but not in a way like you are better than any one else just i guess in a " i respect myself " type of way . which is why i don ' t think you should just fuck someone for practice .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

16. i don ' t think so . i remember hating it as a kid , but i just watched the trailer and will definitely watch it as soon as i can . it seems interesting now ahah buuut . no , it ' s not what i ' m looking for . thanks tho

17. homosexuals are still able to pass along their genes , just not in the ' traditional ' sense . i think it was , but i don ' t think it is any more .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

18. i think i am too , just less violent and more obsessive . i don ' t think it ' s any better for me . though despite that i like to think i ' m a fairly positive person despite what my clothes and music tastes would tell you , though unless you listen to metal you would be surprised to find how many normal  ish metalheads there are .

19. so just because you disagree with it , you think it should be okay to censor it ? don ' t you see how slippery of a slope this is ?
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)

20. but in reality we are all the same race . society has just got super hung up on the pigment of your skin color . to become racist must be either influanced by somone , or having a super negitive experince with someone of that race . i don ' t think someone is born racist .
