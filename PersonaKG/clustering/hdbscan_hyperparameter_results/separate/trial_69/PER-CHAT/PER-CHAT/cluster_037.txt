1. it is not the same because as white people we have not been the victim of systematic oppression and fetishism and our worldview does not allow us to understand the experiences of people of colour because we are in a privileged position where we have not dealt with the obstacles faced by poc , so who are we to invalidate what this girl has to say ?

6. the study doesn ' t say you can ' t be fat but fit , it says societies can ' t be fat but fit . here ' s where the article contradicts its own thesis . " the idea that large numbers of people can be obese and yet metabolically healthy and at no risk of heart disease was wrong " the study explicitly makes no distinction between athletes and couch potatoes and treats them as the statistically significant thing . what garbage . " dr . rishi caleyachetty , who led the study , said it was true that weightlifters could be healthy and yet have a bmi that suggested they were obese .  i understand that argument . bmi is crude  but it is the only measure we have in the clinic to get a proxy for body fat . it is not realistic to use anything else in a gp setting or in the normal hospital clinic . we have to rely on bmi measurements , however crude they may be ,  he said . " while bmi results for particular individuals could be misleading , the study showed that on a population level , the idea that large numbers of people can be obese and yet metabolically healthy and at no risk of heart disease was wrong "

8. i ' m not sure that abortion is the reason . most of our parents were in the " silent generation "  that group of people who grew up in the great depression but were too young for wwii . the greatest generation crammed all their child rearing into the post war period and the result was the baby boom . the baby boomers are the moms and dads of gen y . i agree we are the best generation , though . i ' m proud to say that while the baby boomers partied in the mud at the original woodstock our generation rioted at the one they tried to put on for us .

15. i ' d say retail in general . but consider the experience the people you are asking have . most likely they are minimum wage employees who were placed in a department they have rudimentary knowledge of . if they have a vast knowledge of construction  plumbing  electrical  electronics , they wouldn ' t be working a minimum wage job unless something shitty happened to them .
