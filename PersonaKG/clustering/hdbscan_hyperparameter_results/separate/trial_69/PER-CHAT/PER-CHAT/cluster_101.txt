9. we ' ve been focusing on talking about prepping with friends , family and loved ones , especially because we ' re all going to be together in the run up to the festive season ! plus my partner wrote this awesome post on the sensible about how she used to grow food in just her dorm room . we ' ve now thankfully got a bit more space for our homestead than that .

11. it ' s a text message . if it was urgent , you should ' ve called , imo . we ' re all adults and we ' re busy living our lives . a text message just frankly isn ' t a priority .

12. dude , maybe i ' m just thinking with my shipping goggles on , but she was noticeably worried  caring for mirio , when he was depressed . as for her being into girls , i wouldn ' t put too much money on it . because the most would be lesbian interaction i ' ve ever seen in a pure shounen series is yoruichi and soi  fon , and even that never went anywhere

15. this is the exact reason we ' ve stopped having rats as pets , the missus just can ' t cope with the heartbreak of losing what are always awesome characters .
   (ID: f4cbaf1e6211e2f5122d4636f72579a5a30aaf0d)

16. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .

17. i ' m with your friend . i ' ve never seen any star wars movie . they just didn ' t appeal to me .

18. hey guys , great place you ' ve got here . something struck me , and i decided i need to go ahead and grow out what i can and see where it goes . most times i ' ve had some degree of facial hair , but anything of beard caliber seemed a far off dream . then i figured , " why not " any tips ? also , and this may be an odd question . based on what you guys see here , could you link me to a picture of a beard that looks similar to how you ' d anticipate mine coming in ? just figuring since you ' ve guys seen many beards start off here , you can kind of read where it may go to a degree . edit  my plan is to let it grow at least one month , sept . 1st .
