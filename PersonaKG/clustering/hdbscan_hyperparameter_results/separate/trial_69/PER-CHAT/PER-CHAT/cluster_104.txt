4. . that  s the only reason these movies get made . it  s a business . also have to take into account the audience sonic is aimed for . it looks like shit but the kids may like it . it  s also an established brand so the chances of it doing financially well are raised . plus you have jim carrey who has been in kids movies before . if this movie bombs there will be no sequel . so in conclusion it  s a gamble but a safe gamble business wise .
