   (ID: f37c6d73f88ae9488245dcae1da46589d182fa9b)

2. when you see a no soliciting sign , that is the easiest sale of the day , the reason they put those signs there , they know that they are suckers and will buy anything . remember pma equals opm , it means positive mental attitude equals other people ' s money .

   (ID: e9829c29404a911421b2b39c7ea7309cbcf3329e)

10. dont know you should ask the people living in my house
   (ID: 4dbd3fd527caa93836f895d72dfef9276ea4809f)

11. yeah i  m aware how english works  i mean , i am english after all . my point is that it seems odd to us how american english appears to jump between plural and singular and i  m giving an example where the distinction seems to me ambiguous . if radiohead is nominated for an award do they win the award or does it win the award ? i know the answer to this , but again this is an example of the inconsistency which seems odd to english people .
   (ID: ed9fd9ff218602605c7fbdf8f02f658604680c61)

12. i love eating healthy , and i love exercising , but i also know that in most cases forcing the idea upon people , doesn ' t motivate them to do it .
   (ID: 74934e2c953c123f08b11f7169947c5981ebb879)

13. i know they ' re better people than me , because they wrote that , but i would have drawn a massive dong .
   (ID: 5173a1d5475490650d7365b2c2b2f2c579d33099)

14. i haven had it but i know a lot of people really enjoy shit on shingles .
   (ID: b6567f005c34603036e6119544386ff4f12ec3a9)

15. people should know that teammates wants the best for their other teammates , even if yo ass is shit your teammates is still your teammates and they will revive you .
   (ID: 0382f59fbd685127c76fa5c09142ad60893db6ef)

16. all of those statements are wildly different from taking children to a circus . i ' m not condoning what happens to animals at circuses , but a kitten slaughterhouse is not something that was organized and operated for the entertainment of the common people . i know that you probably feel strongly about this , but you ' re being ridiculous .
   (ID: 40e7e4fcc325e808f67616071f736d382e20795c)

17. sorry to tell you this but people already know that the logo is part of the garage
   (ID: ed2d2ab477a99cff4d15f5f18a7d3662571d6e1a)

18. i would argue that it only works for guesses that the average person has some level of familiarity with . people know about how big a jelly bean is and about how big the container is and can do some mental math . some will be high and others will be low , but it averages out . if you showed people a model of a new bridge being built and asked the crowd for the thickness of steel needed on the center support , you would get wildly varying answer with an average nowhere near the actual answer . so asking the public to give their input on solving an actual problem , determining tax rates , military funding , educational standards , or any number of other things that are actually complex decisions , would not benefit from this effect .

19. you know you doin wrong reddit ? " something you know yowe  people are doing wrong " in a german grammar nazi voice
   (ID: b6f013c0bdbca04282e87d0e013063517d33e93b)

20. i know that this is a meme but people need to understand that there are different teams of devs working on anti  cheats and devs working on cosmetics , i know i ' m probably gonna get downvoted , but as long as the community doesn ' t understand this , games will get less support
