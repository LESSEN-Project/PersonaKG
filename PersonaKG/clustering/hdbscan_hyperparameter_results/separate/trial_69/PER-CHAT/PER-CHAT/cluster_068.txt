11. the button may be sticking it could be something underneath that ' s causing it . if you think it could be this , check out some youtube videos on how to take it a part . i had a trigger that kept sticking and once i took it a part and cleaned it , it was as good as new .

12. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

14. i ' m glad that they moved away from that . i think the floating words thing is used way too much in tv now . the first two examples that come to mind are sherlock and the good doctor .

15. the last movie i saw with my former good friend dawn of the planet of the apes i still think its a good movie , but it probably isn ' t as amazing as i remember it being on a rewatch , which is why i probably ' ll never grant it that

18. i think because it is , by definition , virtue signaling . " look at me i ' m being a good person i ' m going to film and post it on the internet for the world to see " . its basically doing the right thing for the wrong reasons .
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)
