1. i was just going to say , that design must have looked so futuristic at the time . americans saw the war ending , and then saw these leaps in technology and design . i ' m sure they thought that by the year digit we ' d all be living proper george jetson style .

2. cunningham ' s is very useful for learning new things . funny enough , the meta article about it on wikipedia refers to this as an example of how it works . i fully admit ignorance . i can ' t conceive of how different two window managers can possibly be , and i don ' t mean that in a snarky way . textpad is trivially different from notepad   to me , to the point that i have zero interest in trying any other text editors , much less develop my own from scratch or even slightly alter an existing one .

3. it sounds like you are already maintaining healthy behaviors . continue to be loving and pleasant to your mom but maintain your own life . do not allow yourself to feel guilty . identify what you are willing to do fowith your mom as a minimum each week , communicate that , and maintain at least that . talk to her about her wants and needs , and try to give as much as you can . maybe she just wants a phone call if you are out late to say you ' re ok . are you pulling your weight at home cooking and cleaning ? and remember , she is the only person aside from god who will ever love you unconditionally . she is going through a life change and needs to find more things in her life that makes her happy . maybe you can introduce her to some of those things , like an art class or genealogy research . good luck !

7. depends on your situation really . if you don ' t have debt , lease , and are unemployed and  or working at a replaceable job then its doable . even more so if you have some amount of money saved up . if you ' re moving to a city there are probably a lot of cheap hostels that you could stay at till you ' re on your feet , if you ' re trying to go entirely solo . if you have a friend or relative you could crash at for a while , even better ! as for a different country , i don ' t know , but i ' d imagine getting a job would be more difficult unless you have useful skills . may or may not be relevant , but if you join the french foreign legion , you can register under whatever name you want , get taught the language , and when you complete it you get french citizenship under that name . that would be the ultimate " start a new life " scenario i ' d think . i ' ve only read a little about the ffl , so i may not have all my facts straight , but i think what i said is right

8. i didn ' t know about the ice cap thing you mentioned , but i feel like governments should do what they can to try to minimize it , i think that we should work towards developing a way to harness fusion power and attempt to proliferate that around the world and that would solve nearly all of our energy problems and it wouldn ' t polute

10. first of all , maybe you can do some wiring , but please go back to english class . second of all , i have a very fulfilling life , but i have a kid asleep on me so i can ' t really move right now and i ' m trying to address the points that are made to possibly , maybe , help educate someone .

13. your argument is therefore  " there is one candy in the shop . i have a penny . some guy comes along , and tells the shopkeeper he ' ll pay a dollar for that candy . shopkeeper sells it for a dollar . " so , i can complain about why should i not get candy just because some rich people decided it ' s worth a dollar ? that ' s called socialism . the real question then is , if the city is getting richer and more propserous , why are these poor people still poor ? something wrong with wealth distribution here .

15. do you ever notice that the secretaries and paper pushers in those kind of positions are a bitch insensitive ? here they are notorious for not giving you all the information you need so you go do something they ' ve asked you to do and come back and then they said oh did they tell you you need to blah blah blah no they didn ' t so then you got to go do something else and make another trip it ' s crazy

18. the best thing is not to " find a trick to fool yourself into not buying things " but to look how much money you earn in one month and don ' t spend more than that . it is irrelevant how much your credit card lets you spend . what matters is how much you earn .

19. bad script writing . tip , get someone else to go over the script for you before you spend  digit million plus on sets and props . the sequence was not necessary in the end other than to show that people are making money off the war and the thin line between the sides apparently . thing is , one side destroyed the republic planet and kills their dad and the other side did not . confused yet ?
