2. nah , i get you don ' t like what he said . sometimes joking around can result in someone being hurt . but that is what talking is for . tell him you didn ' t appreciate what he said because of how you feel you have insecurities and he knows , but he loves you . and if he really loves you , all the cute girls could be there , and he wouldn ' t give a single fuck .

4. i do that at a lot of sandwich shops . most meat sandwiches don ' t have as much veggies as i like , so i get the veggie sandwich which is usually huge and have them add a little bacon or salami or another strongly flavored meat on top .

6. intellectualized , damn straight . their music is top notch , but you don ' t need to be smart to like them . i hate their fanbase more than their music .

7. a lol channel said that an update i don ' t like is getting reverted and made a very credible video about it , was very sad when i realised the date the video was posted on

12. see . this is my problem with this generation . in my day an adult in authority even if it ' s the photographer told us to do this for a photo i can promise you a vast majority of us would be giving the finger or the italian salute or picking our nose maybe even whip ' n it out , or something else vulgar and disgusting . not in unison like sheep doing what we were told to do . don ' t be sheep .

   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

16. many thanks for this insight . this is gold for me . it ' s bothering me that i don ' t seem to find anything from the public opinion or like articles about the topic . i ' m writing a paper about it and sadly there isn ' t much i can reference .
   (ID: 8e20173a96806d331c3c8933b7c10d5e4c27244e)

17. they don ' t like me for some reason . almost every single dog gets ready to attack me , barking and showing teeth then ever i go past it . confused owners keep apologising , that their dog never ever does that . so in my place , how can you ?
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

18. maybe you ' re nb ? maybe you still have to figure it all out ? you don ' t owe anyone an explanation . but it sounds like your friend is supportive no matter what which is the important thing .
   (ID: 5146a89965a734a4d1ec9ec9145abae872a4569d)

19. i don ' t really like doing business online , because you have to give them your bank data and stuff .
   (ID: e6c4a2b8e8c999b54ade342babc3d7b48868cc6d)

20. perhaps you don ' t understand what is going on . many mothers and sons genuinely like each other and enjoy each other ' s company . going out for a meal or entertainment is not at all uncommon and certainly not suspect .
