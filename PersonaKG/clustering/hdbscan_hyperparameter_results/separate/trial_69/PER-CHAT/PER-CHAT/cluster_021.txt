1. i like to watch you have a good time . nothing like the glee during the aftermath of some new trauma . it ' s interesting to see how much joy comes out of this fucked up shit .
   (ID: 50043497a219924fd275a92e5dadb6e04bac5936)

2. you ' re a pretty cool dad . sounds like your kids had a good time , which is the most important part . thanks for the spider  man review .

3. lager tastes different to me every time , if it  s after a very long hard day at work especially in good weather then it  s the best taste ever , other times it  s just so , straight after food it tastes pretty bad to me so i guess it is whatever to mood strikes me

4. it  s dogshit , but it has dinosaurs . so the real question is , what is your importance ratio between a decent movie and the presence of dinosaurs ? more than half the movie is set in a house . the action is crap . the characters are crap . the plot is crap with a capital c . the twists are predictable . the only interesting story thread is completely wasted for a last minute gag . the climax is essentially the same as the last jurassic world . it is a poo movie . a poovie . personally , i fucking love dinosaurs and dino related movies and i still found it to be a stinker not worth my time . the only good thing about it is that the ending opens up potential for the next instalment . i wouldn  t waste my time homie .

5. well that ' s actually a problem . i go incognito to watch porn and when i close i lose the page , and forget the name if it was a good one . its sad and i need to find a new one every time . if i bookmark i feel weird when i go over over it

6. my son use to get that shit all the time when they heard his voice but he was actually good and never quit . tell your little bro to tough it out and keep playing . that  s not a good enough reason to quit
   (ID: a92e31c7bf57848bffc03edea3f897eca709861a)

7. enter the void made me unravel a little bit the first time i watched it . in a totally good way . i will definitely check out the others !

8. why do you like to ask questions on reddit and waste your good time ?
   (ID: 1476398f6c778fb461539e3f78b07720d4ceee83)

9. it was kinda unbearable , but in a good way ?  i get exactly what you mean ! it  s like , what you  re doing feels good , but at the same time the area is too sensitive so it feels like too much at one time ? i was also confused by that the forst time i came , f17 too here btw !

10. you ' re saying that in order to come up with the simplest possible code of morals , throw out everyone ' s and just look at santa ' s views of right and wrong , from his time frame in his own eyes , only what he sees . alright . unfortunately , good and bad still don ' t exist . you can ' t pin down that concept . you ' re still looking at a code where the boundaries have been drawn essentially arbitrarily . if he has some book of law that dictates what is good and places everyone somewhere on a given spectrum , wherever the middle falls would still be up to him . this is partially why our legal system has the court system , to deal with those grey areas , someone a judge sits down and just makes a decision , coloring in the grey area and more precisely defining the middle . at the end of the day , it comes down to santa making a decision based on whatever is going through his head at the time .

11. i definitely agree with that boss and the kotor characters . seems like a good time to implement them since no movies are coming out so they could be filler characters .
   (ID: 2a4bb889e40b61bb1755181c2b46750d3a082604)

12. it depends , what games do you wanna play , target resolution , target graphics settings and budget . for most new builders watch paul ' s hardware , or biwit videos they explain their reasoning behind a build and prices at the time of filming , good luck

13. that really hit me hard man , but not as hard as that weed might have . at least someone else was able to have a good time for your sacrifice
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

14. solid picks . erased is ridiculously good , time travel isn  t a done enough genre if you ask me . attack on titan , baccano , durarara , and cowboy bebop are some of my other favs .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

15. awful , but your mom seemed to be having a good time , so it wasn  t a complete negative .
   (ID: e0f54d4b6c1ffd9d9c77682093d534d6de05cc9a)

16. depends on whether it ' s a good marriage or a bad one . a good marriage is like living with your best friend , but you also get to have sex with them all the time .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

17. goodbye . i hope that you hope you have hoped for a nice new year and hoped you hope for a good time doing things in the fun times of the new year this year .
   (ID: 0a08de06e76a94de47d869920611b82d8094e6ab)

18. 26m here . you basically just described me . so not alone ? though i also dont feel good about this ravenous pessimism toward dating either but can ' t shake the feeling that it ' s all a waste of time
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

19. first of all , how would time travel " write out " those characters ? i ' m not sure i understand  just need some elaboration . second , " easy " writing usually isn ' t good writing  it ' s lazy and uncreative . the russos are better than that .
   (ID: bb403667518ffc82f0508e3aee8741ea63cec050)

20. you mean this isn  t a mean joke ? what better way to be mean in this day in time than to jokingly suggest women are only good for their bodies ?
