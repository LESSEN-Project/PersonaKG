1. if your not doing pvp , which is sort of slow tbh , you need to kill these for the covenant rewards . they give spells , miracles , and rings which are required for digit separate achievements . for the infusion achievement i got every single infusion in the game and bought digit daggers and infused each one with a different infusion . you have to have all digit on one character , but you dont need it at one time . you also need to infuse it yourself , no lothric deep axe for you .

2. everything that you said is absolutely true . the most aggravating thing about the focus tree is the middle tree especially . oh you have to take digit focuses to get on with the tree ? ok . oh digit days wasn ' t enough ? how about digit different sub  trees that take another digit days to start . the war is almost long over by the time you get the claims on neighbors .

8. if you  re a melee character stand right in lorian  s face unless you  re using estus . simply dodge his sword to left and right and attack his back , works for both phases . keeping distance for a long time is risky because he has some deadly ranged moves , especially second phase , but most of his melee combos are only digit  digit hits and you can wack him whenever he finishes a combo
