6. wear the toughest full plate you can get your hands on and find a mudcrab . let it hit you over and over , casting healing spells to stay alive , or burning through low level health potions . save frequently , as this can sometimes cause issues with crashes though this has been very rare for me and because you may occasionally get attacked by something more formidable when you ' re not expecting it far more common . there ' s a good spot downriver , east of whiterun that i have used several times for this . you may also want to have a shield with you , as this is a good way to level block as well .

7. i can ' t help much right now , sorry , but i do want to point out that big doll eyes are very hard to trade for and you may want to find alternative contacts . looks good so far though !

10. in short , it  s your game . if you want to raise it up , do it . i can justify reasons to or not to either way , but if a perfect , max level onix or steelix would be something that makes you happy to brag about , do it ! that  s the beauty to this game . we all create our own goals and go after what we deem  good  fun  .

12. the class run is pretty good . the goal is simple , beat all bosses only using a starting classes equipment . if you choose mage , your stuck with that mail breaker , knights have their long swords , ect . its pretty fun for those that want more challenge without a lot if restrictions .
