4. at this month ' s office birthday party the muckety muck ' s were talking about recycling and reclaiming garbage . i almost shared the story of my town ' s garbage man red johnson . see , ol ' red had an eye for garbage . and if he liked something being thrown out he ' d take it to the cab  which is the reason he never packed a lunch . but i stopped myself . i don ' t know these people well enough if they have the kind of sense of humor necessary to put up with my smart assery .

6. ok . ay ? but whatever you do you must convince bullets , pendulums , sky and horizon to behave exactly like on a ball . also some examples of people losing jobs and photos of these death threats please . and what do you mean at the end ? in which way does zooming prove flat earth ? second , you answered part of my question , we still don ' t know what ' s the purpose of all this . don ' t try to convince me it ' d be too long , the answer would fit in one sentence .

7. it takes over literally every aspect of your life . everything . it gets to a point where you literally have to put yourself before anything else . it can seem narcissistic to people who don  t know what you  re going through , but when it comes between wanting to blow your brains out and everything else , it  s an easy choice . hopefully

9. i ' m a vegetarian if i don ' t tell that to everyone around me , they will feed me something which i don ' t eat . so the reason behind vegan brag about the veganism is this . especially in india . people here are both , non  vegsome days vegsome days in week so it ' s mandatory to know the people around vegs people to stop ordering non  veg for veg . my point is clear .

11. i don ' t disagree . i ' m inclined to believe there was some affair seeing how terry has never publicly acknowledged it , and bridge clearly has a grudge against him , but i don ' t know how much of the story is true , and neither really does anyone except from the people involved .
   (ID: c08743855177b68f06df5b7637db6f3e62f0baff)
