15. not me but my friend got high off of inhaling a dryer sheets . he did it as a joke cuz he found it in a sleeve . he told us that the entire day was just gone from his memory and the day prior as for some reason he went to another high while we were walking home . he said it ' s pretty terrifying and he would never wish it on another person .

16. me and my friend did this , only problem was his clutch was totally different , i ' m used to hitting the friction point after barely releasing mine . his is almost all the way out . we swapped the light turned green , he stalled out a dozen times . i just dumbly sat there slowly inching the clutch out .

17. behavior data analyst with kids on the autism spectrum . on the whole , i found i no longer agreed with applied behavioral analysis the way i thought i did . we never bothered to find out the reason why the kids were doing things outside of broad reasons , and we just extinguished the behavior . it just felt very . inhumane , a lot of what we did .
   (ID: b8935e64705419fa81f156d0d29b88ffd1e2f443)

18. hahaha . i did this at work , simply tried to force a fart that wasn ' t a fart . ended up running home and yelling to my roommates " omg i literally just shat myself " . then i walk into my room and see my landlord showing some of my friends the house .

19. did you happen to take the trump " media accountability survey " or whatever that gets reposted here a couple times a month ? i almost took that survey but quickly realized they just wanted to use my anger to get my email address and didnt submit my opinions .
   (ID: c06c11f9a6fb4f8cc63a646bb02679d0b38166c2)

20. i just did a research paper in this . when you accept their terms of service , you agree to let them track other activity on the wifi source . at one point while facebook was active , you probably got a text or call allowing facebook to see your number and it  s activity while on the wifi
