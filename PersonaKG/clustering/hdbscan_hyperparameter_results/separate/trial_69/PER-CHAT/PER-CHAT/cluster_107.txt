2. sometimes yes . not always . as someone who has worked in ombudsman escalations for numerous years , i ' ve got a pretty cool output when mad . the phrase " calm down " triggers my angefrustration as it ' s a blanket phrase that is used when the other party is shutting you down and dismissing your thoughts and  or feelings .

6. i ' ve always been a fan of star wars , but my parents would only let me watch the ot and the phantom menace ? eventually i learned most of what happened in the other movies from lego star wars  the complete saga or the clone wars , so i never got around to watching them before now . i understood the context of the memes and , tbh , the cult  y  ness of this sub was entertaining enough for me to subscribe . now it holds much deeper meaning . i love it .
