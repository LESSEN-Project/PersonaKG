6. i think izuku has what would have been a useless quirk . but , piled on ofa , it will be the key to unlocking some future potential . there ' s a precedent for something like that later in the manga but i don ' t want to post it in a comment without op ' s concent .

8. those are great points . maybe after a year , next summer , i could consider orienting in the er , if i think it  s worth it  doable . i definitely want my sanity if i want to last ! and i don  t want to risk losing the amazing position in the micu . having a life outside of work and school is incredibly important to me , too . thank you for your reply !

9. you think nobody has ever typed out a bunch of paragraphs telling me to shut up before ? i ' m not going to stop and there mods abandoned this sub years ago . you ' re the one who opened up a comment that was downvoted into oblivion , don ' t open up comments that have been buried if you don ' t want to read them .

10. i think that cheating should be some sort of crime . if you make a commitment , you stay true to it . if you don  t want to honor the commitment don  t have a relationship with someone who does want a commitment

11. definitely nta but your bf is because if he can ' t respect someones boundaries  consent than that says a lot about thew kind of person he is . i really don ' t think you should have kids with this guy and while i don ' t want to get all up in your personal life ' do you really want to be with a guy who doesn ' t understand consent and the meaning of the word no ?

12. i don ' t even want to start unraveling this mess of a post , i think we are done here .

13. well i don ' t think i can convince you if you don ' t see it , but for me , it ' s more about them becoming too human . and i associate digimon with much more human  like creatures mostly because they talk to you  i never made it far enough into the show to get to machine guns and stuff . i ' m a biologist , so i love animals , and i want my pokemon to stay animals . if it ' s based on a cat , i want it to be a cat , not some human  cat hybrid looking thing .
