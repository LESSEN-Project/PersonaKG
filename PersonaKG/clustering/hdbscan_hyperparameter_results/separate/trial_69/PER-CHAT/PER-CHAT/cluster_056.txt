1. i got downvoted on similar posts showing the math too . i dont think people understand the levity of what etsy is going to change .

2. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .

3. i also got a message from what i think is the same guy . the dude is probably on this sub , looking for people to harass . what a sad human being .

4. my uncle said all pot smokers smoke menthol cigarettes . he also blames poor modern family dynamics are because of pot . my grandma said pot smokers are bad people , lazy , and can  t believe we  re all able to vote about it now . so i asked them what went wrong when they tried it . neither of them have ever tried it so i told them anything they think is invalid and it started this huge fiasco

5. yeah i think people may find my emblem of a crackpipe and ' meth  man ' disagreeable

6. if this is a fan given award lebron ' s gonna win it , so many people would vote for him without caring about the others and after watching all the videos i think donovan , lebron and dwight powell are actually the ones who deserve the award the most

7. do you think there ' s any major difference ? i mean with the way people treat you and all ?
   (ID: db2795e3479f3abf3fd16c22a2bea9450ad82357)

8. think long and and about the history of black and white people in this country . now tell me . why do you think it ' s not considered racist ?
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

9. do you have any proof for who is bot ? you people keep saying that reddit is full of russian trolla and bots , yet you dont shoe any proof whatsoever . i think the collusion story has really left a mark on some people to the point of that they see russians and collusion everywhere

10. because to you it  s not what one says but how he says it that matters . people voted for trump for his policies not because they think he  s cool and likes the way he speaks . no surprise why those who think obama is cool hates trump .
   (ID: 6409e8e0fceb3f9cf59ffcfb7e4f09f6f9fa57a2)

11. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

12. i think a lot of it had to do with inflection . you can interpret something written in a lot of ways . context helps , but people can mistake sarcasm for an insult pretty easily .
   (ID: 278d993cc7cf4f580f0ac9ab56ebf8cb5637a6c4)

13. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

14. there ' s someone for everyone  they ' re out they ' re waiting you and all other shitty variations to give people false hope . to me it ' s better to think " if it happens , it happens "
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

15. agreed , i think this list shows how far reddit has its head up its ass . people joke about the hivemind but this list really shows it
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

16. sometimes i wonder what people who look at my post history  profiles on the internet think of me
   (ID: 194714d1fdaeadcdfa8c031ea9ba02536763b6bf)

17. pescatarian i think is the term people use .
   (ID: 40a3b3e3ead468881f7392ff22e867f06207755d)

18. if you hold people to impossible standards , you ' re going to be disappointed . what if the perfect man for you isn ' t exactly " hollywood handsome ? " you ' re excluding a lot of people because you ' re too picky . also , you might not be as great as you think . if you ' re so great and you ' re still single , there might be a reason . maybe your personality .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

19. so you think people should not be vocal about their opinions ? i should not share my opinion because it is vulgar ? i  m not trying to be directly rude to you here , but if you were a random stranger i would tell you to fuck off . what do you do then ?
   (ID: 2f90bc4ddc8ea7b4aa70e550371ca36c812f636f)

20. people often hide names in screenshots , i think it is  was against the rules to include them .
