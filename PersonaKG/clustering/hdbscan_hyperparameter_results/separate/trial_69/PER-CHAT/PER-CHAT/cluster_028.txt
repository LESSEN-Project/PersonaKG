   (ID: 727005d2be64ad8719921d081ef3d5b06c835375)

3. hmm , this is fairly strange i must say , however there is one more possibility . are you sure you haven  t already entered the dlc ? maybe you already got in . i suggest you go check the tombstone in the hunters dream that takes you to the dlc area and see if you may use it its across from the final chalice dungeon tombstone . if you dont know which one im talking about , the doll sometimes prays there as well .

4. i guess all i have to say is it ' s one thing to know how to do something , and another to know why what you ' re doing works .

   (ID: c639c5ad82360432c4a322b5880d2f58a9b014de)

7. i guess it depends on her personality . if you ' re worried about it , then it might not be the best idea . i say let her try it and see how it goes , if there ' s a problem let her know .
   (ID: cbed067932829315de162cb512843a4f6b1083b7)

13. this is the context before the quote  after a couple of times i tried greeting someone i knew but to no reply or even any looks , they tell me on messenger some days later that they thought it was rude to not greet someone they know . however in this context it ' s to some " dreamy " guy . " i saw insertname but he didn ' t see me . i feel bad because i didn ' t say hi to him but what if he saw me ? " fucking bitch .
   (ID: e4df3cd37235d06b1aac585875b524652bcbecc8)

14. hmm and would you say that when you choose to talk it ' s because you feel you have the authority on whatever it is you ' re talking about . that ' s there ' s no debate , you are right and if you didn ' t know for sure that you were you ' d be quiet instead ? outside is alright , but i have to every morning to take care of the chickens and the horse . do you do anything specific outside , gardening , hiking ?
   (ID: c916f127f4f3e275b37bb32e4a156325cab84540)

17. its okay if you haven  t played ds , as long as you acknowledge that piece of information . the idea that the reality of bloodborne and the reality of ds are one is pretty . stupid i must say . therefore its important that we establish a common ground of understanding , you know ? to put things into perspective , you wouldn  t start a race facing the wrong way would you now ?
   (ID: 05b66d977b603757baf68e2315ea2e5970865864)

   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)
