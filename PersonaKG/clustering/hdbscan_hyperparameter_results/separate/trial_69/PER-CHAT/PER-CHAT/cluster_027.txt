   (ID: 1ab03d054f341c1ede82c7eb9f871db0a696e44d)

6. ah i see , i would be lying if i said i hadn ' t done similar things in the past aha . do you actually enjoy the music  dress sense you are " rocking " at the moment ? haha , or is the sole purpose of it to please this girl . because i know it sounds cliche , but you are better off just being yourself man

7. i know that ' s how it happens , but the placebo effect is effective sometimes . i ' m just saying that somebody is very religious will have more chance of believing they are being healed . so more chance of them actually improving .

10. we  d just talk shit about our friends and be happy we aren  t alone for now . yes i know this question wasn  t intended for teens . shut up
   (ID: 0e323710faccc9821d1ef265a6f9c574e3f4edde)

11. i figured but i know she has feelings for me . and we actually just talked about it and it  s fine the way it is , we are basically sisters , there is no need to date
   (ID: 72b6366221d77b2fc8bc314dd4ba65436ee466f1)

12. from how i read it , the guy just wants a few guiding tips on how to get better , lets face it , there is literally zero assistance . hopefully tutorials are next patch ! but on the other hand starting out , it ' s difficult to know what is what without external resources .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

13. just because you can ' t afford it or it isn ' t important to you , doesn ' t make it a ripoff . if the couple know what they ' re getting and i argue they typically do , it ' s legit . much better examples of ripoffs . edit  spelling
   (ID: 1f43afabf95308ba2ce8ed409ce10835352cb6a3)

14. " this work is just shit " you ' re more dead  on than you know .
   (ID: 146ba3bbe14ff1d86f402aca89bb0aacd7fc9196)

15. have to be honest , if i saw you in passing i ' d assume you are a " queen " who has all her stuff together and plenty of suitors . i guess this is a reminder to me that i can ' t assume anything , even if someone looks perfect to me  i just never know how they are feeling inside . thank you for sharing !
   (ID: 13a80daa16b50a35515cc7dd9a2f892770b9695a)

16. well , at least you know you can do it . it ' s just a pain in the ass to do .
   (ID: 535c3113ba487b9152c4b0adbe8c36822bc45ca4)

17. the gen z lingo .   x200b  " whats poppin bruh " " not much , i was just listening to some sick bop when the fam squad came rolling in with their swags drippin , and no cap they started popping off sick facts , and you already know those facts were lit so i wasn ' t big mad to be interrupted by their fire "
   (ID: 787f4a3fe31691883105c973a6b8e3df9df1436e)

18. so basically , i remember a story on nosleep about a married couple who couldn ' t produce a child because the wife was infertile , but then a succubus with violet eyes draining the man ' s life force to make a child for them but keeping just enough so that he can experience its childhood . i know it ' s a long shot but could that succubus actually be zephrina ?

19. you are a man of specific taste and i can respect that , but just so you know this isn  t a problem for anyone but you .
   (ID: 83ed088161a0acc5bb20774e9e10435e55e88737)

20. maybe she is pregnant . maybe she makes it to the wall next season and maybe she sacrifices her unborn child with the help of mel in some sort of ritual to resurrect jon ? that scene may have been for some greater reason that we ' re just unaware of as yet . or it could have been just for shock value , but we won ' t know for sure until the end of the series .
