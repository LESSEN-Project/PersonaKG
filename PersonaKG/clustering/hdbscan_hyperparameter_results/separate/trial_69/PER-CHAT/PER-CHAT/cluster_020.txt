1. there are two camps when it comes to the disabled , there are those who want to be treated normally and those who want special treatment . if i was blind and my eyes looked like his i would laugh at the joke that i made . that ' s why i made it , in case he ' s not oversensitive .

2. well heres my opinion , the guys probably very paranoid of you cheating on him , im not saying you would but thats what it looks like . heres what you need to do , if you want to stay with him id explain how hes the one and hes over reacting . tell him that you need some breathing room to do whatever you want but that youll always come back home to him . you should only unblock the guy when he understands to give you space . if you feel like things arent working out anymore because of trust then youd definitely be in the right to break up with him . thats what id do atleast

   (ID: fe4ddb52a6f20437e3f3c6003b775cb72c3d048f)

7. not trying to console or anything . but when you started your sentence with , " i have a theory " , i was like okay , " this is the type of girl i want to talk to " your personal description of your physical appearance pretty much flew out the window .
   (ID: 7f3ed7262bf05d9d101b2b917869b90e43710a7a)

8. it ' s yours so you can do what you want . like other ladies have said , you should get it appraised , then sell it or regift it . you ' re not obligated to keep a gift , no matter who gave it to you .

12. in the days where everyone wants access to free information , we have plenty of sites to provide that access . sites like documenting reality , liveleak , goregrish and best gore . they help preserve the legacy of what rotten was . it ' s not some sicko fetish like reddit seems to misinterpret . we want to be reminded of how bad the world can get , so we may appreciate our own lives and those of everyone else .

   (ID: b5942acb07bb8a74e4924ef75fa70edb4f626161)

15. okay great , but you ' re missing the whole point . obviously i dont want that either , but in the scenario where we had to give up pokemon which it seems like we are living in , which ones could you part with ? i doubt that you personally love every single pokemon equally .

19. thank you ! it  s honestly very dehumanising . i want a breast reduction but i now feel like men only find me attractive because of them and not because of my face .
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

20. i  m sad . sometimes i eat too much and guilt myself over it and get sad about everything in my life . it  s like an excuse to ignore my work and then focus on the sadness , cause pity is easier than owning up to anxiety and obligations . i  m sad and i want to cry , but there  s nothing to cry about . i like to feel bad for myself because it  s easy , but it  s an excuse . oh well .
