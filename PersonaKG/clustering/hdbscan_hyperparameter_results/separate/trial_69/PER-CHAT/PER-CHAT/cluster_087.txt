1. is it just me or is it really annoying when people go to schools they can  t afford and then blame the system for being in debt for the rest of their lives ?
   (ID: 8b20a772d1697ecc1b19f9f6451e7346e8b98987)

2. are you just downvoting people not conforming to your sensitivities ! we are the people you asked for " help . i was right
   (ID: cd0b72d117bf74908c3edaaf3947b089a9dafc0c)

3. that ' s my main deal lol . it ' s not a bad release by any means , people just gonna hate either way because they aren ' t accustomed to punk music or hell , maybe they aren ' t into anything other than just rap or hip hop and it ' s sad to see .

4. you could just unfriend  delete the annoying people off of your feed , it leaves you with the people you actually give a shit about and means you can still at least have an active account should you need to use it in the future .

5. lmao what the heck dont let people tell u what to do this is reddit , this place is filled to the brim of people who just wanna start dhit because theyve been bullied their whole lives .

6. haha , grammar nazis . i was just sharing that i was attending the show . people share that they go to house shows and events held in someone ' s garage , so how is this different ?
   (ID: 3790e844e04694d48c253f7aee4d3b61f116d4d6)

7. weirdly , giving compliments to the people around you even if it  s just in your head sometimes . it makes you realize that pretty much everyone is beautiful in some way and that you are a part of everyone .
   (ID: a815d9b5c98aef3203b8f4f74528072fb989f0b1)

8. the voice change really got me too , though i was never that self  conscious about it beforehand . do you actually yell at people out of anger now , or do you mean that you  re just more willing to raise your voice because its changed ?
   (ID: 129ef8c0c15772442f28ff253ba4d16a19caef46)

9. obviously , this argument doesn ' t hold and it  s simply a case of people being irked that non  whites are finally being represented in a larger way . i surely hope you aren ' t assuming that just because somebody is unhappy with one specific historically  incorrect aspect that they do not care about the others . just because somebody isn ' t actively advocating against every historical inaccuracy at any given point doesn ' t mean they ' re using it as a front to deny non  white involvement  most people do acknowledge the participation of smaller groups in the war , but simply find the representation to be statistically inaccurate . i would ask these individuals what they consider of other historical inaccuracies in the game before framing them with what is implied to be a racist undertone .

10. ok ? what will he be doing on the pc ? is he a content creator or a gamer ? also , no disrespect just wondering , if you  re asking people on reddit for specs how do you expect to build it yourself ?
   (ID: 6f291f3688a3a398f92cd165b10b1d3796d86840)

11. well i guess there are many people fapping at the same moment so i guess jesus just can ' t watch them all .
   (ID: b9e4d29ec48fd90198919bb6298d71519e5423e6)

12. just leave a picture . people will understand .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

13. it isn ' t . it ' s just the crappy people that you ' re talking to .
   (ID: 6adb1b89bb74c203724e574d02e0735080effe2c)

14. weird flex but ok is supposed to mean  oh , that  s a pretty odd thing for you to brag about , but ok  . but people stopped using it for that reason and just started saying it in a bunch of posts for no reason
   (ID: d10c10d39129e1768465d09c5c492657be31ef47)

15. we can have a healthy control meta without any counterspells . people dont care about board swipes but counter spells that won ' t let you cast anything is just awful .
   (ID: e6359b877efa1250fe2c10f65ddfd7cb1bef1a9e)

16. i read it already . if people ' s dogs are getting out to do that , it is not the fault of the dog . it is the fault of the owner for failing to look after the dog properly . for that reason , why should i have to put my dog through such an unnecessary procedure ? it is selfish and irresponsible to put an animal through that just because it makes you more comfortable .
   (ID: 03e00c6684f9fe5cb2996bc794372ee9a7a2aea8)

17. if you look in game it is actually " w33 . haa " that ' s why people refer to him just as w33 sometimes
   (ID: 2b77ba529bcde4fc6880b1e5da5dfc3eb15e35e4)

18. seriously . some creeps just come to this sub to look for people to shame  ridicule to elevate themselves , calling them " trashy " even if they aren ' t in this picture
   (ID: e9d73d2eb8490cec3e668bda1db9e716a061d73d)

19. the vampire diaries the first couple of seasons were great but then the storyline got all kinds of stupid , people just refused to die they ' d find some way to bring them back . disappointed because i loved that series at one point .
   (ID: 1f61921525978b0c5bcae6c0ab9c184a4d4c86a6)

20. haha just fucking with you buddy . couldn ' t help myself . my advice , ignore the haters , there will be plenty of people that agree and disagree with you . people are going to troll regardless of opinion .
