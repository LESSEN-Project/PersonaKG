3. i love all your cosplay . hoping that zelda cosplay is in the works but every time you post and your are just yourself , you have this amazing glow that is beyond attractive . it touches my soul and is just a huge turn on .

   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

7. not nerd passion , just it cynicism that the netcode will take time to fix , so no need to bring it up in every suggestion .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

8. due to the blatant disregard to what happened . why risk your job after working there a year and lose the reference for future jobs ? why choose a place that would inevitably get you caught and fired ? the fact that he couldn ' t stop laughing after he was busted . he could have easily been an asshole who just doesn ' t care , but he never really gave that impression during the time i knew him .
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

9. it ' s a waste of time . i start to smell , so i take a shower . then just a few weeks later i start to smell again  the showering experiment has failed miserably .
   (ID: 8b2d23a7a28e92326ee55ed240542b456b58fea1)

10. thanks for explaining . i can understand employees wanting to get paid for the work they ' re doing , but that seems like a really harsh punishment for just a minute or two of time .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

11. just time my friend . time heals all wounds .
   (ID: faebbe18abd4d1c69e3bb9106178f797255444c5)

12. any other event  well , let ' s just empty my ap . lottery events  life ? nobody got the time for that !
   (ID: a7c43585a162702d781f863c7a20194f8fcaaf55)

13. just go dude . one day you  ll regret not spending enough time with family
   (ID: d1e6050d6d7638f6662249831925c3a9185f210b)

14. nah i just read it wrong the first time and thought the grammar was all wacky , it doesn  t have anything to do with nnn
   (ID: 57566e418da3ba7bb3e33d1def44eaef175b88e9)

15. it  s kinda just luck , one kid got eliminated within one period of the game starting cause he hangs out with his assassin quite often , while my original assassin could never get me because she never ever has any interaction with me of any kind throughout the day . information is key and as the game progresses it  ll be easier to sus out the chain of who  s after each person . i ended up top ten because i played defensive and spent more time hiding from my assassins than going for kills until the literal golden opportunity arose .

16. at least you can play it . every time i join an ongoing match , my screen just stays black , i can hear everything , i can move , can shoot but i can ' t see anything . but yeah , the introduction is kind of " lagged " .
   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

17. even in this sub . last time some dude stole a pic with the oops tag on it the entire sub ripped on that dude so bad . all memes should have a mark somewhere imo just to give credit where credit is due .
   (ID: 97f042c151ad751b2811d75ae69fd7feae42ed77)

18. it  s true that it is kinda a waste of time anyway , the problem is that instead of having fun wasting my time i just get depressed
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

19. also , just a suggestion , tell your nurse  doc before the baby is born but while you are in the hospital getting ready to deliver that this might become an issue so they are prepared to deny them any possibility that it might sneak by should they find out somehow when and where you are delivering . another suggestion might be to hire a doula . they are there to comfort you and relieve stress and to advocate for your wishes when it comes to delivery and your time in the hospital . just a for instance , if you should be sleeping and your hubs isn ' t there and the paperwork comes by to put the baby ' s name and other info on the birth cert and your nparents somehow end up being there having a doula and informing your nurses and docs that they may be there and trying to " help " you with the paperwork so you can rest , they will be blocked in a variety of different ways . just a couple thoughts . ps your parents are awful . i ' m sorry that you have to stress about therm when this should be an exciting and joyful time . go nc sooner rather than later if you see fit . the less stress on you the better .

20. haha i can ' t take credit for this theory , somebody explained it to me a long time ago with a lot more detail and they somehow tied it all in with the prince that was promised , dany possibly being the reincarnation of azor ahaii , jon becoming the night ' s king and somehow bringing peace to all of this . they also said some shit about white walkers not actually being evil just completely misunderstood , and there ' s a legend that the wall is just the icy remains of a massive ice dragon much larger than balerion the black . by the time they were done explaining i was just like woah keanu reeves voice
