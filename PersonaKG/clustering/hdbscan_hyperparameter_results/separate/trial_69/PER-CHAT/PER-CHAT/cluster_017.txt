   (ID: 9a13b21f54717da1499379b5cb0e991e82d4c90f)

14. its hilarous that this guy got downvoted for pointing out the truth . but , when you ' re drinking the bungie kool  aid . i guess you don ' t want to hear that .
   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

15. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

16. " in case you haven  t noticed , i ' m weird . i  m a weirdo . i don ' t fit in . and i don ' t want to fit in . have you ever seen me without this stupid hat on ? that ' s weird " i  m sorry i can  t hear someone mention him without reciting this lol

17. no . what i  m saying is check it if you do have intercourse . it  d be even better to not have intercourse if you don  t want kids or cannot afford the expenses , that makes sense . if you cannot afford kids yet get pregnant , you knew the risks and took them , you should have no right to kill the baby .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

18. yes but how to take so clear screenshot of the home page without all the other things on the screen you don ' t want on your screenshot ?
   (ID: e6e1db90a47dca83004beacbcc9004bec464c7d0)

19. it seems rather unlikely that a full  scale war will happen . no one knows for sure of course , but north korea ' s ultimate goal is state survival beyond anything else . the us will respond to any attack with the destruction of the regime , which is something they don ' t want to deal with . the concern is that if the us strikes thousands will die , and we will be left with a major refugee crisis .

20. well if you  re not trying to impede on their relationship why do you want to tell them ? you  re secretly hoping they feel the same way to leave their so . stop lying to yourself and don  t ruin a relationship .
