5. you don ' t have to feel guilty about it during the day either . if you don ' t enjoy being around people you ' re probably just an introvert , and that isn ' t something to feel guilty about . it ' s just an aspect of your personality , the same way loving being with people is part of an extrovert ' s personality .
