1. " fair game ? why do you think you ' re entitled to other people ' s stuff ? it ' s not yours , don ' t touch it !
   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

2. i ' m not the guy begging for karma tho , besides , you don ' t have to be a jerk about it , also , i think not even half the people here give a fuck about your 10k karma
   (ID: 4b127841179d58078b4fbc1377158cb136f3156f)

3. i think it changes for each person , which is why i don ' t think it makes sense when people talk about not " crossing the line " .

4. oh my goddddddd ! i feeeel your pain ! i  m sorry your mum put you through that ! but isn  t it so annoying when you  re out with friends and while they can wear anything and not look provocative , you need to be careful so people don  t think things weary  face
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

5. i agree porn isn ' t the healthiest  most ethical of things . but i don ' t think anyone has ever used the pornhub app to kill a room full of people because his penis was feeling extra tiny that week . priorities .

6. because when you ' re in rome you do as the romans do . unless you ' re obviously a tourist or you don ' t speak english at all , i think it ' s really rude to go out of your way to speak in a manner people around you can ' t understand . my wife does this to me in spanish when she wants to talk about someone we see while we ' re out or whatever and it annoys me to no end .
   (ID: f39e591889b6331bd255039773030c1b50c7e201)

7. no one is saying anything other than the footage was creepy . i don ' t understand what the deal is . are people not allowed to think it was creepy ?
   (ID: 88c35221745da41b29ff5b9f921026de5ccbb6c0)

8. these people are the definition of selfish . they don ' t think anything about their grandchildren , because they don ' t give a shit about them . they care purely for themselves .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

9. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

10. i think i  m a nice person , but i don  t let people take advantage of me nor the people i love . i become a lion if anyone hurts or is disrespectful to my loved ones
   (ID: d95d3548a9506e48c5310c85f3b2994820405e0d)

11. i disagree with this article . i think " thank you " and " i ' m sorry " are sometime necessary acknowledgements of the fact that someone else exists   a person who has their own thoughts and feelings and things to do . i don ' t expect my kid to feel some kind of heartfelt gratitude for me getting them a glass of milk but i do expect my actions to be acknowledged with a polite " thank you " . i ' m in favor of politeness as a social norm . by telling a kid that this is a situation requiring a polite action you help instill the fact that other people matter .
   (ID: 1293e72aa7301baf0ecb3a2509e46cdcca834cd9)

12. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

13. i think a lot of people who are at that point don ' t think anybody cares to listen to them , and they have thought that for so long , that it is very hard to reach out to anybody
   (ID: 4d69affb6415148eda5d5103b282ce15476169d5)

14. i went to one and while i do agree that it can stunt social growth when it comes to interacting with women the only reason it affected me is because no one asked me to hang out with them on weekends . all my friends hung out with girls outside of school , there was an all girls school next door . most people here seem to think that social opportunities don ' t exist outside the school gates but as long as my kids do then i can ' t see any reason not to send them to one .

15. it ' s a fun little demo to show people your watch , but i don ' t think it will improve the way you play at all . the ui is a little confusing , and the data updates a too slow for my liking . the only other thing you can do besides find portals is normal hack them , which can help you get gear easily , but is useless in the long run .
   (ID: c23be0b501278176a288ed6b3ab6669ac6b9896a)

16. how are you supposed to understand what people think if they only give you a surface level thought and you don ' t challenge them to go deeper ?
   (ID: 55e958406ffdbcda694b130569428e520f5e1063)

17. people are less defensive when they don ' t feel attacked . true . nepene ' s above comment addresses this quite nicely . i ' m curious what you mean regarding socialism   it ' s a catchy turn of phrase , but i don ' t think i completely follow .
   (ID: 17b8a304069d7530607e28f8e04d840e28be0d3e)

18. its more the " it ' s ok for me to have slept with a lot of people  have sex on the first date because i ' m a guy . but if a girl does it , she ' s a slut . " that ' s a problem imo . if you ' re not being hypocritical than i don ' t think it ' s an issue . i think there is some on the reverse too  " it ' s ok for me to have slept with someone of the same gender , i ' m a woman . but if a guy does it , he ' s gay . " basically  don ' t shame someone you wouldn ' t have them shame you for .
   (ID: 0dd32da9f7e822909c258818ed313736b958a15a)

19. first off , god isn  t real , there is no proof of any kind that god is real . however i don  t think you  ll ever be able to disprove him as well . there  s nothing wrong with gay people , if you think so you  re a bad person . since there  s nothing wrong with gay people there  s nothing wrong with gay people coming up when you think of a rainbow .
   (ID: 06fa10b621f97c2a4cf8f0194b3238e179bcbc8f)

20. what are you talking about ? you  re delusional . i  m one of the nicest people anyone could ever meet . what is it with you and  oh , you  re in a public space so someone is absolutely going to stumble upon you and your junk  . i wouldn  t be in plain sight , dumbass . what , do you believe that people have x  ray vision or some type of  masturbation radar  ? i don  t think so .
