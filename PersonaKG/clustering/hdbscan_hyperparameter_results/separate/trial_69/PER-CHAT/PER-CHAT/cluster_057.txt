4. no . okay , think about it like this  people are made up of atoms , and when you die your atoms go off and become other things . this means that every girl would most likely be made up of atoms that were once in a dude , so if you bang her you are technically banging a dude , and that ' s fucking gay .

5. i ' d like to think that . and i do tell myself ' well , at least you ' re not boring ' , but sometimes it ' s hard to deny that people find you weird , and not in an endearing way . such as when they wait until you ' re out of hearing range and tell someone else , who then tells you later on .

8. some stupid people think being gay is a defect are are trying to treat it . but , like i said , they ' re stupid .
   (ID: 4bb0a21212688dbc67fe64d6f42fca297fed4f4f)

9. i wish my answer was no but probably yes . there ' s still a large population of people in the u . s . that still believes places like fox news and breitbart are legitimate news sources and think trump is doing a great job .

10. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .

11. i do find it girly  " gay " to not be weirded out by a stranger covering you in lotion and rubbing up on you . how is that exclusive to those who are girly or gay ? that ' s fucking ridiculous . what do you think women and gay people are like ?
   (ID: 372e357e1e3acd2a4dea24aa56a5900a539a9e59)

12. i agree . do you think it ' s white people ' s fault that the number of black people in these fields is so small , like a lot of people think ?
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

13. banning liberals to reproduce , or atheists , or star trek fans ? i think op wouldn ' t agree with banning people from reproduction based on their beliefse . g . liberals , atheists . rather , stuff like passing on genetic defects or illnesses , not being able to provide for the kid , or having a violent criminal history all affect how the kid is raised . the things she  he mentioned in the post have to do with safety and health for the child being prioritized .   x200b

14. the staring . of all the things i found difficult over there , staring was one of the worst . you might think that being taught not to stare at funny  looking people is common for children around the world . nope . and what do you do when it ' s a parent and their child , staring and pointing together , like they ' re watching an orangutan at a zoo ?
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

15. i agree to an extent , but there are a lot of people who think like this
