2. " oh my god the feels " is right , heart every time i think about it . but the feels can ' t be painful as the ones in clannad after story which is another great example of having different feelings towards different seasons .

4. hero labs has all of the encounters pre built for 25ish dollars i think . it really save a lot of time in prep . roll20 has all the maps , lightning , characters ect . i didn ' t use the product , but if i were to do it again i would use this .

5. this shit has always happened to every team and will continue to happen till the end of time as for mayo , it could be a major loss but i think we had three mike lbs and not hightower has to step up and i think fletcher is pretty solid as well . i am excited to see what collins can do .

   (ID: ddf68ce7beaa491a2da885bdfe48a680bf990b37)

7. if the intent behind the action is to annoy another player and deny him from having a fun time . yes . yes i do think that should be bannable . and it appears that the devs agree .
   (ID: f00497cab5e262ea00a022394dce818ebb6c623b)

8. my first kiss was with a goth girl as gorgeous as you . i messed it up because at the time i had low self esteem and couldnt think she was in to me even though she was clearly into me hanging on me . also , couldnt drive and she lived far away . what i would give to have an alt  goth girl . it ' s like finding a unicorn and a leprechaun at the same time .

9. i guess the question should be are they saying " nice work " on objectively average work as a compulsion to be nice , or are they saying " nice work " to everyone any time their work is objectively above average ? that ' s the difference . i give a lot of compliments , but i never give one i don ' t sincerely mean . you ' re welcome to your opinion , but i think you ' re wrong .

10. i wouldn ' t worry . even if something came back on you , it would come down to the prosecutor . does he think he could prosecute you in a charge , and would it be worth it ? it would be pretty easy to convince him that a jury would let you off all day long . guilt or innocence means very little at times . you wouldn ' t be worth their time . no offense .

11. i think it was the first time i played the last of us , i absolutely loved ellie  s character and wanted to raise a badass kid like her . also , i felt the same way when playing god of war . so i guess if i ever have kids i  m naming them ellie and atreus

12. great work but do you think you could have done it in half the time if you had eaten clean ?
   (ID: 7542c8a6be5a118bef67d9539deb69c131fb4fbc)

13. i don ' t think the worst of people , and honestly i don ' t think poorly of the neighbor in this scenario as a person . i will still be faced with this day  to  day reality  i labor tirelessly , and he reads . is your answer , then , that in a communist society i would be comfortable with this scenario because of a general faith that my neighbor either has or will be as productive at some time in the course of their life ? won ' t i be able to ask him about that ? compare hours worked , lives touched , needs met , future plans ? and what happens if the result of those conversations is that we both acknowledge that i ' m a more productive member of society than him ? what mechanism keeps me from resenting him ?

14. well when you see that jk put mcgonagall in the recent movies while she wasn ' t supposed to be born at this time , do you really think there ' s any logic in the hp universe anymore ?
   (ID: 9385648484318d120363516413ac1cac53ac3a8d)

15. because of how i think when i answer questions , it appears that i am lying . my life has been a series of false positives time and time again . it ' s frustrating and eventually i give up and let the person think what they are going to think .
   (ID: 06f2b7a65e600f531fbc47a595626f329ee413a4)

16. well , here in the land of the free we use it all the time . now i think it ' s tea time , so begone .
   (ID: 55b8de304d8d740e98f08da32dd521354cb3658b)

17. i think i once saw something that said that because you spend a lot of time together you end up looking similar , mostly tan .
   (ID: 01ce69fc209a030b404f270c5d5a650bbb706d87)

18. i think the trash wheel and water shark are symptoms of a larger issue we love to ignore . when was the last time you saw a cop write a ticket to someone throwing trash out the window ? yea me neither .
   (ID: 4ad10ae12cb226893a0aec21cddd0e791f57ede2)

19. i think everybody should see it one time . one of those movies you wouldn ' t be able to guess the ending in a million years .
   (ID: 7bbefe3c73b49467552610b8dad9354ce8c09cde)

20. every time i think of an animal i realise that it ' s already in the game .
