2. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !

4. someone called me some bad stuff and admitted that the intent was to harm me . took me almost a year to figure out that bad people just exist and can fit in with society like everyone else .

5. i totally agree with you . but there comes a point where people like me who like trump or just getting so f   pissed off that we ' re going to do anything and everything we can to get him re  elected no matter what .

   (ID: 30878d5598a6575c0913faf01b5060ee805449ad)

7. guess my point is , there ' s always a lot of hate towards white people and slurs , but it ' s kinda just shrugged off like nothing . it ' s like most see it as okay .

9. he could be , and i can see where you are coming from . or he could just be a lonely old man who wants to be friendly and you ' re the only one who ' s actually engaged him in conversation when he ' s tried . maybe he sits alone in front of the tv by himself every night , hoping his kids will call and they never do . eats lunch alone because he doesn ' t get along with the other professors , etc . maybe you ' re like the one person who has been actually friendly and not just professional with him and he looks forward to it each day , which leads him to go a little overboard . like a stay at home parent who talks nonstop the minute another adult is around not being there to see his interactions with other people , it ' s hard to tell . i like to give people the benefit of the doubt .
   (ID: c673eb9fda8629b3a86935092a2668010b581ab1)

10. well , that ' s not very nice . maybe you should do some research into what it means before you treat people like shit . for your information , it just means " lol . funny how someone who made a racist joke is telling other people to go fuck themselves .
   (ID: 7898b57d9475978228e0993fa3f9b6a2058d950e)

11. how do people not just sit back and be like . this is ridiculous !
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

12. all those illegal ballots that people sent in ! why are we allowing people to vote from home ! just walk out of your corner penthouse office and get chauffered to your precinct like i do ! i even pay myself to do it ! and just in case you thought that was serious   s
   (ID: 081bfde47e58fd02f795a0a9ecccc29cc746decb)

13. this is one of those people new to tf2 who thought they would like to share a video with u , so lower those pitchforks , or just a kid who wants karma , in that case , shower him in downvotes
   (ID: 5a485308ca6e36eb17d7b0fc321fcf7695f3af53)

14. " just be yourself " in answer to my question about what i can do to get more people to like me . obviously being myself wasn ' t working , that ' s why i asked the question .
   (ID: 523373521c35d1ab7b6f0045d4586896b61d0d3d)

15. does foster actually exist ? i always thought it was just a joke we were playing on americans . kind of like asians selling feng shui to white people
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

16. people like that never seem to realise how unoriginal and unfunny their jokes are . it ' s just painful to watch at this stage .
