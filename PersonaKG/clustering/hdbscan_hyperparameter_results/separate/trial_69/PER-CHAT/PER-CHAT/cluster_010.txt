1. haha , you  re not , don  t worry . i didn  t expect this thread to get so popular so i keep getting notifications for it . i don  t know how to stop it ! i used to not want to bring my own lunch , but since we never really finish our dinner i might as well take it with me to school the next day .

2. probably a matilda situation . in my experience , your parents don  t have to tell you that you were unwanted and they resent you for it . kids are pretty intuitive that way , and if he didn  t know before then he probably knows now based off of the fact that they want literally nothing to do with their grandchild . but i bet the maternal grandparents will have more than enough love to go around !

6. really ? how about you bluepillbeta do some research before sprouting this nonsense . if you don ' t know what the foundation of mgtow is , why try to have a discussion . if you want a serious answer , read the sidebar and if you aren ' t too blind , you ' ll see why .

9. i guess the thing is what exactly are your end goals ? i mean do you want to be taken care of ? humiliated ? told what to do ? punished ? do you even know ? if you don ' t know what you want , they can ' t know what you want . regardless of how experienced a dom is there is no way we can read minds , and if anyone claims they can , run .

10. start sometime this week or next week and the interview is tomorrow morning . which is great cos it  s soon , but i also don  t know how long it  ll be for an in  person interview and then a potential offer or not . the second job is way better for me in terms of  and parking ! first job isn  t too bad but parking is awful . so ideally i want the second one .

11. i ' m not saying living equal across the board . just the basic man . everyone can be as greedy as they want after we got that handled . i don ' t know what anyone is trying to be . though i feel a responsibility to let them have the chance to find out . food , shelter , vaccines . that ' s all .

12. ah , well in this case i ' m not sure , sorry ! i guess what you want is a way of speeding up the responsiveness of actions , but unless you actually had a system to play with and test ideas i don ' t know how it would actually behave .
