12. that sounds rather tricky , because ultimatley i would think your not going to want lots of male muscle in the long run , you ' ll need a certain amount of fat to your shape . at the moment im 176lb ' s with a fairly feminine frame but im working out a lot . im trying very hard not to build too much muscle and just tone up . i dont want my biceps or calfs to get any bigger for example . i could be totally wrong but i would think you need to gain some fat , but keep working out while putting the weight on to keep it under control . if you suddenly put on 20ib worth of muscle you going to look far more masculine .

14. burke doesnt exist in this canon i think . its strictly adhering to the ridley scott film not james cameron ' s . in this canon , the developers can do what they want with amanda and her life because ridley never addressed what happens to amanda in the film . this is purely a title addressed in the first alien film ' s ' sub  universe ' . hence why there is zero plot information tied in from the second film .

15. i think it should have been a general election again as this is the second pm to be voted in by the tory parties and they only want him because he said he  d get us through brexit deal or no deal and yes they should have another vote on the idea on brexit , it going to be a shit show .
