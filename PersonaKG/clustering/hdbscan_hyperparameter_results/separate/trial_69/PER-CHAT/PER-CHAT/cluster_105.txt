2. i feel like that might have to do with the quality  nachos arent a gourmet food , but i feel like if you were to try making them at home the meat would certainly be better than most anywhere that serves nachos stadiums , arenas if you still enjoy soggy , meatless nachos after accounting for ingredients . then thats cool , healthier too
