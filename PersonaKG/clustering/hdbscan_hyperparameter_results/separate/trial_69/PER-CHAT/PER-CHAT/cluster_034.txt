1. i absolutely hate the threads that are deep  seated in woman hating . yet these people cry and moan about not having friends or a life outside of reddit . gee , i wonder why ? maybe if half the people on reddit stopped whining , stopped giving into the hivemind and show girls some respect . maybe , juuuuust maybe , she will like you . also , reddit is not a reliable source of dating advice ! when a single woman goes on a date with you , all your karma points don ' t mean shit . show her you ' re not an asshat and she ' ll like you .

2. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .

3. i get why some people don ' t like the casting choices but why not give them a chance and at least watch some of their performances which by the way i can ' t find much for anya

4. you don ' t like talking to people .
   (ID: 4a6c4bd92ad418020e8b80aec5e593d85a96d4ea)

5. i just let other people tell me what to do . i don  t like it but it  s not like i  m gonna get far on my own .

6. don ' t complain to the people in the same situation as you , and don ' t complain to your subordinates . if you have an issue , take it higher and work towards resolving it . sitting around talking to your coworkers about how much your job sucks just makes you look like a whiney , entitled prick

7. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .

8. um , no the odds of him having a child are the odds of anyone else having a child . you either do or you don  t . and he could use a surrogate like plenty of straight people do too .

9. couldn  t agree with you more . yes it wasn  t a perfect remake but it was pretty damn close in my books . if people don  t like remakes , i get that . but i can  t understand why people on reddit hate on this movie otherwise . i  m not sure what people who didn  t like it would have changed . the video said jungle book was better ? how ? they were almost the same in turns of animation . i liked it . my friends liked it . like you said the original will always be number one in my heart . but this was a damn fine movie in its own right .

10. there ' s nothing to agree about . i presented a concept for like minded people to discuss . you wouldn ' t walk into a vegan forum and start saying how the idea is stupid would you ? you stated you don ' t like that idea . that ' s perfectly acceptable . you didn ' t add anything to the discussion though other than how you dislike it . obviously you have made up your mind , so you have no purpose in this thread anymore . go talk on topics you enjoy .

11. people actively search out your username and it ' s history to critique it if they don ' t like your comment .

12. i get what both of you are saying . i never intend for this post to get up voted so much . i was just super excited . it was my first post on reddit . but post like this is what has kept me going . the overwhelming support is awesome . and other people have encouraged me to go after the dlc . i don ' t see anything wrong with that . we play and post cause we are having fun . what ' s wrong with that ?

13. i have to ask you why you don ' t look this up yourself ? you have to be on the internet to type and submit your comment so why not just do a quick google search ? one of the biggest problems in this country is that a lot of people do not research anything themselves . they simply wait for someone to present information to them . when they don ' t like the information they hear , even if it is true , they dismiss it and when they hear information they do like they accept it even if it is false . it ' s absolutely ridiculous how easily manipulated people can be .

14. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .

15. some dogs don  t like people with hats on . might just be something they aren  t used to . or a bad experience .

16. trump don ' t like people that turn the other cheek . and neither does today ' s christians .   x200b  oh the irony .
   (ID: 7ef662967b293d289d1c27dbf712fa2e3e720823)

17. i have the mentality of " well i don ' t like myself so why would other people like me . this just makes me push people away . the few people that i feel comfortable talking to always remain aquaintances .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

18. yeah , i don ' t disagree to that one bit . it ' s just that if a generalization for any other race is made , people go fucking nuts . imagine if i said , white men can ' t dance . nothing wrong with that , right ? but somehow black men like fried chicken and watermelon is a no  go . i don ' t mean to start an argument , as i actually agree with you that there are some fucked up things about old white men of that generation .

19. a small book i read in the 5th grade that i still remember is loser  by jerry spineli it wasn  t really life changing , it gave me insight on how people reacted to certain people with aspects and traits they don  t like .

20. religious bigotry is why people like you don ' t get respect . you offer nothing but hate
