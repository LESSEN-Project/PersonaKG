2. do you have proof of such a war looming ? again though , you have to have a reason for starting a war , can ' t just declare war because you think someone might attack you at some possible point in a possible future .

3. thank you ! i didn  t think about the opportunities to swim ! he  s just a puppy so i think it should be ok to transition now rather than when he  s older .

5. how well someone speaks in a beauty pageant is irrelevant to my point , i wasn ' t trying to point out everything about each topic . plus it is just an idea , i think you are taking it a little too serious .

6. why is everything here with centurion ? i dont have a problem i just think its weird out of all characters cent is used in all the posts

7. i ' m actually still just on the side of liking it , but it ' s getting tougher . gaping plot holes , uninteresting storylines , painful characters , terrible dialogue , such poor consistency of any in  universe tech that i have to call most of the sci  fi elements one big continuity error . and that ' s not limited to the newer films . just started watching the original trilogy after tlj , and think i have to accept they ' re just sci  fi films for kids . i think they have some really great core concepts to work with , but then the actual stories that are told in the setting get ruined by the issues above .

8. go , why the hell not ? just be smart and have a plan to gtfo if everything goes south midway through . i think you should tell someone you ' re going , a friend an adviser or someone you can count on if it goes to shit . you will regret not going .
   (ID: f4e4929bb0bef09e7eb72aaccf20c2d9454729c7)

9. you can never stop a single crazy no matter what draconian rules you think up . they will still be crazy and we will just be freedomless , passing reactionary legislation that doesn ' t do anything but pandwr for votes .
   (ID: 1cb49ecc2e4fdb9752d9ca12d02f3cfc2f6659c9)

10. i think they are the true heroes , so just do it !
   (ID: b9e4d29ec48fd90198919bb6298d71519e5423e6)

11. you come across as such an entitled douche , just because your opinions are different from others . doesn ' t make them wrong . get over yourself , ever think you ' re part of the problem with society today ? such a hypocrite
   (ID: 059c976738098229106db9c4736116cbb2f47eb8)

12. it ' s not really shepard anymore , the shepard ai has much bigger priorities than talking to an old crew now . everyone would think he just died during the crucible firing .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

13. imo , it is a fallacy to think that drawing attention to kony means that one thinks he is the worst out there . even if he is the worst , no rational person would think that he is the only one . drawing attention to one of these lunatics just helps to put a face on the problem as a whole . also , cutting the heads off the hydra is part of what eventually killed it . one just has to remember that there is more to be done .

14. copy and paste made me laugh . can you not just type , what you think about the book and why will anyone read it ?
   (ID: 782311f0352356940fd2c1e77bc3cfa9f74b06fa)

15. sorry but i just noticed this . how lucky do you think she must be to have that miss her eye ?
   (ID: 5b6d03d858e37aa90c43f05e45a27fb95beee424)

16. i still think of her as just a girl .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

17. wow well look at you being all happy . how dare you ? you think the rest of us are gonna be as lucky as you with our crushes ? no need to rub it in , christ ! nah just kidding , congrats man
   (ID: 1cd062f77c729b2cea6d91996a2f94b1f5226415)

18. thanks , that only made me think everyone else was doing the same thing , and doubled down my fear that they were just tolerating my presence out of politeness . that ' s pretty much how all of society works , we all just tolerate each other existence . you fit right in .
   (ID: 225291489bc1a4ddf3d197a3062fa9ff935f3029)

19. remember that other one where he got the volunteer to murder stephen fry ? he also used the " anchor " and " color " concepts in that one . it think it is bullshit to suggest anyone can be persuaded in this way  as you mention , there are extensive screening and editing processes that db doesn ' t share with the audience . he just really knows how to pick em .
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

20. just when you think it ' s gone you hear the eeeeeee .
