4. i ' m pretty sure it ' s before , because in lore it says that doomfist was defeated by winston and put in prison . saying that the fight scene ends with doomfist and winston about to clash i think it ' s pretty safe to say it ' s before prison . i might be wrong though , because the doomfist mentioned in the original cinematic could be a different one .

5. what i ' m trying to get across is that if you are a poc and a white person saying white pride bothers you unless we are talking in a way meant to harass someone but you , as a poc , can say it some adjustment is needed . it should not matter what your skin color is . it should not give you free passes or exceptions . do i think there are inequalities ? yes . and they are on both sides though one side is more so

8. how do you say you ' re pretty well sized and in the next sentence say how it has been problematic for you but my lizard brain still manages to ignore that and think  " damn , having a huge dong sounds great . " it ' s so ingrained .
