1. it just adds to the badass effect , i like to think of it as having my gun out passively but always ready for shit to hit the fan .

2. for me the biggest rpg element missing is choice in class  character . if you are a warrior , you are the exact same as every other warrior out there but maybe a single talent choice that might differ . i think talent trees and more impactful stats helped this a lot , but in general wow always kind of had this issue , just there was a lot more variety back in the day . it feels like you have no choice in what your class can do , and you can ' t tweak it to your liking , which makes all classes feel quite shallow , like a fighting game character .

4. you think that , and its not easy ofc , but its really just a case of finding someone like you . my husband and i can do ' nothing ' all day . even a week if he ' s off work .

5. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .

6. like these dudes really blame any small thing just because they can ' t get pussy or anything , and they think relatively high of themselves , it disgusts me . maybe all these women didn ' t give him a chance because he has such a big ego .

7. i agree with you for the most part , but some of the halloween items , like the templar ' s spirit for the medic and the squid ' s lid for the demo actually look pretty cool . i think they should just do away with the restriction .

8. i think the guy just look like him , not much more to it .

10. i watch porn videos where they act like they love you gf roleplays . it ' s just an act but it warms my heart when they talk to me . i always think " that ' s how it feels when someone loves you .   x200b  it ' s pretty hot too

12. i  m a ftm , and the first bit of your comment sounded just like me lol . i have everything planned to a t . i read somewhere about ftms being more likely to get induced so for some reason in my head , me giving labor always starts with me being induced . i think i do this because if it  s induced it  ll be planned and i have a weird obsession with planning everything lol . reading this really made me stop and think it might not go how i plan for it to go , which is scary .

13. look up " romantic bpd relationships . not saying this is what she has , and not trying to shame anyone with this diagnosis . i just think this may give you some insight and useful strategies you seem like a lovely , thoughtful person

14. social studies . i can ' t stand sjw ' s that think everything is your fault just because you ' re a straight white middle class male . not everyone is like that , but there are enough to seriously rustle my jimmies .

15. coincidentally just finished my latest rewatch last night before bed and this post made me chuckle . creed ' s appearances in the last few episodes , and the grass roots story , is pretty funny . i like to think that creed , out of all of the characters that use their real names , is most like himself in real life .

16. it could do although it isn ' t very likely i just can ' t really think of anything else that would click like that and freeze a pc

17. there was this girl holding a sword and when i asked her why she just said that she always came prepared . i ' d like to think that she and her friends were actually having some variety of supernatural adventures right beneath all our noses .

18. this guy is like herpes . just when you think it ' s gone it shows up again with a vengance to irritate the holy shit out of you .

19. off topic about this picture but on topic about the bikes do these bikes have better baskets ? like are the holes on the side of the basket huge because the baskets are useless if you wanna keep your phone or anything in there because they will just slide out . like today i used one in miramar and i had a can of iron bru import from scotland i think and it slid out the side of the basket and pierced a hole in the side causing it to squirt out this is one of the older bikes

20. " you can just speak plain language to yourself " if you speak words in your head , like think whole sentences , you can change your mindset .
