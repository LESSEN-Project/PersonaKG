2. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .

3. my mom says ,  it  s because you  re on that game all the time .  while that  s partially a factor , i  m on the game so i don  t go into mental breakdowns every night

4. apprenticeships ! you can work and get a degree at the same time . you do it with a company , you get a reduced salary , but it means you don ' t have to pay anything , and you get experience in the workplace . you do come out of it with a degree in whatever field your apprenticeship was in

7. they don ' t stack . either you need to waste a bunch of inventory space to carry your spares , or you need to bring out a workbench every time you need a boat , which is especially annoying if you crash your boat in hostile territory .

8. i play in ps4 and i usually don  t get much online interaction until the area after that place . also if you are struggling try relying more on rolling than blocking . ds3 is very different from ds1 in that regard . also , yes , partying is much more difficult in ds3 and takes a lot more time to master

12. i don ' t understand why you wouldn ' t hire me though . i have my flaws but when it comes to work , i put extra at home every day , whether it be reading a programming language book or a dev . to article , working a bit on my portfolio  projects etc . i can be stuck on a problem because i ' m new to the project code it ' s undocumented because he didn ' t have time for it , my supervisor is often wfh or at meetings . i use stov for question , but it obviously takes time to receive an answer .

13. yeah it ' s annoying but over time it does get better . it will always be there but you get used to it . i don ' t worry about it much nowadays . if i ever get a flare up or more pain than usual i do the exercises over a week or two and it settles down again .

14. on desktop all right let me rotate my screen to see the biggest conspiracy of all time that doesn ' t give anything to anyone and costs billions of dollars but fits my absolutely crazy worldview in which government is incompetent enough to leave major flaws in their models which don ' t exist if you look closely but i looked from far enough to see them !
