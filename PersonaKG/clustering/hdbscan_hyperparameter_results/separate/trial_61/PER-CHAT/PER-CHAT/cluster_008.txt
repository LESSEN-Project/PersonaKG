1. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .

2. yes , this piece of you missing sounds like the social part you reserved for people who do not accept you . i am sorry to hear that but no you can seek out new social ties from people who accept you for who you are . i can  t promise it will be easy and you may always miss what you have lost but it will get better if you remain open to new relationships .

3. thank you . i don ' t blame myself in a way that isn ' t realistic . i blame myself for not being aware of the warning signs of what happened to me . that ' s about the extent . i don ' t harbor any unhealthy emotions and though i suffer mildly from ptsd i am conscious enough to work on my issues . with that being said . yes , i am still with my boyfriend . the truth of the matter is that he simply isn ' t emotionally mature enough to understand the depths of what had happened . i did threaten to break up with him . the first couple of times he said it to me i didn ' t stand up for myself . i don ' t know why . but the last time he said it i really stuck it to him . i realized that if he thinks this way i can ' t possibly marry someone who will think like that and i told him that . i also told him i will happily leave because i know i wouldn ' t be suffering a loss if that ' s the way he is thinking . for the first time in all the time i have known him he stopped and gave me a very heart felt apology taking accountability for his lack of sympathy and understanding . quite frankly , a lot of other things were said . but it was true and i know he meant it . this is still a red flag for me . if i am suffering from something in the future , am i going to have to be the one to walk him through it too ? just because i am more emotionally equipped to handle ? he ' s not a horrible person . but he is selfish in his thinking . and he is emotionally sheltered . after digit years i am starting to wonder if i want to be the one who does all of the picking up .

4. i  m sorry i don  t know you or your sister or the situation enough to give you advice that will fix everything . it sounds like you have some remorse over your actions but i have no idea if it  s too much or not enough . i can say a short letter might be the best solution if you think a direct confrontation might make things worse . understand you have no control over other people  s reactions only what you do . focusing on how you feel bad for your actions but also including why you  re angry in a way that focuses on your own feelings may be a good idea .

5. i feel like im at edge because i honestly thought i had real willpower to stop and now here i am failing multiple times . constantly persuading myself to give in and juat have a drink and now i cant even last longer then digit days without a drink . its heart breaking and im afriad about how this has come to be . i juat dont know anymore

6. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

7. nah . you two are obviously looking for different people . you want a first date hookup and she wants something more long term . at least you were blunt and now you both know how the other feels .

10. well that ' s a click bait question that should actually go to datingadvice i do believe that you matured , but you haven ' t matured enough if you lost your footing over a single picture . once again go back to the steps and keep on doing what worked . keep on learning and becoming a better man . she will not see you the way you see her . even if she accepts you , you are clearly obsessive and you will involuntary try to push her away from her new friends who you feel threatened about . that ' s just how stalker mentality works . so leave her be . if you are ment to be , you both will be free in couple years and you will meet up .

11. knock that bish off the pedestal . really , if you keep her there you  ll never be able to appreciate anyone else . including yourself ! ex is an ex for a reason .

12. i don ' t know about the falling in love and all that . but if you ' re looking for advice take it from someone digit years older than you . forget about her . don ' t even think about it anymore . you ' re young as fuck and there ' s plenty of women out there . and don ' t fall in love .

13. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

14. okay . from your post history , i think you ' re doing engineering in bangalore ? probably final year or have recently cleared final year ? woman , i ' m in the same age group as you are . this is my advise to you  what you ' re having , is first rate depression , for which you need counseling . do that pronto . you have hobbies  you draw , you crochet , you write beautiful poetry . focus on those . it ' s amazing . slightly  smiling  face you swim  exercise , so you ' re probably athletic  doing your best to stay in a positive mindset . i sincerely appreciate the efforts you ' re taking , to make your lifetime worthwhile . hugging  face there is this issue of being abused as a young girl . this , and i can ' t stress enough about it , needs to be addressed immediately . talk to a psychotherapist , talk with your family , talk with your best friend regarding this , but talk . it is important to get those feelings out there , it ' ll heal you to some extent . also , do you have lupus ? being a female would put you into that ballpark of lupus . but yeah , doesn ' t mean you can ' t lead a healthy  fulfilling life . i ' m pretty sure you ' re on your meds by now . if yes , check with your doctor if there are any meds that may be inducing a depressant effect on your psyche . don ' t run away from your life . don ' t be stuck onto this aadhar manipulation  escapism that you ' re seeking . it ' ll complicate things , won ' t give you a permanent solution to anything .

15. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .

16. did you ever consider that your own habits and personality are your roadblock to those things ? if you never make an effort to better yourself or even try how can you blame the world for your blunders ? nobody is depriving you to your right to anything . companionship isnt assigned , its something that is found , love is something that is developed along with intimacy . its not just something like equality and civil rights . theres not a chance in hell you could tell me that you cant find a single woman that you cant connect at least a little bit with and work into something more intimate if you want .

17. she probably doesn ' t have feelings for you , it was the drugs . that being said you still cheating on your boyfriend and that is uncool . you could keep quiet i guess , but the guilt will likely continue to eat at you . you should probably tell him the truth and not put yourself in a situation to cheat again .

18. nta . as a lesbian and as a human being with good communication in a good relationship , i see no issue with what you did . your other doesnt trust you and is very insecure . i ' d talk to her and if it didnt resolve , i ' d get a new girlfriend that trusts me enough to not cheat .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

19. the relationships i ' ve valued most came from the women i didn ' t initially think were the most beautiful . life has nothing to do with looks . if you don ' t have a real relationship until you ' re digit , consider yourself lucky  it ' s all a waste of time . bullshit this , bullshit that . most dudes just want a hole to stick their cock in and are willing to lie to you every word they say to get that . some women have figured that out gonewild exists for a reason . don ' t feel dependent on a relationship for happiness or validation . that ' s only going to be a let down . once you feel happy with yourself , love will come naturally . ask anyone over digit thats been through a few divorces  you have to love yourself to love another . anything else is lying to yourself to pretend to feel happy .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

20. yeah this is bad man . very bad . that ' s emotional cheating . it ' s legitimate cheating . you ' ve known for a while that your wife loves attention from men . this is problematic . i think the best solution is separation and possibly divorce . you said it yourself , you feel like the bond that you had with her has been broken . don ' t think twice about it because christmas is around the corner . your wife is a cheater . she requires validation from other men that aren ' t her husband . you were there every night after work for her when you were newlyweds . it ' s never good enough for her . you deserve better , op .
