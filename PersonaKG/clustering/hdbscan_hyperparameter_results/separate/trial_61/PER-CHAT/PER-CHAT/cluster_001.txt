1. ding ding ding . youre right . thats what i was trying to say . the gov thinks the nic addiction is more minor than a heroin addiction , so they ' ll keep nic legal and tax it to make money , because thats what governments do . however , they think heroin is more dangerous and would prefer to keep it illegal rather than tax it . seems like we ' re on the same page here .

2. that doesn ' t prove your point . if i fit it into my macros and am still physically active there ' s nothing wrong with it . it ' s not like i ' m loading up a potato chip sandwich every day and shoving it in my gullet while i watch tv . on the infrequent occasion that i decide to make a sandwich , i ' m gonna put some potato chips on that mofo . you ' re acting as if any human that decides to consume an item that ' s not healthy is suddenly the fattest of the fat and the highest of the stoners . that ' s just ignorant .

3. i understand that , but you can  t just replace digit  of medications with weed . if you could , that would be a medical miracle unlike anything the world has ever seen . i understand your point , and i agree that the prescription drug industry is one of the most evil things this world has to offer . that terrible industry is the reason why many people believe that you can just smoke weed or use essential oils to fix your medical issues , and it isn  t those peoples  fault . i don  t want you to think that i  m trying to be disparaging , because i know both of us have had very different walks of life , and we will never see things the same way . i  m sorry for the shortness and rude tone of my first comment towards you , but it  s very dangerous to say that weed is better than the vast majority of prescription drugs .

4. now i ' m not gonna downvote just because i completely disagree with you , just could tell you in a couple years there could be some other group of idiots who don ' t even eat vegetables because would also be killing and say everyone should only drink water . whatever your ethics are , good for you , but don ' t try and force them into people .

5. because we know , for a fact , that pot is not as bad as the commercials want you to believe it is . meth is every bit as bad as they show , they don ' t even have to play things up .

6. lol . shp ? if not , yta . it ' s irrational and dramatic to say " i ' ve suddenly decided to stop eating this and if you do , you ' ll die " you do you , but don ' t force your opinions and they ' re opinions , there ' s no evidence to suggest eating fast food chicken will definitely give you cancer or guilt trip your loved ones .

7. yes , that ' s why i said responsibly . red meat isn ' t going to kill you or shorten your lifespan if you do it in moderation .

8. i don ' t have to supplement because i get all my vitamins from unadulterated meat is a nonsensical argument ? nonsensical you keep using that word , i do not think it means what you think it means "  inigo montoya , the princess bride . i ' m done chatting , i have more important things to do . have a great day .

9. i am inclined to agree with most of what you said , and i ' ll look at the studies , but i suppose it ' s partially what i was trying to say , no drugs are safe , legal or illegal , if done wrong . i tend to indiscriminately tell people not to do the illegal ones though , since they can destroy your life , in fact it can have nothing to do with the drug and everything to do with the social situations illegal drugs tend to put people in . though i ' m sure you know that much too .

10. who the hell started the idea that making cigarettes more expensive would get people to quit ? that ' s not how addiction works .

11. i call you a reddit groupie because all you do is make up information or try to discredit me and yet you have no basis for your claims yourself . any scientist will tell you that the best way to solve a hypothesis is to do the experiment yourself . i apologize for not having a phd in organic biology , making it so i can ' t publish an article and receive scientific notoriety . i have done the experiment myself in a perpetual grow , so my experiment was built up over time with grow charts  nutrient schedules being compared to lab results to find which nutrients best work for me as far as thc ratios . personally , running into carcinogen rates was a complete accident , but i varied my study around that eventually as well . let me guess something about you . you grew digit years ago under fluros inside a trash can and you consider the time away from growing as time spent growing . i have been holding the same argument and you say i am all over the board ? you realize that nh person shut up after he figured out i was right ? stop asking me to post an article and just post one yourself . i will post up my lab results if you find me an article . just because i have less posts and just digit days of being active on reddit does not mean you are a better grower than me . a reddit groupie is someone who reads things on reddit and acts like that was from their personal experience and thus acts like they have that much experience . i am sorry dirtyhands , but those pictures of everybody ' s plants does not give you their exact nutrient schedule , distancing from lights , environmental controls , and other variables . thus you can not claim that looking at a picture has helped your grow experience in any way shape or form . another thing , if you are going to use a level of vocabulary that is higher than your own , you may want to use a thesaurus or dictionary . substantiate is spelled s  u  b  s  t  a  n  t  i  a  t  e not s  u  b  s  t  a  n  c  i  a  t  e . fyi the catholic church used to say that there was no such thing as bacteria . they said that there was no science behind it . the catholic church also said science and god said the sun revolved around the earth . we now know that to be false and that they made false claims . in this instance you would be like the catholic church . " more posts " and not a " reddit noob " and i would be like galileo in this instance trying to prove someone else ' s theory rightnot my own just like galileo and contradicting what someone of " a higher power " dirtyhand thinks is common sense , but that " common sense " is coming from someone with less ability to comprehend information than a digit year old .

12. why don ' t we just dump amphetamines in the water supply ? isn ' t this pretty clearly a slippery  slope fallacy ? is there a real counter  argument to the ' better living through chemistry ' idea when we ' re talking about decisions individuals and their doctors make ?

13. i mean even the most ardent marijuana supporters must concede it makes people less active and lazy . what are you talking about ? sure , some pot smokers are lazy , but are they lazy because they smoke pot or do they smoke pot because they ' re lazy ? there ' s a lot of really lazy unmotivated people that don ' t use any drugs at all . how would you explain that ? maybe we could just blame video games or something else in that case ? some people are just lazy . you do know people of all professions smoke pot , right ? i ' ve smoked pot since i was digit . got a pilot ' s license , college degree , and have run my own business for the past digit years . just about all of my friends smoke weed and they have all been employed for decades doing just fine . they have spouses , are great parents , own nice homes , etc . you know what makes people less active and lazy ? being hung over . i ' d much rather my employees smoke weed at the end of the day to wind down and get to work the next morning well rested . you ' ve bought into the narrative that has been preached to you since birth . this , coming from a dare graduate lol .
