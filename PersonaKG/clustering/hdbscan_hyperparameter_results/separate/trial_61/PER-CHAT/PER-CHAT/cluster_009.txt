1. i would recommend advice for this , but i ' ll try to help as well anyway i think you ' re just friends by convenience . you ' re on the same team , you live near each other and give each other lifts , but beyond that , he has better friends and you don ' t . i ' ve been in that situation , there ' s not much you can do except to to find other , better friends , and accept that that ' s where your relationship is at . if you ' re scared to do things around him , find other friends and don ' t value his opinion of you so highly , that way if he does judge you , who cares ? as a rule , if a friend makes you feel uncomfortable in some way when you ' re around them , get out , find a better person to spend your time with   x200b    x200b

2. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .

4. hum , talk to him and tell him how you feel , your fears , what you want and what you expect of the future with him , that you live him if you do . and ask him if he ' s willing to be there and take the compromise with you to make it work . depending on the answer just do what it ' s best for you and the baby . it ' s better to leave on time than stay and get more hurt . good luck !

5. you  re so strong for making the decision you did though , just remember that . you  re worth so much more than the way he was treating you and you knew that  i hope you realise how amazing that is . so many people haven  t got as far as you have face  blowing  a  kiss
   (ID: 726d5aaac9472ccdcb64345cd6d082bee4eae6fa)

6. i ' m not going to give any more flak as i believe you have received more than enough . please just let your husband go . he deserves better . if you truly love him as you claim in your post , you would do so . holding onto him like this is just disgustingly selfish .
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

7. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart

8. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

9. you should never give in to he demands of someone who asks you to choose your friends over him . i ' m sorry , but that is controlling , insecure behavior . you might " love " this guy but he ' s insecure and feels threatened by anyone who he doesn ' t directly control or have any influence over . think about that . do you really want to be with someone like that ? do you really love him that much ? what if this were your parents or your family who he objects to ? you seem like a nice person and if i were you i wouldn ' t give in to such egregious demands for anyone . you can do better . i hope that you do .

10. am i missing something here ? you love your boyfriend but hard hanging out alone in your room with a drunk guy who tried to kiss you . you stop him and clarify that this is a no go and you love your bf . perfect . but then you have him spoon with you all night as a comfort to you ? that makes no sense . but whatever . if it is eating you up inside and you really truly did not do anything , you should tell him . i mean why not  particularly since there is no longer contact with the mf .

11. i can only tell you i would have preferred for it to be done privately . maybe send him a text , invite him over and let him know that you have some pretty rough news that you would prefer to talk about face to face . then just make sure he is sitting down and explain what has happened . there ' s no real need to rush it , there ' s also no right or wrong way . there is the facts and your feelings and you have to navigate both . i don ' t know this guy from a bar of soap but general rule of thumb is that guys are pretty simple . give him time to process what you say . he will probably have questions . work through them together . at the end of the day this has happened and if you feel the right thing to do is tell him then you ' ll make it work and he can choose to either take it well and be supportive or take it badly and run through a glass door in a panic . i hope it goes well .

12. you did the right thing for you . your ex sounds immature and there is a good chance he has cheated plenty himself and that ' s why he is so nonchalant about it . his friend is the one who did something wrong . it isn ' t on you to keep his secrets . if you were in that situation you would want to be told , i ' m sure . let him buy you a ticket home . call your people and let them know you are coming back . this just saved you from a miserable life with a selfish jerk .
   (ID: a9b07d3f94647dffebe730771c20ee3ca1af7ec4)

13. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .

14. hey , i know there ' s a thousand other comments on here , but just wanted to say real quick that you didn ' t do anything wrong . dude sounds like a hassle to say the least , and anyone who is willing to flip on you and humiliate you online is not someone you should be wasting your time with . that ' s some immature , disrespectful , petty shit . it seems like you feel guilty to an extent , which i understand , but don ' t linger on the guilt . once it passes you ' ll realize you did yourself a favor by setting some standards of what you will and won ' t put up with . lots of people choose to stay unhappy in their relationships and that is an unhealthy way to live .
   (ID: cb830ff94bb369e5db655e15ee074f392a52c14f)

15. i  ve been in the same kind of situation , a couple of times . you did the right thing ignore him for a few weeks or even months until you feel like he  s learned from it . then unblock him and message him
   (ID: 0328413fb9fd5eff68cef63593bfc5537e85c2e8)

16. you seem to have normalized his shitty behavior at this point . there is no reason why you should be working full time  still taking on the domestic role . if you weren ' t working , sure . but that ' s just so fucking ridiculous and selfish , " tradition " be damned . it sucks you have kids with this guy imo . i think you should leave him .
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

17. i mean you could just ask if he wants to hang out just the two of you , and if je suggests more friends to bring take it as a hint he doesn ' t like you like that .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

18. absolutely speak to your therapist . you trust them . they will help you . you need to get yourself out of that relationship for your safety , physical and psychological . this is not a one  off occurrence .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

19. well you ' re not forcing him to stay at home or not to meet his friends at all , you ' re only asking yourself why he still hangs out with her and the situation seems so odd , so i don ' t think you ' re overreacting . if i were you i would try to confront him ! you don ' t have to be together all the time but if she knows you ' re a couple and she has met you it would be polite to invite you as well as him my boyfriend ' s friends always invite me for instance . especially since he does immature tricks such as only telling you things once he has done them or he ' s halfway doing them like staying at her house , you should ask for explanations and if he tells you that you ' re overreacting maybe he just will never get it .
   (ID: 9b7ab2ecf50a1f0d1a04c43a5112617f13aebfb4)

20. tell him and see his reaction . if he is such a great man that wants to be with you , he should have no problem sticking up for you and making sure his family understands that that behavior will cease . if he reacts in their defense and does nothing , you know it  s not worth pursuing . mommas boys are a serious no  no for me , good luck .
