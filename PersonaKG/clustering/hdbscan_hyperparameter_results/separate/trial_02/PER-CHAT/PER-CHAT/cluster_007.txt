1. i didn ' t necessarily ' disappear ' but i moved several times until i was unknown by anyone in my ' new ' life . on the occasions i ' ve been passing through places my old life existed it was strange to see that actually very little had changed . if cloning could be done , i ' d probably replace myself in this life with a clone and go again . but hey ho .

2. it  s time to put on your big boy pants and grow up . you are now legally responsible for all of your actions and decisions . and you are not helpless  learn the value of an education , the real cost of living , consequences of unsafe sex , and that social media is not real life .

5. i ' ve found talking about such tragedy helps put life in perspective . when it happens such an event is very much " in your face " , but talking about it engages other parts of your brain besides the traumatized part , and eventually you can kind of zoom out and see that event on a backdrop among other bad , but also other good things that have occurred in life .

6. i hate my life , i threw my controller somewhere and cant find it since i had my eyes closed out of rage . i hate that stupid game . when you die in adventure you should drop your junk , and flux shouldnt even be classified as junk

7. they taught that life is always worth living , and that nothing your brain says will break the truth that people care about you . i came to this particular conclusion myself .

8. act natural , because why would you put such a big filter on yourself if you were to actually marry that person . it  s pretty unrealistic that you would keep the filter on for the rest of your life .
   (ID: 2b77ba529bcde4fc6880b1e5da5dfc3eb15e35e4)

9. i filmed several brief interviews with my father about his early life .

13. this show is a part of my life . days don ' t end until an episode or two of office has been watched .
   (ID: bcdf27afc4458eff850310d64f595278a31271be)

14. problem with this is that if anyone ever found out , it would create major financial instability . so i would probably play it out like as realistic as possible . hire people to create a full backstory on me  came from rich parents , parents were killed when i was young , resulting in me inheriting their billions . however , their murder would cause major trauma in my life so i would disappear for years . then suddenly i would return to my city as a young , trauma ridden billionaire . however , at the exact moment i returned a vigilante would emerge from the darkness . basically i  d be fucking batman
   (ID: f2f78f9286caf4c9c8a5d2df66e9befe965daeb8)

15. i consider myself a relatively straightforward , mostly honest , young man . my life doesn ' t belong on rhobh . however , i hold grudges . i ' m wondering how far other redditors have gone to ensure their own agenda ' s pan out .
   (ID: 1f3e82e13d88ba22fce8ba80102ccc24b3880ae9)

16. ywbta . what happened in your life that ' s made you so irrationally anti  kid , especially to one you claim you like ? stop stringing the poor guy along , i can see this ending as the poor guy having to choose between you or his child and that ' s very unfair .
   (ID: 0754abce96e7ea9fd8cd1fd9efebfdaf70578d39)

17. i regret nothing . they all have meaning , or occurred at some turning point in my life . the ones i care for the least can be covered easily .
   (ID: c0c5a7c74c41387a99afab68d3e9fe0bfab4b8b9)

19. i ' m old enough to be your grandfather but i ' m not anyone ' s grandfather . at my age , you can be blissfully unaware of what things children are into . there are no kids in my life , so i have no idea what trends are popular nowadays . take care !
