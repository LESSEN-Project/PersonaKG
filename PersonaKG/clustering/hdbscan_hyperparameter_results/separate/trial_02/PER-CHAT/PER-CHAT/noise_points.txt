1. this is stupid . how can we call for a better america then specifically arrange breaking the laws we set in place . i guarantee you there  s nothing left at area digit , we all know about it , it  s a tourist zone . we should probably be worried about area digit or digit , that  s probably where they moved anything . lol

5. you could go what my wife calls buddhist vegetarian . you don ' t actually stock your fridge with meat , but if you ' re a guest or at a restaurant with no good vegetarian options then you have the damn meat instead of making a fuss or always being stuck with the side salad .

6. except for , the way you present yourself to the outside world and to other humans is as easily explained by  self expression  as it is by  attention seeking  e . g . it isn  t really that simple .

7. for me it depends on the race type and car . find a car from each event type and get to know it over time , learn to tune and dial the car inor download tunes , treat it as if you own it irl . it ' s huge driving a car that you know vs barely drive when choosing difficulty . if i have lots of experience driving a certain car on track type x , i need to max out the difficulty to make the game more exciting due to my smashy aggressive driving style leaving drivatars in the dust . digit percent of the time i ' ll be digit second behind first trying to chase him down to no avail , but i do mostly win . i don ' t think the difficulty is bad for people who hustle their way to the front of the pack in the first 10th of the race but if you have a slug that corners well , you ' ll never chase down first . so i can see the complaint .

8. that ' s funny you say that , i was say the same thing . i think it ' s because of the genetics . nyc has more straight up caribbean and west african folks .

9. and you ' re the type of person who thinks so highly of themselves they can ' t even understand a simple joke . get your head out of your ass .

10. the government has pretty much been horrible at running everything else . no one wants the same people who run the dmv to run hospitals . the va is absolutely horrible and has led to thousands of veterans dying while waiting for treatment . they can ' t take care of veterans  who make up a tiny percentage of the population . how can they take care of the entire population ? the government was designed to be small . the basic conservative argument is that it ' s not the government ' s job to take care of people . it ' s to get out of the way so people can take care of themselves .

11. it ' s not . the two actors were in black priest garbs , i think the younger one was there to find his brother who had left years before he got there i think . not sure . but it ' s not gwh . however similar scene . but this scene is far more intense and longer .

12. agreed . he clearly knew what he was doing was wrong , as did his buddies . that ' s why they went up in arms as compared to saying , " oh i didn ' t know " and walking off . you digit  did the right thing . it ' s like when a child pulls the " i ' m not touching you " line while holding his hands a millimeter from your face . he tried to bs his way through a clearly illegal move . to me that is the same as shooting someone from the deadbox . he walked out of bounds , indicating he was out , then tried to justify it with whatever argument he spewed from his mouth . if i was your manager i would have had no problem kicking that dude out for the day . no time nor patience for people who are going to act like immature little children .

13. can ' t go wrong with seiko in that price range . great first watches but also great for any collector . the digit series is their affordable automatic line and there are quite a few styles to choose from

15. really don  t think about that aspect much . you have a job to do , so that  mission focus  stays . i remember freaking out the first time mortals fell near our fob , i panicked and ran for a bunker . a few months later i wouldn  t even bother grabbing my helmet and kept walking to lunch chow .

18. ha ! nice work . i ' d say that they ' re necessary , not good . for me there are just more pressing issues . i appreciate the arguments for gun violence as a social epidemic , but violence is only a symptom of something deeper . primarily the unfair distribution of resources , classism , and other institutions of disenfranchisement .

19. you just created this acct for this post . not sure if you should be taken seriously . assuming you are for real , are you saying you just started queefing because this new guy has a large penis ? or that your vagina was already cavernous and the queefing has gotten worse ? why would you want to make your vagina bigger with the dragon dildo ? that only allows more air in leading to more queefing .

20. it ' s a crazy cycle of anxiety . they keep trying to manipulate my every move in life . micromanaging my diet , my entertainment , following me everywhere . they keep fucking me up more meaningless shit like smoking a cigarette . all of this bullshit leads me to be in a very anxious state , not fit enough to approach random women in the street . then they have the nerve to complain about procrastination lol . now i have to juggle appeasing all their bitching about what music i listen to and how much i read and still settle myself enough to talk to whatever woman out there trying to marry me . all they do is make shit difficult . every fucking thing has to be the long way there .
