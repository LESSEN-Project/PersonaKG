12. of all the things i dislike about the sequel trilogy , the way it deals with the new republic is the worst . maybe it ' s because i grew up reading the eu , but as soon as i read the opening crawl of tfa i thought " resistance ? that ' s just stupid " and the republic ' s destruction is literally a set  up for finn to ask " where ' s   poochie   rey "

13. i think the best way to introduce them would be through cannibals bay . i like the theory of jon becoming the next night ' s king and maybe he will be the one to find and tame the legendary creature . either way , the presence of dragons and white walkers makes this whole story so much more awesome , what would be more awesome than a massive blue eyed dragon who breathes ice cold enough to take on a normal dragon . also , if r  l  j is true , then it would be very fitting for him to become the next night ' s king and wield an ice dragon to take on dany ' s dragons and there would be a whole new dance of dragons similar to the blackfyre rebellion . just much more epic .

15. having ts on in the back ground shouldn ' t affect the way you play . if it ' s too much trouble , then perhaps a different alliance  corp would be better for you ? fly safe .
