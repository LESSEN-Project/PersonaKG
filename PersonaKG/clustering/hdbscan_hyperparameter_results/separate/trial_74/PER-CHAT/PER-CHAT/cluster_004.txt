1. it happened about a year and a half ago . i am unsure if i could still do so . looking back on it now i wish i had right away . then again i didn ' t quite know what was happening . you hear about it and know the stories . outside it seems so simple but inside it is just a cluster of confusion . i definitely did not feel black and white about it . i was in shock about it and actually just didnt let my mind process it . not to mention the extreme victim shaming and drama that was ensued by my ex over it . the prioritizing of his own feelings . he callrd it " what you did " and how could i have done this " to him " . it distracted me from really ever doing anything about it . and yeah , it was a big thing in my life . still is . i ' m still dealing with it . i found out recently that this guy has another case against him apparently . if i speak out it would help the case . but i am trying to heal . and i ' m currently unsure if i pursue going to the authorities what will happen . will it reopen everything . make it worse . will everyone turn against me again . will i lose the little friends i have left . will i feel worse ? will i find closure ? i will have to tell my parents . now that will just open up more wounds and i am already swimming in lacerations . i am just unsure if i have the strength to survive all of those factors . and until i find that strength i have kept quiet . but then on the other hand i am beginning to feel that if speak up i will find more strength and maybe more closure than i thought i needed . i don ' t even want to face or him or ever see him again . because this guy made me believe that he really cared about me . the lies he told me . if i ever see him again i don ' t know how i would react and i fear that as well . part of me still cares for the part of him that he pretended to be . so it still scares me that i might feel those feelings if i ser him again . for me its hard to let go of that person because i really needed the person he was with that mask on . and i fell for it . ah i dont know . but i do know that hes young . and capable of getting better at being that way . so something needs to be done so he doesn ' t do what he did to me to anyone else , or worse .

2. oof . imma a lonely boy so i can  t give advice from experience , but i would say something along the lines of . i was already looking at another girl and blah blah blah . but you already fucked up so what you learn . take your time bruh . i mean if ur tryna smash and dash then try to  sexualize  yourself . but if u tryna get a relationship be honest and genuine . be like a anime girl right before she confesses ya know . or if your neither and it was  spur of the moment  just play it off like ,  natural boy reacting to your above average sized breasts  , good luck ! ur gonna need it .

3. just ask her  random question . if i asked you if you  d date me , would you ?  or something like that . don  t make it seem like you want to date her , just like a funny question .

4. you  re so strong for making the decision you did though , just remember that . you  re worth so much more than the way he was treating you and you knew that  i hope you realise how amazing that is . so many people haven  t got as far as you have face  blowing  a  kiss
   (ID: 726d5aaac9472ccdcb64345cd6d082bee4eae6fa)

5. yes , our minds love to punish ourselves when we are low . i promise if you truly try you can feel better and once you do it will be easier next time and so on and so on . feeling like this i truly know can be dangerous . don ' t be afraid to talk . get it all out . it ' s ok to be sad . but you have to tools inside your head to make yourself better ! remind yourself that you are worth it red  heart

6. that sounds really fantastic . i had the same thing with my so , we didn ' t kiss until our third date . we ' re still together a year later , and i know we will be for the rest of our lives . it sounds like you know that , or something similar , about your new love . good on you , and i really hope it works out . thanks for posting this , it ' s nice to see something so happy and positive , especially given i ' ve been having kind of a rough time of late so aside , she ' s wonderful in every way imaginable .

7. yeah this is bad man . very bad . that ' s emotional cheating . it ' s legitimate cheating . you ' ve known for a while that your wife loves attention from men . this is problematic . i think the best solution is separation and possibly divorce . you said it yourself , you feel like the bond that you had with her has been broken . don ' t think twice about it because christmas is around the corner . your wife is a cheater . she requires validation from other men that aren ' t her husband . you were there every night after work for her when you were newlyweds . it ' s never good enough for her . you deserve better , op .

8. nah , you should probably went easier with her . anyway , someone would still tell her that and it could have been worse .
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

9. that ' s understandable , i ' m sure the pain and study are more than hard enough to deal with without him making matters worse for you . i hope you can see someone helpful soon !

10. well my friend you sound like a worthy gentleman . is this fair lass of yours isn ' t ready for the snorlax then it ' s her loss . sloth is the enemy of greatness and if she continues to drag it along , you certainly deserve better . apologies , i ' m so drunk that my atheist  heathen ass may have just quoted the bible . nonetheless , the point is the same . if she keep stringin ' ya along , you deserve better mate .

11. she ' s lucky to have a guy like you who is out here trying to make an effort to keep her happy . good people deserve to stay on top . you mean well and i pray she sees it just as that . best wishes in your endeavors brother

12. what am i suppose to say ? what ' s done is done , no need to keep feeling guilty and letting it eat me up for months messing with my mind and shit . just letting go now and not letting it bother me sounds way better then letting stuff fuck me up like most people do .
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

13. what you ' re telling me sounds like he doesn ' t care and it makes you feel bad , so leave him . you deserve to be cared about . don ' t let anyone tell you what you care about isn ' t enough .

14. hmm , well i can be pretty bitter about it too . although i still occasionally get propositioned for sex so i guess i could be uglier . too bad i ' m kind of involuntarily asexual meds and other issues or else i ' d sleep around more . at least someone wants to touch me lol . i ' ve done the weight loss thing and that didn ' t really help not like those before and after pictures where the after is a totally cute guy . it doesn ' t help help that i ' m a socially anxious and naturally introverted reserved person been that way since before the tumblr era so it ' s hard for my inner personality to come out so that ' s another strike . i guess just hold on to see if someone can look past looks and try not to be a forever aloner . pretty hokey advice that i try to give myself .

15. were you overreacting ? i feel like you didn  t react enough . if this shit was the other way around would he be cool with it ? the answer is hell no . so should you be alright with this ? hell nah . whatever feelings or reactions you have here , i say they are warranted and very much valid . i  m sorry this happened . at least you know what signs to pick up on next time some douche tries this bullshit .

16. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .

17. well again , not to take away from your problems , but everyone has them . even those that seem to have all their shit together are dealing with something . hang in there my friend .
   (ID: 7c5209c3b827e0de0cd436466f80ce09b615606b)

18. hon , you need to think about yourself here . i know that can be hard , especially if you ' re a giver by nature , but it ' s true . if you don ' t feel safe , comfortable , and respected in your relationship , you won ' t be truly happy . and that may not seem like the end of the world now , but it will in time . eventually , bitterness and resentment can start to grow and you ' ll find yourself hating the person you once loved . if you don ' t think you can be happy dealing with his bipolar disorder , it ' s ok to move on . it ' s better that both of you find partners you can truly be fulfilled and happy with , even if it means going through some pain first .
   (ID: 87dcb06b0e31b35730fe93ce7dcbef85e6078b40)

19. yeah if you have a gut feeling you won ' t like dating her then don ' t . i mean if she wants to just be fwb that would be cool though lol .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

20. nta  i mean it is a dick move to break up over text that way especially while someone  s deployed . however , i don  t think that matters given that he was an abuser and a deployment would give you a chance to leave him without him reacting violently , not letting you , etc . his reaction of threatening to hunt you down says everything about him , what  s he going to do ? beat you ? kill you ? you don  t need such a horrible man in your life . maybe it  d have been more respectful to do it over video or phone i guess but that also just would have opened you to more abusive traumatizing behavior from him , probably would have been worse to hear it in those ways rather than text anyway . i  m sorry for what you  ve gone thru and the decisions you  ve had to make here . as for your friend , does she know how he  s treated you ?
