2. i said digit  are failing , not useless . i hope they all become great members of society , but i am not that naive . how have you proved anything yourself ? seriously , tell me what you consider being useful to society ? how has gaming motivated you to be useful to the world ?

6. just take time talking with him . as a male , performance anxiety can certainly be tough . however , with the right support , it can be a great dynamic . tell him and show him that finishing early one of the main fears is perfectly normal and will take practice to control . nobody is born to be a pornstar in terms of performance right away ! for example , if he finishes early , i found the greatest confidence booster wasn  t necessarily my partner saying  it  s perfectly fine  rather showing me and reassuring me that she viewed it as me being so attracted to her that i couldn  t hold back . after we both took time to learn each other  s sexual preferences and finding the balance , the sex is great and i don  t have to worry about performance anymore the nervousness was simply caused by me thinking about societal  norms  and their implied notion of me having to perform perfectly or my woman would get bored and be unimpressed .

7. from your pics the 38mm looks far better . if anything , the 42mm looks a little too large to my eye . but really , don ' t worry about what other people say . you ' ll be the one looking at it most of the time so buy something that you ' ll be happy with .

8. i feel like it depends what you use it for ? if you use it just for fun and  or as a little treat for yourself , then no . but if you ' re using it as an escape from shit like " negative emotions , " then you might . i was always told to be responsible with pot and that it ' s best not to resort to using it if i ' m having a bad day . because then the day might come where you ' re having a really bad day , and you try to find your pot , only to find that you ' re out ! you ' d have no idea how to then cope with your emotions and would be , in essence , " addicted " to it . honestly , i feel that the only exception to not using pot to deal with your emotions would be if a doctor prescribed it to you for that reason .

14. personally , i ' d save experimenting with new forms of weed for when you don ' t have anything else going on . you ' re paying for the concert and you ' ll want to enjoy it , so why take the risk that you ' ll be too high to fully appreciate it ? there ' s also the risk that you ' ll underestimate your tolerance or the dose and you ' ll just be spending the whole time waiting for a high that never comes . if you do decide to try edibles , just follow the normal advice and take very small doses with plenty of time in between .

15. i ' m not sure if this is the most effective technique but i just try to be honest . i ' ll ask for them by name and then ask if i ' m pronouncing that correctly . if someone asks how i got their number , i say it ' s from a list that the campaign has , i ' m not sure how it ' s compiled .

17. i was afraid of that . my life philosophy is " don ' t be an asshole " , so i may just have to stop ordering those now that i know it makes someone ' s day worse . thanks for the answer !
