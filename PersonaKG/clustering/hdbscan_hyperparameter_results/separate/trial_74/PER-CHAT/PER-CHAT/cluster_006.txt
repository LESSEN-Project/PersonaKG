   (ID: 7928bd3c3e727c94ff476240a27ed7199d92d666)

4. it  s the internet my dude , you aren  t going to change the minds of people who think they  re right . all you can do is flawlessly which is an unfortunate aspect of talking to people on the internet present your counter argument and hope some people are willing to look at things objectively . maybe you  ll convince one person . just present your sources and hope for the best . the biggest thing is to never take the arrows too seriously , it  ll just make you angry because reddit has a mob mentality against anything contrary to the accepted opinion of the day .

5. yes i  m fully aware , but through consistent elaboration then maybe i could help at least one person learn the truth and show them the difference . as long as just one person learns from me , then my efforts are all worth it

6. i know it ' s someone else since you replied with decency . just find it comical how my own view and something that should affect no one still offends people . it ' s a pathetic culture we have going on .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

7. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

8. how am i ridiculing incels ? i only asked a question . nothing about this post was meant to be derogatory .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

9. are you just downvoting people not conforming to your sensitivities ! we are the people you asked for " help . i was right
   (ID: cd0b72d117bf74908c3edaaf3947b089a9dafc0c)

10. you have a perceived notion on the us government ' should ' run . which you literally just proved my point . you don ' t understand how they actually work .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

11. why ask a question if you ' re going to incorrectly assume the answer ? i know you were trying to be sarcastic , but it just comes off as smug . i ' m sure you could convince me and others of your argument if you actually tried , but that doesn ' t seem to be your goal here . if you do want to engage in meaningful discussion , i ' m all ears .
   (ID: f3f34b7b903c833de2625265da4585abdc86ab7c)

12. you know what , you ' re absolutely right , it ' s mean for me to point out your errors  especially on a forum like idle heroes . i don ' t intend to discourage you or make you feel like you need to justify yourself . you ' ve taught me a lesson today and in the future , i ' ll know that pointing out someones minor mistakes , is not worth the effort and only upsets people . thank you for taking the time for the back and forth . peace .

13. lmao how pretentious are you ? you write like a child found a thesaurus and thought it would make him cool . i understand the historical context . slavery wasn  t ok , slavery doesn  t justify genocide . white people were awful  brutalized slaves , doesn  t mean you should go and murder everyone with a drop of european blood . but sure , go ahead pretending you  re smarter than everyone else  justifying genocide , bud .

14. lol . who ' s trying to save face . my original post was not meant to be taken seriously . other people understood that , or were less inclined to jump into a discussion with the " i know something about something obvious to anyone with a high school education   so let me ' correct ' you " vibe we all love so much around here . you also clearly didn ' t read the thread .
   (ID: 17b8a304069d7530607e28f8e04d840e28be0d3e)

15. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

16. read  watch the fucking news . you sound like a total fucking idiot when you don ' t know what the fuck is going on around you and you make so many fucking stupid political statements when you don ' t fucking know what ' s fucking happening . don ' t correct me on something that you don ' t have a fucking clue about . fucking damnit .
   (ID: dadc9911849239b0d3b98ea480d7a3be43208f42)

17. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

18. super delegates you realise that  s the problem right ? i can read fine thanks , it  s my comprehension of you as a person that i  m struggling with . you actually defend this nonsense . your country is about as democratic as north korea
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

19. wait . i never which side someone is on . please tell me if you are stupid or have common sense ?
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

20. never said i ' d stop replying to you for good , i made it clear i was talking about the specific post i said it in . it really wasn ' t a struggle , just search dbd on f13 sub . doesn ' t matter when it happened . it happened and you were proven wrong and can ' t handle that fact . i made a reddit account a month ago , yeah . not sure why new accounts have to be considered troll but . cool ? if anything , just proves my point that you ' re always paranoid . i mean i don ' t reply to nothing , but like everything else mentioned , keep living in denial , i guess .
