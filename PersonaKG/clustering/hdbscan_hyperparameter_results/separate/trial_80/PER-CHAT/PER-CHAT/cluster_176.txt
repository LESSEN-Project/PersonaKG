3. i highly recommend getting the nathan drake collection for ps4 that has the first digit games on it . you can decide for yourself which is your favorite but they all have a lot of great moments and it ' s worth playing from the start just to see how nate  elena met .

4. i just started watching the dragon prince . only on ep digit , but it ' s already shaping up to be pretty epic . great visuals and storytelling , likable characters , awesome world building , it ' s just awesome all around . one of the creators of avatar the last airbender , aaron ehasz is on the writing team on the show as well , so one can draw a lot of parallels between the two shows . not too violent , but not too tame , so perfect for a kid your son ' s age . and no annoying voices in the characters , so you won ' t need to claw out your ears . it ' s just good clean fun for the family .

5. i love it ! i think this theme is way better than last year . the bathroom looks great , and i love the vintage  inspired wall paper throughout the house . i think the theme  based comps will be really fun , too . i hope they do a color  wars comp that would be a great food comp , which i doubt they ' ll bring back .

6. solid picks . erased is ridiculously good , time travel isn  t a done enough genre if you ask me . attack on titan , baccano , durarara , and cowboy bebop are some of my other favs .

7. k  on ! i was putting it off for a long time , and i picked it up recently . i ' m really enjoying it so far i ' m at season digit at the moment , if i knew it would be this fun i would have definitly watched it earlier . that said though , i ' m still putting cowboy bebop off . i will probably regret this to . because i know its good .

8. oneshot . its an undertale like game , but would be even better only if it had gameplay other than speaking with npcs

9. is there anything airing on nick worth watching , or would i be subscribing to watch through the back catalog ? if it launched with some kind of flagship show i might try it .

10. its was my first one too , so i recommend you jojo ' s bizarre adventure , mob psycho digit and overlord . jojo ' s is a must have for anime fans . just watch it even if the first episodes are more or less bad . if you liked one punch man you will also like mob . that all i want to say to that . try overlord if you want something new .

11. learndota2 though this is very old , some of them are still relevant purgegamers youtube , he has digit playlists dedicated to teaching dota digit and a series where he teaches day9 everything about dota digit . just ignore all the idiots who go out of their way to shittalk lol , most people from dota days are still butthurt that pendragon took a few ideas . drow is similar to ashe and pudge is similar to blitzcrank , frost marksman and fat hooker respectively . teemo is apparently similar to techies ? at least in the sense that they plant mines and you get reported for playing them if i ' m remembering teemo correctly . there ' s loads of thematic similarities between heroes as well if your keen on some of those . e . g . shyvana reminds me strongly of dragon knight .

12. god of war ? if you know anything about norse mythology the story is captivating . and if you don  t , just read a little about it and you  ll appreciate the game way more .
