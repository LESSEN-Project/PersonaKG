1. do a quick visual check to make sure , but i dont think its too big of a problem . check proper fluid level  color , check pad and rotor wear , and look for any leaks in the lines if you are worried .

8. may i ask what system you play and what rep you are ? because there is no way in hell you ' re playing high level duels and landing a mix of lights and heavies consistently as kensei . its most likely mid tier at best . people don ' t parry in high tier . they just block . and kensei is left useless at that point .
