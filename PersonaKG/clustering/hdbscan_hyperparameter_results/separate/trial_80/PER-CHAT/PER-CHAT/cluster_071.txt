1. i mean if the location is good , which it sounds alright it could make sense for some people . like i agree the rules sound insane but if you have a room to rent in sf if you are willing to lower the price you can make unreasonable demands .

2. insurance should be and used to be based on risk . legislation has taken that out of the equation in many ways . younger people rightfully don ' t recognize it as their responsibility to pay into a system when their risk is lower

3. personally i think the flavors go well together . i ' ve heard people talk about acidity being the main factor as to why they don ' t go for it and that i can understand . i just don ' t like people saying it ' s weird or the thought of fruit on pizza baffles them .

4. i feel like that might have to do with the quality  nachos arent a gourmet food , but i feel like if you were to try making them at home the meat would certainly be better than most anywhere that serves nachos stadiums , arenas if you still enjoy soggy , meatless nachos after accounting for ingredients . then thats cool , healthier too

5. its more like they dont buy any plastic . they definitely dont use microwaves . even i dont do that . but i do think the plastic thing is ridiculous .

6. late to the party but let me explain the real reason they are almost extinct  remember in oregon trail when you went hunting and shot everything and was like fuck yeah a 900lbs of food . my family has been at a grueling pace , and one of the kids has dysentery  we could really use this . then you realize  you can only carry 100lbs . that is the story of the american buffalo .

7. in australia we are paid wages  salary into our bank account . and we make payments to others via internet banking transfers . why are money orders and cheques still such a thing in the u . s ? i know my post isn ' t helpful and i feel for the op but it seems like these sorts of issues could be easily avoided .

8. i ' ll agree i have read that this is a problem . i wasn ' t as aware about this . seems silly to tax the people trying to give a child a home .

9. i feel like with many a pizza , if you use wonderful ingredients the pizza will be fine . the difference between fresh and canned pineapple , or breadt an upscale local ham or oscar mayer . i try not to go to places that have hawaiian pizza on the menu because i am a pizza snob and selling hawaiian pizza shows that you dont take pizza seriously and wouldn ' t be inclined to use wonderful ingredients in the first place . but what ' s a deluxe ? mushroom , onion , green pepper , sausage , pepperoni ?

10. it ' s not ? since when ? where do you live ? every fast food restaurant i ' ve ever been to , you take your tray over to the bin , toss the trash , and leave the tray on top .
