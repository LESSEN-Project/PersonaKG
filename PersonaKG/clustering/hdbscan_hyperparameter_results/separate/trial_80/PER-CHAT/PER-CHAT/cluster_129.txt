1. so you ' re clearly letting it bother you and they notice that right ? people like that feed off of your response . you have to learn how to not let it bother you .

2. my father taught me to always hold a door open . for people . it is in the guise of manners . we as well mannered people you and i both will do things for other people that are nice . i hold the door open for people , pull out a chair , help you put on your coat , carry your bags and it is all because of good manners . if i were to do the opposite  walk through the door without holding it , leave you to carry all your own bags etc . would you feel that i am being rude ? i don ' t know because i don ' t know you . maybe you would feel angry that i am just looking after myself . maybe you would feel happy that i wasn ' t assuming that you needed my help . but i know that i would feel rude . the way i was brought up was to help people and to have good manners . that is probably why benevolent sexism happens , people really feel as though they are doing the right thing . as for the calling people honey or sweetie , i am with you on that . i get called that by old ladies " oh aren ' t you a sweetie " that guest at my hotel . but if someone were to say in a certain context i can understand your frustrations . like a lot of things i think there is a line that you cross when you act too familiar . but don ' t be embarrassed for you , be embarrassed for them for not knowing correct social etiquette .

3. i have this problem too . my trans best friend and i refer to each other as " tr    ies " all the fucking time because we both understand that we ' re doing it to take the piss out of actual transphobes . but then i really have to try hard not to refer to other trans people like this . it ' s really bad lol basically , you ' ve just gotta surround yourself with people who aren ' t going to use that language . we automatically pick up and appropriate the language of those we surround ourselves with something something egotistic in  grouping .

4. don ' t complain . treat them respectfully like any other person .
   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

5. because when i get asked if i read or like books , i always saw i do . because deep down i know i should read and it  s embarrassing to not know a book title or author . that  s why people get mad . dude , if you know you have a grammar problem and you dislike reading either accept your non existent interest to learn or start reading . it  s not hard . i hate when people say they love reading but can  t name a single novel or book .

6. i don  t understand trolls . what is lacking or missing in life that they need the validation of words in a screen ? it  s pretty pathetic

7. i see what you mean . i have been called stuck  up because i keep to myself and sometimes have a serious expression on my face that really doesn ' t reflect what ' s going on in my head . i ' ve heard of the marco guy  he really doesn ' t have much to be stuck  up about  simply being the drug  addled son of a rich man is hardly an accomplishment . did that sound snooty ? oops !

8. when i for some reason or another , i or someone else makes stupid mistake or such say " humans are stupid " most people take it as offense  they don ' t realize i am human too and i have to explain it , always , to them .

9. the thing about weight , height , acne , etc . is that it will inevitably talked about . sometimes it ' s genuine concern , sometimes it ' s an insult . the best way to " redirect it " is to actually start being comfortable with your own self . learn to embrace your flaws , and no one will be able to use it against you . if someone does make a joke about your weight , you can also agree and amplify . and then after that , pull them aside in private and talk about how hurtful their comments were
