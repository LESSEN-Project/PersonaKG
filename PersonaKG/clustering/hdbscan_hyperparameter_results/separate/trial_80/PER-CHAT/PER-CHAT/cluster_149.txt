2. we all screw up and make mistakes . you will make more in your years of driving . just kind of put your hands up and shake them and that kind of acknowledges that you know that you were wrong . it ' s sort of a visual " sorry . he can ' t do anything with your license plate . even in the worst possible case that he could , it ' s his word against yours . it ' s not even worth his time . he probably just let the dust settle . if you ' re on the road , you have to deal with people who make mistakes and assholes alike .

3. i used to be a bartender and a group of girls i never saw before were drunk and asked for my number . i gave them a fake number , two of them came the next day and called me an asshole for giving them a wrong number . sucks being in that position specially where you have to stand there and can  t leave lol .

5. a guy on my street used to try to drive us to school all the time and one of my friends used to go with him all the time . my friend always in the newest clothing , shoes , new phone , all that . well one day dude offered me a ride to school and i accepted when i was running late . during the ride to school he stopped in a neighborhood and told me  i will blow you for  digit  flat out said that . so me being like digit and this guy like digit are now face to face and he wants to blow me . i thought about it for a second , kindly declined , he tried to persuade me with more money but i again declined . in hindsight , its really gross to think about it and it still bothers me sometimes knowing a good friend was letting him do it .
