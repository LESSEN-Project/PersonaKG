1. nta just because they ' re customers doesn ' t mean they have a right to treat you like that . if there were some foul language then yes , yta but from the sound of it you were justified , in my opinion .

2. you were just helping them with a new years resolution of giving up soda . they are gonna be panicked anytime they ask for a large pepsi now .

3. i always arrive super early to stuff because i  m anxious about being late , so i got to starbucks like digit minutes early . this is obviously just a casual coffee date , i met the guy online , wanted to get to know him irl . i order a drink and sit down to wait on my laptop . the guy arrives digit minutes early and comes to greet me and asks if i want a drink . i say no because i already have one . he suddenly gets really upset he can  t buy me a drink . keeps asking me to let him buy one , or even weirder , kept offering to give me money for the one i already paid for ? i just keep saying no , it  s alright , i  m a grown woman lol . so he gets a drink and kinda sulks for the rest of the date , like keeps giving one word answers , doesn  t ask me anything . as soon as i finished my drink he asked to buy me one and i said i actually needed to leave . it was just bizarre .

5. wow this was super interesting , you  re a good storyteller ! i don  t think you did anything wrong considering you were having your own experience and you couldn  t possibly read her mind if she was expecting more to come out of it but you didn  t do anything out of the ordinary . . in the meantime , don  t go into her restaurant until this is resolved

6. i get what the manager is saying and i respect that , you should be nice and professional with delivery personnel . but god what a great way to ruin a cute story .

7. nah . i don  t think it  s really that big of a deal for her to go back and grab a couple of things while you are ringing up groceries as long as you  re not already done scanning and other people including you aren  t having to wait several minutes on her . on the other hand , i don  t think you were necessarily in the wrong . i mean , i understand your reasoning . if it is something that bothers you , you have the right to voice that . it  s probably something to bring up in the car on the way home or at home and not at the store , however .

8. that was quite shitty of her . lots of people use others as kink dispensers and then get mad when they ' re not comfortable with what ' s going on . you did the right thing in stopping .

9. yeah i would have apologised too . i guarantee he felt more embarrassed than you . strangely enough i would have had a moral dilemma of even mentioning that the drink was forgotten .
