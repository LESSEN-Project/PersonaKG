1. but the left has a ' my way or the highway ' mentality do you not even realize how biased you just were ?
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

2. but reddit is a place where people care more about being morally right than factually correct . how dare you prove them wrong !
   (ID: d048a45810866f7b853972f50c2c2746bc339a21)

3. super delegates you realise that  s the problem right ? i can read fine thanks , it  s my comprehension of you as a person that i  m struggling with . you actually defend this nonsense . your country is about as democratic as north korea
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

4. i feel like you invite this kind of opposition view to your thoughts when you post them unasked for in a sub called unpopular opinion . we ' re not talking about laws here , were talking about your unpopular opinion .
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

5. funny how you haven ' t actually been able to make a logical counter argument . you ' re just saying " you ' re wrong " without the logical backing that i have . then the " boo hoo whatever dude ! you ' re , uh , just like , uh , a flat earther dude " really , i am ? i ' m literally just like a flat earther ? that is your brilliant counter argument ? that saying it is wrong to promote a lie is exactly as bad as lying ? that is what you ' re telling me ? do you . do you realize how incredibly stupid you just made yourself look ? you just made yourself look like a clown .

6. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .

7. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

8. wait what ? if i choose based on skin color then that  s absolutely racism . you  re picking the better one of the two
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

9. what medium ? their website , that they own ? or the internet as a whole ? if it ' s the latter , then you grossly overestimate the reach of facebook . if it ' s the former , then you grossly misunderstand the meaning of private property . as for banning bernie sanders posts , they would have every right to do so . and if they banned trump , the same . or if they banned discussions about nascar or bob ross or apollo digit or star wars or anything else . facebook is not yours . you do not own it , nor do your opinions much matter to them . why ? because you are not the customer . the advertisers and shareholders are the customers . you and i ? we are an item on a shelf . our value ? the information we freely provide them that they then sell . why did they ban gun sales ? liability . if a madman buys a gun over facebook and shoots up a building , then the government will crawl so far up facebook ' s collective anus that they will be poking mark zuckerberg ' s brain stem . that is the last thing they want , so they are covering their asses preemptively .

10. i think the question is asking what industries you ' d like to kill off , i think you ' re taking it as an insult
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

11. you have got to be kidding . how in the hell do you classify this as racism ?
   (ID: 7928bd3c3e727c94ff476240a27ed7199d92d666)

12. you ' re ridiculous and making your whole movement look bad . do you want to know why vegans are seen as a joke to so many people ? because of the ones like you that are outspoken but can ' t form a proper thought .
   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

13. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

14. does it fucking matter to you ? are you a professional ? are you even a parent ? why dont you keep your " opinions " to yourself since you obviously know jack shit about what ' s going on .
   (ID: ee2906681b3174a80cefe2bcfb40bd3a110c1b29)

15. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

16. says who ? who gives a shit about ' forms of charity ' when the end product is the same ? you should remember who these are really for . people in need . not our own morality .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

17. you have a perceived notion on the us government ' should ' run . which you literally just proved my point . you don ' t understand how they actually work .
