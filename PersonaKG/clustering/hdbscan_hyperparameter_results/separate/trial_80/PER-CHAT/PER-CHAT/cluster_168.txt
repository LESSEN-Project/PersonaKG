1. if you ' ve been paying attention to anywhere outside of this circle jerk of a subreddit , you would know why people are bashing this episode .

2. basically , if he  s a changed man , why is he bringing this up now ? if he  s moved past this , why does he feel the need to express this ? being love and validated aren  t synonymous . you can love your pops , but think his actions are wrong . furthermore , people are in love with what they think liam is . who outside of his close friends and family really knows him . how many people loved kevin spacey before he was ousted ? i dont think you understand what i mean when i say he  s seeking validation . he wants people to say  yeah , i understand how you could have those thoughts  . that  s why it  s selfish , it  s self serving . he could have said ,  i was a racist who unjustly went around hunting people i knew nothing about hoping to kill them to satisfied my twisted definition of justice . instead he churched up the story to try and justify is actions . like i  ve said , if a white person raped his friend , would he have acted the same way ? i  m willing to wager he wouldn  t . we can be empathetic , we aren  t monsters , but we don  t have to validate it . these are the thoughts of a fucking racist .

3. i ' m not surprised so many people are supporting him  the cognitive dissonance must be a total mindfuck for them . that ' s what religion does , turns people in to mindless sheep . the person i feel most sorry for is the pastor ' s daughter .

4. thing is i wouldn  t call it a debate if we were to go by the textbook definition . i could almost guarantee that if i sat down with lorinbassnectar he wouldn  t want to have a debate about policy he would simply shut me out . i  m sure , and maybe i  m making an assumption , but i  m sure that we could both agree that a lot if not the majority of his fan base has no knowledge about policy and simply follows what is posted . that  s what i find dangerous . when so many people look up to an individual they treat his words as facts , and this applies to both sides of the aisle . i also call it dangerous because it is a sure way of not only ostracizing a large portion of your fan base who listens to your music to escape reality but it could even pose the problem of many people losing hope in one place where they thought they could find it , and that is dance music . that  s just me and i can tell from the many downvotes that  s it  s not a very popular opinion .

5. amping up teh st00pid , eh ? fine . wtf are you talking about with " opposites " some sort of straw man , i must surmise .  looks who ' s racist now . oh please . " no , you ' re the real racist " glenn beck ? is that you ?  so , where ' s the asian history month ? where ' s the gay history month ? where ' s the deaf history month ? women ' s history month , hispanic heritage month , american indian heritage month , and asian pacific american heritage  these are all stupid ideas . there ' s only one history . there is only one history in fact but the whole point of of such things is not the actual history but the presentation of history . the only history that people ever heard about was nearly devoid of blacks save for demeaning stereotypes . bhm was intended to bring an awareness of the missing history . actually , gay pride exists for precisely the same reason . prior to very recently , the only public images and perceptions of gays were nothing but gross caricatures .  i ' m aware that the blacks have had a hard time of it . i don ' t think that ' s relevant to this discussion . what ' s relevant is your apparent ignorance of the meta  history . the very fact that you are decrying bhm clearly shows your ignorance of that very thing .  where does it end ? when people no longer feel the need to complain about black history month , gay pride , et cetera , there will be no need for black history month and gay pride celebrations , et cetera .

6. seriously . this is nuts . the article says that prosecutors will seek the maximum penalty for the guy involved . how can they look themselves in the mirror and believe this is the right thing to do ? it is barbaric . sure , he is clearly no angel . but that doesn ' t make this anything other than a travesty of justice .

7. yeah its celebration but if you actually read the quote   x200b   somebody will give us a breakdown of what was happening out there without us having to actually experinence it they know the reaction will be madness

8. that  s absolutely true . every angry word published will hurt and continue to hurt those children forever . that  s always been my biggest problem with bethenny .

9. compare his lifestyle to the previous one . the current pope is much more modest with his attire and seems to me like a genuinely good guy . it ' s a nice message and you are just hating so you can hate on religion . why do you care ?

10. i  m not saying . i agree . the question being the magnitude of the offense . i myself have family that actually work on the show via union chicago teamsters so it  s not in their benefit that it gets cancelled . however , it begs the question  isn  t it strange how this guy creates an entire scenario that  s fabricated from the start albeit he quickly lost control of it and the show is not being affected ? yet , rosanne for comparison affects all the actors and crew just from a remark ? a verbal statement that cost no one nothing aside from those that decided to give her to time of day . not sure why i  m being downvoted  i asked if there was more information and all i got was  ummmmm  and  uh  s  and answering questions with questions . there  s no useful information with that .

11. how do people not just sit back and be like . this is ridiculous !

12. he didn ' t almost collapse a grooming gang trial and it utterly transparent that you only all of a sudden give a shit about the victims because you think it bolsters your point of ' football man bad ' . you didn ' t care about those girls before and you don ' t care about them now and that is precisely why someone like tommy robinson came to prominence .
