1. i get the feeling from what you  ve written that she  s saying this to make you jealous . i think you need to tell her that you  ve been thinking about it and it  s bothering you that she seems so hung up on her and talk about where you want to go from there . do you want her to stop seeing this girl ? do you want the communication to stop ? i think you need to decide what your ideal situation would be in regard to their current relationship . make sure she knows why you feel like this and how it makes you feel when she responds so quickly . if you guys are hanging out together why does she need to be constantly texting this other girl she used to date ? it  s not like they were only friends  you said she was in love with her and it  s inappropriate for her to still be this involved with her . i don  t know if this is useful advice but it  s what i  d do if i were in your situation . best of luck .

2. what you ' re telling me sounds like he doesn ' t care and it makes you feel bad , so leave him . you deserve to be cared about . don ' t let anyone tell you what you care about isn ' t enough .

3. she  s taking my advice and basically just dropping subtle hints to see if she is bi or gay . asking her outright could go multiple ways and , like you , doesn  t wanna risk her friendship but is contemplating if it  s worth the risk since if she is bi or gay they might end up in a relationship . so it  s a difficult scenario . see what kinda friends she hangs out with since gays tend to congregate in my experience and find out what her previous relationships were like if she  s had any . so far it  s going pretty well and hannah is pretty sure she  s bi but still needs to find out more before she moves forward with it . oh yeah i actually had a situation similar to that with my partner , neither of us knew if the other was gay or straight or not . i  m pan so and i  ve dated girls and guys in the past , they  ve dated only one girl and regretted the relationship . after i found out they were pan too because i noticed a lot of their friends were gay , they had an even amount of girl to guy friends , they never denied being gay , etc so i asked them out and apparently they liked me for months on end . now we  re in an almost three year relationship . i hope all goes well for you smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

4. so basically you got a crush on your friend and not in love with your boyfriend ? from my point of view you have three options reak up with boyfriend and hook up with the friend , break up with boyfriend and hook up with other people or work things out with your boyfriend . if i were you i ' d go with the first option but i ' m forever alone ignore me and do what you wanna do . anyhow , i personally don ' t thing there ' s any point in a relationship when its not a lifetime commitment but that ' s just me .

5. in my limited experience  it ' s best to set boundaries clearly , but one issue at a time . you walking up to her mother and saying " you need to back off " immediately sets you up as the adversary trying to cut her off from her baby girl in the most important time . you ' ll be treated that way from that point forward . instead , you need to talk about the individual things with your wife so you have an agreed stance the next time they come up with your mil . it ' s way less likely to lead to war if you can hold your wife ' s hand and speak up for her saying ' we ' ve decided it ' s best if it ' s just us and the medical staff in the delivery room ' , ' we ' ve done the research and want to do x ' , etc . than if you go in by yourself and try to lay down the law to a mother about her child . you can be the one to make the statements , but they need to be phrased as joint decisions with your wife ' s clear if silent support . if your wife doesn ' t want to have those conversations alone alone , that ' s fine . her part becomes to deflect , i . e . " we ' ll talk about it next time we see you " , or just not respond when the mil isolates her on an issue . her backtracking or bargaining alone will kill any progress you make by standing strong together . talk to her about that , too . also , congrats and good luck !

6. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted

7. the short answer is , get in and be the doer , not the done to . if he ' s wishy washy , unless you ' re in super deep , consider the fact that you are the age you are and the people you spend time with rub off on and affect you with you wish them to or not . pull back , give him some space and give yourself some space to evaluate what you want from a relationship . it sounds to me like you want a lack of games and a proper commitment of " we are together and we love one another , so let ' s make this work " it doesn ' t sound like that ' s the case .

8. i don  t think it  s women that like you less , it  s just not the best women who are acting like this with you . i mostly have female friends i knew before and after transitioning and they were all really supportive , same with any male friends i had . they are good people , so they accepted me wholeheartedly . i suggest finding those types of people in your life , regardless of gender yknow ?

9. ehh yes and no , from her point of view maybe , if she doesn ' t know how busy you are

10. my opinion , go out more . not to a bar or club more like a social event at the park find someone whose doing something similar to something you feel passionate about . ex girl jogging in the park go join her keep her company ask like how long have you been jogging here ? then improvise from there obviously ask her for her name just dont make it the first question so you seem interested at her hobby aswell as herself . next try to get into the friend area yes i know you don ' t want to be here but this stage is where youll learn the most truthful information about her . next start sharing life moments you wouldnt tell most people just think before you say it so it doesn ' t sound like extra baggage for the person . eventually youll know when to ask her on a date

11. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .

12. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

13. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .

14. i went on because life is about the present and future . if you regret , you will be wasting your time and proving , you can ' t get over someone . be a man  girl stand up and find someone who loves you . there are more fish in the sea , and if she  he left you it ' s because she  he didn ' t love you enough so why waste time on a lost cause . you are beautiful and deserve someone who sees that

15. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .

16. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .

17. honestly yeah i think you ' re kind of an asshole . men are always much more likely to leave their significant others due to illness  here we go , another example of it . like the girl you ' re meant to love could have something terribly wrong with her and you ' re out here just thinking about yourself and any future  key word future  kids ? come on dude . if you do break up with her because of this , i want you to look her dead in the eye and say " i can ' t deal with you being sick , and that ' s why i ' m leaving you "

18. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

19. it really sucks when things don ' t work out with someone you love . people make mistakes , but cheating isn ' t a mistake . you don ' t accidentally dip your dick in someone . it ' s a choice . a choice someone who fully loved you wouldn ' t make . i ' m sorry , you probably could ' ve worked things out if that hadn ' t happened . but he did it and you shouldn ' t let him get away with it . it sucks having to live without someone you love , but people make their own choices regardless of what anyone else tells them .

20. that ' s fair , one year is a pretty common tipping point in a relationship in my experience anyway . if you feel you have truely put in the effort to address this and seen no improvement , than i think you know what to do . let him know you ' re unhappy and that you want to be with him , but his lack of attention is hurting you . if he still does not put forth the effort than it ' s time to move on .
