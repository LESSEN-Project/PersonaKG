SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 9

1. i usually have to wait in the human line because either the kids or the husband has already eaten some of whatever we are buying and if we go to self serve i ' ll have to call over the staff member anyway to amend the " incorrect item weight " error .

2. i always notice the people that say this either have a 4x4 truck or youve just been lucky on the road . i drive a semi and dont blame anyone for going slower in snow  ice conditions . if youre unsure its better to take it slow rather than making a mistake and sliding through an intersection or causing a pile up . i do understand everyone has to be somewhere but not everyone is as experienced so just take your time or leave enough time in the mornings .

3. my area put up a stink about this because they put in an old time clock that barely works . we all manage to get clocked in before 5am but it ' s tough some days when it ' s malfunctioning . the supervisor has been nice enough to forgive a tardy so long that you were in line at digit  digit .

4. leaving cupboards and drawers open is a man thing . we ' re too busy to close them , i think .

5. i don ' t normally do this but i imagine it ' s because my stop is nearing and i don ' t want to move in , only to have to move out again shortly . it may also be for the legroom .

6. oh my god that  s a nightmare for me . i  ve only recently went through a drive thru for the first time and that was hard af for me .

8. my mom once went to a popeye ' s where the service was really slow and there was bulletproof glass separating the cashier from the customers . the service was so slow that a guy who was waiting in line was able to watch a few episodes of daredevil in the amount of time it took him to get his food . my brother wanted to leave , but my mom had already paid for our chicken and she didn ' t want to trust the dumb kid behind the counter with her credit card again . the moral of the story is that you shouldn ' t go to popeye ' s restaurants in the ghetto .

9. maybe not the worst but it ' s up there for me , taco bell .
