1. that ' s exactly right . it ' s important to have the same respect that you have for others , and apply it to yourself . mental health is weird , people are weird . i ' m glad more awareness has been brought to the subject of mental health . if i didn ' t get the help i needed , because of the awareness going around , idk where i would ' ve ended up . i appreciate that , and i ' m working on it lol .

2. it  s not being  holier  than  thou  , all it  s doing is challenging how we think about the people around us . if you  re a good person , great ! keep on doing what you  re doing . you are the type of person the ad is calling on to call out inappropriate behavior . that  s all .

4. i was massively overweight for the majority of my early life and got bullied for it to an extent , not to the point of trauma , but enough to motivate me . it ' s like a really painful band  aid that people like to put back on you and then rip off again , but you just need to eventually sew up the wound yourself so they don ' t have a place to put that band  aid anymore .

5. i digit  agree with your statement about people who are new to recovery low key bragging about their use . when i was in rehab there was always a group of sprouts sitting around trying to outdo each other with stories of how hard they supposedly were . i ' m not sure if they were trying to prove something or romanticising something they could no longer have now they are in recovery  i know how easy it is to become preoccupied with living in the past and sharing stories of the " good old days " when you know those " good old days " are no more . kind of a coping mechanism , however there was definitely a stench of one  upmanship lingering whenever the topic of drug use came up which was often as it was the reason everyone was there in the first place tldr  drug addicts like to talk about drugs

6. it ' s not rude at all ! i do enjoy talking to folks with different thoughts and opinions on the world , as long as its a respectable conversation . i ' ve always believed that god lets us have our free will . i mean , what a life we would have if we where micro  controlled by a guy we didn ' t really know . i also think that bad things happen , because we don ' t live in a perfect world , and while i don ' t know what a perfect world would be really , i could say that it would be no harm to anyone . the world we live in is thanks to the fall , and is a consequence of that decision  thanks , eve !  unfortunately . humans , in my opinion , also need to have something to look up to , something greater than themselves , whether that be science , a public figure , a deity , or even an object .

7. in my teens i wasn  t very sensitive to the subject . definitely use derogatory words and definitely wasn  t befriending anyone who was openly gay . but then i moved to ann arbor to work at my aunts bar and the very first two friends i made where gay but i didn  t know for like a month . that really opened my eyes . these two are amazing people , and after talking to them i couldn  t believe all the hate they have to face day in and day out . and i used to be apart of that . i can  t believe i used to think and act like that to another human just because of one difference . i will never use homophobic terms again and i pray that everyone in our society regardless of sexuality will receive the respect and happiness they deserve . i will always stand up for love for the rest of my life

8. well , i don ' t go around telling everyone i don ' t believe in the bible and all that nonsense . and i believe there are many people like me . it ' s easier to say nothiing most of the time unless confronted by one of those crazy people who want to send you to hell because you don ' t believe exactly like they do .
