1. you should stop trying very hard to get her to orgasm . many women , even those who do orgasm from penetrative intercourse , will get flustered and self  conscious and turned off if it ' s apparent to them that a guy is that focused on her orgasm . if she can ' t make herself come by masturbating , it ' s unlikely that anything you ' re doing is going to change that . focus on pleasing her and making her feel good , by her standard of what is pleasing and feels good , not yours . most women need to feel relaxed to climax , and feeling pressured to climax by your partner is the opposite of relaxing . here ' s a question  whose problem is this ? is your wife bothered by her lack of orgasm , or are you the person who is most upset about it ? if the former , there are workshops that she could attend that might help . if the latter , why would you create a problem in your marriage where none exists ?

2. just take time talking with him . as a male , performance anxiety can certainly be tough . however , with the right support , it can be a great dynamic . tell him and show him that finishing early one of the main fears is perfectly normal and will take practice to control . nobody is born to be a pornstar in terms of performance right away ! for example , if he finishes early , i found the greatest confidence booster wasn  t necessarily my partner saying  it  s perfectly fine  rather showing me and reassuring me that she viewed it as me being so attracted to her that i couldn  t hold back . after we both took time to learn each other  s sexual preferences and finding the balance , the sex is great and i don  t have to worry about performance anymore the nervousness was simply caused by me thinking about societal  norms  and their implied notion of me having to perform perfectly or my woman would get bored and be unimpressed .

3. if you ' re sure this is something you want to do . make constant sexual innuendos around him . touch him just platonically enough so nobody bats an eye about it , but linger just long enough for him to know that it ' s something you want . you could just straight  up tell him . i don ' t know that many men who would turn sex with a willing 16yo especially if it ' s legal where you are .

5. when having sex with my last girlfriend startet , i also had this problem digit or digit times . my problem is that sometimes my boner would disappear a soon as my girlfriend took her hand of my dick . i found out that this is linked with stress , at the beginning it was harder because it was embarrassed by it and my girlfriend startet to think it was about her body and she is unattractive to me . with even more pressure now it hasn ' t worked out again . because my ex girlfriend got really emotional at this point , i needed to tell her the truth . this was definitely the decision that ended this problem . because i already knew that it wasn ' t a problem with my body . i already feelt comfortable getting sexual with her . but as soon the point of putting on the condome comes , the slight fear overcame me , that these erection problem will lead her to believe she isn ' t sexy to me , which she struggled enough with at the beginning , because of her beeing digit years older . next time we startes having sex , my erection was there until the short moment of putting on that comdom . again i was worried about all the things that were talked about it and i stell feelt a little bit of embarrassment . and she did exactly the right thing , she calmed me down and just continued the same was we did before the condom . and it took some time again and we gave each other time and arousel by foreplay until the problem didn ' t accrue anymore . after that day it never happened again . i do see suspect some parallels with your post . and i can only suggest to you , if you want to have a chance of having sex with him , forget your plans . sit down with him and i tell him that it is ok for you it doesn ' t work out with penetrativ sex . by taking away stress factors for him , you make it way easier for him to hold his erection . also non penetrativ sex can be even more fun and it can help him to feel not so stressed before sex , when you can give him the feeling , of you beeing happy and satisfied . it would be pressure for every guy , if his girl is rarely in the country and on that rare occasion erection problems arise . knowing that you definitely want to have penetrativ sex is extra stressful . i think he knows you wish for that . and surely would like to fulfill it to you , but try to help him get more comfortable first . when you both try it viagra his stress won ' t be dissappearing . he will get depended on these for sex if you don ' t get rid of psychological boundaries first . when they are gone , you will be finding way more sex in the future .

6. okay first of all that is so completely normal for women and there is nothing we can do about it . it ' s vaginal discharge not because we ' re not wiping well enough .

7. be gentle . lube is your friend . use contraception . listen to her . foreplay ! most importantly  porn is not sex . sex is awkward , your first time especially . don ' t panic too much , as long as you love each other and are doing it because you both want to , it will be fine . make sure you ' re each ok with what the other is doing , remember you can set your own boundaries as well ! good luck my friend
