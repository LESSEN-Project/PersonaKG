Total from this dataset: 5

1. why would someone who has anxiety need to park marginally closer to the shops or need the extra space for getting in  out the car ? is the argument that it ' s so traumatic for them to be out , that those digit seconds they save by not walking from the regular non disabled spots really makes a difference ? pretty much . imagine you ' ve parked up at your local asda or somewhere . there are rows upon rows if cars and you have no idea what any if them are going to do . is one of them going to pull out and hit you ? is one of them going to come around the corner really fast ? could one of them be behind you right now ? you ' re standing still trying to process it  could that one next to you beep so that you move ? wouldn ' t you be better off moving ? or better off not moving ? my young son has issues with some things , particularly loud noises . if we go out anywhere and he needs the toilet he ' ll never use the hand driers , and start to panic if other people are there because they could use them . he ' ll frequently burst into tears if someone uses one , and on occasion has hidden his need to use the toilet and soiled himself instead .

2. in other countries they squat over their " toilets " . so this isn ' t meant to say that natives would do this .

4. do people who smell bad really get pulled out of places ? i  ve never heard that before . how would you propose keeping it out of social settings without legislating it then , if you don  t want to make those actions illegal .
