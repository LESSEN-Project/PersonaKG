1. i can answer this despite being an english speaker . it ' s because you haven ' t been taught that cuss words in other languages are just as bad . we never snuck around our parents to say " mierda " , unless of course you ' re spanish , so yeah . it ' s just that it wasn ' t drilled into your head like it is with your own version of the word . like americans using bollocks

2. i agree ! to pretty much anyone in a western  hemisphere or of european lineage context it  d be a fist fight . but , in their context though they see it as innocent not to say it  s not ignorant of medical conditions and genetics , etc , caring and a less awkward way of telling a person they  re getting pudgy . if someone was really offended they would be profusely apologetic , but also completely not understand what they did wrong and still chalk it up to a foreigner not understanding the culture .

4. i agree . i ' ve always heard it used like an alternative to dumbass . my gay friends don ' t get offended and i didn ' t know it was such a big deal . you just have to know who you ' re around .

6. men are just mad that they  re being asked to be better people . if the ad doesn  t apply to you , there  s no reason to get mad at it . if you  re getting angry at it , you  re probably a part of the population gillette has asked to be better .
