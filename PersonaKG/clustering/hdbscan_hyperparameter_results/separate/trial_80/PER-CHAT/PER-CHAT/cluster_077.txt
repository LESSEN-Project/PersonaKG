2. day digit  got the patch test added to my back . it was kind of annoying at first because of how it felt like my back had a brace on it . my shirts kept getting stuck on the tape as well . day digit  my shirts still got stuck on the tape , but i figured out how to lay down with it on . the tape started to itch really badly . day digit  i was told that i was smelly by my brother , but other than that i was fine . the tape was really itchy at night , but i just ignored it . day digit  i went and got the test removed . removinf the tape felt like a wax and was very uncomfortable but it wasn  t that bad . i had a lot of tape irritation . the only patch that my doctor is concerned with is  digit hydroperoxides of linalool , commonly found in fragrances , cosmetics , and hygiene products . i was told to wait a couple of days and to see if it got any worse because right now they can  t say for sure that it is a positive match . the other splotches are either dyes or common reactions , like polka dots from cobalt . i went out and bought fragrance free shampoo  shaving cream . now i just got to convince my girlfriend to do something similar . i hope you all are fighting the good fight ! don  t hate yourself because of eczema ! it  s just your body is confused and fighting itself ! don  t worry ! be happy !

4. it worked for me after smoking for around digit years . i haven ' t had one since fall , and i don ' t want one either . some advice . be prepared for some very vivid dreams , but they seem to subside after a while . make sure you drink plenty of water with the pill and eat something with it if you can . it can give you horrible stomach cramps if you don ' t . keep taking it even after you quit , for at least a couple of months , although you can typically taper off to one pill a day after the initial digit months . if you still feel a slight craving after the initial digit months , ask your doctor for another prescription . it gets so much easier after a couple of months . i just had a digit hour drive with an open pack of cigs sitting next to me , and i didn ' t even think about lighting up . good luck ! it ' s sooooo much better after you quit .
