1. i ' m not an artist myself , but the best advice for writing generally applies to drawing  do it a lot .   x200b  seriously , actually drawing  writing  participating in your creative outlet is the only effective way to get better at it . you can learn from other sources , sure , but in the end it ' s still you that has to draw  write  create if you want to get better at it . not everything will be a masterpiece , and you ' ll probably wind up creating something you ' re not proud of or that you feel wasn ' t as good as it could ' ve been  but that doesn ' t mean other people didn ' t appreciate it , and it doesn ' t mean you should stop .   x200b  never give up , never surrender !

2. do a little bit every day . allocate yourself half hour chunks in which you decide ahead of time what you are going to do . don ' t attempt to do too much in one chunk  if you did , you ' ll be more likely to get discouraged and not even start . if you have a schedule , that also makes it easier to tell people you want to do x because it ' s on your plan . regarding motivation  do you have an end goal in mind ? that ' s always been how i motivate myself . for example with fitness , i exercise because i want to be able to , i don ' t know , run x distance in y minutes . for piano practice it ' s because i want to play some piece and i know i can ' t unless i practise .

4. you ' re probably better off talking to a career counselor , or going to a job centre for this kind of thing . you can also check out the book , " what color is your parachute " , for general career advice .

5. ok , honestly same i ' m one year ahead of you , but in the uk , we can ' t just pick up a class . i figured out i wanted to do theatre when i was digit . i hadn ' t studied it for two years , and i couldn ' t pick it up . so i ' m doing whatever i can outside of school . but now i ' ve been hit with the issue of " how the hell do i pay attention to anything in school " you ' ve gotta look at the bigger picture . universities want to see that you ' re a rounded person if you choose to do that , so you ' ve gotta have something else to show for yourself . most importantly , what your dad said about some actors not making it ? no , most actors don ' t make it . it ' s ridiculously competitive , and you ' ll have to work multiple jobs just to keep on top of rent and stuff . or , you can work hard in school , get a solid fall back chemistry for me and then know that you can work a good job alongside auditions . then you can spend longer auditioning and stand a better chance of actually making a living on acting . if that doesn ' t help , then find something in the other classes that interests you . sure , maybe chemistry isn ' t your thing , but that one topic on equilibrium you love . or you hate shakespeare , but you find the casket problem in the merchant of venice fascinating . great ! find little things that excite you and cling to them for dear life . finally , if none of that works , just buckle down and get it done . accept that you will fuck up your life if you don ' t finish highschool so you just have to . talk to your teachers , reward yourself for revision , don ' t be too hard on yourself , but just get it done . it sucks but you don ' t have a choice . feel free to send me a dm , you ' re a theatre kid my age  we ' d probably get along lmao

6. i  ve said it before but treat college like a digit houweek job and you  ll do well academically . you  re about to get a ton of time and that can make you think you can do it later . make a schedule . do digit hours a day of studying , writing , and assignments and you  ll do fine .

7. don ' t you have significant freedom in picking your classes , i mean those should take about digit studyweeks plus end work and debate , rest digit or here hwo many you wish can be anything , though some math etc always necessary , also organic chem and physics on erosion if nothing else .

8. the inportant thing is to be really invested at a start . really . at the start , you have to study hardaf . after a while it becomes pretty easy

9. the connections you make can be more important than the things you learn in the classroom . so if there are clubs and internships related to the job you want do them . look for jobs that have skills related to what you want to do , or can at least sell to your future employer . the worst ? you find out you hate what you are going into but can change to something else before you are too invested ! the best ? valuable connections that will help you get where you want to go . remember , its not what you know its who you know .
