3. she acted like you took up sooo much of her time whining about your poor baby . no . this woman is a cold lizard . she gave you the minimum and you are victim blaming yourself ! sorry . she sounds peeved that you are so sunk in your grief that you  ve forgotten the planets revolve around her ! well screw her . you are grieving your baby . what was her name ? where is he buried ? and what did she look like ? these are all such basic questions , for god  s sake that she could have asked ! because they mean something , and like any parent , you want to share your memories of your beloved infant . and you deserve to .

5. wow i am so very sorry he dropped that on you like that . i ' m sorry you are feeling the way you are . but it seems like he genuinely did care for you and that he wants the best for you . judging by the note it seems like he is being respectful to you . to be honest when i first opened the image i was expecting some horrible words . but they were gentle , kind and sincere . written with truth . give him that . don ' t demonize him for your own sake . i ' m sure this is a big shock for you . maybe he just said you weren ' t intelligent to throw you off and be more mad at him . maybe something is going on with him . i don ' t know what to make of it . but at least he didn ' t rip you a new one in the note . and you will heal . i promise you will heal from this .
