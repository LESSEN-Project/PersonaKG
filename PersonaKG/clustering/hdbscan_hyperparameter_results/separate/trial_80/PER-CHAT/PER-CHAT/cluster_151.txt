1. i mean if the government told me it was to help stop a world wide war and you weren  t going to get hurt and you believed them ? bull crap jumping on a bus hurts you and other things don  t and are debatable whether it  s a bad thing . that  s why i always hated that compassion that parents like to do . theres a difference between hitting someone because they told you to and jumping in front of a buss . for example in middle school once we were allowed to walk around by a teacher in the classroom this is important and a guy was pinching me and was chasing me so i kept walking away and he kept walking faster and so i ran and got in trouble . but would you really say did i deserve to take the blame for running ? look at it from the women  s point of view . if all of society and every authority figure told you your life and that of everyone you care about is in danger and the only thing you can do to help is hand out a feather . you would do it ! you gotta understand the whole context and the thing being done and the relative morality of it . individuals are not always responsible for there actions . there are always factors involved that take away the choice .

2. for some the shittiness is worth it to have a kid at the end of it . plus , brains tend to protect us by diminishing the memory of how shit the process was . there  s also some women who have  unicorn  pregnancies and feel mostly fine the whole time . maybe the woman got pregnant by accident but can  t or won  t abort . the existence of babies doesn  t disprove the fact that pregnancy can suck worse than you think it does . you think i  m arguing because of my  hurt feelings  ? lmao . i  m arguing because i disagree with your views on something you  ve never gone through . imagine if i told you  broken bones don  t suck as much as you make it out to be , stop complaining  but i  d never broken a bone whereas you had . you  d think i was full of shit . where did i say pregnancy is the ultimate suffering ? honestly at this point i think you  re just being stubborn and contrary for the sake of it

3. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

4. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .

5. fuck that . women who don  t let men have an opinion on abortions but expect child support are something else . it wasn  t the immaculate conception ladies , his sperm made the baby too . i don  t know how to make this situation work for both men and women . however , simply ignoring the fathers opinion is completely unfair .

6. can you explain why this is so bad ? if i ' m paying 20k a year to go to school my classmates shouldn ' t make it my responsibility to make sure they don ' t kill themselves .

7. because we leave the freedoms to the individual . some people are retarded and make poor decisions ie not paying attention in school , have kids at digit years old , or joining gangs instead of filling their time with more productive means

8. while i like the grand notion of basically forcing certain breeders to become virtually extinct , this may fare better for the other side . many people don ' t want kids and still can ' t get sterilised because they don ' t have kids . kind of a paradox . a really dumb one . some who end up with kids end up resenting them . i believe if those who truly want this treatment can get it , a large portion of bad parents would be eliminated before the deed is done .

9. you know that has no chance of ever happening ever and for the people that live in the real world abortion needs to always be an option .

10. aw i ' m really disappointed that you took my comment out of context  this is thehandmaidstale so context is the one thing that should be assumed here . adoptive parents are real parents . i thought that went without saying especially in the context of tht . stealing someone else ' s baby because you think you deserve it more than they do is not the same as adoption ! not even close ! since my original comment was so misunderstood let me be perfectly clear . adoption is agreed to by both biological mothers  parents and adoptive parents . everyone involved wants the child to have the best life possible . biological parents typically choose adoption because they believe that adoptive parents will love and care for the child . i believe that the wives aren ' t capable of loving and caring about these children more than their actual mothers , even though they have been deemed better and more worthy . now as far as parents biological or adoptive go , no one can love you more than they can . least of all a random couple who thinks they ' re better or more worthy than you .

11. and what if those kids families were killed in the wars they now serve and the only thing they can do to survive is to take up arms . not justifying just saying
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

12. of course they " shouldn ' t " thats not the real world its the same as saying ' if everyone was nice there would be world peace ' its just word vomit that means nothing . the punishment would be letting the potential kid live in a fucked up life and you know that .

13. she is violating the child ' s body by having it torn up and sucked out of her . she is using the child ' s life as a sacrifice to her convenience . yes , slavery is always wrong . in a perfect world this wouldn ' t be a problem in the first place . but in the real world i choose the lesser of two evils . taking an innocent life to prevent your own suffering is wrong . please be intellectually honest and stop using the fringe cases as an excuse to justify the common occurrence . they are definitely worth considering , but even if they were justifiable , it doesn ' t mean the others are . i am pretty sure i have heard every reason that pro  choice advocates have for abortion . and so far , they don ' t change what i see as a very simple truth . it is always morally wrong to take an innocent human life . and , though you are free to disagree with my view on morality , i can ' t think of anything worse that one person could do to another . saving innocent life  saving bodily autonomy .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

14. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

15. i ' d probably take my chances . i mean we live in a world where living things must kill and consume other living things for survival , so , how much worse could it be ?

16. rifle training was once taught in school . they even had competitive shooting teams . firearms in america have been part of ordinary life for a long time . it is only recently that mass shootings have become a problem . the number of shootings is increasing , while the number of gun owners is going down . this suggests that guns are not the problem . so , what is the problem ? what changed ? is it a breakdown of family values ? or that we no longer teach civic duty and citizenship ? is society encouraging a sense of hopelessness , futility , and cynicism to the point that we devalue human life ? i don ' t really know what the answer is , but it appears that there is too much fighting for enough people to think about what it might be , in order to make a change .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

17. ok , i get the point of this and i  m sure it would help clear this up with some people but , if you force a man to get pregnant and carry the baby wouldn  t it be going against their consent thus making you the rapist in this scenario ? i  m not trying to put down somebody  s experiences with this but that sounds really morally wrong . not that any of the other stuff happening isn  t . i  m not trying to say something against this i  m just arguing morals .
