1. what you have written is sending out warning signs . i highly recommend you do not see or go near this man again . definitely getting a sadistic  abusive vibe from what he ' s done .

3. here are your two outcomes , i too work for a large hotel , and i see this quite often . digit .  you go to hr and explain how this was not divulged to you , and you do not agree with the discipline given given it is some sort of progressive discipline , and you aren  t given a verbal warning vs a written one but , you paint a big target on your back by doing this , and moving forward they will look at you day and night until they find something you do wrong . digit .  you take it , explain to your new director that you were not aware , and you never received the information . but you are aware now , and you can assure that you are there to be part of the team and  help  him through the transition , making you an ally . it  s the high road , and depending on your short and long term goals , this might be your best option . remember the hotel industry is not that big , and someone always knows someone .

4. if you have genuine evidence , like . it ' s not what you know , it ' s what you can prove in court " then i ' d say open fire and expose him . what would you want to wait for ?

5. surely there are other avenues to take this information . you reported it to the police department of which luke murray is assigned ? nothing seems to have been done ? take it to another department , go get legal advice , take it to a lawyer , any of these options are better than posting it on reddit , and if this turns out to be a false report then you are committing an act of defamation . i ' m not doubting your honesty , just think you should find another means of having the law look at this accusation .

6. you wont get charged with a hate crime . that ' s something he cant dictate anyway , only the prosecutors office can and i doubt this will go that far at all as long as there was no damage .
