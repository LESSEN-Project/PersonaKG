SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 7

1. we are particularly good listeners by nature so that ' s why people tend to dump their problems on us . also , i feel we tend to understand and put ourselves in their position thus being able to say what we might do to help improve the situation . personally speaking , if a friend asks me how i ' m doing i just say i ' m fine since i feel my problems are mine and i don ' t like unwanted advice . so , if i were you i ' d learn how to tune out when people start wittering on about their problems or make yourself unavailable for a while . hope it gets better for you .

2. never assume how someone is feeling . it really hurts when people say " you look happy " " you dont seem depressed " " stop trying to seek attention " . you can never know how someone is feeling and always assume people are telling the truth when they tell you they have problems . people have different ways of dealing with their problems around people .

4. i love introverted conversations . we just get other introverts and it ' s not a problem because we know it ' s awkward and we can just ignore it and not judge each other . so tell me , what did you eat today ? was it tasty ? what ' s your favourite name for a cat ? what colour eyes do you like the best ?

6. this happens to me with my long distance friend . i ' ve been friends with her for years but whenever she doesn ' t reply for a day or more i assume i said something wrong and she hates me . i ' m always wrong . i know it ' s a shitty way to think but thats how my mind works . i think part of it is because i ' ve been betrayed by many people i thought were my friends before

7. i can ' t seem to figure out this healthy boundaries thing . i talk to my mom all the time , my step  dad ' s a dick .
