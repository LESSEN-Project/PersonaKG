1. well . what i ' m trying to say is , niantic could of done something really cool for everyone that showed up and surprised them with something special like a shiny nidoking . next time they have another event advertised for a sticker . no one may show up .

2. i said this on another post , but this really feels like a cheap attempt to keep people collecting the same pokemon . i like the idea of the lucky system , but giving luckies their own pokedex entry makes me think that they did this just to give completionists something else to chase . if they had kept the same system , but instead made it so pokemon had a chance to turn shiny instead of lucky , i think this would be a lot better .

3. i ' d imagine a vast majority of people attempting to get this skin did it in the first few days of it being released , and we saw zero proof of it being unboxed during a time where most superior packs or packs in general were probably being opened . i ' m less likely to believe it actually existed during that time than i am to believe that they simply waited less than a day before notifying players of an increase . as much as i hate to don a tinfoil hat , it ' s also possible that they purposely delayed the tweet just to make it seem like it was actually obtainable before . if anybody went as far as to take some sort of legal action against them for falsely advertising an item as a possible reward in a virtual lottery , delaying the tweet is one way for them to prove themselves innocent .

4. yeah exactly . i personally don ' t really like the new design myself , but if people do , perhaps there ' s something there that i may have missed out on . perhaps some cool new feature i missed out on that makes it better than what ' s already here . i mean , if it ' s not broken , why fix it ?

5. even the new tim comes as a gift . and no one claimed that this is more than a slight refresh . nobody has the reason to complain , especially when the new parts are going at the old prices .

6. yeah , they could have swapped these amateur  oriented modes " effects " and " scene " for u3 and u4 . they messed this up on the d7100 by putting " effects " between u1  u2 and m  a  s  p and i still like the d7000 ' s approach on this for the same reason  on this type of camera , they could easily go with m  a  s  p , u1  u2  u3 and nothing more . if the d750 could go up to , say , digit fps with a grip and if it had an adequate buffer depth , it would be something of an upgrade from the d700 . i agree it could be named d650 , because the d6xx could have more serious af in the first place . if i was soon going for an fx body , i ' d gladly pay the price of the digit for a d750 without these things that are crippling it .
