1. i see . i feel people want others to exercise to conform to their standards using health and physique as a dumb excuse rather then caring about someone being happy . ofcourse it is different when someone is obese but you get the message . also , many sports are boring and gyms are full of toxic shits anyway .

2. i think they ' re just not putting up with people ' s shit anymore . at this point it ' s like " i am who i am some fuck you if you don ' t like it ! " they just people to stop treating them like shit for it .

3. i think people should be able to like what they like whether it ' s elvis or iggy azalea . i personally like a lot of different kinds of music and there ' s some i just don ' t like but i don ' t care really what other people listen to . the only thing i have a problem with is blatant racism or things of that sort .

4. i totally agree . i ' ve noticed this a couple of times and , like you said , the reason is often a mystery . i only downvote comments that are rude or that mock someone ' s tastes  there are tactful ways to disagree with someone ! thankfully , there have only been a few of these occasions and this sub is , on the whole , a safe , friendly space to share ideas and opinions . that ' s a rare find on the internet nowadays . let ' s not spoil it . eta  i love that this whole post has turned into a whole bunch of conversations that are just spreading positivity everywhere .

5. honestly , i think most of us hate the pc culture that is spreading as well . we just dont want to get into an argument , so we go along with everything . i definitely agree that people need to stop getting their panties in a wad about stupid shit and begin focusing on the real issues . however , it will probably never happen .

6. if you can ' t countenance a person ' s art because the person is trash , that ' s totally your own personal choice . i just don ' t think that social pressure to boycott art like that is healthy . people should be allowed to choose for themselves if they want to consume that kind of culture or not .

7. i don ' t mind a bit of rugby although i prefer league to union , but the thing annoys me about rugby fans is that they are incapable of not comparing everything that happens on the field to football . they love to talk about the superior moral code of rugby to football , but imagine if wayne rooney had been found guilty of eye  gouging , biting , punching , swearing at a referee , elbowing , headbutting and striking , and still not been sacked as england captain . it is absolutely not an exaggeration to say there would be questions in parliament and general moral outrage . but of course dylan hartley is a nice middle  class boy playing a nice middle  class sport , so it ' s all good .

8. i ' m fresh out of high school , and i hated when people would do this . or brag about how they only smoke the ' good ' weed . granted i know there is a difference between mid grade weed and high grade , just shut the fuck up and smoke it . it ' s pot , it ' s going to get you high regardless . why do people feel the need to brag about such things ? shouldn ' t weed unite us ?

9. people hate trenders because it takes a legitimate and real identity and crap we  re born with and turns it into a game . being transgender isn  t fun . dysphoria isn  t fun , even if your dysphoria isn  t that bad . i didn  t choose to be born like this , i would never choose to suffer like i have speaking of personal experience only . dysphoria sucks ass and it genuinely upsets me when i see girls trying take something that  s been a real challenge for me and thousands of others and turn it into a fun little game . i really don  t understand why you  re defending trenders . they  re literally just cisgender people trying to get some oppression points . they aren  t people genuinely questioning their gender because they aren  t in this category , people who can  t transition in any way , etc . they  re taking a label and exploiting it for their own personal gain . they  re going to one day change their mind and then the consequences are left to those who are actually transgender . if you want to see in a difference situation and circumstance why trenders are doing more negative than positive , then i  ll give you one . the people who are sad for a few days and say  i  m depressed  . the people who are a little nervous and say they have an anxiety disorder . or , those people who like cleanness and order and say they have ocd . we all know that mental disorders stem from the mind just like being transgender , our brains don  t align with our birth sex . you can  t choose to have a mental disorder you don  t choose to be trans , you choose to transition yes but you are born transgender . the people who label themselves as such when they have the littlest of symptoms are doing more negative than anything . same goes for here . girls who like boy clothes  etc . aren  t transgender . or those girls who are little or very masculine . just because they don  t like their boobs doesn  t mean they  re transgender . plenty of women don  t like their breasts . for transmen , it  s not only that they don  t like the lumps on their chest  it  s that it  s supposed to be a male chest than a female . our brains are telling us that it  s supposed to be a male chest , but our anatomy is giving us something else . then that  s when dysphoria kicks in and so on . the brain section is actual scientific fact . not some principle . there  s evidence of transgender people  s brains not aligning to their assigned sex . my brain is similar to my father , not my mother , because of the slight differences between the two brains . we are having a discussion here . i haven  t told any trender anything nor spoke to one and said anything bad . there  s no actual way i can ever  police  anyone  s identity . having an opinion is not policing . i  m not gate keeping either . i wouldn  t say this to an actual trender because i  d say it in a completely different way .

10. i totally agree ! it ' s hurtful and harmful for so many reasons and for everyone ! why does anyone want that straight bar right where the jumblies are !
