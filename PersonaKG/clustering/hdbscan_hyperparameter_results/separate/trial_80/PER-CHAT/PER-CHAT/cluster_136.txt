1. duuuuuuuude . now seriously  this is impressive for a first release . sure , they ' ve been working on it for some time , but it already has features that are still missing from opera and people are complaining about  digit versions after the abandonment of presto . everything is looking good , it even works on , although a bit sluggish on the machine i ' ll be using for some more months . i noticed it has some gestures , but it seems they are neither documented nor customizable for now  e . g . down  right closes the current tab .

3. i have the gamecube gameboy advance player somewhere , but i can ' t find it to save my life . if i could just find the disc , i could probably find the device itself on ebay pretty easily . i just miss the ability to play pokemon emerald on the big screen . maybe one day i ' ll get emerald on the switch . until then i ' ve got a modded mini snes , but it ' s just not the same !

9. this card is basically a zero mana discover a spell . u can either play the discovered card or another spell but either way you are still paying full price it ' s not that similar to glyph because the discount doesn ' t last . it ' s not a true discount like prep because the card itself costs digit mana . personally i don ' t think it will see any play outside of hagatha .
