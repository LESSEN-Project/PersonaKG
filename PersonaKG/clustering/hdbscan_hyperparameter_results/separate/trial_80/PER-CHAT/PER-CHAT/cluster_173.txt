1. bro , i highly doubt you can keep an actual conversation with someone that actually has a science degree  take your pretentious ass outta here . as someone in the field , i can assure you there are many individuals with engineering  medical  science degrees from several different backgrounds that have faith in a religion  same way as atheists . you  re just as bad as the bible humping pedos trying to force your perspective on others . the irony in all of this i  ll explain it for you is you baiting the op along with others even though you  re the one that was triggered and felt the need to comment and express your discomfort  that of which , was never really  forced  on you  you can always keep scrolling and living your insignificant life . adios !

2. i add comments instead of editing , because i doubt people will re  read my comment . worried , maybe not , but you were the one who wouldn ' t take my word for it . sources dont usually help people that already have their minds made up .

4. hahaha no , i ' m sorry ! i think i know what ' s happening . i didn ' t object to you using the term pseudoscience , but to you defining as science with shaky bases . it ' s just flat out not science of any kind , only posing as such . that ' s the distinction i was trying to make you understand . i think i might have been a bit clearer , but i ' m on the phone , so i was perhaps too curt . sorry again .

5. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
