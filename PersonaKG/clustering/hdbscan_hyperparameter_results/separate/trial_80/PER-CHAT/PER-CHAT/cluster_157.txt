1. it ' s a running joke leading back when a twitch thot copystricked his channel and called all his viewers a bunch of nine  year  olds . it didn ' t go so well for alinity but the joke stuck . he also made one very small twitch streamer gain a significantly bigger audience and also a small youtuber who also gained a nice sub count after the deblockle . it was a pretty memorable affair , and so because it ' s an inside and running joke the people just call themselves digit year olds . i would say nine  year  old  digit as a part of the joke .

4. blt  digit  cage cage stood eying morti . she was , as always , an ever growing enigma . he had run ins with morti before , and none of them ever made any sense to the brute . everywhere morti was , there was an air of danger and secrets that went well beyond the pale of cage ' s understanding . kuko seemed to know a bit about what was going on with morti , but then again , kuko wasn ' t a normal peach either . crazy women always surrounded cage , these two were some of the craziest .  " the top ? " cage pondered to himself . did she meant she fell from the sky , as they did ? or did she mean she fell from the top of the tree . if from the top , wth was she doing there to begin with . the brute would sigh . if he tried to get all the answers he needed to comprehend what was going on , he ' d die of old age . cage simply stood by and watched as morti was freed from the tree , and little creatures spawned from roots and vines , running deeper into the tree itself . the little guys were cute , sure , but that didn ' t mean they could be trusted . cage recalled on the moon where he was attacked by tiny rose people . fuck that junk , can ' t trust nothin you don ' t know . regardless , dani was the first to speak voting they take the center path directly into the tree . cage didn ' t really care , but he wanted to make sure they stuck together .  " could give a rat ' s ass in a rusty boot which way we go , ya dig ? alls i care about is that we move as a unit . i ain ' t acceptin no stragglers , and that includes you sista . you was here for some reason , so you ' s gone come with us through this tree . " cage referred to morti . he was still unsure what she was doing in this forest . if there was one thing he knew from experience with morti , she always had more information that the let on .

17. from the little i ' ve learned about this , the whole routine is pretty hush  hush . it ' s existence was only proven when some guy won a lawsuit to force boeing to admit it . would be great if a pilot could tell us some more . digit was a boeing digit register n591ua and first flew in digit . could be that it was too early to have this feature . totally speculating , but i reckon if the hijackers have already disabled the transponder , it could make it harder for this feature to be engaged from some external authority , which would seem to be the most useful and kind of scary application of this technology .
