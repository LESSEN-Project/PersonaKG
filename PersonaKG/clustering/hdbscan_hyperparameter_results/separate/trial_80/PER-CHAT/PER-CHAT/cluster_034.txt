1. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?

2. it ' s sort of true because a " few " kilometres for you would be a long distance for us relative to the size of the country but yes every city has it ' s own accent and within that many variations of that accent

3. depends on how patriotic you are . for example , there ' s some people who live here who hate america , and are ashamed of it . on the other hand , there ' s people who would die for this country , and get happy  teary eyed when they hear the national anthem .

4. ok that  s actually pretty great the , means they  re integrating more and more sources . i hope they will enable linking up of various national transports to make cross border trips much easier too . maybe they feel they  ve already covered the majority of the terrain they needed to ? i  d say there  s also the issue with some transit providers simply not having any api integration . on another note , have you seen anyone take advantage of the maps extensions much yet ? i know uber was there and then they removed themselves and opentable can book tables with yelp having some integration too .

5. the regional pokemon are supposed to be something special you get for traveling . i ' d always assumed that , once trading came out , it would become something that players who didn ' t have the means  opportunity to travel could get by engaging with other community members . this was kinda the expectation i had , and i knew a lot of other people that shared it . having it come out as a special event was kinda cool , but it changed farfetch ' d from this cool , insanely rare thing to another event pokemon . farfetch ' d went from being more rare than a legendary to essentially another pikachu in a hat .

6. i guess it really depends on the location . some places may be way worse and others way better . best we can hope for is swift rollout of the new maps .

7. it ' s because no one who lives from delhi is actually from delhi . most other teams are centered around states whereas delhi isn ' t classified as a state and it ' s tiny compared to other states . new management have gathered loads of new fans . mostly college students but good nonetheless

8. with soccefootball there are so many players around the world , plus the transfeloan system , it makes it easy for the wealthy clubs to acquire good players . in the nba it ' s a lot more difficult , sometimes there is nothing they can do . teams like the lakers and knicks would have been relegated a few years ago , despite how big of fan bases and wealth they have .

9. from what i  ve heard , they  re still exercising at least once a month which is the same as before . they were all pretty excited when the  no more war games  thing was announced , but we don  t call any of our exercises  war games  so we just assumed it was a way to seem like we were giving up something without ever doing so . if anyone was to bring up the fact that we haven  t stopped exercising we could be like  we gave up the war games , but we didn  t stop our training exercises  . hell , i  m in japan and even we were hoping that maybe we  d luck out and they  d let us quit exercising as well . no such luck .

10. league schedules and tradition of being a " summer festival " are trivial issues compared to real world problems . i ' m not saying qatar will be a disaster , i ' m saying the construction projects are shady . thousands of people have died , worker conditions are horrible , safety standards are poor . people are sacrificing their lives and enduring brutal labor to build the stadiums . they should host the world cup somewhere thay either has stadiums already , or at least has ethical labor laws .

11. it just is daunting to me to have such a large population for a city , and i would hate to move into the " bad parts " unknowingly . it would be like someone moving to townsville and accidentally going to live in vincent . they . would . die .
