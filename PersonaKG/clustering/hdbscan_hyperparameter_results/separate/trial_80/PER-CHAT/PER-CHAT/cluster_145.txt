1. yta . she  s allowed have a best friend . and you bought digit tickets . would you rather the other two go to waste ? i can kind of understand why you want her to spend more time with you instead of lucy but not allowing lucy and her husband to go when you already have the tickets is a little silly

2. the best advice i can give to you is to either talk to your friend , let them know how you feel and give them the chance to become aware that their behavior is bothering you , or do nothing and slowly back away from the friendship . i am in a similar boat myself . as friends we should be able to voice our opinions and concerns within our friendships and not worry that the other will become defensive or misinterpret our motivations , but sometimes it just doesn ' t work that way because of bias or prejudice or just plain ol ' human error and that ' s when it ' s time to step back . good luck !

3. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .

4. if she ' s insisting but let you pay the other times , let her this time . i dated a guy for awhile who paid for every single thing , which is super flattering , but when i told my mom she was like " you need to pay too ! just make him let you pay " so i felt weird about it . we are told we need to take care of ourselves first , to be independent , that we can ' t be " bought " etc . i think it ' s actually a good sign on her feelings towards you . while i ' m not dating that guy anymore , i offered a lot to pay because i didn ' t want him to think i was taking advantage of his kindness . i did finally end up paying for a few things here and there , which worked out because he never carried cash and i ' m a cash girl . i doubt this will be the new " rule " where she will always pay for herself .

5. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .
