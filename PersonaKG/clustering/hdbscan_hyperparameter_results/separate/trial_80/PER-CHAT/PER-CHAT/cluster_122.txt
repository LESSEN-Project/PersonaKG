1. look i ' m not saying there isn ' t value in those studies , and that parenting style . it ' s just not exclusive like you seem to think it is . try raising children with different types of challenges , like autism spectrum disorder or oppositional defiant disorder , then tell me there ' s a one size fits all . also , confirmation bias . there , now i ' m really out .

2. if god dosent like to see us suffer then why does he let us suffer ? i was raised in church but once i got older i realized it wasn  t for me . i know the whole it  s part of god  s plan story but what about starving children or kids being molested ? how could that ever be part of a god  s plan ? i mean no disrespect i  m just voicing my thoughts .

3. i agree digit  people who are like ' god helped me study and pass my exams ' or ' god saved me from a car accident ' are so brainwashed . once people realise it ' s themselves that are in charge of their destiny , they decide their own morals , actions etc and not some invisible sky daddy , the better we will all be .

4. i am inclined to agree with most of what you said , and i ' ll look at the studies , but i suppose it ' s partially what i was trying to say , no drugs are safe , legal or illegal , if done wrong . i tend to indiscriminately tell people not to do the illegal ones though , since they can destroy your life , in fact it can have nothing to do with the drug and everything to do with the social situations illegal drugs tend to put people in . though i ' m sure you know that much too .

5. its not moral to believe that the fall justifies all the bad stuff , it just caused it to happen or was the kickstart i suppose . i do believe that adam was made from dust and eve the rib . the snake , in my view , was satan in the form of a snake , or talking through a snake . i read the bible in a metaphorical way . of course many things are taken literally like the earth flooded folks who arent christians , thats their choice . i would never say  go burn in hell  to anyone regardless of age , beliefs , or gender . many good things come from all corners of the world too . there is a misunderstanding between atheists and christians though .
