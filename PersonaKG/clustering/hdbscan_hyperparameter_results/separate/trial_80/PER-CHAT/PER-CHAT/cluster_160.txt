1. i agree with this . it is impossible to tell someone how they should feel about themselves . but for whatever it ' s worth let me say i imagine you make most men horny . i hope you get what you need from the labiaplasty .

2. lol you masturbate digit  digit times a day and came to reddit ask for some sort of solution to your attraction towards women ? nah bro you need help  even though you don  t wanna hear it . there  s no magic solution  you  re gonna have to put in the work to learn why you feel this way with a therapist and that  s the only way to solve your problems .

3. i couldn ' t tell from your post if you had tried this or not , but spanking is a good way to start . start slowly and get him aroused , then increase the intensity . it ' s a good way to learn together the proper balance between pain and arousal . it takes practice . start with your bare hand , then introduce a brush , etc as your comfort level increases . done properly it can be incredibly erotic . when you ' re comfortable , introduce verbal dominance as well  tell him he ' s been a bad boy and you ' re going to punish him , that sort of thing . i ' ve found it most effective when my wife whispers these things  it sets a very intense mood .

7. it does take a lot of courage , but you have it in you . otherwise you wouldn ' t have made this post ! just know you ' re not alone . there ' s a whole community here that supports you . here ' s maybe an odd idea  instead of only looking at body types that you would want for yourself , try checking out all sorts of people with different body types . big , little , thick , thin . don ' t judge , just accept them for what and who they are . then after a time , try to find little things you appreciate in each one . maybe it ' ll help broaden your horizons a little , instead of being so focused on what you covet right now .

8. oh my god if his fetish has this much of a hold on his love life you don  t need to be with this person . have you told him everything you mentioned here ? about how uncomfortable and skin crawling hes being ? it  s cruel of him to expect you to change your body for his fetishy desires .

9. all of these people here saying you should give it a try or that you ' re being a dick are wrong . if you aren ' t comfortable with it , that isn ' t bad , it doesn ' t make you a shit person . straight up , being a furry is weird . it really is . it ' s someone dressing up as an animal in weird cartoon like suits , most often for a sexual purpose . people dressing up in animal costumes for sex is not normal , and is likely certainly a mental issue . i mean no offense to your gf , but really . don ' t do anything you aren ' t comfortable with . don ' t indulge in this bc if you do it ' ll make you crazy . literally . i mean like it ' ll cause you to go crazy  in case the meaning was unclear also , i think you may need to seriously think about breaking up with her . i know that ' s not a desirable outcome , and that you love her , but i think that truly is something that is digit  a deal breaker in a relationship . unless you can think of some way you both can be satisfied perhaps open the relationship ? i know that ' s mostly never desirable for a lot of ppl but idk it could help if you just wanna stay with her . i have a problem in my relationship issue in the same vein , not specifically about being a furry but still a fetish thing which has some parts i ' m not entirely comfortable with . i am trying to find a way to deal with that myself . it is incredibly hard even in a partial , lesser way . i ' m sorry , i can ' t imagine how you feel .

10. yeah , maybe when your facial hair fills in as you get older , you could try it but right now you look the best clean shaven .

11. i think you ' re good as you are . never listen to these negative people , just ignore them . your hair looks pretty nurtured  normal , and your breasts might be smaller but that is completely okay , there is nothing wrong with you ma ' am !
