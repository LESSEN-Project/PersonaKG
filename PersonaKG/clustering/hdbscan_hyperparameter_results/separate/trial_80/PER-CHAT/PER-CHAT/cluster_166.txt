1. of course my argument makes sense so long as you think about it properly . the effective skill of your team lowers when someone is simply feeding , or their focus blinded by anger . getting tilted and becoming unable to play your best handicaps you and your team , effectively lowering the skill of that player .  and you can ' t control soccer or football in that regard because people who throw in those games get permanently banned from the league yeah , and the exact same thing happens in professional dota digit . another similarity between dota digit and football  soccer is that you don ' t get permanently banned from throwing games just by playing casual matches with randoms .

2. they may feel like that but many of them are ignoring the immense amount of time that went into the other requirements and at the same time vastly overestimating the value of castle wars . i ' ve found it pretty funny the reaction many people have had  when people who set up castle wars boosting fc ' s specifically to cheat games with alts , not the totally legitimate afk fc ' s are complaining about devaluation , and people who called themselves trimmers but hadn ' t finished the breeding log or salty etc are complaining about devaluation , i find it all pretty memeworthy . ontop of that , why weren ' t all these true trimmers pissed when 5k games as diminished ? surely you ' re not really a trimmer if you don ' t have 5k then ? or when people boosted games ? or when people account shared ? i ' ve seen so many twitter posts of people who blatantly cheated their cwar games acting outraged that i just can ' t take it seriously . i ' m someone who trimmed immediately after the rework , and to see people behave like my trim is worthless or that i didn ' t earn it is so gross . i ' ve been trim sans cwars for coming up on digit years . i put in as much effort as anyone else  i refused to cwars on principle for a variety of reasons , primarily because i believed it was a flawed decision from the start , and because of the rampant cheating that went on in the early years of comp that still goes on to this day , not because i couldn ' t be bothered but because it wasn ' t content , and it wasn ' t fair .

3. brecci was good though , this isn ' t . i wasn ' t saying it was the remington , it ' s the only comparable in one shot kill type of way . it ' s bad when i ' d rather use fists in half the gun fights tbh . and the sg12 isn ' t garbage unless you can ' t click the trigger more than two times . any average player can use the gun like any other , sure it ' s no saug , but it ' s still way better than the mog12 . it ' s just depressing .

4. all i see here is a good pilot communicating with a good gunner . if that team they were destroying had a single squad in it that dedicated a minute to shooting that bomber , it ' d be dead . hell , a single fighter or attack plane running the correct loadout would shred that bomber in a half  second . a single tank that ' s half  decent at leading projectiles could smash it instantly during a bombing run . vehicles are supposed to destroy uncoordinated infantry easily , but a coordinated effort easily destroys any vehicle . behemoths are far from broken . if a team has to fight a behemoth , they likely control most of the map . if they control most of the map , they have more than enough stationary weapons lying around to destroy it in less than a couple minutes . which is unfortunate , because behemoths are supposed to be overpowered  they ' re designed to allow a team to easily catch up to the winning team , but rarely succeed at doing so . the " oversights " you ' ve mentioned are much different than the ones i did . yours are perceived as overpowered because the average player does not use teamwork to properly counter them . mine are perceived as overpowered because zero effort was put into fine  tuning them to a balanced state . a flat damage bonus to all weapons will always result in clear  cut best choices . they never learn from this in every title they make . if they actually put time into giving every weapon different damage stats in hardcore , issues like these wouldn ' t exist .

5. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .

6. i have to agree honestly . as much as i like skins with different styles , this new mentality of " i dont like their hat , get rid of it " and " make this character blue because i said so " is so uncalled for

7. we all kind of rely on each other to be honest . i play all roles and i feel there should just be more respect , and more competency between them . healers keep everyone alive yes but a good tank stops everyone else taking damage . without the tank you would be equally screwed . likewise good dps will kill things so you ' re not fighting a war of mana . they should interrupt and stay out of danger . what i am trying to say is that everyone should work together , show some support and learn your class so you can adapt quickly . as soon as one of these digit roles thinks they are more valuable or don ' t have to try as hard the whole thing fails .

8. hmm . good point . my argument seemed to be a bit flawed . i guess it  s just down to the amount people use and nothing else . or is it . i guess imma have to come back to this topic at a later date and think about it a bit more

9. the post clearly says the point . 400ms lights , in response to consoles extra delay with frames and guard switch makes the lights unhealthy for the game , it promotes spamming and ' lucky ' interruptions of combos . i didn ' t go from " this to that " , it ' s all apart of the discussion , if you ' re not following it don ' t comment ? and as i said before the party for lights arent consitant enough to keep up with the dmg that lights do . i mentioned orochi because his lights are nasty , you can whiddle and opponent down in digit light combo strings , let alone if you mix anything in .

10. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .

11. to be fair this is what the community has complained heavily about since release . is this not what they wanted ? no sense in complaining about it how it is now if you were complaining about how it was before , as you  ve asked for these changes , specifically .

12. i ' m not willing to attempt running my game on an emulator but i can see why people do , other than to cheat . if you want some of those people running on emu to stop optimize your game to not hammer our phones battery . i have charged my xperia z5 digit times today playing this .

13. i don  t see the shtick about being toxic to jojo fans , jojo is anime . it  s a fact . just let people like what they want to like
