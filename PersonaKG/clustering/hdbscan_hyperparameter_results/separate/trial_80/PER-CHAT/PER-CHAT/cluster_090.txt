2. i dont get the relation of your question with your text . are you asking that practising to get digit headshots per day is too much ? well if you rly have the time to get 1000headshots sure why not . as states in other posts hs only isnt rly the best way to practise .

5. according to the tutorial your thumb stops the cards before making a digit and in the above video he moves his thumb until he riffles whole pack , with little more practice you can do it .

6. can ' t use price tho . what would you do when a card swings up over the threshold ? everyone has to check prices every time they want to play ? what if it goes over  digit between rounds ? you get my drift there .
