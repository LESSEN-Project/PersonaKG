1. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !

2. 26m here . you basically just described me . so not alone ? though i also dont feel good about this ravenous pessimism toward dating either but can ' t shake the feeling that it ' s all a waste of time

3. this sounds a lot like my story . i appreciate all the people trying to make you feel better , and they might be right . but here ' s my two cents . yeah , you might be a narcissist . you might just have narcissistic behaviors . you might not have any . in my experience and research , i found there are a lot of misconceptions about the concept of narcissism . i began my research after thinking an ex was a narcissist . low and behold i eventually saw clearly that these behaviors were in my own actions . i highly recommend emdr therapy . changed my life . i definitely think that zealous religious cultures like mormonism breed narcissistic traits and tendencies because people have stunted emotional growth  emotional intelligence . it also cultivates codependency . people miss out on a lot of experiences that are key to growing into a health functioning adult . hang in there . no matter the situation , you have the desire to be self aware which means you will keep growing and getting happier . bravo and hang in there !

4. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .

5. maybe i ' m coming off as too depressed . i wouldn ' t say i ' m officially " depressed " i live my own independent life . i go to school in a major that i love . i workout digit  digit times a week , i taught myself to play guitar , i fly  fish any free chance i get , i love hanging out at winery ' s , i love to cook for other people and i love to just be outside . today i did a ten mile bike ' n ' hike . the problem is , is that i do most of these activities alone or with my guy friends . i don ' t know though . maybe i do need some form of therapy and anti  depressant . the main issue is , it would mean i ' d have to tell my parents . i don ' t want to admit to them that i have a social anxiety that comes from fear of initiating a conversation with a woman . my dad made a joke the other day that he thought i was gay because i ' ve never brought home a girl from school . i took it personally . i don ' t know why i ' ve built this up to be so much harder than it should be .

6. bad break up ? if so you got to let it go . if not , then go outside and explore somewhere where people are accepting , like a sports bar or social clubs or something where you can add to peoples conversations

7. sounds like you had it rough in hs , sorry to hear . i did to , but eventually you grow up and realize none of that matters

8. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

9. not really , but if you don  t like your life change it . take a step and talk to someone my dude doesn  t hurt i was a shy dude but still had a lot of friends . i wouldn  t think of your teenage years wasted because you e spent time with yourself either you probably know more about yourself than a lot of others . stay strong home dog and go talk to someone about how you feel .

10. nobody should ever feel this way . it hurts me that your  friends  would tell you things like that . i would take some time to find a new friend group . if there is a counselor or someone on campus , i would utilize that resource too . you don  t need to feel alone . you have a bright future . i  m sorry this is happening to you .

11. im sorry they are making you feel this way man i hear you . i can relate and it fucking sucks when your own family treats you like this . how old are you ? maybe save up and move out as quickly as you can . its not permanent , youll get through it !
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

12. well , i hope that you ' re still here . those friends that your referring to , those aren ' t the type you want to have . if they don ' t like you or your interests , that ' s their lost , not yours . if you don ' t mind me asking , why does your mom want you to move back in ? you may call her narcissist , but aren ' t all parents , in a way ? i would suggest you call her . if you kill yourself , it could destroy her . i wouldn ' t know , but maybe she wants you to move back in because she likes having around . maybe she needs some help , that is if she lives alone .
   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

13. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

14. being single does suck . i ' ve been single my entire life m16 . i usually cope by hanging out with friends . i know i ain ' t the best looking , nor am i fit . but yeah . i get how you feel . life does suck that way . whenever i feel down about being alone , i usually think " i ' ll find that person eventually " some day you will . just continue doing what you like , and hang out with your friends
