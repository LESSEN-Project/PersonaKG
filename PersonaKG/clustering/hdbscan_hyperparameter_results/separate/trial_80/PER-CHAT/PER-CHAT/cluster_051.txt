1. i mean , either you let them do that in some server of their own , or they will hack in casual and ruin both gamemodes

2. good . can ' t really be that arsed about them finding another group of people who want to kill them . can we instead have , say , a pretty damn mean snowstorm descend on the area and they have to survive that in their communities , with loads of walkers in the area ? possibly even having to still make trips between the communities ?

3. i ' m confused what you ' re upset about . a gunslinger who understands how to use his class to its full effectiveness ? much like a titan putting a bubbleshield directly over a control point and sitting there with a shotgun , or titansmashing everyone at a control point ? haha , as a fellow hunter , i have to say , i ' ve tripped my own tripmine grenade and killed myself more times than i ' d like to admit golden gun gives hunters zero shields , nor does bladedancer . all they had to do was go in one of the two other entrances , double team him and he would have been gone . instead , they filed in the same door over , and over , and over again . edit  just watched the second video . derp . yeah . this is why i always roll my eyes when titans complain that hunters are op .

4. assuming they both use the force they could probably counter it , there is a reason they don  t just use the force to unarm people in a fight .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

5. that ' s true . i ' ve been killed while ducking as well so , you ' re right , he should ' ve been able to kill the gunner at some point even if he had been ducking .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

6. well that ' s just peachy , you killed my variant on this that was going to be for creating convenient holes for boarding parties , you fiend .  d i really do like the idea of making a weapon that causes the universe to just go nope , and make a gigantinourmous explosion to fix the problem we just made . atoms really don ' t like being inside each other .

7. i actually wonder , if someone launches the nuke at the area , where player camp is located , do they become  wanted  too afterward ?
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

8. i mean , that does make sense , why would you just let them kill you ? your gonna fight back and if it goes according to plan , you will kill them first
   (ID: de62a0a330b0a7ca76d55a6702dcae5baf1c3cae)

9. there is . you wont really know who is spectatin you or wheter he is spectating your team . it ' s like having random guys on teamspeak  mumble who can listen to your conversations even thought you dont know someone is there .
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

10. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

11. considering if you bayonet charge people in this game , your soldier will said something . then im sure you can get em .
   (ID: cd4ad4cc67fcfb39fcb1f11e52709d863f1c0215)

12. doesn ' t the hypothetical intruder think that about you ? why should they be allowed to take your life ? will you not defend yourself ?
   (ID: 74058c90ada3aae7a59703064acbf3ced38f3681)

13. the aetheon patch in a single picture . seriously though if i and you can fall off the edge . why wouldn ' t the boss be able to ?
   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

14. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

15. depends on where and how powerful
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

16. leaves party gets gunned down by the rogue for leaving lmao but really , yeah they should have the feature to give someone like digit seconds to leave before also being marked . i enjoy going rogue but i know some of my friends are like you and dont so i won ' t go rogue if i ' m with them , but you never know when you squad up with a rando .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

17. well , the game does tell you how low the odds are of getting him .
   (ID: c5b665e8ba18adb2125a557bd8ecbb0654907c67)

18. thats the reason we have spotting mechanic . remember , even if you down you can still spot the camper , so you can save other .
   (ID: cd4ad4cc67fcfb39fcb1f11e52709d863f1c0215)

19. having a deathcam is way to casual already . if you want dedication your screen should turn black as soon as you get killed
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

20. i don  t mean morally , i mean for safety . they could easily be mistaken for a walker and killed . i know the point is they look like walkers but it  s not like everyone else knows that . not to mention the whisperers are not friendly
