1. would you believe me that this is as cheap as a metal deck can get . i would avoid crafting this because more decks are building around aggro but if you still want to you can get away with not including level up and maybe throw in some pirates or murlocs ?

2. i think you should just look over joseki that you encountered in your games . if you feel like you got a disadvantageous sequence in a corner , go look up josekipedia , and see what you could have done better . that ' s all . if you play something often , you can also check wether it is joseki . who knows ? maybe you got used to play a slightly sub  optimal sequence . i heard someone that the path to progress goes  learn joseki   understand them   forget them , the last step being the most important .

3. i laid mine out in chunks like front left  front right , back bottom , back left  right , shoulders , etc . basically , as icreamboy said , plan ahead . also , with the enthusiasm of buying patches , you may end up with some patches from bands you enjoy . then realize you don ' t enjoy them enough to have them stitched to your back . so think about the patch before you put it on , and if it ' s something you will feel comfortable with for a while . sure , you could remove it later , but as said before planning makes a visual difference . i have maybe digit patches that i bought specifically for my vest that , upon laying them all out , i decided against using for one reason or another .

4. ultra necrozma malamar is probably more consistent than this . you have way too much going on . i also don ' t see why you run ditto since you don ' t run metang . also you need digit ultra balls

5. yeah , i want there to be a build sensitivity and shoot sensitivity . would really benefit from that especially on console

6. honestly after talking to allot of people . i main her and i basically use the sweep as a mental tool . people will almost always dodge the sweep on reaction bc it  s so rewarding , if you delay the sweep it turns into a gb . the only buff she needs is a damage boost .

7. i  m getting one that isn  t a full controller but offers triggers so i can switch my shoot  aim button on pubg to be where they press . i  d say your best shot is to just search game controller for phone and see what would fit you best

8. hi , i hope i ' m not sounding too disdainful , here , but if you ' re only 13k , i guess you have not been playing that much like , not very seriously for several years . are you sure you are dedicated enough to the game to get a go  related tatoo and no regret it later ? that ' s more the kind of things i would expect from dan players . i also have my doubts on what black stones would look like as tatoo just big black dots . but anyway , that ' s none of my business , and i hope you find something that suits you .

9. thank you ! this is the comment i was looking for . i didn ' t know goggles had a dvr feature . i own a 3d printer so i was just going to fab up a mount . but , at any rate , the foxeer seems like the way to go . i ' ll ditch the pdb , and get a better vtx and transmitter . investing in some good goggles makes sense to me since they will likely outlast the drone . looks like i have some more research to do .

10. these all look really nice and could make some non meta characters viable . maybe i ' m not really too versed on how good these upgrades are

11. chi brew is better for single target  with serenity , and eventually when you get digit  set and a higher ilvl and class trinket let ' s say average digit  you ' ll want to run chi explosion  ascension for multi and single , as it just gets easier to manage with very little difference in dps . i might be wrong about the last bit as its been a while since i ' ve gone and played ww , mostly brm at the moment . the most important thing to remember is that this is a game , and   you have to play it my way or not at all   personal preference takes precedence over min  maxing unless you prefer to min  max and like doing as well as you possibly can .

12. hero labs has all of the encounters pre built for 25ish dollars i think . it really save a lot of time in prep . roll20 has all the maps , lightning , characters ect . i didn ' t use the product , but if i were to do it again i would use this .

13. best value for the money for a novice is the players pure x cue . seyberts they will prolly run you 180ish with digit . 75mm i believe ldc shaft with a kamui soft tip on them . i have been using mine for digit months and i have nothing but good things to say . you can also buy the shaft separately or any other shaft which i think is a good option as well for you if you really like your butt . me personally i like to look at and touch all different butts

14. let ' s be real tho , how many times is a centurion gonna charge his heavy from neutral ? if we ' re talking about casuals , then yeah that probably works , but if we are talking high level duels then most often than not the centurion starts with a kick or a feint . btw i ' m not talking about just dodging the kick , almost the whole cast gets some sort of guard break or cc after dodging one but kensei doesn ' t , he just dodges because the recovery is so slow to do anything .

15. personal preference  rest . there is no reason for you to swap if you really dont want to but you might aswell try and see if you like others more . a different crosshair literaly changes the whole way the guns feel . starting with a simple dot to weird crosshairsettings . fool around , copy others and see what suits you best . as for me . coming from digit . digit i really need someone similar to that .

16. i dont have the subox but i do have some kanger tanks and i really like these  digit delrin tips from . i have bought several and they are all great . the tapered long black one might be just the ticket for you .
