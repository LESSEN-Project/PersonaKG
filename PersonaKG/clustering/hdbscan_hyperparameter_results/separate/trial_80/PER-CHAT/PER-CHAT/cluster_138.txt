1. hypothetically . would you really need to launder it if there  s not more  illegal  money coming in ? cause you  d have to use some of it for a front to actually launder it . but why not just keep it in cash ?

2. it depends on the charity  some pocket the money for themselves which is why the founders of a lot of them are millionaires . but if it ' s actually going towards a good cause , i don ' t see why not . i ' d probably choose to feed and  or vaccinate children .

3. as much as this would be great , it  s still a lot of money . as if we already don  t get robbed every paycheck anyways yknow ? granted there are things our taxes go to that , aren  t really beneficial . but it  d be a rough time i think . what about you ?

4. no i honestly think it ' s a good idea ! how am i so off base on this ? yes power banks exist , yes solar chargers exist but if you dont have any other options in the moment this could be a super convenient thing to be able to go and buy . jesus by all the downvotes and sassy comments i ' m getting your think i ' m advocating the clubbing of baby seals or something

5. i didn ' t know about the ice cap thing you mentioned , but i feel like governments should do what they can to try to minimize it , i think that we should work towards developing a way to harness fusion power and attempt to proliferate that around the world and that would solve nearly all of our energy problems and it wouldn ' t polute

6. i see , so when there are tons of coins , the inflation will be quite minimal , but unless the community grows quickly enough , the mining value could drop to the point where it ins ' t worth mining except for the charity aspect of it . bitcoin has struggled with this at times where the electricity cost of some computers that are less efficient is higher than the value they can earn by mining .

7. well it ' s about time this happened . it ' s probably going to push rents up but it needs to be done , australia ' s housing market is out of control , needs to burst already . honestly what idiot gets an interest only home loan in the first place ? dickheads who watch too may " flip a house " shows . think they can do that too then realise how expensive tradies are ? haha . fuck em . let them fall !

8. there is a reason they have only made it to pilot programs . i am not saying a guaranteed income program can ' t work , just that it has plenty of risks . most of the guaranteed income pilot programs i have heard about were run in countries with a small and primarily wealthy population that already has quite high taxes and social safety nets .
