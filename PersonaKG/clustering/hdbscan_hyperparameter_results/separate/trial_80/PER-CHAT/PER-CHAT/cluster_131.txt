1. this question just made me think of the movie sleepwalkers .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

2. dude , if only the device in ' inception ' was real , you could totally enter your dream and try to find what the fuck is causing you to have these night terrors and sleep walking .

3. i always thought it would be crazy if we are just like aliens taking a hit of some crazy drug and when we die we wake up next another alien and we ' re like " shit did you see that "

5. i would like to think that certain future events could be dreamt about occasionally . but that ' s a different story . i think that this time it is more likely subconscious thing . there is stuff bothering me . either that or i was visited by an evil entity at least i go to heaven ? lol .

6. you get to be a ghost for a while , then its lights out . but i only believe this because i find it comforting to believe there ' s something non  permanent after death .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

7. i wouldn ' t feel anything , ' cause then i ' d be dead .
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

8. what is the otherworldly feeling like , if you describe it better for us ?
   (ID: e871625874733300de2a83384cee8c72546d3ec6)

9. those " alternate life  dimension  reality " dreams always just feel like the " regular life " , but . enhanced . let ' s say everything smells and sounds more accurate , more intense . no unusual sounds or smells whatsoever . on another note , i can ' t recall what specifically happened in them , but i do remember they ' re some sort of " alternate dimensions " , where i made different choices or some things directly concerning me went a different way . e . g i ' m a drug dealer in some slums . when i wake up from them , i don ' t feel my body at all  i don ' t feel anything , i just see . i slowly open my eyes , and i ' m unable to recognize where i am , feeling like i ' ve been moved somewhere else , while it ' s just my regular , real  life bedroom . it takes me a good couple of minutes to realize i ' m conscious and awake in reality . what intrigues me the most about this is that maybe death is just a transition to another reality . i don ' t know . sorry for the poor grammar . it ' s pretty difficult to put this in words .
