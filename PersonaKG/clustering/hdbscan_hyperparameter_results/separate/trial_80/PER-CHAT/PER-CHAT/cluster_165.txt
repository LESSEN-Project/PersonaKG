1. i would recommend advice for this , but i ' ll try to help as well anyway i think you ' re just friends by convenience . you ' re on the same team , you live near each other and give each other lifts , but beyond that , he has better friends and you don ' t . i ' ve been in that situation , there ' s not much you can do except to to find other , better friends , and accept that that ' s where your relationship is at . if you ' re scared to do things around him , find other friends and don ' t value his opinion of you so highly , that way if he does judge you , who cares ? as a rule , if a friend makes you feel uncomfortable in some way when you ' re around them , get out , find a better person to spend your time with   x200b    x200b

2. well heres my opinion , the guys probably very paranoid of you cheating on him , im not saying you would but thats what it looks like . heres what you need to do , if you want to stay with him id explain how hes the one and hes over reacting . tell him that you need some breathing room to do whatever you want but that youll always come back home to him . you should only unblock the guy when he understands to give you space . if you feel like things arent working out anymore because of trust then youd definitely be in the right to break up with him . thats what id do atleast

3. maybe you are dating the wrong kind of guys . no , not all . not all guys are even remotely the same . not all men are even aggressive at all . maybe digit in digit are aggressive enough to pitch a shitfit these two . you managed to find them both . this isn  t something wrong with you , it  s something wrong with them . overly aggressive men also tend to be passionate and whimsical . it can kind of  sweep you off of your feet  . they also might make you feel  safe  because their possessiveness feels like you are being protected . in reality , they are the ones that you need to be protected from . just about any grocery bagger or cab driver would do better . have someone hook you up with a mutual friend that is not your type and give it a whirl . this is the type of advice that i would give my daughter , and i  m not saying any of this to be mean . last time i gave this kind of advice i got a lot of nasty replies . i mean , what does a man know about men , right ? this is for the op .

4. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .

5. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol
