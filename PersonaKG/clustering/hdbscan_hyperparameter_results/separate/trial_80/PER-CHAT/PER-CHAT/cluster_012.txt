1. i ' m a slytherin , but i never understood why as everyone describes me as really sweet . one day there was a harry potter trivia on , i assumed i ' d win or come at least second on third , as for the past few themed trivia ' s i ' ve been to half of the people attending didn ' t actually know the material or care . well for this trivia i swear every harry potter nerd was out of their bedroom . thankfully it was going for two nights , so i book the next night and of course being there before i knew all the answers . i also had to pay for dinner again to do this by the way . but i refused to loose and the prize they were giving out goes really well on my shelf .

3. i shut down my social media accounts years ago because no one contacted me . i was hoping someone from my youth would look me up and send a request and we could catch up and maybe go get a burger but nothing happened . they didn ' t care back then , i guess there ' s no reason to think they would now .

5. the answers to these tell me a lot about a person . what  s on your playlist ? what  s the most fulfilling experience of your past year ? what  s the funniest thing you  ve ever done ? how many times have you cheated on a partner ? what  s that body count looking like ?
