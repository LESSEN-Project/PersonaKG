1. i hate how they all say  leave a like it really helps me out  like i get it , i do , but it  s really annoying .
   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

2. oh i do . i let people know right away that they are dumb for asking a question when we both know they already know the answer . why would you want to force a conversation with someone ? do you enjoy bothering people ?
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

3. definitely ! and what bugs me even more is when my friends correct the mistake they made when i can clearly understand what they were trying to say . does anyone else get mad when their friends correct their typos ?

4. i get annoyed with a lot of phrases , but the one that is the kicker for me is when someone says , " i seen that . no , you saw it , or you have seen it . idiots !

6. why is it that people who behave like this , look the part at the same time rolling  on  the  floor  laughing
   (ID: 79b35c8caff79f47f37bb4856cc6b57bcd49e5bf)

7. it ' s the equivalent of canned laughter  the reader is being prompted to laugh . i ' ll laugh if i think something is funny . in fact , if i read something funny but the writer includes a " lol " , i will stifle my laugh . principles .

8. one of my pet peeves is that here in oregon the signs say " motorcycles use extreme caution " that they can craft a sign with four words that has two mistakes  okay , one definite mistake and one iffy word choice  just makes me want to bang my head against a wall .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

9. tbh it ' s out of awkwardness as it ' s an inconvenience for you but yeah it ' s englishness in a nutshell
   (ID: 77ab4860c32a7084ca81fd91302df6690ce56731)

10. look and acknowledge when this bs happens to you and you will understand how annoying it is
   (ID: 41fc1b2c09d5a16a25f120edde55b2a6e2e54e29)

11. so does blind people , they never see what you ' re showing to them . so rude .
   (ID: 60d49a425809d6f450335028a75a5202d3b84678)

12. maybe its their way of letting you know how ridiculous you ' re acting ?
   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

13. how easily does " jag you are " roll off the tongue for you ?
   (ID: eee9dc5129787c4d2a8fda055f09565efcf9322a)

14. i think it ' s because half the time you keep talking to the wrong end . pick the side that ' s not blowing hot air , and you ' ll have a good conversation . if you do pick the wrong side , run , for it will soon be smelly .
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

15. everyone  s there to improve , most people who know this aren  t paying attention to anyone else and most likely enjoy seeing other people there to better themselves . imo anyone who shames other people for trying to do that is just an asshole
