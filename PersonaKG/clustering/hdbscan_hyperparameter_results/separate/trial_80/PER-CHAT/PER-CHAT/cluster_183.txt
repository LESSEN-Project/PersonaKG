1. i enjoyed how you became self  aware toward the end of your post . parents are just humans , figuring it out as they go along . difficult kids teach you a lot very quickly , and make conflict with docile children feel like a walk  in  the  park .

2. i don  t have any words of wisdom i am just sending a hug . that must have been so painful for you and i understand how hurt you are on so many levels . i am sorry you had to hear such unkind , untrue and vile words . hold your heart close , let it beat , you deserve love and you deserve better than an ignorant , spiteful woman .

3. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers

4. did you ever talk about it ? with someone close or a professional ? i mean i was in an abusive relation once , took me a couple of years to get over the most troublesome aspects mostly because i acted like i was ok . but i ' m in a happy relation now . i ' ve just been really open about it with my partner and she knows that there are things that trigger me . she tries to help me with it . it ' s nice to have a partner .

5. i totally understand . i have add and many times my parents at mad at me for stuff and i don ' t know why . then later it hits me and i ' m like shit this is totally my fault i ' m an idiot . i don ' t blame my parents at all for getting mad . many people with mental illnesses don ' t recognize there ' s a problem and that just makes it so much worse . all i can say is i hope everything turns out of for you and your brother eventually

6. i understand this so much . i ' ve still got attachment disorder , and when i was younger i was always sort of happy that i didn ' t trust anyone . it made me feel like i had a superpower . never trusted anyone , and never expected anything beyond the worst possible reality from any situation or outcome . i built this huge protective wall around myself . now , at digit  something , i miss the human interaction of plain ol ' friendship . i even hold my husband at arm ' s length because there ' s still this part of me that refuses all attempts at real intimacy . and therapy is ok  i can at least tell my therapist about my ' trust issues ' , but i don ' t think i ' m capable of being ' cured ' .

7. that ' s where i need to be . in a space in my head where i can ignore it or walk away from it . i ' m hung up on being angry that he gets to treat people however he wants without consequence . i honestly don ' t know how you didn ' t react with your father behaving like that ! i ' d have been terrified ! it ' s nice of you to still help him with his medical treatment even though he certainly doesn ' t sound grateful . i can see that having boundaries is important . i guess i need to know what mine are and stick to them at all times . i don ' t know if having cptsd is what makes my emotions take over when he does these things . something to talk to my psych about i suppose ! thank you so much reginaagnon , your kind words help more than you know ! red  heart

8. it is not a petty reason at all to be angry at this . you said it yourself you guys had a rough childhood and you still have struggles . you are allowed to feel like this no emotion is invalid . im sorry you are going through this , you seem like a really strong person . focus on your school . i believe in you .

9. thank you . i don ' t blame myself in a way that isn ' t realistic . i blame myself for not being aware of the warning signs of what happened to me . that ' s about the extent . i don ' t harbor any unhealthy emotions and though i suffer mildly from ptsd i am conscious enough to work on my issues . with that being said . yes , i am still with my boyfriend . the truth of the matter is that he simply isn ' t emotionally mature enough to understand the depths of what had happened . i did threaten to break up with him . the first couple of times he said it to me i didn ' t stand up for myself . i don ' t know why . but the last time he said it i really stuck it to him . i realized that if he thinks this way i can ' t possibly marry someone who will think like that and i told him that . i also told him i will happily leave because i know i wouldn ' t be suffering a loss if that ' s the way he is thinking . for the first time in all the time i have known him he stopped and gave me a very heart felt apology taking accountability for his lack of sympathy and understanding . quite frankly , a lot of other things were said . but it was true and i know he meant it . this is still a red flag for me . if i am suffering from something in the future , am i going to have to be the one to walk him through it too ? just because i am more emotionally equipped to handle ? he ' s not a horrible person . but he is selfish in his thinking . and he is emotionally sheltered . after digit years i am starting to wonder if i want to be the one who does all of the picking up .

10. oh jeez . honestly . my recent ex has said so many horrible things to me not one sticks out on my mind anymore . just the most recent horrible things . the last thing he said before i blocked him on everything was that my therapist was being paid to be nice to me . one thing that stands out the most . he called my rape " what you did " . he calls it " what you did to me " . he said that because of it i was vile and disgusting and he says that i need to take responsibility for it . he also posted it all online only he changed it to make it seem like i was cheating on him . and he said that digit  of the memories he has of me in the last five years are filled with misery . when i tell him what he ' s saying is absolutely horrible he responds by telling me that i ' m being disrespectful . and that i dont know how wrong i am . he said i shouldn ' t be allowed to be in a relationships with anyone . i don ' t deserve it . that he feels sorry for me because i dont have any sensibility . he even went as far as to play the popular card . everyone likes him better . blah blah . its all really horrible stuff . hes lucky that i dont believe him because that stuff can really break a person . i mean really break someone . theres so many other things . digit years worth of horrible things . i didn ' t realize how bad they were back then though . i think back then i believed them . now i dont because i know hell say just about anything to make me feel worthless .
