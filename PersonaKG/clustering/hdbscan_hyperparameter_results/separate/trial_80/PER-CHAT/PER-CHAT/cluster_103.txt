SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 20

1. " one of my straight female friends said she likes hanging out with gay men , because she knows that the only thing they want from her is friendship . i thought that was a good point . " because wanting something beyond friendship is a bad thing ?

2. i think you really don ' t get it . we don ' t want a significant other , we do not want to find " someone to spend our lives with " your post and your opinion shows how little you actually know .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

3. no . but being clean taking a shower helps . ladies like it when a fella listens to what they have to say , and treats them like a friend . smiling , saying nice things , and validating their feelings really helps . something that i think that most incels fail to realize is that ladies get lonely too . they get bullied even worse them fellas do . plus , when it comes to sex , they have to worry about being seriously hurt . i mean put in the hospital with injuries hurt . if you hope to one day achieve your wildest fantasy , you will first have to learn how to treat them . not frightening them is a good 1st step . incels that i  ve talked to prescribe to ideas that are frightening to ladies .

4. " beautiful women " wont go extinct . just that example alone shows your prejudice but why argue with you ? not like you ' re really making an effort to change here
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

5. i get hormonal acne on my chest too and it  s never been a deterrent . come to think of it , i don  t think anyone  s ever even mentioned it . they  re generally too distracted by naked boobs to worry about a few pimples . i  ve been with partners with body acne too and it  s never bothered me in the slightest . it  s just a part of being human . remember  the people that mind don  t matter , and the ones that matter won  t mind .
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

6. being a male i ' ve never had a period so i honestly feel it would be pretty disrespectful to voice that sort of opinion towards any female as i haven ' t experienced it myself . it ' s like someone painting a wall and somebody else comes up and says your taking a long time . how do they know what it ' s like or the problems that can arise if they haven ' t got any experience of what i ' m doing ? i choose just to be supportive .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

7. that slogan is quite counterintuitive . if you think about it it ' s a lot more like they want everyone to be nonbinary .
   (ID: f2cec4af782c7d455288420e90648dc9c6d12538)

8. people are seldom rational about their sexuality . the flip side is that being in a relationship is so socialized into people from an early age that they fail to recognize that it  s an active decision that you need to make with another person and then participate in , the latter involving a continuous renewal of  wanting it  . you can look at others and feel sexually charged ! that  s human , but failing to recognize the decision you  ve made to be in a relationship is an active process is something that a lot of people end up screwing up . it  s not to make it sound like a chore ! certainly too there are other configurations of and agreements to relationships , but the primary recognition , as far as i  m concerned , is that you have to be an adult and responsible for making a choice to be in it . otherwise , why bother ?
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)

9. not gonna lie , i ' ve known some girls that do not understand why i ' m repulsed by and scared of snakes , and they keep acting like i ' ll " come around " if i " just give them a chance . " no way . not a snowball ' s chance in lucifer ' s kitchen .
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

10. i  m sorry , why does someone  s sexuality mean anything other than who they are sexually attracted to .
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

11. that still sounds like you are condrodicting yourself , someone can not be smoking hot and also be unattractive . but whatever , agree to disagree ?
   (ID: ba841e2486d1df5b5baefde5ead0636c7c03c79c)

12. i cut my own hair . but if rather have a woman do it . total stereotype here , but i think they do a better job .
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

13. because fashion is irrelevant and you can wear what ever you want .
   (ID: 3e510494aac4d4cfd98d8ee4e7b04dffd5534bee)

14. okay but what about men who sleep around ? it  s fine to think this as long as you hold men to the same standard
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

15. alot of guys do . i ' ve had girls trying to get me to do it but . i don ' t do it . what does it matter really ?
   (ID: 73e90e443642babe17d8b9523bc123bb79b21e79)

16. generally they don ' t notice . i stopped completely shaving because of the amount of ingrown hair so now i trim . i ' ve even been known to not bother for a while and go natural and again no problems with partners .
   (ID: 5d5b1d6dc4106ea3828986093f78b562f2a75587)

17. gays aren ' t picky enough to be frustrated like incels are .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

18. why ? because all men must be manly ? again , it  s because you don  t like it that it is a problem . not a problem for the guy wearing the make up because he likes it . also , i don  t count restaurant staff as role models for my children . i am their role model , and i will explain to them time and time again that people can express who they are , even if we don  t find it  normal  or  cool  .
   (ID: c28c39847d1ec88851aadf063f6e8baf4594b35c)

19. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

20. but isn ' t this the natural thing to do ? didn ' t evolution say the " hotter " girls are the ones to survive ? just as the more tough , brute force boys are to attract the girls ? denying this almost seems the same to me as trying to convince gay people they should be straight . i ' m all in favor of promoting intelligence , but then we end up with kids that sit behind computers or grow up and sit behind desks all day at work and slowly fatten and waste away . why can ' t we promote kids to be both good looking and smart ? self  esteem is important , both in your personal hygiene  grooming habits , and in your intelligence . i agree super  model only mentality is wrong , but we need a healthy balance , not a swing shift to the other extreme of how we talk to little girls . tell them they look good and they ' re smart .
