6. " being gay just means you like guys , so if you are a girl that likes guys you ' re gay . i don ' t see why people make a big deal out of being gay "
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

7. apparently " triggered my trap card " comes from the yu  gi  oh show thing that was popular back in middle school that means , from what i understand , is that the other person is getting " owned " because they set off a reaction of events that works against themselves . so i dont really understand this statement as i ' ve never watched yu  gi  oh but how i interpret the ops statement is that " if you sleep with a girl that used to be a guy then you ' ve given them the upper hand and got owned by them by validating their femininity " . or something like that . i ' m not saying i agree with them , i ' m just saying i think thats what they mean .

8. bitches who say they got no emotions are the biggest pussies
   (ID: afdf67bb8f008481f179013844deeffa5b1b9a03)

9. " hot tits " is a winner in most girls books . men don ' t understand that women want to be sexually spoken to and touched like a whore , but respected like their mother all in one . most of what we complain about would fall into one of these categories . guaranteed . in some way it will be either a you dont find me attractive or b you don ' t respect me enough summary  fuck like whore , respect like mother . p . s . clean dick is a must .

10. tending to attract attention    doing it for attention . i  m saying you are wrong because you are unilaterally defining motives for a large group of individuals without actually providing evidence other than  well i can  t think of another reason  . you are the one who made the claim that all flamboyance is for attention , you need to defend it . also , your definition of flamboyance doesn  t even serve your point . nowhere there does it talk about loudly talking about their sexual encounters . my reason for pushing he idea that is that , because you seem to be ignoring the fact that straight people literally do just as much as  flamboyant  gay guys . if your issue with it isn  t that they are gay , you need to have an issue with anyone talking about their sex lives loudly which again , straight people do not just people who are flamboyant . my point is , if people  s private conversations bother you , no matter how loud they are , don  t listen to it . whether they  re gay or straight , or male or female . it  s not a personal problem for all straight people , it  s an issue you personally seem to have . it  s also not really a double standard because loudly yelling about your sex life , regardless of sexual orientation , in a workplace is frowned upon . like i  ve said , you don  t seem to have an issue with the fact that , whether you care to admit it or not , straight people do the same thing as well , so yea , right now it does sound like your issue is with gay people .

11. when a guy let  s a girl dress him up and put make up on him to impress a girl . if it  s who you are , ok more power to you . but if you let someone change who you are just to impress them , wack .
