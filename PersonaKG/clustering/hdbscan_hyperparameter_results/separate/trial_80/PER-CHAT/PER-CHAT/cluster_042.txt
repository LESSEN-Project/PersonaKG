1. i mean people sometimes name their kids after traits or values , like charity and patience , so it ' s not totally implausible that someone might use celibate . i personally wouldn ' t . a couple of google searches seem to suggest that this is not a thing .

2. shmukatelli would do well to get to know someone with genuine gender dysphoria , and shmukatelli might learn some compassion for those with the condition . getting a sex change is not something one goes through on a whim . neither i , nor anyone in my family is like this that i know of but if my children ever came forward as such , i would support whatever decision they might make .

3. yta . it won ' t confuse your kids . they aren ' t stupid . you can ' t use religion to be homophobic because there are many other things that aren ' t in god ' s word that you still do cutting of hair , wearing different materials , etc . as well as that the bible states various things about your wife being your slave . so you being against homosexuality is on you , not on god . if you ' re worried it ' ll make your kids gay  it won ' t . if they turn out to be gay , it ' s because of their genes . yta bigtime .

4. it ' s hard for me to say , i ' ve seen fucked up shit and that ' s shaped me to the person i am today to some degree , but i don ' t know if i want my kids to see the same kind of stuff , but at the same time i don ' t exactly want to censor what they can and can ' t see , i suppose the most i would want to do is make sure they get whatever they need to get done first before they get on screens and if i catch them looking at something i might have been looking at i ' ll explain to them what it is and that i don ' t think they should be looking at it but they ' re their own person and can decide what they do and don ' t want to look at

5. i think kids should be able to experiment and have privacy but at the same time it kind of bugs me . i ' m digit and almost all my friends are having sex . i don ' t care and it ' s none of my business but they don ' t know the risks involved other than " use a condom or you ' ll get pregnant . it ' s concerning

6. digit he didn  t make another post about all religions digit he can have whatever views he wants to have , just as i can call out a potential inconsistency in the view . why the fuck do you even care anyway ? do you disagree with my point ? or do you just have some ridiculous need to argue about absolutely nothing .
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

7. idk i ' m just being biased provably . recently in my area there is a digit year old boy that came out as trans and is being put on hormone therapy as an digit year old . that ' s just soo wrong . children should be learning and playing not declaring to the world that they are gay or bi or trans , you know ? harmless childhood crushes are one thing but openly embracing it at an age like digit or digit is just wrong .

8. personally i don  t understand why an asian woman like me would want to marry another asian . all that misogyny . all that cultural chauvinism . that patriarchy . it  s like marrying your brother .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

9. my mother was an only child , she said it was very lonely growing up as an only child and she always wanted a big family . i have digit siblings , after seeing how expensive it is raising a child and all the other drama that goes with having digit kids , i think it is insane ! i personally would like to have two kids . maybe three .

10. that ' s true . let ' s put it like this , your digit year old is an early bloomer and a digit year old man wants to marry her at the age of digit . what do you do ?
   (ID: d8b92be4e0b1e639cde4ac3fc3f079b296813fc5)

11. what ' s the differense between a trans person who knew when they were digit and a trans person that knew when they were digit ? nothin '

12. if you can  t tell what shape or number comes next in the pattern , i guess you  re somehow incapable of emotionally nurturing a child  s

13. i have more than a few issues with this but among them  digit people act like college students aren ' t adults . why isn ' t this conversation geared also to digit  digit yr olds who are not in college ? digit being on a college campus does not mean you can ' t call the police . i someone feels they were raped , call the actual police , especially if you feel the campus police don ' t react adequately . i was on a college judicial board and cases were frequently dealt with in both places .

14. digit i  m not straight digit wouldn  t it make sense to argue that nobody should be harassed for their sexuality . your hatred of straight people really confuses me .
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

15. my wife and i were both virgins when we married at digit . we are now digit . we both waited for religious reasons and couldn ' t be happier . it is nice knowing we aren ' t being compared to someone else and we don ' t feel we missed out sowing oats earlier . we have digit kids so our sex life certainly has challenges , but it is very good e . g . experimentation , some kink , lots outdoors , lunch breaks in the minivan , etc . we are certainly not prudes or how many people would classify those who wait .
