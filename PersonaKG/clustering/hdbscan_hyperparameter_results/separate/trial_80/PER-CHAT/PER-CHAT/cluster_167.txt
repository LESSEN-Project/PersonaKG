   (ID: d8b92be4e0b1e639cde4ac3fc3f079b296813fc5)

2. i think death is a state which alters our consciousness to the same form of life in an other parallel universe . so that we can live better and evolve . inspired from time is a flat circle !

3. me ? i dont have an existential crisis anymore i accepted we probably live in a simulation a while ago sounds stupid but look up neil degrass tyson ' s video on it he explains it really well but you should probably just take your mind off of it and or work toward accepting it and like me it might give you some weird peace knowing that nothing you ever do will matter .

7. i get that . there ' s something strange about the feeling of non existence since you are here now and it ' s the " black sailed unfamiliar . i suppose a lot of it is a fear of the unknown as well . what i find strange is that i was speaking to my neighbour last week . he is in his 90s and he was doing his gardening . i was asking him about his hearing as he has just got a new hearing aid and he said " i tell you what , i wish i would just hurry up and die already . i mean , it ' s depressing but it seems to show how thoughts change as we get older as wel . i got over these thoughts nearing my late 20s . obviously i don ' t want to ask how old you are but it will get better !

8. remember how it was before you were born ? me neither . and that ' s the way it will be when we are gone . same exact state . there are many questions we will never know the answer to but it ' s best to concentrate on what we know and what we have  enjoy your life and be good to your fellow humans .
