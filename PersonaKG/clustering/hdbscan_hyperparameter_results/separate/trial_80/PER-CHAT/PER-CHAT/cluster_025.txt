1. i highly recommend mint . it syncs with your bank to categorize all of your expenditures . you can set up a budget in the app and , say you go to mcdonald ' s for  digit , it ' ll automatically put it in your fast food or grocery budget . it is so user friendly  not sponsored lol

2. you can find them on sale for like  digit . it  s nice to be able to just set it and let it cook for a couple hours . the rice cooker setting alone is worth it .

3. do you want cell service on it ? i bought a  digit tracphone at walmart for my toddler to watch netflix on during a trip . it has all the things you mentioned . it ' s locked to their network so you ' ll never be able to take it essential l elsewhere , but it seemed to handle what i required of it .

4. i ran around like a crazy person on my honeymoon in new zealand and have no regrets about trying to see digit different places in digit days , but we had a campervan .   x200b  consider how frequently you can handle  want to pack and unpack and carry your luggage to a new location via public transit . using luggage shipping carriers is useful but they don ' t transport it for you in the same real time you ' ll need your stuff . what are your top priorities for this trip ? do you like crowds or nature or a mix ? will it be obon stuff is expensive , closed , and japanese people are all on vacation ?

6. producing an average digit episode anime costs around  digit million , and if you want to provide animators with a liveable wage , especially in america , that ' s going to increase quite significantly . and that ' s when the studios are already established . so i ' d say start by building up some capital .
