1. don ' t appease her for risk of breaking your lens , shes just being uncanny . let her come around , , , dont fold my guy its not worth damaging your lens . let her be passive , but when she comes around hold to your strong points you have in why you refuse to use it . but you realllllly shit the bed by using the word psycho ahahaha i mean like , its like if the story of rosa parks went way south ? like if people didnt have none of that sitting down shit . well , you just did that . ahah she will show you psycho now that you called her out . best wishes on that part .

2. don ' t try to act it was intentional or that you were serious . just laugh in a way , that indicates that you know you just did something awkward . thats how you show confidence and the ability to laugh about yourself . but you still need to stand your ground , if your awkward moment becomes a permanent joke about you . but the absolute worst thing you can do ist to become the aggressor , if you try to bring the attention to somebody else , by beeing an asshole , you show everybody your low self esteem and bad character .

3. most people aren ' t . easiest thing next time , is accuse her of the same thing she thinks you are doing and take your phone to say you are calling the cops . i doubt she ' d stick around

4. oh man what a prison scenerio , you got punked in front of everyone , now everyone will punk you . you gotta beat his ass down 5x harder than he hit you to get back with a little extra . even if you get beat up at least you dont look like a coward . or  its just highschool and no one will remember in a few days . he was obviously trying to impress someone so it has nothing to do with you personally so you can be the bigger man and walk away , dont give him the satisfaction of retaliating . if it occurs again i would ask him why he did that . if he has a reason , try to deescalate the situation and find common ground . if hes just a dick and doesnt stop , resort to the first plan .

5. so , assuming this is some kind of special ed thing , surely it would be easier for you and  or your parents to request someone different be assigned to you , or be assessed as to whether or not you still need this person at all ? you should probably also look into some anger management , because whatever this conflict is caused by , you don ' t seem to be dealing with it in a healthy way .
