1. the first digit harry potter games for pc were good , but after that everything went to shame . can you imagine nintendo making a game about the triwizard tournament ?

2. yeah , if a directors cut comes out that ' s digit  hours long then maybe . i know i ' ve crapped on it so far but ww , flash , and even parts of aquaman were good just wish dc would stop trying to race marvel and just make good movies .

3. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

4. i see what you mean . i ' ve never played reach ' s multiplayer so i can ' t say much about the problems you mentioned , though they do seem pretty bad . personally my main draws were more from the single player modes , especially campaign . i thought the alien invasion story was actually quite good , since it showed how massive and powerful the covenant was , and how ill  equipped the humans really were to fight them . it was definitely more grounded and military  based than the other games , but i personally liked that sense of desperation and scale the setting gave off .

5. it does a good job at being a shooter , the single player is just an after thought , i really hate when games don ' t have a worthwhile single player mode to them because some weird reason most develpers probably don ' t even know but just go along with it because everyone does it . i am not a fan of multiplayer especially not online i don ' t know i just don ' t like it . so splatoon went in my opinion from interesting to it is a good concept . it is just focused on multiplayer and the single player seems to have no replay value

6. probably one of my favorite game . the combat and movement are fluid , and the maps are very well designed . if you want to play stealthily , the maps offer many different ways to achieve your goal . if you want to don ' t want to play stealthily , you get a large array of weapons and powers . just watch stealthgamerbr on youtube to see what i ' m talking about . great replayability , and the dlc that comes with this bundle is excellent as well  they ' re not just short missions , but lengthy sets of missions which introduce you to new characters and powers . the only drawbacks i can think of are that some people may not like the artstyle , and that people complain about some powers being op . also , if you ' re a completionist , finding all gold in every stage is a pain . for  digit , it ' s a must buy imo

7. strong story and a solid world is all i want , took a chance to play battlefront digit recently and while it plays well and everyone is dressed up like they ' re in star wars , it doesn ' t feel like star wars

8. thinking more about it this looks . bland ? rushed ? i don ' t know . it has the standard plot , is all serious , all very cookie  cutter . where is the variety in locations ? mainframe was a city inhabited by standard everyday computer people going about their lives . here it looks deserted apart from the evil robots trying to kill them , and twinkly purple buildings . doesn ' t even seem to be any variety in the environments . hopefully the games will be back . and always trying to kill them ? that wasn ' t the case in the original series , where we had other villains and situations . will there be anything like high code , a relatively light  hearted adventure ? and good god , will anyone be able to suffer the live action ? this is not reboot . in any shape or form . at least not from what we ' ve seen so far . this is generic , predictable , and yes reboot may have been all those things and more , but it didn ' t look like it just hadn ' t tried . the name alone , and seeing if they can redeem megabyte becoming santa on his sleigh , are the only reason i will give it a chance . but resurrecting the show for the lame " oh hey now teenagers from our world can magically teleport into the computer world so we ' ll have rad skater dude and jock dude and nerd dude and girl dude " really makes me want to cringe and  or punch people until they get smarter .

9. tbh there are a lot of 2d games that are better than hzd , such as super mario bros digit and digit . i ' m not saying this game doesn ' t have its niche fanbase that will replay it people such as yourself , i ' m saying it wont be the sort of timeless game that continues getting new players into it years and years after release . it will instead fade into obscurity . the reason it wont age well is , as i mentioned , the fact that it ' s a copied and pasted open world format in an already overrsaturated genre . and it ' s boring .

10. i prefer for comic book worlds to remain mostly static . i ' m not totally against change . without change , dick grayson would still be robin . however , i don ' t like when characters have been one way for their entire publication history and the writers change them for the sake of " diversity " . that ' s lazy and insulting to the fanbase . if it ' s really so important for them to include more minority characters , then they should write new and interesting minority characters . it would be so much better if riri williams were to fight alongside tony stark rather than in his place . have amadeus cho join the hulk family along with rick jones , jennifer walters , and betty ross . it annoys me when writers basically say to their audience , " oh , you ' d prefer to read about johnny blaze rather than robbie reyes ? too bad . johnny ' s gone . robbie is your only option . " i wouldn ' t mind these new characters if i still got to keep the old ones . you can always count on brian michael bendis to ruin everything . the only good thing that man ever gave us was jessica jones . other than that , everything he ' s written has been trash . he ruined iceman and turned iron man into a digit year  old girl because he ' s a terrible writer who can only continue to sell books with pure shock value . marvel is a pathetic shell of its former self and i ' m not sure it will ever recover .

11. idk , i  m able to relate to nearly every message and character in the book . halliday  s created the most immersive  video game  in the universe and yet it  s so much more than that . people get lost in it .  the missing millions .  all just because he wanted people to like what he liked . and that somebody like wade who had quite literally nothing but passion and skill for the same things was able to beat his game . i think cline wrote every character perfectly , being able to understand their plights , i mean even sorrentos character was compelling , somebody you really wanted to hate . the references were insane . i didn  t even grow up with the old school games but the attention to detail was incredible . in an era where aaa titles don  t even come with enough content for digit month , cline was able to imagine up a place where everything was under digit platform , the whole world shared halliday  s creation , gunter or not . free learning , unlimited content , whatever your hobby was , it was in the oasis . i  ve never wanted something to be as real as i do the oasis . but the themes hit home too . the problems with being overly connected , letting the real world pass you by . the want and need to not let corporations rule the world . i just think it  s amazing start to finish . i understand liking something and later feeling differently but man , this book , i don  t think i  ll ever get tired of .

12. yeah , the potato faces bug me , as far as i can ' t tell races apart very easily in oblivion . but honestly , my biggest complaint is the voice acting , it takes me right out of character anytime i hear a voice . i will get through oblivion , i love the story , and the quests i ' ve done so far are fun , but like i said there are aspects that just drive me nuts . not that skyrim is perfect , it ' s just much much better in my mind . but because i ' ve seen a lot of morrowind is text based i feel i still might enjoy it . and i know most fans see it as the pinnacle of the series . it really makes me wish i started playing es with morrowind , not skyrim so it won ' t feel like a completely different game .
