1. they have a strict " we don ' t do that " policy listed on their website . also , in past experiences , when i told the suicide hotline that i was suicidal they pretty much just say " okay , why tho ? " like , the only time they would call the cops is it you were at the edge of a building or had a gun in your hand . just general " i am suicidal and want to die " is what they are there for . also , pro tip  if you don ' t like the person you ' re talking to , hang up and call again . it takes about digit mins for them to get back on the line , so you ' ll get someone new . i ' ve had to do that before once or twice .

2. yeah maybe with mammals and stuff but i don  t think snakes really understand the concept of help . from what i know they  re left on their own from the time they hatch and don  t receive any kind of assistance from mom . it  s possible but i doubt it

3. not in some states in australia . i used to live in new south wales where my mum had dad forcefully commited . i don ' t remember much about his first few episodes as i was pretty young and my oldest sister and mum sheltered me from it . but from what mum told me my dad is bipolar with a schizophrenic psychosis and ocd tendencies . he does not know who ' they ' are or what ' they ' want but he knows that ' they ' are after him . he started or we noticed his mental state was not right about digit years ago . he is on 120mg of zoloft a day and a daily dose of risperdal i don ' t know the mg dosage for that one . it took the doc a while to get the right mix of meds to treat him those were some fucking scary times . every time we take him to see a new doctor they freak out and try to change his meds and dosage because of what he is on . when we got him to the dr they put him on some meds that didn ' t work he flipped his lid one day , put a 6foot speargun in the back of the car and went out looking for them . i remember him saying " i know where they are today , i have to get to get them before they get me . " mum called the cops and the port macquarie mental asylum they took him and he was in there for about digit  digit months . mum had to fight pretty hard to get him back out though . flash forward about a decade and the doctor we took him to in townsville decided that zoloft and risperdal were no good and changed his meds . he went beyond bat shit crazy , he ended up in townsville ' s acute mental asylum for a while . this was when we found out we couldn ' t have him forcefully commited in queensland , even though mum was his legal care giver they wouldn ' t take him against his will until he became violent or posed a threat to anybody . he hasn ' t lost touch with reality for a while now , that ' s both good and bad though . every couple of years he decides that he doesn ' t need the tablets anymore because he hasn ' t had an episode in a very long time . we all try to tell him thats because the meds are working , sometimes he listens , other times he stops taking the meds but tells us he still is taking them but we know how that song and dance ends . it takes about digit  digit days before his mental state starts to deteriorate and once that starts there is no way in hell we can get him to take meds again . he calls the asylums " hotel california " cause you can check in any time you want but you can never leave .

4. well , if you stand under the wrong tree a pissed off drop bear might get you , but a snake will only strike at you if you startle it when close enough that it doesn ' t feel like it can get away  like if you ' re crashing through the bush chasing one or two terrified people . i ' d be at least a little concerned , but then , i ' m not a murderer . if i was a victim , i ' d take the chance of a snake bite and leg it at the first opportunity . i save my ' everything in australia will murder you ! ' stories for my kiwi husband and friends  it makes me look like a badass when i tell them about how i killed an eastern brown with a shovel or found a redback in my bed .

5. i have no idea about what happened to you . i can only comment on my own experiences . the staff i worked with only medicated patients at a physician request . they are the only ones that could legally prescribe . all medication drawn and administered is documented , heavily . so no one in my organization could " knock you out " simply because they thought you were a burden . it doesn ' t work that way . as for restraints , if you become a danger to yourself , staff or any other patient then for safety reasons you will be restrained . depending on the state or province the form of restraint will vary . some units will use handcuffs , others just simple velcro straps . any properly regulated hospital will ensure that restraints or even isolation units for that matter are used for positive outcome . never as a punishment . i ' m not going to say it doesn ' t happen because i know it does but for the most part in my experience things were always by the book . i can only speculate about your experience . if you did try to leave the facility and you were a level one psych patient then meds would likely be given even after restraints were placed . the number one thing is to keep you safe . if that means sedation then that ' s what ' s going to happen . maybe to get your vitals back or to help you sleep .
