2. the best thing to do is participate with your family throughout the entire process . that is what makes having a family meal together so enjoyable . yes , help set the table . you can serve the food or maybe someone else does that while you or another pours drinks  water . the entire idea is that it is a family gathering and all participate from start to finish . most families find that certain people do certain roles . my mom does the cooking and my dad cleans up , but just last night after the big meal , it was my mom and i cleaning up together while dad was getting an activity we had planned together . we had fun cleaning up together . enjoy being with your family throughout the entire meal and day .

3. declining invites is i think a bit too far unless you have reason to expect an immediate disaster , such as a hurricane or snowstorm . here ' s what i would do . digit  keep some basics in your car , primarily water , food , meds and blankets . if you ' re travelling without a car , keep basics in your luggage if at all possible . digit  introduce others to prepping , but be diplomatic about it  start with the absolute basics , and mention for instance how you ' ve been reading about hurricanes  floods  any other fairly common disaster , and you think a few day ' s worth of supplies is a really great idea digit  don ' t start off by saying ' the end is nigh and i will not come stay unless you have guns , ammo and twelve years of mres ' sounds far  fetched but i ' ve met very intense preppers . they ' ll almost certainly just think you ' re both impolite and crazy , which is unhelpful . digit  you have an advantage now that it has happened once . next time you go stay with these friends , you can say ' remembering what happened last time , would it be helpful if i bring some spare water and things along ? no big deal , just though it might help keep all of our minds at rest , what with the kids and all ! ' they ' ll almost certainly take the hint and stock up on a few basic supplies if they can do so .

4. i ' d say lie about it , your idea of having to pick someone up at the airport is a really good viable excuse given that it ' s the holidays , people may be flying in at weird hours , etc . the one thing i would say about lying though is that if you guys post pictures or run into any coworker ' s or anything while out they could catch you in the lie . i don ' t know where you work so i may be totally off base in saying this but i work retail too and it ' s not ever , ever busy that late at night , even on weekends . if you ' re a good employee i imagine they wouldn ' t be too mad about letting you leave an hour early , you could always start by saying " oh can i leave an hour early i have a prior commitment " and then if they ask you could give the excuse , you never know what they ' ll say before you ask , really . you could even make sure to do extra work or make sure your work would be adequately covered by those already there before you ask .

5. the other comments are kind of mean . you aren ' t obligated to be friends with anyone and it doesn ' t seem like you guys are being mean to him . as long as you continue to be polite you won ' t be an asshole . i also don ' t think its clique  y to have a group of friends you regularly hang out with . i would just continue to be polite , and maybe if he keeps signing up for your breaks say that " actually his name , we usually all eat lunch together . we aren ' t asking for you to switch the time you take your break at all ! but because only x amount of people are allowed break at once , could we coordinate a little better so that i can still eat with your friend ' s names ?
