1. i think you are really over thinking things yes all those questions are relevant , but you don ' t have to cope with and understand them all at once , tackle them in bite size pieces . otherwise you will feel totally overwhelmed . take a deep breath , the first place to start if your fairly sure , would be therapy .

3. oh , you mean mean you don ' t know ? so you decided to comment on a scientific subject despite not knowing what the fuck you ' re talking about ? and now you need the information spoon fed to you because you ' re too busy jacking off to animal cartoon characters to do anything intelligent or interesting with your time ? well nope . see , i don ' t like people like you . you ' re an ignorant , boring , loud mouthed piece of garbage , and i don ' t want to help you . i don ' t want to explain a single thing to you . you ' re fucking repugnant to me . so go back to your sticky , disgusting little animal fuck fetish subreddit and shut the fuck up about subjects you ' re too stupid and too fucking lazy to understand . stay in the corner with the rest of the nauseating degenerates who literally want to fuck cartoon animals since normal humans have rejected them outright . as well they should . fucking gross . blocked . because i really never want to encounter you again . wow . just . wow . absolutely disgusting .

4. if you ' re happy and making enough to live comfortably in the manner of your choosing then it sounds like you ' re getting what you need most out of the job . what do you need beyond that ? maybe that person needs more , and that ' s fine for them . find something to do that makes you happy , surround yourself with people who do the same .

11. without being able to see your knives and what level of smithing you have achieved its difficult to tell you where to go . if you want to make your knives a bit more artistic you could try making and pop them on the end of your knives . the world is your oyster if you want to start making things like that because you could equally do , or if you are happy rocking out that then you could try and that gives you the chance to try out the many amazing that you can do .

15. no problem at all . as i said and as other people have said , you ' re probably going to find a lot of common qualities among most atheists , and can probably make a bunch of ' most atheists are . ' ' . skeptics . ' is a good one that ' s mentioned further down statements that we wouldn ' t argue much against . one thing i am , and i believe that many fellow atheists also are , is humanist . i don ' t know what else you ' d like to talk about . personally , i ' ve never been religious and had very little exposure to christianity or any other religion as a child , so i ' m still learning what parts of my world view would be interesting  novel  different from your own views or from those of religious people . what would you like to know ?

16. for me it was oregairu , when i first watched i was at a point in my life where i acted very similar to the main character , and i hated that . the main characters actions never did anything but make me dislike the character , when i finally realized how similar i was to the mc i decided i wanted to be more positive and get better at making friends . while now i don ' t have a lot friends , i do have more than i used to and am a generally happy person . i think that if i never watched that show i would be much less happy with who i am now . tl  dr  oregairu made me realize the reason i wasn ' t happy is that i hated the kind of person i was .

20. there are some foods that need to be cooked that are otherwise toxic , quinoa for example . the ' cooking destroys nutrients ' thesis , although often true is irrelevant . you can eat eat a greater quantity of steamed broccoli and recieve the same amount of micronutrients as a smaller quantity of raw brocolli
