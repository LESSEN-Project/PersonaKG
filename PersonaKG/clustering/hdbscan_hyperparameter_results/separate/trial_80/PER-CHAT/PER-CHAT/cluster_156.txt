1. what world do you live in ? doesn ' t matter what the facts are . reality will become whatever narrative the media wants . if he is a lone wolf muslim terrorist who swore loyalty to isis before he died , that ' s what he is . period . it ' s a conspiracy theory to think differently than what the media tells you the facts are .

2. there  s a large contingent , including spokes people for the police , who view her as a victim . bring her over by all means but she should be treated as the terrorist that she is . why is she a victim , because she  s female ?

3. no , he ' s not . unlike satan , trump is real . he ' s not a threat because he ' s evil or out to watch the world burn while he cackles . he ' s a threat because he ' s out only for his own power and is unwilling to compromise on anything or admit any sort of mistakes like his general pershing claims . he lies constantly . not in the way other politicians do , either . he lies about meaningless bullshit that embarrasses him when disproved like lying about being invited on talk shows and major issues that can place the us in a tenuous situation like lying about how the us is in a prime position to rain hell down on north korea , when the navy hadn ' t changed it ' s readiness level . he is uneducated on what it takes to be president , he is a horrible businessman , he has never been proven to have any knowledge of foreign affairs , he places his own family in positions of authority they have no qualifications for , and he is a massive hypocrite . he ' s blatantly unqualified for the job he has . he needs to go , as soon as possible . anyone with eyes can see that .

4. do you have any evidence that the murder was ordered by the dnc ? why does one get the benefit of the doubt and not the other ? because one fits your political narrative of harming your opponents . and the other doesn ' t .

6. some woman supposedly .  i  m not saying this didn  t happen but fuck me . you won  t listen to the fucking fbi but this is a credible source for you ? at what point will you realize that you just hear what you want to hear .

7. i wouldn  t call him racist . what happened is that when he was young i believe in ireland but don  t quote me on that his close friend told him that they were raped by a black guy . so being an irrational young teen who was brought up with violence , neeson went out looking for black men to kill . course he didn  t actually kill anyone but still . he also added that if someone of another race , say maybe east asian , he would  ve done the same thing . so i think people are taking it out of context saying that he just went out trying to kill black people . he even says that he knows it was wrong and he  s changed a lot over the past decades , is not racist , will not do that again , it  s just a part of his youth and thought it was an interesting story to tell .
