1. dating someone in your class is far worse . i was digit when i decided to date this girl in my class . she was digit , ofcourse it didnt work out because we were little kids . she was a stalking bitch and i wanted space . anyways . after we broke up i spent digit more years with that bitch in class . after finishing high school we both wasted studying the wrong thing for a year . and i shit you not , we end up in the same fucking class together again . we still dont like each other but luckily nobody knows about it she is smoking hot and i look like a big fat sack of potatoes

2. being the youngest of digit , i ' m not the biggest fuck up . i like the fact that i am able to make my own mistakes and still remain one of the top kids . that ' s really shitty to say , but my family has a really shitty dynamic .

4. i ' m digit " digit practically everyone is taller than me , never taken much notice of a dates height unless i can ' t reach something . who they are matters

5. possibly it  s that then , i didn  t think i had particularly strong features , just a  standard  face if such a thing exists . quite possibly my personality has something to do with it as i  ve always been mature for my age .

6. i went through three different relationships in middle school , all of which i really didn  t even try or want to initiate . i have no idea how my dumbass digit  digit year old self was even attractive to them , because i did the cringiest shit and didn  t even care . my sex drive didn  t really kick in until digit , so i really had no interest in these people at all . i literally just dated them to get them to stop annoying me . i guess confidence and apathy work on preteen girls , i guess ? fast forward to me now , the contributor of digit  of pornhub  s ad revenue . oh , how i wish i could go back .

7. yes i had crushes , but this isn ' t about crushes . children , especially digit year olds and younger , don ' t have the mental capacity to identify themselves as any sexuality . hell when i was digit i barely even knew what sex was . no matter what anyone says , i ' m gonna refuse to believe a 4th grader has enough mental maturity to call himself gay , bi , trans , or lesbian and know what they truly mean . i ' m betting digit  it is probably something they heard or were influenced by an outside source . i have nothing against gay people but come on this is ridiculous . a child this young should not be calling themselves gay . they should be playing with legos . atleast wait till you have started puberty to decide that . crushes are one thing but openly being gay as a digit year old is another .

8. i ' m digit , and in my last job many of my colleagues , including some of my best friends there , were around your age , or older . everybody has something to contribute to a friendship , whether they ' re digit or digit , so i ' ve personally never really considered it a factor .
