1. not sure if this counts but i was out walking my dog in the when i come across one of my classmates tied to a tree , unconscious and severely dehydrated , apparently some other class mates mugged him , beat the hell out of him and dragged him into the woods , naturally i untied him and explained what i knew to the police and i know very little after that , the two thugs and the victim did not come back to school and the teachers did explained the circumstances , i was never called as a witness , my guess is they plead guilty to whatever charges or because they were minors got a slap on the wrist with a new identity , apparently the victim did recover physically but lord knows what going through that really does to you .

3. i was taking a shit in my alternative school bathroom stall , put my phone on the floor so it wouldn ' t fall out my pocket and break , some guys walked in and saw it on the floor , my teacher thought i was watching porn , my probation officer heard about it , i lost my phone to him for a week . that ' s my only story so far . and it wasn ' t even a porn watching story .

6. oh , we ' re talking about cops ? once in high school , this convenience store owner called the police because my friend and i were smoking weed behind his store out of the way , out by a tree , not even on his pavement . cops show up , we toss the joint , and they want to get us in trouble but can ' t really do much without evidence of actual weed . so they start looking for the joint and my stoned friend bends over to help and one of the cops literally pushes him away . never forgot that for some reason . it was such a hard shove and the friend was really just trying to find the joint to help these cops get him in trouble , lol .

7. as a kid , i was traveling with my family to my grandparents . my dad went to the bathroom on the boat terminal and me thinking it would be funny to scare him when he got out so i waited outside the stalls and scared " him " when the door opened . thing is it was some random dude . man i still cringe over that to this day .
