1. but what you dont understand is the reward that epic gives for you for the grind . were not selfish and clearly youre angry that you cant play as much . but youre not gonna play digit hrs a week to get omega after digit weeks . thats not how it works . you need to put time into the battle pass . say , you go to work , part time whatever . you dont enjoy the work you do , but at the end of the month you get a paycheck . its the same with fortnite .

3. crap , i like playing support characters because i am not too great at gw2 when it comes to playing against people as it is my first mmo and i don ' t even know if my builds are any good . the server i play on is henge of denravi , when i play , there is hardly ever anybody on because of the time difference . over the past month i have not been playing gw2 as much because i have hit a wall . i do love jumping into a zerg as a sup gaurd or just tailing a small group i don ' t enjoy pve much since i have run all the dungeon paths multiple times , farmed the crap out of world bosses and getting my ass handed to me in pvp over and over isn ' t appealing . the only thing that has got me coming back is my guildies and doing living world because my so likes living world stuff so we do that together . i have the nbn where i am so latency is not an issue for me tbh , but i spent most of my time playing on an adsl1 connection with an average digit . 5mb speed , latency was a killer . but now the only issue i have with being able to play the game is the constant drops in connection , it ' s not my pc or internet connection either , if my so is playing at the same time she usually drops a few seconds after me . have run a tracert on the hod ip address , it always seems to time out around the 40th  43rd hop so there is nothing i can do about it . because of the drops i can hardly play let alone compete lol .

4. you complaining about free rewards ? it  ll get better and more competitive as you grow within the game . i assume your still very new at swgoh and are clumped with people who are probably not that into it the same way you are .

5. i used to play offline so i could enjoy the game with no ads , now it  s like playing while online . forcing me to pay just so i can enjoy the game , i don  t like devs or games that do shit like that .

6. i agree . once the achievement hunters get their aps , everything will be back to somewhat normal .  the only real bad thing about leagues so far are the pve commanders . yeah , there ' s a ton of them  but on the flipside , they probably really want to help . it just so happens they get overwhelmed with all the things they need to do . they may have been used to running with their guild then decided to try it out on the server . i once commanded our guild run in wvw and it ' s really different when you ' re working with your guild and when you have pugs with you . with your guild , you know what they are capable of so you always know what to tell them . with pugs , there are a lot of probabilities with them  are they upleveled ? because they might not survive the first clash . are they here just for the karma  xp  loot ? then they won ' t follow instructions if you tell them to " stack " , " blast statics  might " , and so on and so forth because they would be like , " whatever man let ' s get this over with "
