1. i do this as well . if you ask your vet about catch and release services you can find places that will loan you traps and fix the cats for free . i ' ve been feeding  fixing feral  stray cats for years . i hate seeing animals that have been abandoned go hungry .

2. find a small spot with no stool to stand and give the bartender a  digit from the get go . chances are he will treat you as a vip and you will be taken care of all night .

3. the best suggestion i ' ve heard on the subject is , ask your pizza delivery guy . start with cheap chain places like dominos , because their drivers are more likely to not give a fuck . a driver for some local shop might be the son of the owner or something . so you order a small pizza in case you have to try this more than once in a night , and tell the pizza dude your situation . you are new to the area , and could use help finding bud .

4. are you somewhere weed is not totally legal ? if so , i would say mailing joints would be an unnecessary risk . i suggest you give them to a stranger that looks like he smokes weed and maybe you ' ll make a new friend .
