1. i thought you had to take them all the way off but i guess that makes sense if you can lean back on something or got good balance . never really thought about it .

3. i ' ve developed the habit of just not openening my mouth as wide when i yawn . it ' s almost like muscle memory now although occasionally a wide one happens and it ' s mildly unsettling . lol . i recently had someone tell me to look down when yawning as you physically can ' t open your mouth as wide . good technique if you can remember it .

4. your mileage may vary . i practiced on a friends car for a couple hours before i got my first car with a manual , i did ok at first , but there were definitely a lot of stressful moments the first month or two . hill starts were really scary , and one time i tried to start in 3rd on a hill and smoked the living hell out of the clutch . but now , a year and a half later i feel like a pro , double clutching with the best of them . my girlfriend , on the other hand , is hopeless . we have spent digit hours in a parking lot , and she still asks me which petal is which when we start a session , and can get the car moving maybe once or twice without getting fed up . i ' ll teach her eventually though .

5. maybe i am just bad at using them but my experience has been they don ' t help a lot with deer while bow hunting . if you can ' t get close with out one they are not a silver bullet for fixing bad sneaking , add to that they get caught on everything until you get used to moving in them and they get warm . that being said they are uncomfortably good for hiding from people . we had a rather large fellow bring his double xl curvy lady out to the woods for some public private time . they started getting undressed about digit feet from where my buddy and i where sitting in on a hill . they freaked out when we got up to walk away because , neither of us wanted to watch what was about to go down .
