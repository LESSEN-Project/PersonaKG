--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 11

1. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .

2. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .

3. you gotta get out , this is the tip of the iceburg . if you want a red flag this is a huge one . as a matter of self preservation you get the hell out . been there it does not get better with time . don ' t be a schmuck

4. nta  i mean it is a dick move to break up over text that way especially while someone  s deployed . however , i don  t think that matters given that he was an abuser and a deployment would give you a chance to leave him without him reacting violently , not letting you , etc . his reaction of threatening to hunt you down says everything about him , what  s he going to do ? beat you ? kill you ? you don  t need such a horrible man in your life . maybe it  d have been more respectful to do it over video or phone i guess but that also just would have opened you to more abusive traumatizing behavior from him , probably would have been worse to hear it in those ways rather than text anyway . i  m sorry for what you  ve gone thru and the decisions you  ve had to make here . as for your friend , does she know how he  s treated you ?

5. if she doesn ' t know what to do at least run or something right ? i mean not everyone will hurt somebody even if they ' re killing you or something like that but at lease get out of there i hope you get platinum for this i don ' t have any so i cant give any

6. if you feel as bad as you say you do , then whatever threat he made shouldn ' t even matter . do it .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

7. i ' m not going to give any more flak as i believe you have received more than enough . please just let your husband go . he deserves better . if you truly love him as you claim in your post , you would do so . holding onto him like this is just disgustingly selfish .
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

8. sometimes you have to take care of number one , regardless of how others might feel . it  ll be a different story if he was actually trying to get help , you have no reason to feel like the bad guy .
   (ID: b5cc14fd703a97548093b4e06f7e3e92575b80b9)

9. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart

10. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him

11. am i missing something here ? you love your boyfriend but hard hanging out alone in your room with a drunk guy who tried to kiss you . you stop him and clarify that this is a no go and you love your bf . perfect . but then you have him spoon with you all night as a comfort to you ? that makes no sense . but whatever . if it is eating you up inside and you really truly did not do anything , you should tell him . i mean why not  particularly since there is no longer contact with the mf .
