3. wow this must be one of the most arrogant things i ever read . so basically you are saying that grrm and d  d are not good enough story tellers plus us hard core fans are too stupid to pick up hints in the show unless you the leaker god start a discussion about them in order for us to be prepared for the bad writing and wouldn ' t get it without your help ? how many people did you just insult with this arrogant comment .

4. because as like everything else we don  t believe in hear say bullshit . if we believed every bullshit story someone from the past wrote down we would still be worshiping cats and cutting off virgins clits . so from all of us to your god i say this  all it takes is a two minute appearance and boom , we  ll all believe  .

5. nobody who actually cares about historicity can take the idea of hell seriously . but since belief in it is so prevalent , i guess knowing it was a translation blunder is a unique vision .

6. takei ' s exact quote was  " i take no solace or joy in this man ' s passing . we will not dance upon his grave , nor stand vigil at his funeral holding " god hates freds " signs , tempting as it may be . he was a tormented soul , who tormented so many . hate never wins out in the end . it instead goes always to its lonely , dusty end .
