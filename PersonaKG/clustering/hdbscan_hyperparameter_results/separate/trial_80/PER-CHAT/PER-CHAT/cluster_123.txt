1. i think people should play for the enjoyment and not just to win another uhc  like if you want to play dirty there ' s a cutclean game in digit minutes .  it should be for the audience .

2. pve upscaleds i ' m all for everyone wanting to try wvw but i really , really , really hope they are playing to win rather than playing for the achievement  loot  xp and karma train . i have seen people running back and leaving the zerg in the middle of a siege  clash just to pick  up a gaddam loot bag left behind .

3. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

4. i don ' t mean balance as in the character meta , but in the community sense . more people are on equal footing . and yeah i agree the prices are ridiculous but unfortunately i don ' t think it ' ll change to much . i wish they would do a system like injustice where you could buy most characters for the farmable currency , but some would be event based

6. no it ' s better for pc players not for the entire market . stop crying where was all the crying with all the ps4 exclusives ? only seems like this games gets cried over don ' t pretend to be some beacon for the industry when you ' re just a child throwing a tantrum .
