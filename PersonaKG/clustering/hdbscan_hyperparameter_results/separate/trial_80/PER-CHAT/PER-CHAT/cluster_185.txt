1. as someone who puts up walls like it  s my job and also someone who  s last relationship crumbled because of it , the best thing i can say is to try . also , be patient , it takes time and you have to let the person get comfortable with you

2. depends on your comfort level with them . if you two can casually have conversations about anything just bring up the fact you have feelings

4. if you  re four months into the relationship , i think they  d be happy to hear  i love you .  that  s just me and my partner , though . best way to do it is  hey , person  s name ? they respond  yeah  or  what  etc i love you .

5. i think the worst thing you can do in a relationship is expect the other person to know what you ' re thinking , wanting , or feeling . i ' m introverted and keep things to myself , but i knew things were vastly different with her when i felt comfortable telling her my insecurities , dreams , and pretty much everything about me  i actually found myself wanting to share all of that with her . it may sound overly simple , but we communicated really well from the get  go .
