1. i think the proper analogy would be  a person who does not post  leave home won ' t get banned  mugged . the more often you ' re outside  you post , the more chances there are that you will be considered a mark  offend a mod . the more often you go to dark alleys  sb and sv , there more you risk , as the muggers  mods are more vicious there . one can give the mugger his valuables when confronted  be civil , follow the rules , and take his lumps when he and the mods don ' t agree , and then he probably wont be beaten up  banned .   x200b  see ? i too can make up loaded analogies .   x200b  i insist that " zoat asshole , zoat hissy fit " is a childishly simplistic view of the situation . to me it looks like  zoat is more active , so is at higher risk of ban all else being equal  zoat is a bit abrasive , so this also contributes to conflicts that may occur  sv and sb mods are power tripping , sb mods more than sv ones  you seem to think zoat is in the wrong and behaves childishly , completely disregarding that mods can also power trip and behave childishly .   x200b  also , at which odds are you ready to take a bet that zoat will receive next ban before eaglejarl does ? digit  digit ? digit  digit ?

2. op makes claim using vague terms , gets told to define term , provides definition , gets argued with or laughed at for mistaken assumptions . that ' s usually how things work around here . just substituting ' circlejerk ' for ' god ' or ' soul ' or ' spiritual ' or whatever the hell else . tell me exactly what you mean by it and i ' ll tell you what you have wrong . tl  dr whoosh

3. hahahahaha . no buddy . telling someone words is not a threat to them . actually committing acts is a threat to them . they have shown time and time again that they are willing to actually kill people . stop fucking defending these fucks . they ' re scum . and they deserve everything that is coming to them .

4. but that ' s not actually what ' s happening , you are writing hypothetical fiction at this point . suppose in your hatred of trump supporters you become a murdering psuedo  vigilante who kills trump supporters . you should be banned from reddit you murderer ! you should be in prison ! see , anyone can do it . and my point with that example is that you are really going to say that a good father and successful mechanical engineer is " piece of garbage " just because of who he voted for ? give me a break . to be fair , though , washington dc is just a corrupt city in general , it ' s not just trump , although he is probably among the worse . nonetheless , the whole city is owned by corporate donors , e . g . the koch brothers . at least it ' s not as corrupt as it used to be in the gilded age , boss tweed era .

5. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .
