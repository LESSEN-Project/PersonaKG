1. it ' s just crazy rng . if it was a mode where it was bo2 round wise and you got all your health back after each game then it ' d be a lot more reasonable to beat . but asking players to fight digit  digit fighters that can pop off out of nowhere since they ' re a npc and can just decide when to tech every grab and aa any jump in is just ass . it doesn ' t help that you have to watch your character do his little dance every time you ko someone . you have to do digit fights and that ' s a solid digit minutes of just sitting there waiting for loading . hell , i ' d accept the game mode as is if they just made check points for hard and extreme . have it be a random drop like the current buffs and things but make it cost double the cost of a full restore or something like that and it can only be used once . i ' m thinking of this digit ways . one is where say you get to round digit  digit and you buy the check point . if you get to round digit and lose you just go back to round digit where you bought it , like you ' re setting down a marker . or when you buy one it just lets to do the fight again if you lose but you can ' t stack retries .

2. everything is bullshit if you don ' t have an answer to it . personally you pick it if you can get bursted down a bit quickly , and there ' s probably digit key heroes that are pretty tanky and do quite some damage . other than that the attack range is so much better , you ' re illusions get it too and you can take t3 and barracks in like digit seconds

4. i was excited for fo4 because i have tried to get into fo3 many times before and always failed to enjoy it . i was hoping that fo4 would fix the problems but i was disappointed . other people may be able to overlook the issues i found with the game and enjoy it for its other merits , but i found the same flaws in digit as in digit  the most significant point  clunky combat . i can ' t really describe what " clunky " feels like exactly but the movement and the shooting feel " slow " and unresponsive , and they don ' t feel like they really have an impact . i found these same issues when playing skyrim and this seems to be a trademark of the elder scrolls and fallout series . the movements don ' t seem to really connect to your enemy , if that makes sense . perhaps it ' s an issue with animations ? a polar opposite to this would be games made with the source engine where all your actions feel more " precise . " again , i can ' t really describe what i mean as it ' s a subjective feeling . the ui , in addition to the combat , felt extremely clunky . everything from equipping items to switching weapons to navigating the menu to using vats felt like a chore . it seems like i could never navigate the menus consistently . i also wish they could have implemented a good minimap instead of the linear compass thing not sure what it ' s called . having to access the pip boy again , navigating menus to look at the minimap which turned out to not be helpful at all was a nuisance . optimization . i may be wrong here but i feel like i should be running the game better than i am . i have an i5 digit and an r9 digit . i have everything set to high or ultra except for god rays , which i set to medium . i set aa and af to low . i occasionally dip into the digit  digit range . i realize my graphics card isn ' t top of the line but i get better performance on games which are more or equally as visually demanding . i never dip below digit fps in games such as fc4 , gtav , and dying light , and i have the graphics also set to high  ultra with low aa and af .

5. i feel like i need to say something here so i will . all three games are phenomenal . when i think of a souls game i think of challenging gameplay . dark souls digit was my first game and i loved the shit out of that game , still do and plan on getting the remastered when it comes out . tried demon souls but it would constantly break on me so i just quit . played through dark souls digit and due to the changes in combat was given the chance to better myself and git gud again . it had a beautiful world that made you question wtf was going on . it had a plot that was there only if you took the time to look . these things to me are what make a souls game a souls game . i just started playing three recently and i  d guess i  m about digit  digit of the way through the game from what i know about it . its fucking awesome starting out already knowing how the combat works . but because of this , i can  t git gud at it because i was already good at it when i started . i beat gundyr first try . dark souls digit took away what i wanted from a souls game , to be able to proudly say that i got good enough at the game to beat the everloving shit out of it . don  t get me wrong i  m absolutely having a blast playing it , and i definitely wouldn  t call it a bad game . digit and digit feel like adventures , while digit , much like its predecessor demon souls , feels like i  m just playing a game to get to the end , kinda like chores almost . finally , how in the actual fuck are you gonna say digit isn  t a souls game ? have you fucking played it ? have you beaten it ? it  s just as much a souls game as demon souls and bloodborne . in fact dark souls digit is more a demon souls remake than a dark souls digit sequel , they just threw in the same item descriptions and a couple characters from digit . if you think dark souls digit is the purest form of souls which it is than digit , being totally open with a vast array of ways to start is more like dark souls digit than digit is . there it is , my thoughts on the matter . downvotes welcome here smiling  face  with  sunglasses
