1. yes , it could be that , i got the page from the video and forget about it . that is the bad thing of the points system , you don ' t know if people downvote because they hate it , because they downvote things they arent interested like gunlance or because technical details .

5. " best results ever tested on headphones drivers " this is the stupidest comment i ' ve read all day , it ' s like a lie donald trump would tell . is this the official company line ? there ' s no such thing as " the best " are you saying it ' s the closest to the harman target response curve do you know what that is even ? that would be notable , but no reasonable person would call it " the best " because there ' s no such fucking thing ! only an idiot who ' s only owned headphones they carry at wal  mart would say something like that , while patting themselves on the back for how smart they think they sound
