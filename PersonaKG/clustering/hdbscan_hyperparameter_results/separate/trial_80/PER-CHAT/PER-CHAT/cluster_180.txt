1. that hs nothing to do with it . nice try though . the game had no real progression . it felt like a waste of time to me . hey look everybody ! someone who is a crybaby because someone has an opinion on reddit !

2. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .

3. i am following the rules of this sub , and spreading out my posts . none of my posts have had the same core point nor were they copy and pasted versions with each one being written completely originally and from scratch so i am not spamming . i am providing detailed arguments of the lore , and discussing those arguments with others here . and in the process i have remained respectful to those who disagree with me , despite several trying use insults to make me back down . an echo chamber is not healthy for the community . and if you want me to leave the subreddit completely simply because you disagree with an opinion on the lore , that is exactly what you are promoting .

4. first off bud , i  ve played since alpha . secondly i didn  t say anything was over powered , you do know how to read don  t you ? they asked what we thought was the best character offensively , it  s an opinionated post , the  competitive  aspect of the subreddit has nothing to do with options or thoughts . your assumptions and negative responses are the exact reason this game is dying .

5. someone doesn ' t play the game for the same reason you do , therefore they are objectively wrong , nice argument there .

6. its hilarous that this guy got downvoted for pointing out the truth . but , when you ' re drinking the bungie kool  aid . i guess you don ' t want to hear that .
   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

7. that wasn  t me who said that lol . i played the shit out of the first destiny . every dlc , did every raid , all of it . the game is absolute shit . i understand that that  s my opinion , but i truly do not get how people like that game . didn  t even waste my time buying the second one . so disappointing that bungie abandoned halo for this garbage

8. yeah , the first week of season digit the planes were just fine to everyone , i didn ' t see a single post about how op it is until the freaking sword was realest . now the sword is gone people want to attack the planes now ? excuse me , what the fuck . i just think people doesn ' t want anything added in season digit if this is the case . whats the point of playing fortnite if you can ' t have fun and keep bitching on how everything added is ' op ' . in conclusion , plz stop this , bring back the sword , and subscribe to pewdiepie .

9. you think metallica sucks ? y  know good for you . i will never be able to agree with you but you do you my guy .
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

10. no mans sky always were a good game . you suckers just say it is  was bad because the creator overhyped it and lied about some features . blame the creator . not . the . creation . thats not just about nms , its about every fucking thing  your wife died giving birth to your child ? blame yourself for making her pregnant or dont blame anyone thats just one example . and also the game became really good after those updates . fuck you . haters gonna hate .  digit

11. god , you sound like such a condescending piece of shit .  opinion discarded  is your poor way of saying that i  m wrong when everything i am pointing out is true . if you  ve ever played a game of sanhok , you would notice that you typically wind up with the same guns . saying otherwise wouldn  t be true . the map is smaller , and logically , you would not be able to plan and strategize in a smaller map as oppose to larger ones , which give you more time zone  wise and travel  wise . all you are doing is taking what i say and saying  that  s not true  and then just saying otherwise . i  m not gonna continue this pointless argument if all you  re gonna do is say  nuh  uh  and ignore everything i say . god forbid you  re anyone  s husband or father someday . side note  please stop playing me off like i am a disgruntled little kid . everything i said and am saying is completely calm , and i  m not being aggressive when expressing my opinion . you just want to argue with someone .

12. so the fuck what if i don ' t have more time to dedicate to something that didn ' t grab my attention ? why do you feel the need to defend a game or convert people to be fans of it ? that kind of attitude is just annoying . if you want to convince me it ' s good , tell me what is so amazing about it oh and why are you talking about the witcher ? that game was okay , nothing special . .
