4. i suppose it ' s the same in every country , you need to be relatively educated and have an okay job . i guess the problem with britian is that whatever the reasons you don ' t have these . if you don ' t your pretty much left to rot . there is a very large underclass here who have no opportunities and for them life is a real struggle .

7. i would argue that it only works for guesses that the average person has some level of familiarity with . people know about how big a jelly bean is and about how big the container is and can do some mental math . some will be high and others will be low , but it averages out . if you showed people a model of a new bridge being built and asked the crowd for the thickness of steel needed on the center support , you would get wildly varying answer with an average nowhere near the actual answer . so asking the public to give their input on solving an actual problem , determining tax rates , military funding , educational standards , or any number of other things that are actually complex decisions , would not benefit from this effect .
