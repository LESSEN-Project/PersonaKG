1. yeah . like a lot of king it ' s digit  filler . he is a good story teller though , so you may enjoy that digit  as well .

2. stark  digit ? heck no . the character he was more based on , ultimate spider  man ? yes very much so , though neither wanted to be a sidekick but an avenger disney  i prefer it to the other two because people like you have ruined them for me but i in no way think it  s this godsend tom is kind of accurate just not really digit accurate

3. i know ! it would have been so much better to have stuck with the hendrix . i can only imagine they changed it because they couldn ' t find anyone to make it work .

5. i don ' t know man . it ' s either they do mistake considering namco like to do mistake for example release dark souls dlc before release date or its 2b assets . it could be a bug fix but i don ' t think bug can take up that much space . i think maybe the unreleased edge master stuff ? or new feature . we can just hope we discover something when the download finish .
