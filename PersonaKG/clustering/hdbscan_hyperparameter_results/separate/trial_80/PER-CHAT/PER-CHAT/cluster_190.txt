--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 5

1. my mom has depression and diabetes . the depression causes her to neglect her physical and mental health . she frequently ate things that were high in sugar without caring and slept all day and most of the night from a combination of the depression and astronomical blood sugars . i really had to grow up fast and my twin brother and i spent a lot of time by ourselves , left to our own devices . i had nobody guiding me through how to do adult things but still had to figure it how to accomplish them think going to the dmv , getting my first job , or even things as simple as grocery shopping for our family , i always get really nervous when i have to do something new . i feel like a little lost kid again whenever i have to do anything outside of my comfort zone .

2. i hope you  re doing okay . i am now in your shoes , and it sucks . one of my best friends killed himself digit days ago . when all of our friends are together it isn  t so bad , but when i  m alone all i can do is look at pictures of him and think about it .

3. do you have to fight it back ? being sad can be a beautiful thing too ! you can ' t always bother your friends and family but it ' s definitely an option . does it feel like you care a whole lot about those people , so much that it actually hurts , like , in your lower chest ? sort of like something is squeezing ? cause i ' ve had that before .

4. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

5. one of the biggest errors our little human brains make is assuming people we know are the same from day to day . many people do not understand the episodic nature of depression . i strongly encourage you to mention to a friend of parent something like " this may be out of left field , but between you and me , i ' ve been feeling kind of blue lately . i know i don ' t show it , but i guess i could use a little extra support at the moment " say it in a way that feels like your voice . saying it out loud is scary , but surprisingly therapeutic in and of itself .
