6. is there one of these for the extra deck ? sometimes i feel like digit cards is just one to few , and theres so much nuance in deciding how many copies to run in the extra .

7. i feel like ever since digit took over everything halo has severely dropped in quality apparently that includes text on a box which would be so easy to spot and cheap to fix that they just really must not give a shit anymore

8. i  m a big decepticon fan , and these guys are an inescapable purchase for me . even moreso because i  m in canada and the wait sucks , so i  ll go stateside for it online . one of the thing i think some people have overlooked is that since there are digit bots for devestator , in order to make the star math work , we see the firsts 4pt filler bots .
