15. true , but if joji does play frank one last time for this , he can  t do the voice for long since his throat got damaged from doing it for a long time , he also won  t do comedy since he said he was done with franks comedy

16. i think now we will see the fighting . germa has been around for so long and we dont know shit about them and about big mom past i think we may see another short flashback at the end of the arc , also mother caramel maybe is alive inside bigmom or as a homie .
