1. i  ve just got this horrible feeling that we  ll end up back tracking on the due to international pressure . international law stipulates that we cannot leave someone stateless but what for the islamic state , the one that she left for ?

4. only god knows  personally i think that atheists who actually live fairly holy lives may have a better chance than a  cne  catholic who picks and chooses bits to follow . i know i  m not supposed to judge , and i try not to .  but i  m a little irked at just how much longer the communion line is sometimes knowing that people can  t possibly be reconciled having not been there the weeks before . it  s between god and them , but  what  s better really ? someone who  s turned their back and lives a good life helping the poor and doing good works , or someone who declares themselves catholic in name alone ?

5. i mean if he thinks he deserves higher wages and can get it elsewhere he just might . plus we don  t know how well mahrez will play in our system . it  s in the realm of possibility . maybe unlikely at the moment , but i hope to have this set of attackers for years to come . barring when aguero goes back to independiente
