1. we did acid with two other people , one of them had a fucked up bad trip and was eventually going to hurt himself or us he already tried to shoot us with a gun he hallucinated . before i called digit , the two other people including my former bff left . the other guy could have killed me and no one would know . it was then i realized that he didn ' t actually care about me and was toxic .

3. continuing the ideas of the nice spooky story from chimichenghis i heard about the first person to go missing at digit am . by digit pm three more were gone . no one seemed to know where they were as the storm hit land and we could barely see through the torrential rain . i kept my family locked inside and all day i peered into the gray , my shotgun by my side . this had never happened before in our town . we live in a quiet fishing town . everybody knows everybody , and we haven ' t had a person go missing in digit years , let alone four people in two days . i ' m not a superstitious man but i know when something isn ' t right . at digit pm my wife was cooking dinner in the kitchen , fresh blue crab , when i heard a woman ' s scream outside . i saw a shadow running down the street in the downpour . i saw another shadow , slower but steadily giving chase . i threw on my parka , grabbed my gun and slammed my front door open . " hey ! " i shout in my booming voice . i am a large man , six foot , six inches , and i have shouted over storms on many boats . " pick on someone your own size ! " the first person continued running but the second turned toward me . they began walking toward me and i can see shaggy strands of something hanging off of them . " who ' s there ? " i call out , " identify yourself ! i ' m armed ! " the figure , apparently male , continued to shamble in my direction silently . his head tilted to the side . i shoulder my gun . " come on boy ! you want some buckshot ? " i have never shot a person before but i was an engineer in the navy and i would not hesitate . the shambling sped up . " screw it . " i mutter . i pull the trigger . my wife screams in the kitchen when she hears the shot . the figure stops for a moment , then continues forward . i missed ? i pump the action then fire again , the bead dead center on the figure ' s chest . he is rocked back but does not stop . i rack my shotgun again and pull the trigger . no blast . i look at my gun , puzzled , and see the water dripping into it . moving quickly , i duck back inside and slam the door closed . what can take two shells of digit buckshot and keep moving ? my wife screams again . she is in the living room with me now , staring out the window . i look out with her and see the ghastly figure . it looks like a drowned man , covered in seaweed . his eyes are gone with bloody , sunken cheeks , as if his skin had been eaten by fish . " get my other gun ! " i yell at my wife , mostly to get her out of the room . i don ' t know if any gun can stop this monster . a million thoughts race through my head but i fixate on one . our father , who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .

4. i still remember back when this thing happened as a child while listening to that old song on this old device that nobody uses anymore . the last time i did this other thing was back when we still did this usual thing . these kids nowadays don ' t know what this thing is and how to do that other thing .

5. i was at a large music festival near london with a group of friends . we had set up our tents on the first day and were sitting around drinking and meeting our new neighbours . later in the day i had to go to the main entrance to meet one of our group who had just arrived . it was about digit minutes walk . when i met him he was carrying a broken false leg which he had somehow acquired on the journey to the festival . typical festival wackiness . when we got back to our tent area , our friends were talking with one of our new neighbours . neighbour guy sees the false leg , looks inside , and proudly announces  yep , this is one of mine  . it transpires that neighbour guy had been telling my friends about his interesting line of work  he made false legs . he had just finished explaining that he could identify any of his creations by checking some kind of id that can be found inside each model . and this is the exact moment i return . with a false leg . a false leg that he apparently made . this was digit years ago and i still don  t understand how this happened . even if he didn  t really make the leg , i think it would still be pretty weird .
