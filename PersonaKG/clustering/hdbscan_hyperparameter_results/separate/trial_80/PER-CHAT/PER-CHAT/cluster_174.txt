Total from this dataset: 10

1. the president is telling you we need to go to war . does congress do everything the president says ?  you do not yet have the information about how gwb got a briefing in august that it was going to happen and ignored it . the president is not the only one who gets briefings . the democrats are on committees that get most of the same briefings . they have access to top secret information that you and i dont have unless you are getting e  mails from hillary clinton . they knew what the president knew and they did nothing either . to vote for war and then say bush lied is a fucking lie . they are as responsible as he is . im willing to admit that bush was pushing for war and was wrong to do so , but what you cant to is hold those democrats responsible for letting a war happen that they should have prevent if it was such a bad thing .

3. ever country shows certain degree of hypocrisy . when there are so many people in a single country , long term rational decisions are tough to take as humans tend to give more weightage to short term experiences while making decisions . also in democracy leader who want to come to power again , it ' s easier to take actions which seems sweet for short term . that migrant worker construction  worker most probably , isn ' t gonna vote .

4. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .

5. i think the division is really individual . i believe in a social democratic society which benefits everyone with some laissez  faire social spheres where there  s a general decorum . if a thoroughly studied , evidence based concept can  t be discussed or legislated without fist fights in the street , it  s not worth discussing at all ! but there are tonnes of people who want more autocratic , paternalistic state interventions on both sides of the aisle . i think all of them are crazy as individuals . face  with  tears  of  joy unlike what either extreme believes , becoming insular and being the loudest person in the room doesn  t make them the smartest or the most right .

6. my opinion is that trump is doing nothing to prevent it . he ' s just kinda pushing them over the edge more and more .

8. i ' d like to think it means you can say whatever you want assuming you aren ' t outright threatening someone or something , but the more i poke around in reading about freedom of speech , the more i become convinced it doesn ' t exist as much as we think it does here . if you speak out against the government too much , or tell the truth about what they ' re really doing , they ' ll off you and make it look like an accident .

9. why would you assume the fbi isn ' t corrupt ? they are a violent criminal organization . i don ' t know why so many people view them as a good thing . last time i checked the good guys don ' t radicalized and arm domestic terrorists .

10. maxon was not conservative , he took an entirely different approach that what the brotherhood is supposed to do , conquest and genocide are not brotherhood ideals the railroad is somewhat like the french resistance in ww2 institute is your classic technocracy minitemen are your classical liberals its not like they forced it in your face , but you have to be looking at it from a political mindset to get something political out of fallout other than communism is bad
