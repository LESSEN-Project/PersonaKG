1. once i fully realized i was an alcoholic and couldn  t control myself like i had been desperately trying to do , i was like  fuck it , what can i do to make this downward spiral faster !  . eventually , i had a moment of being willing to try something different , even though i didn  t know how or what to do . six years ago , i went to a crappy rehab , where we couldn  t even have coffee and i didn  t always want to be there , but , i  ve stayed sober every day since . i  m totally not extraordinary in any way , i just decided to give doing something different a chance and be open to not  knowing  what was gonna happen . i hope you find some comfort , regardless of your next move or circumstances .

2. you do need to take steps to improve your life , but a big part of cbt is just thinking positively . recognizing the way you ' re thinking now is irrational , that your problems aren ' t insurmountable , and that you have reason to be hopeful for the future . it ' s annoying that people expect you to be better instantly , but thinking positively is the cure .

4. i started to not enjoy all the things i used to love but still loved them . it was a feeling of wanting to do it but not being able to .

5. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .

6. thank you for your comment , you  ve made a lot of sense to me . it  s like a switch gets flipped whenever i begin to think about doing something for me . study , art , meditation , even my last therapy session i struggled to keep myself present and awake . having been in therapy for a year now , my therapist has only recently begun talking about dealing with my cptsd so i  ve got a long way to go . hopefully i can begin unpacking my terrible coping mechanisms soon because they really are disabling in so many ways .

7. i don ' t feel like my perception of reality is very off it is that i am way more critical of myself than i would be months ago and some weeks are worse than others to the point i don ' t want to get out of bed . i also don ' t feel like anything triggered it really it just sort of stuck it ' s head out of the blue , i don ' t really know how else to discribe it .

8. i wish you well . i hate to say it because it ' s a stupid cliche , but it can get better .

9. it ' s clear you ' ve never had depression . my mind wants to do something but my body just won ' t move no matter how motivated i am . i try convicing myself to do something but subconsciously my body knows i hate my life and dont want to do it . it ' s like falling into a deep hole you can ' t climb out of without someone getting you out .

10. yea i think that  s what it all comes down to at the the end of the day . i  m always looking for a quick fix or an escape or the easy way out , i need to just confront my problems . i know exactly who i wanna be , i  m just too lazy or scared to get out my comfort zone and just do it . but nobody can make the decision but me . no therapy , distractions , drugs are gonna do it for me . sorry if this is all rambling and incoherent , i  m still pretty blazed . but i think i  m starting to understand . you don  t know how much this means to me man , thanks

11. lsd made me realize that i was overthinking most everything , and that most problems like that are just made up in your head . it really changes your mindset . would highly recommend taking lsd  mushrooms at least once .

12. thank you ! writting nice things is one of the things that keep me going . i know you will . life has a strange way of always changing the staus quo . if you are happy , that ' s gonna change soon . if you are sad , that too is gonna change sooner or later . you just have to pretend it will be sooner rather than later .
