1. im gonna tell you , mate , taking your life only hurts the people around you . not one single person is thinking life would be better without you . high school is no determination factor anyway , life changes after high school and you can make life what you want it . you can start and entirely new life for yourself , you ' re moving on to how you want to impact the world . i know talking to someone isnt at the top of everyones lists when it comes to mental health but from experience , it really helps . reddit is a really good place to get your emotions out mate . there are lots of people on here with the same problems you ' re going through and we ' re trying to overcome it together . we ' re here for you , mate .

2. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .

3. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .

4. i ' ve reasoned that because christianity was my coping mechanism for such a long time i never developed a way to handle life . that ' s a really aware and mature way of looking at it . but seriously , just enjoy life . don ' t worry about the big issues for a bit , find something that ' ll make you happy and do it . go out with your friends , play a video game , do something you ' ve always wanted to do but have never done before . reality isn ' t nice , but that doesn ' t mean we have to think about it all the time .

5. you ' re not a failure because you had a panic attack . you didn ' t choose to , you didn ' t want it , we can ' t blame ourselves for things out of our control . i hope you win your fight .

6. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .

7. this post is actually a pretty good start . whether you realize it or not , you ' re reaching out . now you need to go to a doctor , or a therapist , or whoever you feel comfortable with , and tell them all of the things that you have told us here . i ' m no doctor , so i can ' t say one way or the other whether or not you actually need medicine . but that ' s all the more reason to go talk to a real one . if you really do have depression , you might need meds . you wouldn ' t leave any other disease untreated , right ? as for the girl in the pic , i ' m guessing you look nothing like her . the hard reality is that you probably never will . everyone is different . you need to stop comparing yourself to other people , because you ' re only hurting yourself more . chances are , that girl has insecurities of her own . everyone does . but you can ' t let it control your life .
