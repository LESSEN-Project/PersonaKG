5. people aren  t against you  they  re for themselves . let  s say you  re a local politician  city council maybe . ok . so your pay is shit . this is a part  time position with few benefits . you  re in your 40s and you  ve got two kids to put through college . you  ve got your normal job paying you ok , but not enough to take on thousands in tuition . there  s a vote coming up to decide if you should create a local landfill for a nearby city  s trash . it  ll make the town some money but also won  t be great for the local environment . it  ll smell bad in that area . some people won  t like it . a guy who has the land to sell for the landfill says he  ll give you  digit , digit if you vote yes . a guy who has trash trucks who will haul the trash for the coming years will give you  digit , digit to vote yes . you don  t have friends or family who will be affected and your kids have a jumpstart on paying for school . plus , the city gets some money . a few more people get employed . big reward for you , small downside for some . that  s how this stuff starts . innocent enough . i think the problem then comes from the slippery slope if i did it for tuition , it  s not that much worse to do it for the vacation house ! and the possible blackmail . the next vote comes around and maybe you  re opposed to expanding the landfill but now you  ve got folks who paid you and can tell newspapers other outlets that you got paid . your political career is now done .
