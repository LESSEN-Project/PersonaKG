1. i was thinking plasma bursts from the sun . it would cause the burning without the radiation . i was originally thinking it could be gamma ray bursts  but there ' d be so much radiation there ' s no way anyone would have lived . but i also find that it ' s a trick question  it doesn ' t matter . that ' s all in the past . all that matters is surviving right now .

4. did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise ? i thought not . it ' s not a story the jedi would tell you . it ' s a sith legend . darth plagueis was a dark lord of the sith , so powerful and so wise he could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create life  he had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying . the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural . he became so powerful  the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power , which eventually , of course , he did . unfortunately , he taught his apprentice everything he knew , then his apprentice killed him in his sleep . ironic . he could save others from death , but not himself .

5. he didn ' t make hell . hell is the absence of god . doctor who , of all things , gave a fairly good description .  the space between dimensions . there ' s all sorts of realities around us  different dimensions . billions of parallel universes all stacked up against each other . the void is in between , containing absolutely nothing . imagine that  no light , no dark , no up , no down . no life . no time . without end . my people called it the void , the eternals called it the howling . but some people call it hell .

8. wth ? you are given that much power , and all you can think of is how to cause trouble ? what the hell is wrong with you ? use it for something that helps people , dammit . save some people . deliver medicine somewhere . bring a long lost relative to his dying grandfather . something , anything , that doesn ' t prove you are an immature prick .

9. i can try to answer the last question because i  m not sure who he got tb from . but i think one of the thing that drives him to that is finally seeing life clearly , and now seeing that he hasn  t given but rather taken his whole life . if you read his journal there are some clues to his explanation about the business being disgusting , and that in a weird way it was much more honorablenot the right word to hold someone at gunpoint and steal than steal lawfully . not the exact quote but it  s along the lines of that . the diagnosis really allows him to see that he isn  t immortal a kind of attitude that a lot of gunslingers have but with the sickness he is humbled and now sees that the business and revenge is a fools game . i know it  s a bit of a sloppy explanation but that  s what i got .
