1. if it ' s staples requesting you to do so and not a subpoena from the courts you ' ve never been to court related to it ? , don ' t waste your time by going . once you show up to court the first time , you will need to show up every month until you are actually called and might be required to be there until a verdict comes out . fyi your current company would pay you the same way they pay jury duty .

3. if it ' s the driveway to their property , and you don ' t live in a place where parking on driveways is illegal because of some obstruction nonsense , they can just show you the deed or even a few bills . there ' s no way they own a private house but not the driveway attached to it lol . just make sure to get your parking spot lease in writing also .

6. you don ' t have to ask for legal advice but you can ask if you have a case and that if you do have a case ask them if they have a lawyer in mind that handles that sort of shit . believe me if you were an electrician , a plumber or contractor a lawyer would ask you for advice too .

7. i used to work as a gas agent , until medical meant i couldn ' t do it any more . one of the major aspects of my job was delivering 45kg bottles . this is less dangerous than most people think it is . i can even surmise , that the reason they are doing this , is that there is not enough pressure in the gas bottle for it to run . there are two ways to add pressure . direct heat . or compressed air . direct heat is the less likely to kill you option of those two . the real question is whether they have the taps open or not . if they dont , the pressure release valve will pop and then that gas will ignite and basically create a flamethrower .

8. it depends on if your area has a shopkeeper ' s law or not . if it does they may be legally allowed to detain you long enough to determine whether you ' ve stolen anything .
