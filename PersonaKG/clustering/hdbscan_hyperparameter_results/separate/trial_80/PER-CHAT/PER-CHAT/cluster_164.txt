6. if you just met them like at a party ,  tell me about yourself  is a perfect opener that allows people to take it where they want . if you have developed some rapport , asking about people  s brothers , sisters , and parents  remember their names , and if they sound positive , ask what that relationship looks like  would you say you act more like friends or are you the protective sibling  . if they sound negative , venture elsewhere or play it safe and ask something more open ended like ,  who are you closest with ? who do you tell stuff that nobody else knows ?  the provocative questions like that last one is a gambit and can either turn people away or build intimacy quickly .
