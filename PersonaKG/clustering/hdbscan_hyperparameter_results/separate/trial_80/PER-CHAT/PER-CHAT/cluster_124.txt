2. this is not quite what was in the question but . i was born in a catholic family and baptisted but i rejected faith as a small kid for some reason . i didn ' t like it . what made me rethink it later was the paranoia of estimating years that left me to live , like . i needed to use them as good as possible because there would be nothing after death . i was digit at the time . anyways my life has always been shit , it was full of tragedies that was so ironic that i thought and still think my life is literally joke . in addition i had depression that had been developing since i was like digit . i started praying because i had no better thing to do to fix it all . it started slowly getting better . my " dialogue with god " was the only conversation i would have during the day . i had no one to trust , nothing to lose . it ' s been digit years by now . still a lot of ironic shit happens to me , like i was cursed or something , but the depression vanished and isn ' t going to come back soon .
