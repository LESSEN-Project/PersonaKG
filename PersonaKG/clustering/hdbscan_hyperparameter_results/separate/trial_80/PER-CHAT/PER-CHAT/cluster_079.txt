1. morgan wallen is pretty successful in the country world , but i guess that ' s not exactly " mainstream " so point stands . show sucks , but there have definitely been some talented folks make a career off of their time on the show , so it ' s not totally bullshit .

2. in defence of adventure time , i have never seen this orange thing , i feel you miss the point . have you ever seen young kids play ? they are random as fuck . get one to tell you a story and they will tell you about a girl whose best friend is a giraffe and they go on a voyage to buy a dress but they meet a witch who turns the dress into a wolf so they have to go to the underwater cave to get a special sewing machine . in this respect i cannot see that it ' s that far off the target audience . sadly like the fan boys hanging on to the super hero characters of their youth cartoon network has no obligation to keep things relevant to a market that is technically no longer their target . every time the selection of cartoons change i get pissed about it . but then in time i learn to see what ' s good in pretty much all of them

3. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show

4. i see what you mean . the first time i read the following sentence in the article  " such young men are the people most likely to be regular voters at the movie information site , and it  s only the opinions of imdb regulars that shape the top digit . casual users of the site don  t have a say in the matter " i didn ' t interpret it as the casual users ' votes not being counted but rather that they were so outnumbered by " bro " votes that they were insignificant . if the former is the case , then i agree that it is rigged by being even more strongly biased

5. it was mostly just talk , and they acted like they were showing what the people want , even though a lot of people wanted pewdiepie to be in it , or the whole jake paul suicide forest ordeal .

6. went to their show in minneapolis and would agree , fanbase makeup is dominated by white men in their 20s  30s . very few poc and women , age distribution was also very alarming . my partner found them to be very off  putting when i play them in the car . she feels like they don ' t make an effort to make space for women and other voices and therefore can ' t relate to them in any meaningful sense . this coupled with the recurrent themes of misogyny makes them peak bro  socialism at best and reactionary at worst . conversely , when i play revleft in the car , my partner loves hearing brett ' s voice and whoever he has on . he makes an effort to have diverse voices on his pod and thereby practices what he preaches . brett seems to have evolved politically as well since the start of his show , but i can ' t say the same for cth albeit , except for matt . it ' s the same bro  socialist  libdem  socdem rhetoric today as when they started . they do admit though that digit they are dirtbags , and digit their entire shtick is to follow the antics and theater of the ruling elites and ruling institutions . i appreciate those combatting the liberalism within their sub and friends irl who won ' t shut up about cth .

7. 11th highest selling musical act of all time and 2nd highest selling international act in the united states behind only the beatles . there are definitely people who don  t hate nickelback !
