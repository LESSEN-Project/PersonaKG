1. my friend was in a similar situation . his parents are british but they moved to south africa and had him there , so although he is a uk citizen he wasn ' t classified as a local student for the purpose of uni fees . you could always try germany . you could study for free at public german universities as an undergraduate . good luck !

2. think about your network . can you build one quickly , can you survive without it ? if the answer is no , don ' t go . you are married . how does your husband feel about it ? is your relationship solid enough for long distance . if it works out , what will your husband do for work ? can he transfer ? its your decision , but you are also a team . if he doesn ' t want to leave or can ' t , you may not want to take the job . can your finances handle supporting two households ? if you move to establish the homebase across the country , your husband still needs to maintain the current home . this means a strain on the finances . can you afford it ? do you want to ?

3. you seem to have your head on straight , you want to create something of your own , really embrace your parents ' legacy . if you really feel like its the right move and you ' re excited about it than no one can stop you . however , be prepared for long nights of your own , be prepared that if you do meet a woman and you do have kids that you might put them in the same situation you are in . now thats also an exaggeration , you could completely re invent the company to where you dont even have to lift a finger and youre home with your family all the time . but that will take a very long time . its all your personal preference man , dont completely rule out a college experience and a chance to take on a different path because you might hate working digit  digit in a factory with loud machines all day . whatever you choose to do , just make sure you ' re happy and keep your options open

4. please note  i am sorry if i sound ridiculous or well off the mark . i ' m from nrth qld , and have no real sense of what the city of adelaide is like . i am happy to not live near the heart of the city , so long as my labouring  standard job type partner can work close enough to the home , there is a nice school in the area , and there would be a doctor or hospital close enough if one of us or my kids needed emergency care . also being from the north , our threat is cyclones so i would be clueless and terrified in a fire . so i would not be the best to live in the middle of a fire threat zone etc . thanks for being patient and i do google earth the area a lot . i like the look of the suburbs in the area i circled but i ' m not sure if they are actually suburbs or if they are small communities considered " way out .

5. i say go for it ! change is good , and for your situation and everything you described moving is definitely going to be good for you . you don  t want to keep thinking about doing it for years and regret not going sooner .

6. i don ' t know enough about canada to know if this is stupid or not , so feel free to ignore me if it is . can you sign up with credit karma ? it ' s a free site that will show you your credit reports and they also will show you offers you might qualify for . check it out and see if they recommend any particular cards . discover cards are usually pretty easy to get , as are capital one cards . just be careful of things like annual fees and high interest rates .

7. go , why the hell not ? just be smart and have a plan to gtfo if everything goes south midway through . i think you should tell someone you ' re going , a friend an adviser or someone you can count on if it goes to shit . you will regret not going .

8. i think you just clearly stated the concept of a ' starter home ' that you and your spouse are doing right now . as your family and income grows , you may find that house too small and if you are able to buy a larger home , you may do so .

9. there are many alternatives to driving , and to say you can ' t afford not to drive is ridiculous unless you live outside of the city or the commute is immensely far .   x200b  biking is a great alternative , you will have to leave home a bit earlier but you can avoid the traffic so in some casesdepending on where you live it can save you quite a bit of time . obviously you need to take conditions into account but there are many snow rated bikes and clothing that people take advantage of .   x200b  public transportation is in every city and whether it be a bus or train there is a way to get from one end of the city to the next . i know it ' s easier said than done but if you can wake up a bit earlier it can save you the headache of totaling your vehicle .   x200b  again , depending on where you live there are many transportation apps like uber that are fairly reasonable and even if you just need them to get you over a certain bridge or past a certain point and you can walk the rest of the way is great .   x200b

10. can i ask how you are funding your education currently ? i want to get back into post  grad stuff but can ' t fathom a financial method in order to do so .

11. beyond how much money you need , there are some other things to think about . furniture  don  t try to move furniture across the country . look for a furnished place to rent  first , or better yet , stay with family at 1st . you  re barely going to be there anyways . clothes  take your favorite outfits , and enough to get through about a month without washing clothes . you aren  t going to have time . your favorites just because i already know that while you won  t wear them again , you aren  t ready to get rid of them just yet . stuff  ditch it , unless it  s something you want to save forever . money  not enough information in your post . are you looking to get your own place when you get there , or can you crash at family  friends house for a few months ? you  re going to make more money than you have time to spend once you get started . you  ll be able to get a really nice place in just a few months , but you won  t be there much .

12. i believe the benefit you  re speaking of is a state benefit for your father having a disability rating from veterans affairs . here  s the criteria . go to school . nothing wrong with doing what you  re talking about with the music store but realize that  s a hard path . take a variety of classes . see what  s out there for you . you may end up going after something totally different . i always encourage people to look into nursing . is it glamorous ? no . but you can make  60k per year for digit  digit hours per week . you can even do it with a two year degree . that also gives you an income where you can start giving music lessons or working part  time at music store so you can learn the business . best of luck to you

13. if the foundations of your house crumbled , would you just say  fuck it  and remain there ? if you live a while away from the jobs , borrow the money to buy a secondhand bicycle and ride it to the nearest town , and to see your friends . the littlest steps are often the biggest . you  ll get there , i know it  s difficult , but you can get it .

14. every job will do , as long as you adjust your living standards . i don ' t want to argue that living coast are way to high in the last few years . and that mini jobbers don ' t get paid enough , is also true . but thats how things are at the moment , so you have to adjust . at most places your job you doing besides beeing in school won ' t pay you an own apartment . the higher the coasts of living are in a city , the more you have to find things to cut out . get a roommate , maybe even more . just buy cheap foods that are on discount and stock them . use a bike if possible instead of public transport quit your gym and start bodyweight training shorten your shower times buy everything possible used . sadly a lot of students have to work a lot , while also balancing school life , without a fair payment . so you will just need to be really lucky with your job or you have to really cut back in your living standarts for a few years . maybe even share a room and give up your privacy . i don ' t wanna get into finding somebody helping you out with money , you probably wouldn ' t have asked if this possibility exists . hopefully we students use this unfairness as motivation to make it possible for the next generation to have a healthy work school balance and getting a fair payment .

16. woodworking man . go pick up a stack of free pallets , and you can tear them down with an hour and a hammer . after that , you know you have free wood , so even if what you make is crap , it didn ' t cost a dime . make a shelf , box , whatever . if it ' s something you ' re into , it ' ll grow to making cool stuff . and if you ' re not into it , no harm no foul , didn ' t cost anything but a few basic tools if you don ' t have them hammer , drill and circular saw will handle most everything , and are cheap online  craigslist . good luck man ! hope it works out

17. i ' ve been lucky enough to snag a position as digital media director at the radio station . have my own staff and stuff , but i guess i don ' t know what proper internships to look for because i ' m in the journalism field . i don ' t know where to start lol to even find something i could be interested in that i even have the skill for .
