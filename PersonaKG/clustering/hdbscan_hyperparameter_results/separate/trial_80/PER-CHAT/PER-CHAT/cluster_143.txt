1. thanks friend . i liked your poem . i am in the general habit of cutting much . i say lose traveled because life traveled nowhere fast is cliche and doing something so simple as i suggested freshens the idea and can challenge a reader in a good way . i also don ' t like a poem laden with prepositions , hence the absence of between . these are all just opinions from your readers , which after some trolling , i feel this subreddit lacks at least quality opinions  input

2. you have it now , it  s just hard to see in the moment . it  s one of those things that you don  t realize you have until you look back on all of the stuff that you  ve already been through . the fact that you  re still here and you  re talking about it proves how strong you are .

3. i ' m ready to fucking die as well . i ' m completely alone . my family thinks i ' m a piece of shit because they don ' t get depression , and i have no friends because i move around a lot . it ' s my 16th birthday tomorrow , and tonight would be the perfect time to do it , i just know i don ' t have the balls for it . at least you ' re not alone in feeling alone .

4. i cut myself today for the first time in awhile but only had a serrated knife which hurt a lot more so i didnt really get that into it . also made plans for my next suicide attempt . i haven ' t had any money in a really long time though so i ' m pretty much just window shopping for ways to make a charcoal grill with as little money as possible . i fall between screaming in my head to please let me die and begging for some kind of purpose . then i start to think of what being an actual person would look like and all i can think of is all the gross horrible shit i ' ve done . i really wish i could fall asleep in some happy dream and never wake up . i wish i could die and my body could live on and fix the world . i want good things to happen to everyone around me i just so desperately dont want to have to exist anymore .

5. i hope you ' ll one day be able to see past this and get through it , and that the non  suffering times get longer for you .
