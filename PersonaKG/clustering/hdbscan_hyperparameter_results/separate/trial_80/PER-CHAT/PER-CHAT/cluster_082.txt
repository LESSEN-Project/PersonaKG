1. that is so homophobic !
   (ID: 1e6ea64fb15fb5b12b1d82a3a5bdced4e3a6559a)

2. while i agree somewhat to the fact that hispanics like to fuck . i find it a bit distasteful to say that the problem is with hispanics . not with retarted white christians . who are too dumb to realize that their children are going to fuck regardless of what they ' re told . so hey lets get them to put on a jimmiehat

3. i think you ' re overanalyzing this pic , op never said anything about men or women , he probably meant something along the lines of " from ' having a penis ' to ' not having a penis anymore ' " , without mentioning gender , sex or self  identity , this is literally only about losing a dick , it doesn ' t matter if it was an operation or an amputation also this is a meme about a tv character , why on earth would you be offended

5. but my point wasn ' t that . this is literally not a part of islam . yes a woman has to dress modestly but dressing like that is for horny men that cannot control themselves . personally i respect all women decided covering their hair but this . sorry but this is not islam . this is straight up misogyny . you can dress modest without turning into a fuckin ninja . and you ' d be surprised how many " muslim " women take advantage of dressing like that . i can link a lot of articles from turkey where a woman dressed like that committed a crime

6. is there a difference between transgender and transsexual ? is transsexual considered to be an insult ? i ' m genuinely curious . all this gender talk frustrates me sometimes , there ' s so many genders and no one talks about sex  what ' s in your pants , or whether its there naturally or artificially . that ' s the thing i care the most about when it comes to romance and sex as a gay guy .
