5. i don ' t like anyone bagging my groceries for me , just the way i am . so when i see someone coming to bag it for me at the self check out , i turn them away . many times it is someone who is mentally challenged , probably often times i didn ' t even notice . either way , i don ' t want to be rude . i don ' t want them to think because of their disability i don ' t want them handling my food . so i say , " oh , no thank you . it ' s going to two different places " so they figure i need to pack it a certain way .

10. go to youtube and search " panhandler scams " and you ' ll see stories of professional panhandlers who do what they do because in some cases , it ' s more lucrative to stand on a street corner to rely on the generosity of others than to actually work a job for money .

14. i mean if they see you with a bunch of paper they will probably ask you for some , that ' s what happens in my music class whenever we need to write something . i also ask other people for things like pencils and stuff because i ' m bad and keep losing my own stuff .
   (ID: 8eba9c7d48a60bfbded2227dacd3275ae756fcce)

15. the company i work for pays us to go volunteer a few times a year with a food bank we work closely with and donate to and what not . the fuckin nerve of some people that come in there is unreal . you have the super nice and just down on their luck people that are super appreciative for anything you give them , and for helping load it into their cars and what not , then you get the giant pricks who make you put digit bags into their brand new car , then when you get there they open up the bags and start taking out vegetables and whatever else they dont want and demand you bring them back inside and give them extra cake or sweets , or whatever they choose then flip out when you tell them that ' s not really how it works .

18. anywhere except where op works . i didn ' t even get a reprimand . the guy didn ' t ask to see any sort of supervisor . sounds like i was being rude , i know , but in my line of work , you can give as well as you get . its sort of the best version of customer service ever .

19. we want to hear it so we can fix it or oh god not this again ! there ' s two types of managers and owners . sorry i don ' t have a better answer but that ' s just how it is ! i will say though that hilton holds a very high standard and that stuff will not fly for long . the next inspection they get will likely get those types of issues fixed . just always be kind when reporting issues like that . most times we would certainly want those things to not be issues but our hands are tied budget , staffing , time etc . trust me . our job is easiest and most fun when our guests are happy !
