5. i have had very similar experiences with edgepark though i never ended up ordering from them . just the short list   i only mentioned interest in the omnipod . digit weeks later , received approval letter from my insurance . they had requested rx from a doctor my pcp , not endo without my consent .  misquoted my benefit level to the point of not believing my insurance company about how to code the rx  tried to tell me that they don ' t like to fill the omnipod rx without also filling dexcom  when i cancelled the order after both me and my insurance company yelling at them , the order magically appeared again digit weeks later . went to byram , no issues , very pleased .

6. your best resource would be to go to car forums for chargers  dodge . there you ' ll find actual owners and what they ' ve dealt with . also realize that a lot of places like jd poweothers use flawed data to get their results . if someone says " i really think my ac should be colder " or " i hate where the button to my cruise control is " , they report that as a reliability issue even if there is no actual problem .

8. doesn ' t the fee amount start with the team ? are they doing anything to lower the fee ? i haven ' t seen any info or feedback from them about it although i have not done much looking . i do know i am invested in xby and they were able to lower the withdraw fees by updating the wallet within the exchange . i dont know if this is anything like that but thats my other experience i have had with high withdraw fees .

9. right , i can see why you would make that decision . i was thinking about the dark base too but i wasn ' t really sure about it . is it any good ? what can i expect from a case like that ?

10. thank you gunther  w for chiming in . i like the design concept of the coils but i kinda figured they might be " too good to be true " i ' m not sorry i tried them , but i really like the starre with their stock coils more .
