1. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .

5. lol ! i liked it a lot , especially the sense of isolation and vulnerability you had playing as a regular soldier rather than a spartan . it also reminded me a bit of metroid prime , which is one of my all  time favorite games .

6. the whole of that series is amazing . if anything it got even better as the series progressed .

7. it ' s up there but not on the top . it was so fascinating in so many ways but not th best . and if you ask me what is you ' d have to give a day or digit to look through huge library of amazingly animated movies .

8. so i just recently re  watched the digit  digit batman film . saga ? i ' d also just yesterday posted on lounge about how much batman forever didn ' t live up to my fond memories of it . i still liked batman returns even though i felt that it is more goofy than ' digit batman . i like michelle pfeiffer ' s selina kyle , devito is so good . it did bug me that the world ' s greatest dective didnt work out that his date was catwoman sooner . uhm , the siouxsie sioux song is also good although it ' s certainly not the best orginal song the franchise produced . instead of alien digit that i haven ' t seen yet you should definietly do the sync  points on batman returns , batman forever the purgitorio film and batman  robin . good soundtrack , bad almost everything else

9. although i love clannad and code geass with all of my heart . they arent flawless . and i dont think its good to keep saying to yourself that nothing will beat this anime . because then you ' re making it harder for yourself to find a really good anime . i recommend going in every anime with the thought that this could be you ' re digit  anime . this way you can enjoy more anime .

10. it is my favorite stealth game of all time too . i have actually played it through many times because i love the story , voices , language and sound effects . stephen russell , who voiced garrett , has also done a ton of voices in elder scrolls  fallout games . i always look for similar stealth games but only a few come close . i do like the two styx games and the dishonored series . wish something new like it would come out !

11. darksouls was the most challenging game i ' ve played in past decade , and imo is one of the best games ever made , so hyped they might remaster it next year . as an emotional wreck of a human being and welding a heart so deep one could say it ' s . the dark , the game and stories of the npcs really hit me hard .

12. that was a brilliant game . i remember playing that when it came out  2000ish ?  and thinking that video game graphics couldn ' t possibly get any better . still think that gp4 is the best f1 game ever made apart from possibly grand prix legends .
   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

13. anyone like to hazard a guess as to what sort of state the game is in now ? playable but a bit rough around the edges ?
   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

14. i have not played the first game . but i hear the second one is a massive improvement over the second one . it has gotten some pretty nice reviews .
