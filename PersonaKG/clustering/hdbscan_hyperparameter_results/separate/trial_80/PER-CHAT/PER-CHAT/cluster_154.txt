SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 5

1. i know a bit of german history and i always associated this song with the first world war and the footage was just random results for german army digit so it is probable that there is world war digit footage in it but i did not really think of that until now

2. are you taking about trails in the sky digit or trails of cold steel digit because the english release of sky digit came out last year and the japanese release of cold steel digit came out last year and they usually take a couple of years to be translated . you can definitely start playing cold steel digit without having played any in the trails in the sky series . the first sky is only  digit at the moment but the other two are still somewhat expensive , by my standards at least . i haven ' t actually played the third sky , but i think the story is only somewhat related to digit and digit , in that it has the same characters but runs somewhat parallel to the story of digit and digit , which is a continuous story .

3. maybe they didn  t get around to it yet ? you can also notice some states are mentioned twice or more so it  s pretty much incomplete and i assume will expand greatly prior to end of digit as stated in the keynote .
