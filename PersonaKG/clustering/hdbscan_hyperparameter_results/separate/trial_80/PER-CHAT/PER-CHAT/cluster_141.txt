1. you can ' t stop the march , so why think about it ?

2. i mean even the most ardent marijuana supporters must concede it makes people less active and lazy . what are you talking about ? sure , some pot smokers are lazy , but are they lazy because they smoke pot or do they smoke pot because they ' re lazy ? there ' s a lot of really lazy unmotivated people that don ' t use any drugs at all . how would you explain that ? maybe we could just blame video games or something else in that case ? some people are just lazy . you do know people of all professions smoke pot , right ? i ' ve smoked pot since i was digit . got a pilot ' s license , college degree , and have run my own business for the past digit years . just about all of my friends smoke weed and they have all been employed for decades doing just fine . they have spouses , are great parents , own nice homes , etc . you know what makes people less active and lazy ? being hung over . i ' d much rather my employees smoke weed at the end of the day to wind down and get to work the next morning well rested . you ' ve bought into the narrative that has been preached to you since birth . this , coming from a dare graduate lol .

3. so people who earn great wealth should not be able to pass that on to their kids ? isn ' t that one of the main reasons we work so hard , to make a better life for our kids ?

4. i grew up on a pig farm . my chores when i was digit were harder work than any job that i  ve ever had as an adult . pig farms are highly sustainable because they can eat just about anything , including communists . if the shit were to hit the fan , that  s exactly what i  d feed them . this guy !

5. who the hell started the idea that making cigarettes more expensive would get people to quit ? that ' s not how addiction works .
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

6. reddit has some crazy idea that all lobbyists are just running around with briefcases full of bribe money and buying votes . while it is true that some corruption exists , there are tons of legitimate lobbyists out there doing good work . how do you expect all the senators , and representatives and other government officials to learn about issues ? lets say we want more solar power . we can all post on our representative ' s facebook page saying " yay solar " and linking to random websites with statistics that say solar power is great , but that will just get lost in the other pile of every other person ranting about what they want . now lets say that people pool their money and hire someone who has an intimate knowledge of the cost  benefit of solar power and can not only put together a persuasive and concise report , but can answer any questions on the spot that may come up . that person can do more in digit meeting to inform a representative on the issue than digit , digit people ranting online and writing letters could ever hope to do . lobbyists can do great work and i know multiple people who work as lobbyists in multiple fields , many for non  profit companies , and none of them are dropping off briefcases full of cash . if you want to ban every profession that has corrupt individuals in it , lets go ahead and ban all cops , teachers , doctors , accountants , realtors , nannies , waiters , and pretty much every profession , because there isn ' t a single profession out there that is free of corruption . how many people do you think would be cops , doctors , and teachers for free ? and do you really think that would increase the quality of work from that profession ? if lobbyists are really corrupt , do you think that having them not be officially paid is really going to stop them ? how about instead of making a crazy statement like banning a paid profession , we simply enforce the laws we have regarding government officials taking bribes ?

7. you don ' t see the problem at all . you don ' t know any of the complexities or the implications of the issue , and that ' s why you think copy  pasting your own method would work . how offended would you get if the us told your own government  hey , our economy is the most successful in the world , you should copy it directly . of course you ' d be insulted . you should run your own country to your own circumstances , and we should do the same .  copy pasted from question digit mins ago

8. actually i kinda agree with her on this one . waiting for a revolution isn ' t what makes it happen .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

9. if they can give me a shit ton of money to raise my children , why the hell not ?
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

10. i disagree . it does do something . it helps thousands of people have food for a short while . i am sure that you ' d be pissed if you were part of the famine affected communities in somalia and someone said " we were going to send you digit tons of food but some guy on reddit said that there isn ' t any point in it , so we decided to spend the money on big screen tv ' s and taco bell " maybe it won ' t solve the problem but it ' s better than doing nothing .

11. yes , he is your president , even if you didn ' t vote for him . you don ' t get a participation trophy for protesting . youth may be the future , this is the now and we need someone to fix this mess our country is in . maybe some day when you ' ve experienced how the real world works and start paying real taxes you ' ll change your stance on what you want your children ' s " future " to look like .

12. tax cuts should be used as a reward for the ' job creators ' who do their fucking job . i don ' t see any around these days .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

13. i work in the industry and what your saying here is absolute bullshit .
   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

14. i made the decision last year to emigrate after i finish my master ' s program . this country is going down the drain fast .
   (ID: 24d2489761902de9148fe06d43ec8d7e34c8e35b)

15. not a great living but definitely a lot better . you do realize that mose of europe believes in a livable wage , not a minimum at least in the uk i know they do . i believe you are the one with a skewed perception . you grow up hearing " america number digit " so much that you believe it . since you like to throw your own heat , allow me to retort . from your post history i ' d assume you lack a level of empathy considering you told one person they are in america because nobody else would hire them , and your first comment ever is able not being able to love your own child because it ' s disabled . if you want to continue to sling mud at my heritage and mentality go ahead . i ' m not the one who got offended about a simple joke .

16. no free healthcare ? that is crazy ! why would anyone oppose free healthcare ? healthcare that nobody has to pay for ? who could possibly be opposed to free healthcare ?
   (ID: b650c9c531ec58d468c7c1fc9b7083efc4cbca9c)

17. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .

18. woohoo ! 90c per hour pay increase from mcdonalds . wow , you certainly argued that well .  it ' s worth noting though that the wages at walmart and mcdonald ' s remain very far from the  digit level many advocates and government officials are pushing for . now , if you read what i said , i meant an across the board sweeping change . upping minimum wage by digit  would be a bad thing for business . i am going to be the bigger man here and bring about this embarrassment of an argument you are trying to present . you have not acknowledged a single thing that a real business owner has told you about how his busniess works . you have tried to give me old mate ' s opinion as fact because he wrote a book never owned a minimum wage paying company in his life and you haven ' t brought a single example of when a digit  jump in minimum wage was ever worked . you have not convinced me of anything because nothing you have said has brought me evidence of when this happened in a country before and worked . i am not going to convince you because you are so stuck on being right that you can ' t accept what happens in real life when massive economical changes are made .

19. interesting ! i think most people don  t think about the effects of producing such things , rather than just what they promise to do .
   (ID: b5511d022d9aa43868b3f1a7ca2e4368d861570c)

20. you might notice that regardless of income it has done nothing but gone down for the past digit years , so don ' t really know what you ' re talking about . as for that ramble you gave , what the fuck is wrong with you ? why would you not want the place you live to be nice ?
