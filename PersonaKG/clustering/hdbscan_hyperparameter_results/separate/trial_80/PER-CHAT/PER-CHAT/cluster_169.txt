1. maybe when it goes on sale . it will be like every other new game i buy , play for a month and then come crawling back to gta like a lost puppy . are you going to jump on rdr2 ?

2. same as the other guy , i have thousands of hours and feel the same way . however the dota digit community still begs for new content constantly , even if the content is just a treasure full of cosmetic hero sets .

3. as long as they keep putting out seasons ill still play . i love seeing new skins and the live events , even if i stop finding the game fun ill still keep watch over the map and the item shop because i dont want to miss a thing

4. the game is too big to die . with all those mods , you can even play just terraria for your entire life . maybe the hype might die and player base will be lower but i don  t think it will die .

5. don ' t feel like i can be entirely myself with a product that is designed to keep you hooked and online . plus the fact that you ' re being seriously tracked by the evil zuckerberg . facebook is one of the most unethical companies out there , why would i trust them ? i deleted whatsapp too because of him .

6. no , because i like the game just enough to keep playing at least until there  s more dragon ball super or something and even then i might just stop playing for awhile . i won  t quit until i stop having fun and so long as i have battles with people where the timer is at digit , we  re both down to one character and everything is gonna come down to the next move , i  ll keep playing . when things get too easy or hard for me to do , i  ll stop
