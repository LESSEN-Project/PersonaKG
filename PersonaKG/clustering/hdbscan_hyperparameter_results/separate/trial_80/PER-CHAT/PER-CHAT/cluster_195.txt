2. your dad sent his flying monkey when he saw you were slipping from his grasp . treat the flying monkey like you would a narc . even less , i  d say , because this is no way their business and between you and your dad . nothing requires you to even speak with this person . you don  t even have to acknowledge them . because of this was so important , shouldn  t your dad say these things himself ? stay strong .

4. it happened about a year and a half ago . i am unsure if i could still do so . looking back on it now i wish i had right away . then again i didn ' t quite know what was happening . you hear about it and know the stories . outside it seems so simple but inside it is just a cluster of confusion . i definitely did not feel black and white about it . i was in shock about it and actually just didnt let my mind process it . not to mention the extreme victim shaming and drama that was ensued by my ex over it . the prioritizing of his own feelings . he callrd it " what you did " and how could i have done this " to him " . it distracted me from really ever doing anything about it . and yeah , it was a big thing in my life . still is . i ' m still dealing with it . i found out recently that this guy has another case against him apparently . if i speak out it would help the case . but i am trying to heal . and i ' m currently unsure if i pursue going to the authorities what will happen . will it reopen everything . make it worse . will everyone turn against me again . will i lose the little friends i have left . will i feel worse ? will i find closure ? i will have to tell my parents . now that will just open up more wounds and i am already swimming in lacerations . i am just unsure if i have the strength to survive all of those factors . and until i find that strength i have kept quiet . but then on the other hand i am beginning to feel that if speak up i will find more strength and maybe more closure than i thought i needed . i don ' t even want to face or him or ever see him again . because this guy made me believe that he really cared about me . the lies he told me . if i ever see him again i don ' t know how i would react and i fear that as well . part of me still cares for the part of him that he pretended to be . so it still scares me that i might feel those feelings if i ser him again . for me its hard to let go of that person because i really needed the person he was with that mask on . and i fell for it . ah i dont know . but i do know that hes young . and capable of getting better at being that way . so something needs to be done so he doesn ' t do what he did to me to anyone else , or worse .

5. no you handled it well . i would of done the exact same thing . think of it this way  if he did kill his self and you didn ' t inform anyone , you would feel a lot worse . you ' ve done the right thing . you ' ve broken up with him and told several people so now it ' s their job to look out for him . not yours . you are free .

6. shit . that ' s a terrible thing to happen to you so young . if it helps , you ' re getting internet bro hugs from me . you should know that you ' re an absolute hero for talking her out of it . even if she ended up doing it later , you still gave it your all to save her . most people go through their lives without ever saving someone else ' s . most adults wouldn ' t know how to do what you did . you are a legend .
