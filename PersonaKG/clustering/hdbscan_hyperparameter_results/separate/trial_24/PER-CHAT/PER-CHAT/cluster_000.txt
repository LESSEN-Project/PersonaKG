1. you ' re taking the cowards way out by ghosting him after saying you ' d give him a second chance . you should practice saying what you mean and meaning what you say . people might like you more

2. did you ever talk about it ? with someone close or a professional ? i mean i was in an abusive relation once , took me a couple of years to get over the most troublesome aspects mostly because i acted like i was ok . but i ' m in a happy relation now . i ' ve just been really open about it with my partner and she knows that there are things that trigger me . she tries to help me with it . it ' s nice to have a partner .

3. you aren ' t being selfish at all . at some point people hit this wall in their relationship . if i ' m totally honest , you should always look after yourself and this is coming from someone who literally never does that , and my god km paying for it now i know this sounds cheesey , but if you can take time to look after yourself , and he ' s still there in full when you ' re ready then perfect ! i know it ' s a difficult suggestion , but have you considered just trying to take some space from each other ? step it back a little bit , where possible . as soon as you get financially involved with someone life can become more complicated . i do hope you can work out what is best for you . you could try couples therapy ? there is nothing wrong with that especially if you have mental health issues , sometimes it ' s too hard to communicate when your brain won ' t cooperate with you .

4. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .

5. im gonna tell you , mate , taking your life only hurts the people around you . not one single person is thinking life would be better without you . high school is no determination factor anyway , life changes after high school and you can make life what you want it . you can start and entirely new life for yourself , you ' re moving on to how you want to impact the world . i know talking to someone isnt at the top of everyones lists when it comes to mental health but from experience , it really helps . reddit is a really good place to get your emotions out mate . there are lots of people on here with the same problems you ' re going through and we ' re trying to overcome it together . we ' re here for you , mate .

6. there ' s nothing you can realistically do about this apart from get a hold of yourself and learnt to move past it . remind yourself that you have no reason to be angry about it and make sure you never treat your girlfriend poorly because of it
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

7. if things change that quick there is a hidden reason for it . maybe something like a better option if she was seeing someone else around you and you were a close second . maybe an ex contacted her again . maybe there was an aspect in your later talks that she couldn ' t get past . either way i think it ' s a lack of communication on her side as to what the reasoning for the drastic shift was . luckily you were early into it and minimal damage is done . one thing i ' ve always told myself and kind of my own line " expectation only leads to disappointment . " remember that , if it ' s expected and happens , it ' s nothing special . if it doesn ' t happen then it ' s only negative emotions .

8. so no debt from college and free healthcare , plus  42k a year net income ? that ' s not bad . my question would be is it even worth trying to excel in your job and get promoted and a raise because even if you got to  84k with the tax rate you ' d probably be making the same net income , right ?
   (ID: 73c241755308e15ea272f3060f9c0a430c541f1a)

9. the unfortunate thing with being human is that despite our radical free will , we can only choose for ourselves  not others . i ' ve been through young love and know its inexplicable potency . however , first love won ' t necessarily be your best love . in situations like this , the more you try to force things , the worse they will become . a few words of encouragement about your sexuality  gay and lesbian relationships occur among many species of animals in the wild . there ' s nothing wrong with what you ' re feeling or who you ' re attracted to . i think what makes people uncomfortable about it is that it inherently presents a challenge to the privilege heterosexuals have and are generally unwilling to reflect critically about . although you don ' t want to break up , try to stay strong . the best thing you can do is let her know that you love her and are there for her if she needs you . i wish you both the best .

10. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .

11. " maybe you shouldn ' t have gone out with insert bitch name here behind my back . try working things out with her instead of jumping around . "

12. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .

13. thank you for spending the time with your child . i wish my parents didn  t work so hard all the time because i could never see them . trust me , they  ll be grateful you were there for them because not a lot of parents are . i wish more people would spend more time with their children because it  s very important to their development . she  ll only be in your hair for so much longer . keep up the good work !

14. take this time to learn about you . what are your hobbies and interests ? trying learning something , anything and become knowledgeable in it . that will give you some topics of conversation and help you find friends maybe girls too as you enjoy those hobbies . those guys you ' re jealous of . they probably think they are losers too  they just hide it better . don ' t be so hard on yourself !

15. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

16. simply ask ,  hey , do you wanna go out ?  guys don  t wanna make assumptions about your intentions and look bad , especially in a society where a guy can be criminalized for being interested in a woman . a shy guy will absolutely not take that risk , so if you  re interested , you should let him know .
   (ID: e09cddf2452184c83537d2d4e8a36f0ba7c3fae9)

17. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

18. thank you so much . it means so much to me .
   (ID: 870d9d198f856764296262192823c935f1daf781)

19. well again , not to take away from your problems , but everyone has them . even those that seem to have all their shit together are dealing with something . hang in there my friend .
   (ID: 7c5209c3b827e0de0cd436466f80ce09b615606b)

20. thank you so much i really appreciate it ! you ' ve gained a follower too . i wish you the best of luck and keep showing us those awesome results as time goes on . have a great day smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes
