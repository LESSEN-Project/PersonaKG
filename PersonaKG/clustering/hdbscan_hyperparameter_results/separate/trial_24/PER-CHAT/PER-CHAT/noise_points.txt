11. the hike is about digit km if you begin and end at fureai park a digit minute walk from jr kaimon station . it took us about digit hours round trip , but we were going pretty fast and didn  t linger because it was cloudy and no views . we kind of winged it from yamakawa jr station i asked people and the bus driver told us to get off at the wrong stop  we ended up having to pay a fee and talk to the attendant at a golf course kaimon nature park for digit minutes . the train to kaimon from kagoshima  chuo runs like once every two hours , but if you plan your timing better than we did , you can bypass all the bus nonsense !

14. i mean , sometimes i just really don  t want to talk to anyone , even if i  m on the internet doing other stuff . talking to people can be exhausting and not everyone can handle being in constant communication with multiple people . i  m ignoring my best friend as i type this because i just want to be left alone right now , but it doesn  t mean i hate him . if i were to send that brief  hi  i  d be committed to a solid hour of giving another person my undivided attention when i barely have the emotional reserves to scroll mindlessly through memes . some of us are introverts . some of us are depressed , or busy , or have people in our lives with issues that we need to prioritise over a friendly conversation . honestly i think the way we  re constantly a press of a button away from everyone in our lives has given people unrealistic expectations about how much attention is reasonable .
