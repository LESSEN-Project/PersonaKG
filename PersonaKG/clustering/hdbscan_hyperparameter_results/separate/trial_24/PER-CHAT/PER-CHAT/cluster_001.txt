1. since this platform is free for everyone to post and comment all kinds of things i won  t take your note on keeping my nose out especially from someone with attitude you possess . by all means you deserve to be called out and maybe you should take a note about changing your attitude towards others , because too much negativity is bad for everyone . i  m not american btw , stop assuming , looks like it  s not for you .

2. apologies if my comment came across as uncivil and misunderstood . i wasn ' t insulting the op in the slightest  in both of our cultures what i said is deemed friendly banter and it is a difficult situation as the internet is globalised so certain cultures reading this would take what i said to be offensive however the person this was directed at would digit  understand where my intent lay . i do however understand that there may be people reading this who could find it offensive even if it wasn ' t directed at them so i can see why it was removed . i just wanted to clarify that there was zero malice in my statement . thanks .

3. i couldn  t back a source on one thing which was actually quite unrelated . how about you back a reliable source that states the refugees are going to rape and kill us all . is hitler your trigger word or something ?

4. yes i  m fully aware , but through consistent elaboration then maybe i could help at least one person learn the truth and show them the difference . as long as just one person learns from me , then my efforts are all worth it

5. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .

7. anti  intellectualism is great to see on what is meant to be a university community . big words , small words , what ' s the difference ? i ' m not posturing . i use the terms that i think best express my ideas . i didn ' t present a counter  argument because isanybodylisten didn ' t present any points that could be refuted in a meaningful way . it was very much , " i see you as being    " . i could say that i ' m not those things , but those are equally weak statements . in what class could you get away with making an assertion without justification ? none . if you ' re comfortable with drawing all of your conclusions about someone from the way they conduct themselves on reddit , maybe you ' re pretentious .

8. watch your language . that you can ' t answer my basic questions without filth and hate coming from your mouth speaks a lot about you .

9. we  re talking about australian laws and politics , so digging your heels in and pretending like we all have to bow to your laws and historical events is again , not a good argument . being egged in this manner is not considered assault here . it  s not violence . it  s silly  that  s the entire point . what is violence is hate speech . in my opinion fear mongering is too . killing digit innocent men women and children is violence . don  t get me wrong i think egging people is a fucking stupid method of protest . we not too long ago had a pm get head butted by a dude called dj funknukl . that is assault and he got charged . i don  t like that pm he  s a piece of shit but doesn  t deserve to be on the receiving end of violence . what is very different is the act , the intent , the events of causation and the parties involved .

10. your my friend are absolute scum . worthless fucking cretin . you deserve to be burning in the fiery pits of hell for all eternity . so you can take your fucking " uwu " out of here , and go fuck yourself .
   (ID: 6692d386ab188df76448f18f0e9d59c1e6d88c50)

11. yep , you ' re totally just ignoring this . you didn ' t make a comment about how you were unsubscribing or respond to my comment . i can see how you just mind your own business and ignore things . you ' re totally not acting like a whiny snowflake at all .

12. but the left has a ' my way or the highway ' mentality do you not even realize how biased you just were ?
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

13. so tell me child . how much joy do you get out of this ? and it seems as though you ' ve forgotten there is a world outside of america . where left and right wings protest peacefully , intellectually an through many generations . you seem , perspectively through your comments on this thread alone . like nothing more than an imbecile , a child , an idiot . i hope you come to learn one day that there are benefits to all sides of the political compass . and if your narrow . you ' ll only lead to a narrow mid which in all cases . is simply , useless . good day

14. posting something that i as a muslim support doesn ' t make me a cunt . you using a generalising term clearly shows the upbringing you ' ve got . wow . shows where you stand ? oh wait . nowhere !
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

15. cool , dude . you seem stable . yeah , so far you ' ve called me stupid , an idiot , a piece of shit , and a dick  man , all i did was post a comment , that in no way attacked you . but thanks to your anger problem , which i ' m guessing you got from your dad , you ' ve made this into a much bigger thing than it needed to be . but yes , how dare i be concerned about the seeming trend of cop  related civilian deaths in the country that i live in . so , you ' re right , i ' ll start packing for brazil right away . i was wrong to question police authority for the job they literally signed up for . so , we ' re done , right ? can we please be done ? ok ? thanks for wasting my time
   (ID: cca2db8a0bcb7aff323abdba1f381d7388c9f713)

16. lol , ok ok . i ' ll stop . dude , for you own sanity . realise that this is a shitpost . my account is a shitpost account . you are arguing with me on a heavily down voted thread that almost no one will ever see . look in the mirror , remind yourself that you are a human being that doesn ' t need to get upset about idiots on the internet that are clearly doing stuff to get a rise out others . cause dude . it ' s not ever gonna stop . get used to it .

17. first off bud , i  ve played since alpha . secondly i didn  t say anything was over powered , you do know how to read don  t you ? they asked what we thought was the best character offensively , it  s an opinionated post , the  competitive  aspect of the subreddit has nothing to do with options or thoughts . your assumptions and negative responses are the exact reason this game is dying .
   (ID: ef2135d90df57b27df5e96791848d8d9201afd29)

18. i guess i did make some assumptions . i apologise . thanks for explaining . like i said , everyone is entitled to an opinion . thanks for sharing yours

19. this . exactly . just because we don ' t know every single piece of information about our universe does not mean you can just say " well then it must be god "
   (ID: b7ca8beb99c98a46de3704213b38cdcc44dbb728)

20. what the fuck is wrong with you ? see what i did there ? have a great day .
