7. i  m sorry , but it does have to do with religion . it was largely a rejection of paganism by the levites that brought it to the forefront of judeo  christian  morality  . it was reinforced throughout greece and rome by the spread of christianity and wedged its way through northern european society by way of brute force and religious indoctrination . it may have started as a cultural phenomenon , but it only held on through the passing of religion as if that was ever a passive process , but that  s a totally different conversation . to argue it has nothing to do with religion is as intellectually dishonest as it is historically inaccurate .

8. having ts on in the back ground shouldn ' t affect the way you play . if it ' s too much trouble , then perhaps a different alliance  corp would be better for you ? fly safe .

16. ok . though a subreddit is only as strong as its hallowed parameters , and is only as worthy as its erudite membership , one still seeks that spark of humanity , that intangible whisp of a soul existing beneath the unyielding tradition of syntactical perfection . tragically , one would be on a fool ' s mission , and would be reminded of his folly in a manner most brusque . in a way , such bitter truth is its own reward , sharpening the rose  tinted myopia of the naive optomist so that he is able to alter his path before it leads him off the precipice .
