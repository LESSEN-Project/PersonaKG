1. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .

3. remember how it was before you were born ? me neither . and that ' s the way it will be when we are gone . same exact state . there are many questions we will never know the answer to but it ' s best to concentrate on what we know and what we have  enjoy your life and be good to your fellow humans .

6. is trish in the extra ? otherwise it looks good , maybe try compulse instead of one of the call of the haunteds because it can help against ragnazero and exciton , or let you re normal summon a deskbot digit stuck on the table . maybe try soul charge ?

7. it ' s not ? since when ? where do you live ? every fast food restaurant i ' ve ever been to , you take your tray over to the bin , toss the trash , and leave the tray on top .

8. how you get them is how you lose them . why would you think that he would be faithful to you ? i ' m pretty sure he ' s reassuring you the same way he reassured her .

10. talking it is not the same thing as complaining . discussion is not the same as whining . when you complain you want sympathy or agreement that you ' ve been hard done by . you should look at the past to avoid making the same mistakes , you should not look at the past and feel bad about the present . rather you should look to the present and see the mistakes still being made that need to be fixed and put your focus there . you can say it shaped their lives it did . but they still wouldn ' t exist otherwise . a shitty life is better than no life .

11. do what makes you happy ! by the way , you ' re ridiculously sexy .

12. for me ? when someone asks me a question . about me . even if it ' s just a crack , i hate opening myself up .

13. i can  t believe i just read that whole book you just wrote lol . but look i can tell you immediately why you don  t wanna give him a chance . bc you don  t like him . period . you just see him as a friend . you never even thought about dating him til your family said something . you never mention having some chemistry or any kind of feelings for him . and that  s ok . yea he sounds like a great guy but if you don  t feel a connection with him or get all giggle with him i don  t think it  s gonna work out . the best part of a relationship is the honey moon stage . i mean you could give him a chance but don  t get all stressed about it . dating is suppose to be fun . especially around our age . goodluck op

14. sure , these people need help . but they ' ve got to want that help . we can ' t just pull them out of it without their consent . if we try to do that , they just go further and further into the hivemind until , eventually , they will kill someone . either themselves or someone else or a group of someone elses . it ' s better that they kill themselves to relieve their pain and prevent harm to someone else . if they want to leave that community and make an effort at self  improvement , then great ! i ' m not talking about those people . they are no longer incels .

15. i like your thought philosophy and i try to tell my wife that all the time . it doesn  t matter if it  s digit kg a week or digit grams . if it  s going downwards , it  s all that matters . like many others , i  m interested in following your story and interested in seeing the end result .

16. don ' t fuck him unless you trust him . cause once they cum you ' re trash . and they usually don ' t even text back . so if you ' re looking for more than a fuck , get to know the dude . also ? cum tastes like shit . i don ' t care what anyone says . it tastes like medicine or some salty thick mucus shit . but for whatever reason they love it when you swallow . go figure

17. no shame in going alone ! i  d probably prefer it honestly . the important thing is having a great time and celebrating the bride and groom  s wedding day

18. i like how they put up an " out of order " sign , just in case someone actually tries to use it .

19. it ' s a fun little demo to show people your watch , but i don ' t think it will improve the way you play at all . the ui is a little confusing , and the data updates a too slow for my liking . the only other thing you can do besides find portals is normal hack them , which can help you get gear easily , but is useless in the long run .

20. I'm interested in food and beverages.
