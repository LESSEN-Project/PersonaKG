   (ID: 114e3678c6af9d322985bb4656e33b19c03a0479)

7. whenever i hear that word , i think of some lady , covered in too much makeup , holding an ice pack between her arbie ' s style mudflaps sitting out on her front step , resting her pie out for all to see . on her vagisil .
   (ID: 720bf2762acb0f756492e6e40ae840126dae87ce)

8. i think it  s a sin
   (ID: 3418702de52d65ee261943b207996da3e2569fd2)

9. the rest of the poem is what i would call poetic . i think the piece functions with a degree of uncertainty without the last line . i think it takes away from the awesome that is this poem . after a few more readings , i might suggest dropping the punctuation but that is sort of whatever .
   (ID: 109fa004cbb85f6a703624f8b4393d7d7d685509)

10. i can only think of ' ' minecraft vr ' ' when watching this
   (ID: bd42a28607025a98ff2c7df361f815aea9ee3ea9)

11. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

12. i think that people shouldn  t have to lie about their beliefs . i think their religious beliefs shouldn  t be mentioned at all
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

13. i can confirm this is true . but for me it  s anytime i even think of her .
   (ID: 34784a4c9eca2e43db08bf9f548798a984337741)

   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

15. hmm now that i think about that i would be kinda hard to find him . but there ' s no harm in trying
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

16. maybe . it depends on the response of the members . what do you think ?
   (ID: ac53f9ce173965984299f3686335a39bc2a5810f)

17. i ' d rather not be high and think about all them germs .
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

   (ID: b4b3c5b3797986d94531e12d74354970a19f91bc)

19. at first i was thinking why would you put him in that situation , that can ' t be safe . after watching his reaction i ' m think what a judgemental prick i am . that was awesome to watch .
   (ID: b6567f005c34603036e6119544386ff4f12ec3a9)
