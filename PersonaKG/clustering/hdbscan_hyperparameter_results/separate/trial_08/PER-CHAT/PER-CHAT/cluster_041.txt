4. that ' s the problem . they shouldn ' t be yours . the system would be far more fair to all styles of play if collecting the oro from the kill of another simply removed it instead of giving you points . i know for a fact that you are against players joining your server just to hide or not actually participate in battle for the sake of making it through the event . in my opinion , spamming movement techs , not actually killing anybody , and only stealing oro is just as destructive to the point of " pvp " as sitting there hiding or feeding oro . rewarding people for doing so is a bad idea , and it ' s part of the reason people continue to complain about pvp and treat it like garbage . there ' s a reason i used the word " relatively . there ' s a mile of difference between hitting a fast  moving , erratic target with a bullet  projectile and simply swinging a melee weapon in proximity to them . whether or not i fall under the definition of your pretentious jargon is irrelevant . thanks for the clip , but it completely misses the point of what i ' m talking about . there ' s a reason oro theft is a popular complaint .
