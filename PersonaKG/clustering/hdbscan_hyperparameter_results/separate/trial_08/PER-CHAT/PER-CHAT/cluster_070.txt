4. if it  s really bad you should try to find a tutor or a study group to keep you motivated to complete your assignments on time . it  s easier when other people expect something from you rather than just yourself

6. people trying to bum out booze and  or cigarettes from random people are sooo annoying . i sometimes get approached outside of a train station and asked if i don ' t have some on me , usually really bad looking smelly people

7. my take on it is that  how can we prove they really kicked us out of the group just before the final boss ? a screenshot doesn ' t really prove we got kicked out . for all anet knows we might just be out to give this people a bad time for whatever reason .
