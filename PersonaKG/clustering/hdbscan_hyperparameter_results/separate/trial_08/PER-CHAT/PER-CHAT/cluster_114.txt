1. no , you ' re correct , obviously im generalizing it but to a skinny person , you ' re probably more likely to laugh off a joke about skinny you are versus people who are overweight would take a joke about their weight .

2. are these people and their one sided twitter beefs a joke or something ? this phd person has to be satire . then there  s the troll who keeps trying to stir up stuff with rackets for attention i guess ? maddox needs better foot soldiers on social media , the cringe is unreal .

3. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .
