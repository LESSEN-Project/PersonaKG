1. admitting there is a problem is hard . fixing it even harder . your kids are likely in school full time . perhaps there is a way that you can find an after school program instead of a daycare . or , a dayhome . an hour or two in the afternoons probably won ' t affect your children negatively as a they are more connected to you by this age and can identify right from wrong and tell you , and b an after school program is guided by professional people and c less costly than full time care . i am a mom to a half day kindergartener digit and a digit mornings a week preschooler digit . i would need to find evening or weekend work to save myself from childcare costs being enormous , so i choose to wait until they are schooled full time . do you have any flexibility with your job ? perhaps you could drop off and pick up and return to work if necessary when she returns home . i ' m getting off track . i can ' t think of anything you ' re doing that isn ' t gentle , kind or thoughtful and coming from a place of love . i know my husband works long hours for our benefit and i appreciate the hell out of him for it . you are a good person and it sounds like she does need help in the form of a doctor or counselling for ppd . just keep coming from a place of love when you tell her you miss your partner in crime and that you want her to be happy , and all that growing old together stuff . i would beg and plead with my husband to come to counselling with me if i thought he needed it , but if that ' s likely to make her angry i just don ' t know . maybe if you guys are close with her family you can discreetly discuss with a trusted family member that you are worried . maybe they are worried too .

2. do you mean ' safe for work ' as apposed to nsfw ? if so does it have to be at work ? because i guess that would be this old guy john i used to work a sales counter with yelling " please stop ! " to an old lady walking into the show room that was about to walk over a piece of paper that had fallen on the floor , so he thought she would slip . she walked over it like it was nothing before looking up at him and starting to sign in sign language . because she was def . and therefor did not hear this old guy scream so loud his face turned beat red , and everyone that worked in that huge building heard and came over , but she didn ' t really pay attention so she didnt know what happened and no one told her lol . thats the sfw story i go to when talking to family or kids or whatever . idk if thats what your looking for .

3. my ninth grade intro to tech teacher mrs oh i am sorry dr h . first let me tell what what she looked like she looked like chucky with heath ledgers jokers mouth as an old pale lady . here  s what she did digit . once she got mad at me for saying the word aids . i was explaining what wakanda does to make people not want to go visit it and keep the secret digit . she talked slowly while emphasizing certain words which made listening to her painful . she talked like this  the audit . has shown that most . of you . have . been . on other sites . never mind that most of us also got our work done while on said sitesso imagine listening to her try to punish you i  ll get back to this later digit once for a class project we were planting plants in the schools front yard . while there she told me and a couple of my friends 3to be exact to go the school and get some empty boxes . we go and look for the boxes . now the only boxes we found were not empty at allthey had printer paper i think so we thought we should grab one and bring to her to ask if that  s what she meant and she just misspoke or something . we show her the box and the . this digit year oldish lady throws a damm temper tantrum . she starts yelling  i asked for empty boxes  i tried to tell her  mrs hackney these were the only boxes we foun  empty boxes empty boxes she kept yelling while stamping her foot like an angry toddler . i just turned around and went back inside to keep looking to shut her up . turns out the janitor was about to throw the empty boxes out and that  s why we couldn  t find them . he let us have them though nice guy really any cursing at all was evil to her like she downright went on rages about it  you can  t use those words there evil , your doing evil . crap i just said the fucking chrombook doesn  t work for god sakes . remember what i said about her  trying to punish you  . here  s what she did he yelled you you until you stopped and then tried to make you agree with her that you were wrong like she actually was fanatical to the rules . like when she heard me someone say fuck she would try to make you stop by saying it wasn  t in your  vocabulary  and making you admit you were wrong . while most teachers would just be like  don  t say that out loud  or just ignore if it wasn  t in a conversation with them . we were in ninth grade and i knew for a fact my friends and iwho she was talking toknew what fuck literally meant because we discussed that earlier in the school yearwe were wondering how  fuck you  became an insult instead of a complement . and when i was talking with my friends during an assignment she told me to stop because  no job lets you do that  . i told her i see what some jobs would airport guides drivers surgeons ectbut that it wasn  t affecting our .   nope no job let  s you do that restaurants don  t let the cashiers or cooks do that  . we were doing a  put a computer together  simulation which i am pretty is one of the jobs that lets you talk to each other . and actually this ended up a project that we had to end up doing together because it was too complicated . lots of her projects ended like this . her saying we need to work alone and then telling us we had to work together back on track i knew for a fact the  no job lets you do that  was bull becasue my grandma has a resultant and the workers are always joking around and stuff while working and at the local mcdonald  s and giant and all the other stores and restaurants well most the workers would talk and gossip to each other while packing bags or giving you your order . i tried to tell her this but she kept yelling so i just shut up and pretended to agree while listening to her rant on  emotional intelligence  and the ever so infamous  talking back  lecture . thirdly she tried little i mean pre k teaching methods to try to get us to do what she said . like saying if we didn  t do something that was school mandated i think not using phones . which all other teachers just ignored if it wasn  t while you still had work to do that the principal would  turn me into a toad  in ninth grade . we all knew one wizards aren  t realor at least publicly know secondly if he was a wizard why was he being a principal at a regular school ? so we just kept doing it while hiding it from her . there  s a bunch of other stuff or i could clarify on somethings if you want . tldr tech teacher tried to teach ninth graders like kindergarteners . was crazy loyal to to stupid rules .

4. so , let  s break this down , folks .  i beg the principle by which you derive the conclusion that he is in debt owing to his donators . the very nature of donation implies no need for reimbursement . if a refund were a reasonable expectation , then that implies something had been purchased . in fact , no such trade was agreed upon . people willingly donated to support the arts they appreciated specifically spoony ' s . this was not a loan situation . why must so many people die on this indefensible hill ? from the patreon community guidelines page   patreon is for artists , creators , and people who bring ideas . don  t put up fake pages or collect money for things you  re not actually doing . you also can  t use patreon as a prank or to fund non  activity .  that seems very clearly what spoony is doing . collecting money for things he is not actually doing .  giving out of love or support , even if it is for a person ' s product and not just for themselves , comes with no strings attached . if you give , or if another gives , and then demand return on the investment , that is a false gift , and you are reneging , or in other words cheating on your gift children call it indian giving , but that is offensive for obvious reasons . it is an extremely bad sign of character . it is not presented by spoony as  no strings attached  . he attached them when he put rewards up . rewards he is not delivering on . it is a gift exchange , agreed upon by both parties . i give him something , he gives me something . so far , he has gotten a lot of somethings and given barely any back out .  everyone keeps calling him a scammer , but the very nature of his supposed promises on patreon is that they are supposed to be projects that he would attempt , and or things and activities that he would try to give back to show appreciation for the support of those donating fans . correct . and he has seemingly failed to even attempt many of these activities .  it is ridiculous to inflate his lack of production into some kind of premeditated , draconic , dastardly , mustache curling scam to gain money , and then screw himself out of the money that he so cleverly thieved away by very cleverly destroying his source of income . does anyone really take this premise seriously ? do you think he is a scheming thief or a bungling failure ? he ' s either good at robbing , or bad at making a living . which one is it ? premeditated ? probably not . bungling failure is probably the closest to the truth . the dude is fucking himself over , which is sad .  there ' s one very simple answer to anyone who claims that spoony orchestrated a planned scheme to steal from his fans and is thus guilty of theft  why would you steal from people who are already paying you for next to no work ? why in the name of reason would anyone choose to fuck over their main support in favor of . essentially nothing positive ? it makes no sense . indeed , it does make no sense . which is why i  m surprised he  s doing it . he really either needs to just throw in the towel and call it quits or start producing again . this limbo state his patreon and site are in is just a sign of what many perceive as apathy at best and wholly dishonest at worst .  just let it go . you ' re angry at the guy because you ' re either a millennial that feels like they deserve to be treated as more of a priority , or you ' re from generation x and you grew up thinking life was business and money , and any kind of moving of money is necessarily a purchase of goods or services and must be rewarded in some way . i  m not angry at noah . i  m really not . i  m actually sad that i get no content from him , because i really enjoyed it . and your strawmen arguments hold no sway here . it is very simple  by putting up rewards , he agreed to provide them in return for money . he has consistently failed to do so . no more , no less .  if the case is the former , then please try to remember that the man is only a flawed human , who happens to be unfortunately not so good at sustaining his own productivity for reasons that really aren ' t your concern . if the case is the latter , then you need to catch up with the world , or you ' re going to have some serious issues in the future as we continue to progress as a technological and information based society . they say generals always fight the last war . well , things are moving at the pace of progress right now , and it is observably mathematically evident that society is evolving at an exponential rate . your childhood does not represent even the world of twenty years later at this point , and you need to adapt . be flexible and try to understand that those acts of donation on the internet in no way come with a bill of sale , contract of reimbursement , or value estimation . yes , he is flawed . and he is not owning up to those flaws and admitting defeat or conquering them to become a better creator . he is just ignoring his patrons . now , the middle of that is a bunch of meaningless platitudes that have no bearing on the conversation , so i  ll skip to the end  these donations did come with an expectation of reimbursement . by spoony . himself . he said that if you give him x amount of money , he would give you y content . that . is . a . business . transaction .

5. okay so this comment is a little different than the answer your looking for but it kind of fits . i worked at a resturaunt as a server and had a manager who was really mean all the time and had such an attitude problem . she would piss off the guests in my section often and let them leave pissed off to write a bad review , on numerous occasions . she would shoulder check me and make fun of me in front of people and yell at me on the floor for something that wasn ' t done by me , wasn ' t even in my section and had literally nothing to do with me . and she has left me in tears often because of how badly she treated me . she also made a lot of really horrible calls like choosing to not tell me about guests special requests and letting them get mad at me for not being prepped on how they prefer things . they ' re rich assholes and prefer their experiences where they don ' t have to communicate the way they want things . which is completely opposite of how we treat the normal guests . but i wouldn ' t know that unless she taught me that . so she ' s made me look like an idiot on a couple of occasions . one night it was really busy and the sushi chef was behind so i had to wait a really long time for a roll for an appetizer . this table was very high maintenanced and picky so they were pissed . i asked the manager to move it along and talk to the table and she ignored me . finally i talk to the sushi chef he usually prefers no contact and i find out that the lines i put in on the computer to distinguish between apps and entrees just didn ' t show up . so i draw them on the paper and ask him for the roll asap . the manager should have been doing this because i needed to get to my tables and run my food . then i tell the manager about the problem with the specific computer and how it has been giving me trouble again . it happened at random since the very beginning of me working there . she gave me a horrible response about how there ' s nothing she can do about it . it my head lady , i still have the number of the posi support team in my phone from my old management job and i know that you can fix it . again , in my head . so i ' m upset because she had no regard for the happiness of my table . had no regard for the problem with the computer that was causing a lot of issues . and had no regard for helping me out which is her job . but again , she ' s a bully . so im in a hurry i ask the sushi chef for the entree roll and he hands it to me and i drop it at the table and apologize over and over again . in my head i ' m like i ' m just ganna split this sushi roll off the bill and tell them at the end i paid for it . i wasn ' t even going to ask the manager i was just ganna pay for it myself . so then i realize he hands me the wrong sushi roll and when the entree sushis come up its wrong because he gave me an entree one for app . so the sushi chef is fighting with me tooth to nail and i ' m telling him what i need and he ' s just saying no . and in my head i ' m like how can you fight against this . this is for the customer we need to fix the mistake and talk about it later for the happiness of the guests . i tell the manager i need her help again and she starts yelling and screaming in my face about how i should know the difference . so i said out loud " the sushi chef didn ' t know the difference either . it ' s busy . i need my roll for the table there should be no arguing about it " . so i basically undermined her at that point . then she pulls me to the side to say that i have no right to fight with her , i was acting like a child and tried to threaten me with the owner . whom was sitting right in front of the sushi station and didn ' t even offer a helping hand to get the problem solved efficiently . then i ' m so fed up i start literally crying . saying i don ' t care was the owner says at this point i need the help when there ' s an issue and instead all i do is get yelled at . then she says we ' ll talk about it later . we never did . i worked there for a year and had a lot of shifts and was really good with the guests and always had compliments . about a week later i came down with the flu really bad and kept showing up to work anyway . i was literally throwing up in the bathroom on between tables for days there . i called out once because no one would cover me and i needed to get better . i even gave them ample amount of time to motivate someone else to come in . then i went to work for a couple days again . and i was getting worse . finally it was so bad one day that i had no voice was throwing up with diarrhea , had snot continously dripping from my nose and could get my swollen eyes to stop tearing . so i called out . and the next day this bitch had me fired . they fired me . i loved that place . i loved the people i worked with . i loved the kitchen crew and the guests . i have never been so sad about leaving a job . i have also never been on bad terms with a job before either . but her awful professionalism to handle situations in a correct manner for the guests directly resulted in me losing my job .
