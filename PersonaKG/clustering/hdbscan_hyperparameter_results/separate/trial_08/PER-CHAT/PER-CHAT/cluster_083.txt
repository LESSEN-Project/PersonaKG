1. thats apples  oranges dost . your heels are a part of your style . it ' s about how you choose to project yourself to the world . it ' s totally different from standing on a stool using an external prop . i ' m not suggesting that photography is or should only be about total realism . i totally get that a photographer tweaks the space  choreographs the people in the frame to get the most aesthetic bang for buck . especially in celebrity shoots . this situation here appears different . i ' m not a betting man but if i were , i ' d bet that if the woman was significantly shorter there wouldn ' t have been a stool for her .

3. my opinion on the subject tends to piss people off to begin with  i hate it that any single group has been indoctrinated by judeo  christian hegemony and then adopts it as if it  s their own bias . african , afro  caribbean , and african americans are the unfortunate prime example , but it also extends to native and aboriginal peoples across the world . the british , spanish , dutch and french came in , installed  buggery  and  sodomy  laws which criminalized homosexuality . the european dominion of the overseas territories brought with it puritanical religion which became deeply entrenched and persisted  in most cases still persists to this day . i wouldn  t blame these communities for a second , most of them had third genders and  or never had a prohibition on homosexuality until white people told them to . and the rest is history .

4. to be fair i kind of find it interesting . being a straight furry is like being gay in the world . we ' re made fun of , some people ignore us very small minority , but still , and its very difficult to find people you can relate to . so you won ' t find solice here . it ' s the world upside down and its sometimes fun to see what would the world be with lgbt being the majority . i know it can sometimes suck , but hey , being a furry is a choice unlike race or in some cases , arguably , your attraction . you have to put up with all the bullshit , but you can quit at any time .

5. the staring . of all the things i found difficult over there , staring was one of the worst . you might think that being taught not to stare at funny  looking people is common for children around the world . nope . and what do you do when it ' s a parent and their child , staring and pointing together , like they ' re watching an orangutan at a zoo ?

6. you know that has no chance of ever happening ever and for the people that live in the real world abortion needs to always be an option .

7. what kind of world do we live in when white people cannot drive through these types of neighborhoods without being victoms of police profiling .

8. depending on how many died of the catriona , it might turn out that ciri killed more innocent people than anyone else in the books or games . i guess she kind of balanced that out by saving the world , but still .

9. so you can dish it out but not take it ? are you surprised to find that when you ' re rude , other people are rude back ? welcome to the world , sweet summer child .

10. league schedules and tradition of being a " summer festival " are trivial issues compared to real world problems . i ' m not saying qatar will be a disaster , i ' m saying the construction projects are shady . thousands of people have died , worker conditions are horrible , safety standards are poor . people are sacrificing their lives and enduring brutal labor to build the stadiums . they should host the world cup somewhere thay either has stadiums already , or at least has ethical labor laws .

11. its selfish to pity or hate yourself , for people you maybe didn  t even met yet , you gotta be grateful for what you have since lots of people all over the world lacks it
