2. well , if memories could be restored and uploaded in the new brain , that person could live some of his life back again , finishing whatever they had left before dying , or just because they have the money , and don ' t want to die yet , to learn about cultures faster and shit . like a hard drive that you can manipulate but then you can restore it as how you got it . i dunno man , i ' m pretty drunk .

3. it is not the same because as white people we have not been the victim of systematic oppression and fetishism and our worldview does not allow us to understand the experiences of people of colour because we are in a privileged position where we have not dealt with the obstacles faced by poc , so who are we to invalidate what this girl has to say ?

5. lol i know that feel came to say the same thing . it ' s like having three people try and talk to you at the same time . your trying to focus on one but you end up trying to talk to all three at once and seem like your not paying attention to any of them . it is frustrating because i come across as absent minded , like i ' m not paying attention , and i ' m not mentally present . i promise i am doing my best . it just so happens that while we are having this conversation about what is causing that memory leak i am also thinking about how 8th ed is going to affect the 40k meta , weighing the pros and cons of . digit vs 6x45 , and trying to stay on topic and not wonder how the digit people just got out of that smart car out the window .

6. the moose attack is what taught me to fear any and all large animals . probably explains why i feel so unnerved near horses  no antlers , but they could still wreck my innards in an instant .

7. society would collapse , i remember the days before netflix what a dark and desolate place the world was . we spent our meaningless lives watching tv you young ones won ' t remember those or the shiny discs we called dvds . i envy the young never having to experience those horrors

11. yta . they do have to come out . would you like everyone assuming youre a homosexual ? its got to be harder to find a mate if you keep attracting the wrong side .

12. i kinda get the feeling that if you don ' t take this advice there are going to be a lot of things in your future that you won ' t like .

13. i like to solve problems . if someone complains about something to me , i ' m ready to jump in and fix it . apparently , people enjoy the act of complaining , and me leaping in to correct the issue startles them or something . i ' ve had people even tell me , " i don ' t want your help , i just want you to listen " . it ' s really difficult for me to just let people whine .

14. oof , as a woman i suggest you not to spoil women that much , some of us get used to get all we want and then it ' s really hard to get on track again . not my case , i made clear to my boyfriend we are equal and he can count on me as much as i can count on him . i suggest you to talk to her and give her an ultimatum , you should take care of her but she ' s abusing it and not thanking what you do for her . obviously you need to change this , and don ' t have any kids for now , neither more pets or expenses . that wouldn ' t be good for the kids or you .

15. risk is a gateway drug . before you know it , you ' ll be painting warhammer pieces and wondering what you ' ve done with your life .

16. i haven ' t heard of that before . it might be you using scorestreaks while the camps need you to only use the maddox . try no scorestreaks and that might work . it sounds like the sort of thing you get in a new update .
   (ID: 420a86ecfb9d645349db591746d0cdeba4b68f37)

17. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !

18. i don  t believe he would want me to feel guilty at all , but it doesn  t stop me feeling it .
   (ID: c391065478603a686531cbdd50568136a5e14508)

19. i ' ve never been in a coma but i know someone who was , they said it was like they never slept and immediately woke up but remembered some things people had said to them
