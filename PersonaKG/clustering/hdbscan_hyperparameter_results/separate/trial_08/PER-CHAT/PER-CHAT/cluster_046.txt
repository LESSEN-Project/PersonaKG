2. well , i was ready to trash the phone . it only worked while connected to a battery pack or wall charger  and i went through that for half a year . i wouldn  t even be able to hand down the phone to my kids to play games . a cheap battery replacement was my final straw for it . and it worked out . i never opened the back to see what i got and i don  t really care tbh but my phone now works like when i first got it . thats all that mattered to me lol .
