2. it  s not offensive , never said it was . and again , i  m not against sending a message , it  s how that message is sent . my concern is that they will overdo the strong independent female personality , just for the sake of it , robbing the characters depth and transforming them into a trope . it would be as boring and lifeless as a generic male power fantasy .
