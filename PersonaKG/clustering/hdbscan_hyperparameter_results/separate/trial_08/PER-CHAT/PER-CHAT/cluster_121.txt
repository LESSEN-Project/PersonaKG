2. i am awake , and i didn  t say it was actually optimized . i said it  s  hard  to optimize because of what they have ingame . also assuming someone has some syndrome isn  t so smart .

3. hunters do not ask anyone else to adopt thier morals . hunters are not compelled to kill by tenet but by choice , there are plenty of times i ' ve sat in a blind had a few beers and never touched my bow as deer wandered by . i can say that i didn ' t even try to kill anything today when i get back to the lodge and no one will say that i ' m not longer a hunter . my bet is if you say to a group of vegans that you just a little bacon today or a bit of scrambled eggs this morning the reaction will not be as favorable .

4. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .

5. stories might be believable if you just didn  t say  and everyone clapped  then you have a potentially believable story .
