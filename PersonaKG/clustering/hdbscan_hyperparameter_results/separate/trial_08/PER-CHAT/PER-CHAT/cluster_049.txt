1. whilst browsing hentai porn as a horny teenager i was popping in and out of various categories looking for something fapworthy when i spotted ' loli ' without yahoo or altavista ' ing the term . ' pre google ' i clicked it and instantly felt sick , turned my computer off and worried for almost a week that someone was going to find it on my computer and think i was a pedophile . iirc i reinstalled windows thinking it would hide it . heh bad times .

4. there is no guarantee that this man is who he says he is . if he has bad intentions he knows when this woman is going to be home alone during the day . home invasions and burglary happen ever day . never give out personal information to strangers knocking at your door or calling you .

5. it just is daunting to me to have such a large population for a city , and i would hate to move into the " bad parts " unknowingly . it would be like someone moving to townsville and accidentally going to live in vincent . they . would . die .
