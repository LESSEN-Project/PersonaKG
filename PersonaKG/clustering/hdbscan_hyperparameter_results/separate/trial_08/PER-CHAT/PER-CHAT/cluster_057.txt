   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

8. " listen here , do you know who i am ? give me what i want or i ' ll make sure you ' re not back in this school next year " is a pretty common thing for normal parents as it is . i could only imagine it ' s worse with some celebrity parents . though that is only conjecture .

14. school textbooks in vietnam are amongst the tightest controlled , most heavily censored , and most unyielding to change of any " permitted " writing in vietnam . they are gone over with a fine  tooth comb by the party to make sure that the content fits in perfectly with their desired ends . education ' s end is to make the model citizen as they see it , to fit in with the big picture that they promulgate .
   (ID: 5b02e2fd29e743c4c80de2b0919a03d95400c23a)

   (ID: 199ca187d50b43aebb52968a5525289cb65a1520)

18. after reading some of the comments ive come to realise people find some of the magic eyes difficult . i assumed you could either see them or you couldn ' t . although this image is quite shallow in depth it resolves itself just as easily as any other . not entirely sure what point i ' m trying to make only that it was an eye opener so to speak
   (ID: e982e025c0604997a6e2072eb87b9bb01bed38ae)

19. you know how you can turn this into something valuable rather than a tifu , op ? make sure it never happens again . make sure that next time you are in that situation , you remember how you felt today , how you were so annoyed at yourself you had to come vent at reddit . remember how much of a fool you feel right now , and be sure that even the most brutal rejection will be easier to deal with than this . because at least you will have tried . faint heart never won fair maid , and fortune favours the bold . so be bold . don ' t ever again be the guy who posts his failure on reddit .
   (ID: 59ebeb8d8fee755bce043a6482743bde8a2a0bb1)

20. i always wonder if my cptsd triggered my pain in the beginning . my inability to cope with anything remotely stressful whilst not dealing with past traumas maybe made my brain resort to this to get my attention and make me slow down  stop so i can recover . but then i read about how long many of you have suffered and i  m not so sure how much of it is related to my original mental health issues . it  s all a bit of a mess really , isn  t it ?
