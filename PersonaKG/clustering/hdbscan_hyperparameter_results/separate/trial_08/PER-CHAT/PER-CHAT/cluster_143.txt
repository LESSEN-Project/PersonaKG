   (ID: 73e90e443642babe17d8b9523bc123bb79b21e79)

2. okay but what about men who sleep around ? it  s fine to think this as long as you hold men to the same standard

5. at first i was thinking why would you put him in that situation , that can ' t be safe . after watching his reaction i ' m think what a judgemental prick i am . that was awesome to watch .

7. i think my voice is decent , but i can ' t bring myself to sing in front of anyone . lol
   (ID: de5db66359e6314e9bac24fd9a10ec1d49584c4f)

8. why do you think that , is what i am asking .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

9. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .

10. what ? i think you and the rest of your team have been smoking too many blunts .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

11. no , it had them stay in the neverzone during running with scissors , marco dies in the neverzone but star brings him back to earth , which somehow brings them back to earth . i think it was on fanfiction . net or ao3

12. it  s funny to me that there  s this obvious disparity in quality of plastic surgeons . we think of doctors as infallible gods of science and trust them with our lives . but then you see some of these obvious tit jobs and you have to stop and think , do they deserve our unquestioning trust ?
   (ID: cb8cb80756996949fe8fa5c308bb091367a0c6ff)

13. i think he has grenades in the situation ?
   (ID: 6b2e7201275c9aa1dcb6d1b24840765a41796c3d)

14. but you  re insane to think that hitting your hand with a hammer the first , tenth , or even a hundred times will not hurt . it  s mental illness making you think there has to be a secret number of how many times you can hit your hand until it doesn  t hurt anymore
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

15. i think it  s a sin
   (ID: 3418702de52d65ee261943b207996da3e2569fd2)

16. depends on what they think i ' m gonna eat .
   (ID: de5db66359e6314e9bac24fd9a10ec1d49584c4f)

17. maybe . it depends on the response of the members . what do you think ?
   (ID: ac53f9ce173965984299f3686335a39bc2a5810f)

18. i can confirm this is true . but for me it  s anytime i even think of her .
   (ID: 34784a4c9eca2e43db08bf9f548798a984337741)

19. disagree  i think if there is profit to be made then digging in old landfills , dredging the ocean or mining asteroids in space  these elements will be recycled and re  purposed .
   (ID: 30506e41c4121e1e7573a25d4985de191de679c9)

20. do you think it would help with any pain he ' s having though ?
