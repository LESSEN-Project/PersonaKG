1. what you have to realize is when you do something to  get back  at someone your fucking over more then just that person it  s everyone who works there and everyone who uses the company services but if you wanna be a tool you can go right ahead i just think it is childish .

5. nta but i think this conversation needs to be with your father in law . the reason why she continues to take advantage of him is because she can and he allows it . i totally understand your frustration and if you were going to approach your sil , maybe just mention what your fil said . see her reaction .

8. i loved the musical numbers . although i think billy crystal ' s opening montages were hilarious , the theme for this year ' s oscars was a tribute to musical theater so it just made sense to have that opening and the dance sequence .

9. just watching the one card and it ' s got me thinking , what do you think the optimal cage shape is for mma ? or does it not matter as long as it is the right size and there is no sharp corners ?

16. surely there are other avenues to take this information . you reported it to the police department of which luke murray is assigned ? nothing seems to have been done ? take it to another department , go get legal advice , take it to a lawyer , any of these options are better than posting it on reddit , and if this turns out to be a false report then you are committing an act of defamation . i ' m not doubting your honesty , just think you should find another means of having the law look at this accusation .

17. just when you think it ' s gone you hear the eeeeeee .
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

18. i ' m actually still just on the side of liking it , but it ' s getting tougher . gaping plot holes , uninteresting storylines , painful characters , terrible dialogue , such poor consistency of any in  universe tech that i have to call most of the sci  fi elements one big continuity error . and that ' s not limited to the newer films . just started watching the original trilogy after tlj , and think i have to accept they ' re just sci  fi films for kids . i think they have some really great core concepts to work with , but then the actual stories that are told in the setting get ruined by the issues above .

19. why should you panic if there is nothing to lose . youre not playing in the katowice grandfinal . just try your best and if you fail , think . about what you could have done . better in that situation . you learn by mistakes
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

20. no i think that  s what i  m gonna do . i was just asking for possibilities on what the hell it could be
