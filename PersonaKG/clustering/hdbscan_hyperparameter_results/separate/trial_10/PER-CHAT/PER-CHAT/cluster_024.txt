1. just takes practice , i just drawn a lot in my free time as a kid and now its kinda stuck with me
   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

2. harassment is bad , but i admire your harassers commitment . he must have so much time on his hands . encryptions aren ' t impossible to crack , however it just takes so much time that it ' s more ideal to bypass them using other means .   x200b  also are you sure your friend isn ' t just harassing you for kicks ? i mean . a single conversation of you and your friend and no one else just that app seems weird .

3. any other event  well , let ' s just empty my ap . lottery events  life ? nobody got the time for that !

4. well no . not all the time . in fact that ' s important that it isn ' t all the time . it makes those brain  gasms so much more special . it ' s important to never take your brain  cum for granted . this was supposed to be inspirational but it just got weird .

5. i believe that there ' s a percentage of claims denied that you need to stay above or your job is on the line , if you just said yes to everyone ' s claim you ' d be out on your ass in no time .

6. if it was more than one , every moment with my dad when i was little . if it was just one , it would be meeting my s . o for the first time .
   (ID: 8e04d9ff8cb4775dcd9beaa83d8499ec17c7bc83)

7. trust me , next time , just go for the kill . i learned the hard way that messing around can often get you killed . at lease , that how it is for me .
   (ID: d28197335e7305577b59f952af257f553cab06d9)

8. nothing fancy honestly . whatever ' s handy at the time . just regular glue works fine if you use the correct amount .
   (ID: db2795e3479f3abf3fd16c22a2bea9450ad82357)

9. thanks . this actually makes sense to me . we actually leave ours out all the time and it just confused me why if we never wrap the chord up it gets messy
   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

10. they  re wrong and so are you , because there literally is not a correct answer . sorry if what i said stung , but i hear it all the time from fans who obsess over it instead of just enjoying the show .
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

11. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .

12. i just read it for the first time too . i showed my husband the picture of the outside of the boa eating an elephant and covered the words asked him what he thought it was . he said a snake or a camel . i found the perfect man

13. i believe it gives you a little bit more time as you still have enough time to walk under them before your timer is up and you can log out , and they would have to pathfind to you which takes longer than someone standing beside you . although i guess you could just barrage them and run while logging , i dunno .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

14. i hear you everyone  s different , to an extent , but yh probably was psychosis but you was young at the time so it was probably just that
   (ID: 7dfa169bdfe2df7e214baa35fc2f2b73cbb10c46)

15. at least you can play it . every time i join an ongoing match , my screen just stays black , i can hear everything , i can move , can shoot but i can ' t see anything . but yeah , the introduction is kind of " lagged " .
   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

16. so what do i do next , do i just kinda ask again some other time ?
   (ID: 5ad91cf15026f9d604e90af77be91ab4f6b7289a)

17. i love all your cosplay . hoping that zelda cosplay is in the works but every time you post and your are just yourself , you have this amazing glow that is beyond attractive . it touches my soul and is just a huge turn on .
   (ID: ac0e0bfdedf04bf5199d4337ba10a43f13e1e49c)

18. lol yeah , i enjoy myself also . it  s just that sense of dread of something going wrong . best i could describe it is being young and with your peers at the time .
   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

19. same here . if i could just take the courses i need for my major and minor , everything would be fine . unfortunately , i have to take a bunch of courses that aren ' t worth my time and money .
   (ID: 8dc7a300c762f2c528a6f2993d152d50f9fcc702)

20. i legit do this if something doesn  t scan 5th  6th time i  m holding on to it and not putting it in the baggage area and then just put it in the bag when i walk out
