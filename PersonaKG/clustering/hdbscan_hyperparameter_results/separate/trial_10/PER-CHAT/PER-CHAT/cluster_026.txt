1. yea it sounds like you care about her . as long as she isn ' t fat that is . good luck with everything . i hope you realize how to love somebody for who they are on the inside and not worry so much about what ' s on the outside .

2. i find that pre thinking does me a lot of good in that type of situation . having a course of action plotted , like " go for a walk " for when my brain reverts to purely reptillian type responses is invaluable .

3. she treated me like a good friend . that ' s it .

4. that ' s pretty good , could it be a scanner colour matching issue then if you ' re able to correct it like that ?

5. my first shot , they took a moderate amount of work with having to slice up the huge piece of skin i bought and having to cook them in the oven , then fry them . they are more like cracklins than puffy pork rinds , but i sprinkled some cajun seasoning over them and they taste pretty good

6. looks like a good phone . why do you have both lite apps ? i guess you might not be using them so much .
   (ID: 4dd03f320502247ea725348e21fe67168d7cf5f1)

7. this life by denzel is pretty good . i can suggest more if you like it . you should check out his  imperial  album
   (ID: d1e6050d6d7638f6662249831925c3a9185f210b)

8. obviously great depends on your definition of great . if you like social programs and high life satisfaction levels , you have scandinavia . if you like crushing everyone else with money , media , and military might then america is pretty good .

9. that sounds like a good reason for them to avoid water .
   (ID: acecdec2f65b894e4aeb0b0d8b7a744c44568aef)

10. i like keeping a good girl .
   (ID: 3fb7fd62eac31dd8823db2c71d8359cdbbbe3399)

11. omg u guys are so dumb obviously no one has ever said this to you so stop making  memes  and go get a real job like go on tumblr or something that  s a good website guys it  s obviously a joke . edit

12. was king kong any good ? my parents would like to see it next year on my birthday because of that universal studios ride , but i  m kind of skeptical of watching a musical starring a giant puppet
   (ID: ded51a42964a203363b0abca3e5be0d03ef95ffa)

13. yeah if the case cover is off i would suspect bad contact of the cooler to the cpu . with a good aftermarket cooler you shouldn  t be seeing temps like that .
   (ID: e7516540d2045135f43a4a7c61f0bd88856c8ff4)

14. answering this seems like a good way to go to jail !
   (ID: 1cb49ecc2e4fdb9752d9ca12d02f3cfc2f6659c9)

15. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .

16. well , maybe use the fear of failing and getting left behind as motivation ? or if doing something physically like working out , anger is good .
   (ID: 2608313794dc26cc5adf438bd6602e11da2cd151)

17. like everything good in life it will be worth the wait ! youll catch one i can see it , what is day or two of wait ?
   (ID: dd50b301fbfd713e92cffecd0a18fa135e6d75d3)

18. if you choose to do cookies for your goodies , i ' d suggest you keep it super simple and classic   like good old fashioned chocolate chip .
   (ID: bd723644638296cdfc92c932fca8a0e0d4cc9f7f)

19. you proved my point . you have no reason to hate america  americans . we have good terms with nz and you haven  t lived here , meaning you have no clue what it is like .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

20. i like how the stars on the boats represents how many seasons they played . good job !
