1. hey , i know there ' s a thousand other comments on here , but just wanted to say real quick that you didn ' t do anything wrong . dude sounds like a hassle to say the least , and anyone who is willing to flip on you and humiliate you online is not someone you should be wasting your time with . that ' s some immature , disrespectful , petty shit . it seems like you feel guilty to an extent , which i understand , but don ' t linger on the guilt . once it passes you ' ll realize you did yourself a favor by setting some standards of what you will and won ' t put up with . lots of people choose to stay unhappy in their relationships and that is an unhealthy way to live .

6. they aren ' t demanding anything of you . it ' s there for the taking , or you can leave it alone . you actually can choose to not bother with it , you know . it ' s like folks that hate poe that still constantly waste time in it . like , ya ' ll don ' t need to go into that crapfest .

7. you ' re saying that in order to come up with the simplest possible code of morals , throw out everyone ' s and just look at santa ' s views of right and wrong , from his time frame in his own eyes , only what he sees . alright . unfortunately , good and bad still don ' t exist . you can ' t pin down that concept . you ' re still looking at a code where the boundaries have been drawn essentially arbitrarily . if he has some book of law that dictates what is good and places everyone somewhere on a given spectrum , wherever the middle falls would still be up to him . this is partially why our legal system has the court system , to deal with those grey areas , someone a judge sits down and just makes a decision , coloring in the grey area and more precisely defining the middle . at the end of the day , it comes down to santa making a decision based on whatever is going through his head at the time .

9. i ' d ask why would you build a wall ? do a travel ban instead . it ' d work so much better at reducing illegal immegration . go learn about what you want to change in day  to  day life before posing a solution .

10. would definitely recommend they try to start and keep a fire going . big stones spelling sos ? it works occasionally . some lonely fuck on a beach waving there arms ? not very effective . but smoke ? that ' s the way to do it .

11. god  fucking  damn . this was sex . i feel like this is dice telling the world , " we out here . all y ' all still bitching about microtransactions have no idea what you ' re missing " this is bf2 ' s second wind . let the battle begin !

13. sounds like you ' ve had some pretty awful experiences . i ' m sorry i wouldn ' t say every time you think or feel something it ' s the truth though , people have issues with trust stemming from nothing real all the time

14. i agree . once the achievement hunters get their aps , everything will be back to somewhat normal .  the only real bad thing about leagues so far are the pve commanders . yeah , there ' s a ton of them  but on the flipside , they probably really want to help . it just so happens they get overwhelmed with all the things they need to do . they may have been used to running with their guild then decided to try it out on the server . i once commanded our guild run in wvw and it ' s really different when you ' re working with your guild and when you have pugs with you . with your guild , you know what they are capable of so you always know what to tell them . with pugs , there are a lot of probabilities with them  are they upleveled ? because they might not survive the first clash . are they here just for the karma  xp  loot ? then they won ' t follow instructions if you tell them to " stack " , " blast statics  might " , and so on and so forth because they would be like , " whatever man let ' s get this over with "

19. i ' ve had similar dreams for about six months now . it ' s like earth but everyone is preparing for the end of the world . random towns get bombed , regularly so people don ' t stay in one place for more than a few hours . i get a job for an hour , get paid instantly and have to start running . public transport is free and arrives every digit minutes . i get off at a random stop , race to a building and claim it as mine . every room is filled with beds , lines and lines of empty beds . i defend the house , get some sleep , wake up and start moving to the next location . a lot of times it just a bus or train , other times i have to move countries . we ' re all just waiting for our time to be raptured .
