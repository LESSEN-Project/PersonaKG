13. it takes me a few minutes to really focus on my text book , so it helps when i ' m in a quiet place , maybe with a candle or something that calms me down . for some reason studying scares me  like i won ' t be able to comprehend the material , or i ' m reading the wrong things , so anything that helps me relax i try . for that reason i don ' t like studying in a public place . music helps too but sometimes i get distracted by the words .

18. what past films are you talking about ? the only ones we had were superman and batman , and out side of those they were pretty much one offs . so the modern age of superhero film is still pretty new . if you don ' t like it , it ' s not out of nostalgia but rather your own preferences .
