5. behavior data analyst with kids on the autism spectrum . on the whole , i found i no longer agreed with applied behavioral analysis the way i thought i did . we never bothered to find out the reason why the kids were doing things outside of broad reasons , and we just extinguished the behavior . it just felt very . inhumane , a lot of what we did .

9. am i missing something here ? you love your boyfriend but hard hanging out alone in your room with a drunk guy who tried to kiss you . you stop him and clarify that this is a no go and you love your bf . perfect . but then you have him spoon with you all night as a comfort to you ? that makes no sense . but whatever . if it is eating you up inside and you really truly did not do anything , you should tell him . i mean why not  particularly since there is no longer contact with the mf .
