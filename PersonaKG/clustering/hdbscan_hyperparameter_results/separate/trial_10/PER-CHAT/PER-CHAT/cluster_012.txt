3. i wasn ' t familiar with the supermarket incident . i know there was a fat soldier or marine please excuse my memory of which , carrying his in a mall , but he had notified the police before hand . it is similar to westboro baptist church , just because you have a right to do something , doesn ' t mean it should be done .

5. i know they are different , i just didn ' t know if they are different versions of the flash or something . for example you can buy ' the flash ' pops from the tv show . you know this because the logo at the top of the box reflects this . i didn ' t know if one of these flash pops in the picture are from dc universe online or something . i cannot find any info on the reason for the change in logo to just release the same pop , with a slightly different costume .

18. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else
