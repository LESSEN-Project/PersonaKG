14. i ' m responding to this   if you told one lie in your life is it fair to describe you as a liar ? i ' m saying , not your whole life . but if you ' ve told a lie in the past week , i would describe you as a liar . there ' s a period of time somewhere between a week and a lifetime that it should be forgiven .
   (ID: c978d968d1c4e9730afc6b7b09cbdd832546a06f)

16. like anything else in life  " if you ' re unhappy with something in your life you can either complain about it and not do anything about it or you can decide to be in charge and make a change "

   (ID: 88279b92dca36b3b3c236d960135a2afe2e68b33)

20. i didn ' t necessarily ' disappear ' but i moved several times until i was unknown by anyone in my ' new ' life . on the occasions i ' ve been passing through places my old life existed it was strange to see that actually very little had changed . if cloning could be done , i ' d probably replace myself in this life with a clone and go again . but hey ho .
