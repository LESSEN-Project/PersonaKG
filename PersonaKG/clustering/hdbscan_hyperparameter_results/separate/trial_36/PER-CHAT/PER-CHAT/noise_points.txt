3. idk if i  ve had this problem but it sounds extremely similar . this is what i did  what it sounds like to me is that you constantly have judgements hanging over you . it sounds bad too if it  s everything you say or do and i  ve been there . think , is it your thoughts or is it just thoughts you think other people are having ? if it  s the second one , relax . it  s better if you think about nothing or what  s going on during your day or whatever . just don  t think about what other people might think of you because that is going to affect every single one of your actions . i hope i somewhat helped .

4. i would say that has some truth to it . shows and movies are getting more realistic and we realize that life doesn  t always have a happy ending but there  s still a story to be told . if look back to  50s   80s , almost every movie that depicts the future was very vibrant and colorful and everyone was happy . but in today  s cinema every time we see the future on screen it  s dark and dismal and destroyed . something to think about

7. the only thing i ' m scared about is my parents taking me to the hospital for my thoughts but after reading this has made me think " isn ' t it better for someone to take you there for thoughts rather than an attempt .

10. i  m sober too and sometimes say politely  i  m sober  when someone offers me a drink and i  m trying to head off or end a conversation about why i don  t want a drink  prevent a future offer . sometimes people don  t take  no thank you , i don  t drink .  as a full answer without follow up questions which i may not be opening to answering . i  ve had many first dates where i  ve had to say i  m a recovering alcoholic to get people to stop questioning me about why i don  t drink . for the record i  m not saying op was going to question her thusly or that the coworker was polite , but , just that  i  m sober  can have a more valid , less self righteous context versus a simple  no , thank you .  .

11. where did you get that ? i need that in my life .
   (ID: b4d61ff0c23f7ce5512ee9f64d1bea0f938f262a)

12. i feel the same way at christmas when the family is opening presents . seeing my kids and grandchildren laughing and really enjoying each others company is the best feeling i can get .

13. i don  t think people understand this . it  s important to know life is gonna change nothing will ever he permanent , idc what you say it will never be , so people need to learn how to push through tough times . mourning for a few days is good but you have to start grasping yourself after that as if not you will never learn to accept what happened and move on to a extent where it doesn  t affect your day to day living , i can say what a joke i was at digit i was so fucked up that i just coped with my friend being in coma with getting more fucked up . but idk how i would feel if she never woke up or etc , . , . i probably would not be talking to you rn if she hadn  t as i would never did a digit and just killed myself

15. you ' re really going to argue that an digit year old and a digit year old are at the same level of development ? when you say " development " do you mean physically , mentally or something else ?

16. i don ' t give a fuck what you read or if you read , you ' re a fucking adult , you ' re not my problem . unless you fuck up my life and force me to suffer the consequences of your bullshit .

17. when my stomach hurts on acid , it ' s because something is bothering me and i either haven ' t identified or have chosen to ignore it this approach doesn ' t work . i ' ve found that when i think through what ' s bothering me , most negative physical side effects go away . your issue could just be ibs , though .

19. i ' ve done photography for digit  years and have lost count of how many times people have asked me to make them look thinner or cover up things they perceive as flaws . my rule is i only remove temporary things like pimples or cold sores . we can work with posing and lighting to highlight your best bits and draw attention away from parts you aren ' t comfortable with . but i ' ve always said to people i photograph  " we ' re going to make you look awesome and aren ' t going to tell any lies . yes , retouchers are just doing what they are being told , but i ' d quit a job where i was asked to do things like this . if you choose to be ethical , you are choosing to not have a bunch of jobs .

20. first  didn ' t have my first boyfriend  relationship til i was digit . i was like digit . digit  sure i was terminally single for life , i couldn ' t get a date even when i lost 100lbs thinking weight was my issue . second  if you like the guy  is the conversation a . awkward on you part because you ' re shy or b . awkward on your part because neither of you actually have anything in common to talk about ? i like to play a game when first talking to new guys  twenty questions . not the fav coloufav food type of shit , but the stuff i really wanna know  ex . if you could have a concert w  any digit performers dead or alive , broken up or together , who would you pick ? if you were having a dinner party with any digit people dead or alive , famous or not , real or a character in a movie or book  who would you pick and why ? what would you serve ? pick obscure questions . get a feel . get lost in a topic when you hit something you both have in common and steer the convo into that . he picked alexisonfire ? well fuck you love aof and a show is coming up , maybe you guys should put that on for the future . he served a craft beer ! well shit maybe you just happen to love craft beer . discuss . he served duck ? you duck hunt . or you hate duck . or you know the best place for duck you both should try . discuss . he had a hockey player come to dinner ? a writer you love ? share your passions and the convo should flow . if it gets dull  time for one of you to take the next turn on asking
