4. i just try to play how i  ve been playing the whole game , i usually rush and play aggressive so thats how i try to play in the end , changing up your play style to camp towards the end allows for you to get nervous and lose your touch . playing aggressive lets skill decide the winner not luck like camping

6. was showing a couple of my buddies the game yesterday and actually had two great matches , an escape without getting hooked and then all four survivors killed , and both times the post game chat got flooded with toxicity , to the point where one of my friends looked uncomfortable to take a stab at playing the game after i ' m here from overwatch because the toxicity there is disgusting , but sometimes here it gets pretty overbearing too . ' it sure scrapping the chat is the right idea but it would be nice if maybe after enough reports of toxic chat were verified , a player could be like shadow muted ? they think they ' re sending their bm to all players but it ' s not being sent ?

11. overwatch . the game currently has too many ways to stop a player from playing  stunlock and all that . took a while for me to realize what it was about the game that was making me so angry , but i haven ' t been back since . sometimes i kinda miss it and want to go back , but then i see a play of the game or highlight that involves so much stunlock it hurts , and i decide not to .
