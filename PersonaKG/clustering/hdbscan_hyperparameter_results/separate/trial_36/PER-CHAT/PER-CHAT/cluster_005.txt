1. why do we feel ? why do we see things the way we do ? is this all made up ? was it made up by me or by someone else bc they felt bad ?
   (ID: c50479206ad2428ecdc02592a82261c4f2ae30a5)

2. i feel like it depends what you use it for ? if you use it just for fun and  or as a little treat for yourself , then no . but if you ' re using it as an escape from shit like " negative emotions , " then you might . i was always told to be responsible with pot and that it ' s best not to resort to using it if i ' m having a bad day . because then the day might come where you ' re having a really bad day , and you try to find your pot , only to find that you ' re out ! you ' d have no idea how to then cope with your emotions and would be , in essence , " addicted " to it . honestly , i feel that the only exception to not using pot to deal with your emotions would be if a doctor prescribed it to you for that reason .

6. i feel like that might have to do with the quality  nachos arent a gourmet food , but i feel like if you were to try making them at home the meat would certainly be better than most anywhere that serves nachos stadiums , arenas if you still enjoy soggy , meatless nachos after accounting for ingredients . then thats cool , healthier too

13. it ' s awkward because after the breakup , it is always weird to celebrate your own birthday by yourself , especially if that person was toxic or abusive . i just haven ' t celebrated my birthday in years because i feel like i ' m celebrating their birthday instead of mine . in the moment it was awkward too . when it ' s your birthday you get special treatment from friends and family . when it ' s someone else ' s as well , it sort of makes you feel like you ' re not unique or special in any way .
