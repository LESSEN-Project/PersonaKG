9. i think the article is bit misleading because a lot of people that i know have not replaced watching tv for different hobbies . i think people have switched to watching videos online as part of netflix , hulu plus , and bitorrent which is illegal . also , people use dvrs now and watch tv at later dates . the nielsen ratings do not capture these statistics and therefore , they are understating how many people are actually watching broadcast or cable tv .
