1. esh unpopular opinion but there ' s nothing brave or special about coming out as asexual . she sounds like an insufferable person but at the same time you say " you were only sitting there to get closer to your crush " and implied that her asexuality doesn ' t matter to you because you ' re not interested in banging her anyways .

5. how do i tell a guy who thinks things are going well that i just want to be friends without hurting their feelings or making them hate me ? " hey , x , i ' m only interested in being friends " that ' s all you have to do . if a dude doesn ' t respect that and back off , or if they start resenting you , they were never your friend to begin with and you ' re better off without them . " leading them on " implies you ' re doing that intentionally to get something out of it . obviously that ' s not the case , so you really aren ' t doing anything wrong here . you ' re not obligated to give people a chance romantically , and if you aren ' t into them , it ' s arguably worse to tell them you ' re interested in them romantically when you aren ' t . if you aren ' t compatible and you know you ' re not interested , don ' t go down that path . however they react is on them , and if they get shitty with you for saying that you ' d rather be friends , they were a shit friend because they never actually intended to be your friend .   x200b

19. it  s hard to say without knowing what kind of relationship you have with your boss and how the question was delivered . on the optimistic side , perhaps he or she is genuinely interested in understanding how you like your job so improvements can be made . if you  re paranoid and  or pessimistic , you could be left wondering if it  s a subtle , passive aggressive attempt to threaten you so you work harder .
