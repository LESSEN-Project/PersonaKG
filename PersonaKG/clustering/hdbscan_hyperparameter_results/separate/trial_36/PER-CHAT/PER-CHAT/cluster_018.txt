1. i know a girl who politely sat through a date where the guy wouldn ' t stop talking about all the ways africa could be " fixed . he ' d never been there , but he was taking a really interesting sociology course and figured she ' d want to hear the entire thing . when he finally stopped for long enough that she could get a word in , she had this inner argument running  should i tell him i lived in nigeria for four years and that he ' s full of shit thus inviting further " conversation " , or should i tell him that ' s fascinating and ride it out to the end ? she rode it out to the end . there was no second date . i think you should tell the story of this date . it sounds entertaining for us .
