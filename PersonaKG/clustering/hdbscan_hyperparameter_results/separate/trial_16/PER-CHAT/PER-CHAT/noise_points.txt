7. i gave all four a fair chance , and i didn ' t really dislike any of them , but to use any of them as an example of digit being a great year for music is a pretty big leap . i mean , this is the internet and we are a bunch of strangers , so who cares about what we think ? but , irl , i think it would be better to approach this conversation a little differently . " i ' m really into these cool new acts . they aren ' t popular , and most people might not be into them , but there ' s something about them that i really like . if you ' re interested in hearing some new stuff , check it out . " is waaaaay more realistic than " what a great year for music . " it wasn ' t a great year for music . it was possibly one of the worst ever , so how you present yourself will completely change how seriously people you know will take you . i ' m not trying to sour you on what you love . enjoy it . get lost in the moment . go to a live concert and absorb it for what it is , but try not to oversell it . just my opinion , but i think that people will respect you for it . i love music too , and when i hear something i love , i want to share it with everyone , and i want them to feel the way that i do about it too , but one thing that i had to learn is that people don ' t always appreciate what i love , and it ' s good to tone it down a bit .

8. hi there . joseph here , i ' m the owner of python discord .   x200b  looks like you ' ve hit our defcon filter . we enable this to disable joining of new accounts after a raid or some event similar to this . we disable joins for members with accounts which are under a certain number of days old but as soon as you are past this threshold you can join fine .   x200b  until your account is over the threshold there is no way to join the server right now , but we don ' t keep the filter on for too long because we don ' t like denying entry to people with no malicious intent .   x200b  sorry for any inconvenience caused .

9. start by not giving a shit about what other people think of you . do what you need to do for yourself . learn to say " no " more often without the repercussions of other people ' s feelings . the rest will come naturally .

12. the is is a good answer . the words really just very broadly define what they do . when it comes to implementing these things , it  s a huge variety that  s hard to really categorize .
