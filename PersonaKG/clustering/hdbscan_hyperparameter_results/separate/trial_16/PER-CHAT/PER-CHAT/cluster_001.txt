11. first things first , i should really say it looks more like a digit than a a320 , but even so its not a scale to a digit . the main thing that would make me say its a digit more than any other aircraft is the nose . if you look at the below image you will see what i mean . the aircraft on top is a digit and the bottom is an a320 .

14. wut ? that makes no sense . what hp are you making ? what suspension are you running ? what wheel size ? so many questions that need to be answered before telling you what tires to get . with driver mod you can do whatever you want , no matter what tires you get .
   (ID: b00d56612ead91f05aac8db48a48c30d7422809c)

15. ok im out of the house atm so i can check the torchics when i get back , what nature would you lile the torchic ? also could i take the miltank or is it too high of value ?

18. you are now already out that  digit you transferrred , be prepared to pay that back to your bank . the best thing you ' ve done is to get on here and ask . this is a total scam .
   (ID: 20ee46767f4f96df6795d9b93f6c4c7be9a56261)

19. chi brew is better for single target  with serenity , and eventually when you get digit  set and a higher ilvl and class trinket let ' s say average digit  you ' ll want to run chi explosion  ascension for multi and single , as it just gets easier to manage with very little difference in dps . i might be wrong about the last bit as its been a while since i ' ve gone and played ww , mostly brm at the moment . the most important thing to remember is that this is a game , and   you have to play it my way or not at all   personal preference takes precedence over min  maxing unless you prefer to min  max and like doing as well as you possibly can .
   (ID: 2e464b2732570f16afced14ab79d30fa92622627)

20. use the wa as much as possible , i did an uchi playthrough and i ended up using it until i got onikiri and ubadachi , the wa will do significant damage as long as you keep dex up and plus it up . also , if you  re running a dexterity build which i assume you are infuse the uchi with a sharp gem and it  ll scale with your dexterity better
