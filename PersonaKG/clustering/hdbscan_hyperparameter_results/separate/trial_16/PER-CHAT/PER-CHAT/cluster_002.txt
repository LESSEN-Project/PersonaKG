1. q  what  s missing ? a  if nothing wrong took place , then why don  t we waive privilege on the whole issue and let those who have something to say on it speak their minds and share their stories ?     that ' s exactly what most canadians are saying . the fact that trudeau hides behind privilege tells us that something criminal has occurred .

2. what the hell does ' the weak ' have anything to do with it ?
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

3. my opinion is that trump is doing nothing to prevent it . he ' s just kinda pushing them over the edge more and more .

4. that ' s not what i was getting at . i am trying to say that why do you think you have the right to lecture a person on their health ? do you actually care if they develop some kind disease ? you just think they would look nicer with less weight and you can simply say that instead of mentioning health . do you go around telling people to stop smoking because it ' s bad for their health ? as if they don ' t know that ? do you actually care ? i honestly don ' t care if someone smokes alot if they are not my family . just like i honestly do not care and won ' t comment on someone else weight and health issues .

5. you have only proven that you do not know what you are saying regarding this subject . may you never know what it  s like to be forced to fight a war or be put in a cage . are you a brit ? still mad about the american revolution ? imperialist twat , how funny .

6. it  s the internet my dude , you aren  t going to change the minds of people who think they  re right . all you can do is flawlessly which is an unfortunate aspect of talking to people on the internet present your counter argument and hope some people are willing to look at things objectively . maybe you  ll convince one person . just present your sources and hope for the best . the biggest thing is to never take the arrows too seriously , it  ll just make you angry because reddit has a mob mentality against anything contrary to the accepted opinion of the day .

7. omg . murder and war are just examples of the flexibility of human morals . i knew some idiot would get wrapped around the axle over some inconsequential minutia and miss my point . it was simplistic to make a point . morality is completely relative based . mistakes are made when i apply my morals to your situation . fuck , people , get out of the fucking weeds . op wasn ' t asking about specific moral issues just morality in general . goddammit .

8. the president does indeed have an impact on the markets , both positive and negative . anyone who says otherwise is not basing their words on fact .
   (ID: 73a501f273781aa2c0deb878ecb02dcab3a9d4d3)

9. so it ' s okay to take people ' s rights away as long as they don ' t get angry about it . i am learning so many things today . thank you . you ' ve explained something to me that i didn ' t understand until now .

10. i don ' t think most are brainwashed , i think most are scared to speak up against their government . edit  if the government would have treated then right , and let them have a lot material things and would have taken good care of them , then it would have been difficult to to deal with them . from what i understand , news reports coming from that area , is that theya re living in poverty . not too long ago there was a video going around of reddit of a digit year old girl who was starving to death .

11. okay , a reason . your comment is intellectually base and not worthy of debate . how ' s that ? now goodnight my precious troll .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

12. you probably don ' t have a clue what it entails . calling one out for stupidity while the biggotry and sjw ethics almost drips down your comment . not knowing what mgtow entails , but still judging upon it . do you get triggered by your own stupidity too ? or only when you think you can respond to it . i didn ' t call you sjw , though your reasoning and choice of words indicate you are , a raging one at that . so , if you wanna argue about these topics , start to learn how to read and understand . idiot . you know these subs are regularly vacated by raging sjw ' s that can ' t accept that people disagree right ? pretty much what you are doing .

13. oh , i still say israel shouldn ' t . but you wanted a answer from the left so i gave you one . me being from the right doesn ' t mean i ' m unable to give a left answer .

14. i  ll answer it , and of course get down voted do to such an unpopular opinion . the slippery slope argument can literally apply to any law regardless of political agreement . giving states the right to govern their own is part of what can happen and in all fairness should . washington and colorado legalizing weed could go down a slippery slope with conservatives saying ,  well why not legalize all drugs or take way the drinking age ?  a line has to be drawn somewhere . also pregnancy test are digit  accurate and can work within a few weeks after conception . not saying this will be an answer to all but digit weeks is plenty of time for most to make the choice . it  s a heart beat , it  s movement , it  s no longer a cell it  s alive .

15. i  m not saying . i agree . the question being the magnitude of the offense . i myself have family that actually work on the show via union chicago teamsters so it  s not in their benefit that it gets cancelled . however , it begs the question  isn  t it strange how this guy creates an entire scenario that  s fabricated from the start albeit he quickly lost control of it and the show is not being affected ? yet , rosanne for comparison affects all the actors and crew just from a remark ? a verbal statement that cost no one nothing aside from those that decided to give her to time of day . not sure why i  m being downvoted  i asked if there was more information and all i got was  ummmmm  and  uh  s  and answering questions with questions . there  s no useful information with that .

16. why are you so stupid ? is it because i ask you to shut the fuck up while you are being condescending towards someone ?
   (ID: 0b3478daa0c3ecb398dde7764084e605d476d0ad)

17. i dont see how my attitude is hateful . ive never said that i hate all incels or thought of them less than anyone else . ive only said that they sometimes have radical ideas . how could you possibly know what i want ?
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

18. not commenting and commenting are the same thing . you imbecile . you fucking moron .
   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

19. okay , you ' re trolling . you got me . i give up .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

20. and by taking these other people into consideration you make a problem where no problem was . let them be what they want , not victims .
