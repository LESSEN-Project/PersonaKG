Total from this dataset: 440

1. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .

2. what ' s the rush ? first dates are about getting to know each other . don ' t force yourself on her  she will let you know when she is receptive . she is more interested initially in finding out if the two of you can be friends .

3. bad break up ? if so you got to let it go . if not , then go outside and explore somewhere where people are accepting , like a sports bar or social clubs or something where you can add to peoples conversations

5. hey man thanks for taking the time to do that . looks great .
   (ID: cbfa1583c81154d2d46853ff6ca36ad6b01a3e0e)

6. your dad sent his flying monkey when he saw you were slipping from his grasp . treat the flying monkey like you would a narc . even less , i  d say , because this is no way their business and between you and your dad . nothing requires you to even speak with this person . you don  t even have to acknowledge them . because of this was so important , shouldn  t your dad say these things himself ? stay strong .

7. i can ' t tell you how long it will last , but i can tell you that most likely you will not get burned like that again because you won ' t love unconditionally like that again . at least i didn ' t . it is actually kind of refreshing to know that i am now the one that is emotionally in control of my relationships now .

8. i ' m sorry about your struggle with depression . i have had the same struggle and can empathize , suicidal thoughts included . the comment she made was terrible and i ' m sure it stung extra hard in that moment in particular . but maybe try and see it from her side too . she had a terrible day with bil i know how much stress this kind of situation can be because i was a drug addict and it hurts everyone and puts a lot on others close to you . it was a problem on top of a problem . it was obviously a terrible thing to say but from what you wrote i ' m sure she didnt mean that . do you really think shes a sociopath or something ? i would hope you guys can sit down and talk things through , sincerely . just wanted to comment because i have said terrible things to loved ones and definitely didnt mean it . best of luck .

9. i ' m sorry . i was selfish , complacent and foolish . i hope your new man realizes how wonderful you are and treats you like you like i was supposed to . thank you for helping me become a better person .

10. of course . i ' ll post a link when it ' s finished .

11. advice regarding what exactly ? get out and go for lots of walks . being cooped up doesn  t do anyone a lot of good . look around to see if there  s any mum meet ups etc

12. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .

13. well if you don ' t like how your life is right now , you have taken a step in the right direction by starting a therapy at least . that is always a good first step . and with time it ' ll get better . why was this week hard ? did something happen or just in general ? i really hope next week is gonna be better though .

14. you deserve attention and love and happiness . you sound dedicated and committed and that ' s amazing . however , and i don ' t mean to sound rude , maybe family is not something to invest your efforts in . you matter . other ppl don ' t . don ' t be a devoted wife  mothehousewife if it makes you feel like you ' re just spread thin . maybe it ' s time to re  shift the paradigms so to speak . have you addressed the issue in your family ? stressed how underappreciated you feel ? if the ppl around you don ' t give anything back to you they are the wrong ppl . family isn ' t everything . marriage is a common cause of depression and self  loathing in women . while you ' re waiting for the current ppl on your life to show you that you matter you could easily replace them with others who really do care about you . eventually you might find that the greatest love you can ever experience is the love of you for yourself . find what makes you so unhappy . then iliminate it .

15. i know exactly how you feel . i ' m a man and when we were dating my wife was always touching , kissing and the like . i liked it but it was all a little overwhelming . and she is a tender thing so i never wanted to say for fear of making her cry . but i finally made the plunge . she did cry . but she was happy that i was honest with her . that ' s where relationships thrive . honestly . i think you should choose your words carefully , adding be honest .

16. being treated nicely isn ' t what everyones after , some people prefer someone who ' ll challange them . whether it be intellectually or spiritually or whatever . lots of people are also still searching for what they want . someone might think they want excitment rather than someone who ' s more chilled and later find out they were wrong . there is also the possibility they just don ' t want you and thats it . idk its not an exact science . last possibility assuming you haven ' t made a definitive move on her is they think you ' d make a move if you wanted to and have given up on their end . if you think this is it , just try having a chat with them and say your piece . it ' ll happen or it won ' t but its better to have a answer i hope you enjoyed my ted talk

17. if you can be a normal human being and act like a professional , keep your job . if you can ' t , get another job and try not falling for someone married once you get there .
   (ID: b8837ddf157d8cba7dd70f0bf376c970a7b9132c)

18. you should never look at sex as something that needs to be done just to say you did it . ask anyone that ' s been married to the love of their life , they ' ll tell you they wish they waited . its not that you can ' t because of anxiety , its just that it isn ' t the right time . there are no such things as missed opportunities because when you meet the person of your dreams , you will never let then go and vise versa with or without anxiety . those aren ' t friends , they are just cliche douche bags and it probably burns when they piss . fuck em , because the kind of anxiety you get from meeting someone new is something you learn to cope with . the anxiety you get induced from people you already know , you are stuck with .
   (ID: 51e06ea43809bd7f43c9c3b13a19193236a72570)

19. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .

20. the thanks goes to you for posting , i hope to see more in the future , this made my day
