1. yeah , i know it ' s the hardest and worst but i simply want it . the why ? i already played a dozen worlds to where i was starting to mine iron , and this stupid black bronze has always eluded me . the most i ever managed to make were digit tools at any one given time . i refuse to progress further until i get this .

6. i like your thought philosophy and i try to tell my wife that all the time . it doesn  t matter if it  s digit kg a week or digit grams . if it  s going downwards , it  s all that matters . like many others , i  m interested in following your story and interested in seeing the end result .

7. so i did what you suggested with the store your keys mod but i can  t store my keys because they don  t show up in the exchange screen . am i not doing something right ?

8. probably jordan peterson right now . because he ' s so good at articulating his ideas . it makes me feel like what i can articulate and how i feel about situations are more in line with each other . which it turns out is very important . not to mention his ideas themselves beyond that are incredibly helpful to so many people .

9. that ' s where i need to be . in a space in my head where i can ignore it or walk away from it . i ' m hung up on being angry that he gets to treat people however he wants without consequence . i honestly don ' t know how you didn ' t react with your father behaving like that ! i ' d have been terrified ! it ' s nice of you to still help him with his medical treatment even though he certainly doesn ' t sound grateful . i can see that having boundaries is important . i guess i need to know what mine are and stick to them at all times . i don ' t know if having cptsd is what makes my emotions take over when he does these things . something to talk to my psych about i suppose ! thank you so much reginaagnon , your kind words help more than you know ! red  heart

11. complete all kinds of snes games and find all hidden secrets and all sorts , all before the internet . now as an adult , i have to google where all the hidden exits are in super mario world . have no clue how digit year old me used to do it !

12. descent of angels only deals with dark angels backstory , so it  s skippable . half of fallen angels does deal with war efforts during the heresy beginning , though nothing major . to be honest i quite enjoyed both books , especially fallen angels , and don  t understand all the negativity towards them . they are no masterpieces , for sure , but highly fun .

13. it ' s these kind of detective posts that i love on reddit ! good job !

14. the human capability of it being reactable is irrelevant as this works for me like a good digit  of the time . not to mention the tons of mix  ups you can use to feed into thoes lights , mid  combo

15. going to get a lot of shit for this , but i think this is the same type of argument you would have with your son  daughter about getting transgender reassignment surgery . the " i feel " argument is so crushing that you just want to shake the person and say " no , you are wrong . that is not who you are ! " she doesn ' t have cancer and you cannot have babies just because you turn your penis outside  in .

16. maybe not one of the best , but when jeff hardy ' s comes on , so much pop !
   (ID: 3790e844e04694d48c253f7aee4d3b61f116d4d6)

17. i don ' t know what ' s going on . some of the questions show there are digit  digit comments , but i cant ' see them . this question says there are digit , i don ' t see them . whenever i post a comment on some questions , i can ' t see my own comment . then when i go back to the question , it ' s not there either !

19. fuck them . even the ones who post spoilers without context . even if you post that meme , i don ' t want to go in the cinema expecting those things .
