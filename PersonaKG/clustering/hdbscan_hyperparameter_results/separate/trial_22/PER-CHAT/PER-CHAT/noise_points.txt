4. you don ' t have to feel guilty about it during the day either . if you don ' t enjoy being around people you ' re probably just an introvert , and that isn ' t something to feel guilty about . it ' s just an aspect of your personality , the same way loving being with people is part of an extrovert ' s personality .

7. i would copy your original wallet . dat file and save it somewhere safe . also dump your private key and keep it somewhere as well . i assume that you can recover your wallet with the backup file , but i always use the original wallet . dat file . if someone else has said wallet . dat file then yes i believe they can access your funds so dont let it get in anyone elses hands i do not know anything regarding the passphrase and the extra security it may provide . there are how  tos on how to dump private key and access wallet . dat file if you need them

14. that  s true . it  s more knowing that there was a time this person played a vital part in your life and now they  re barely more than a fleeting thought every once in a while . it  s so scary how things change

15. what is tdee ?
   (ID: 8ea8e4a00c3f2a64096e00bdbba0247e580cdb17)

16. no , it ' s quite normal to be sedated for it . you generally have to ask for them to keep you awake . it sounds like a failure of the anesthesiologist if they were unable to keep you sedated , and it ' s battery unless you told them you want to be awake plus you described it as what sounds like battery to me .

17. have you tried it ? you need to try it .

18. hey i ' m really sorry to hear about the time you ' ve got . buy your wish is yours alone . don ' t look for others wishes . you have got a pretty good list there . orangutans are generally very happy creatures . go for that one of you ' re looking for something peaceful and memorable . disneyland too is a great choice . lots of love .

19. i imagined it like this though . there is a camera following every single person on the planet , and they are the only ones making a movie about . it would have been a shit movie if it was one of the people who falls down the crumbly crack , so thats why they chose these guys . surely digit person out of 7billion would have a little luck

20. i  ve learned its about matching energy . if they  re upset and boisterous about it , match it . if it  s more of a somber rant , be quieter in your response ex her   i just can  t even believe she  d do that ! it  s crazy !  you   yea thats super fucked up !  her   im just really down right now you know ?  you   yea , it do be like that sometimes .  if you constantly try to fix the issues they come at you with it makes it seem like you  re trivializing their problems because , in their eyes , you  re saying the answer is obvious . everyone wants to just vent now and then and having someone reciprocate your feelings feels better than answers sometimes .
