1. man no one is being helpful in this thread . sorry mate . not everyone is mean just find out if she ' s trying to keel the kid and you may lose things in the process but you gotta figure a plan out my best wishes to you . i wish i was in your situation because a three way sounds dank af rn . best case scenario , you have three people raising that kid , two ladies and you . thats a win in my book

2. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

3. try to think about how you want her to feel about your exes . that  s how you should handle it .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

4. what she is doing does not seem particularly troublesome . i mean it just seems like she is changing in ways that are really freaking you out . from what you have said i would let it slide as long as he isn ' t violent , extorting money or raping her . i mean as long as she is happy and not getting hurt right ?

5. you ' re definitely not going to keep a girl for long if your attitude is " when can i expect a girl to show up and be my girlfriend , like literally which day . it ' s not an entitlement that you have a right to . my favorite girlfriends were ones i met when i wasn ' t looking . the harder you try the more it doesn ' t work . even if you do get one that way , your worries about holding on to her are going to push her away anyway .

6. you should never look at sex as something that needs to be done just to say you did it . ask anyone that ' s been married to the love of their life , they ' ll tell you they wish they waited . its not that you can ' t because of anxiety , its just that it isn ' t the right time . there are no such things as missed opportunities because when you meet the person of your dreams , you will never let then go and vise versa with or without anxiety . those aren ' t friends , they are just cliche douche bags and it probably burns when they piss . fuck em , because the kind of anxiety you get from meeting someone new is something you learn to cope with . the anxiety you get induced from people you already know , you are stuck with .

7. what am i suppose to say ? what ' s done is done , no need to keep feeling guilty and letting it eat me up for months messing with my mind and shit . just letting go now and not letting it bother me sounds way better then letting stuff fuck me up like most people do .
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

8. i feel like im at edge because i honestly thought i had real willpower to stop and now here i am failing multiple times . constantly persuading myself to give in and juat have a drink and now i cant even last longer then digit days without a drink . its heart breaking and im afriad about how this has come to be . i juat dont know anymore

9. oh , honey . sending hugs . can you ring a friend for a chat ? you need to speak to someone who knows your worth . i hope it gets better or , if not , you find what you need . good luck .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

10. should i tell her ?
   (ID: 6212c082850f067a67618ad2a3b9f8ed336590f4)

11. why are you assuming you are being friendzoned ? i mean you seem to be just friends at this stage . she hasn ' t rejected you , so you are not really " friendzoned . it ' s a bit hard to know if she likes you or not from what you have described . just be yourself and don ' t go in with the expectation of wanting her to like you because you are nice to her . dont assume anything , ever ! good luck !

12. i get the feeling from what you  ve written that she  s saying this to make you jealous . i think you need to tell her that you  ve been thinking about it and it  s bothering you that she seems so hung up on her and talk about where you want to go from there . do you want her to stop seeing this girl ? do you want the communication to stop ? i think you need to decide what your ideal situation would be in regard to their current relationship . make sure she knows why you feel like this and how it makes you feel when she responds so quickly . if you guys are hanging out together why does she need to be constantly texting this other girl she used to date ? it  s not like they were only friends  you said she was in love with her and it  s inappropriate for her to still be this involved with her . i don  t know if this is useful advice but it  s what i  d do if i were in your situation . best of luck .

13. i agree that she ' s dropping hints . next time she brings it up say something like " why in the world does anyone get married ? the details are mind numbing ! i can ' t imagine putting myself through that . big sigh . i don ' t know how you ' re managing to deal with all this . let ' s go to a movie or something because this is seriously depressing me . "

14. nta . you would be the ahole if you keep leading her in . just be honest with her . it will suck for a little bit , but she ' ll get over it
   (ID: 73c241755308e15ea272f3060f9c0a430c541f1a)

15. honestly yeah i think you ' re kind of an asshole . men are always much more likely to leave their significant others due to illness  here we go , another example of it . like the girl you ' re meant to love could have something terribly wrong with her and you ' re out here just thinking about yourself and any future  key word future  kids ? come on dude . if you do break up with her because of this , i want you to look her dead in the eye and say " i can ' t deal with you being sick , and that ' s why i ' m leaving you "
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

16. yeah if you have a gut feeling you won ' t like dating her then don ' t . i mean if she wants to just be fwb that would be cool though lol .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

17. it sounds like you are taking the right steps . i really hope she hasn  t been kidnapped and hoping for a logical explanation for you and her .
   (ID: e1d1404c2d4f1c884debe976d40ee13df3959fcf)

18. you ' re not a bum ! the fact that you came here to post this means you still have hope ! honestly , i was feeling down like you too , but then i stumbled upon guide to purposeful success and it really helped me find a purpose in life , which i am pursuing every single day now , and it ' s been great ! hopefully it can help you too .

19. move out . do you know how many people have problems like this because they live together first ? he has no incentive to marry you . you ' re probably sleeping together and living exactly like you ' re married . so either you need to take all those privileges and perks away to motivate him or let go of being sensitive . not trying to be harsh . but you got yourself in a pickle here . honestly ask yourself if you ' re in his shoes , why should you go through the risk and trouble of getting married when you can have what you want ? why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free ? old saying

20. seems like he has a lot of baggage going on . he ' s sexuality interested in other people and is likely cheating , or going to cheat outside of the rules . if you have rules like you do , you shouldn ' t be together . it ' s gonna get ugly if you stay .
