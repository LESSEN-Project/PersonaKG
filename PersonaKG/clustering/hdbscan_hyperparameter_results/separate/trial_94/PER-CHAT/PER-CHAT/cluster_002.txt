   (ID: 77d0324af3e030bb9fb9365a16e870bd522fd275)

12. still my point stands . shooting someone because they  re that desperate is wrong . you should never shoot someone unless you are physically in danger . somebody might be that desperate , just let it go just get your shit insured .
   (ID: 54271e4114265f638c8e4c59d7a3b35b6caa55bf)

16. just gonna throw this out there but i think the older brother is gonna be ippos first pro opponent , cant remember his name but its the one who quit and got fat  they just look similar imo , have similarly aggressive personalities and overconfidence in their under trained fighting strength , its just a feeling .

19. when you load up one of them , there ' s a setting that says " position " . you just have to change the value and it should move .
   (ID: 7d84a169d4ddae2aee36640f218ff2b5b534792d)

20. see now you are just trying to bait me into political arguments . i ' m not biting . i will not be commenting on comparisons to school shooters , real  world terrorism , etc . it is insensitive and unfair downplay the severity of these actions so much that you can compare them to a tv series . these are real lives being effected not just characters on a show .
