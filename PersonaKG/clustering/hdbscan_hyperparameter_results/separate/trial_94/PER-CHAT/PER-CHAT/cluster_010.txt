   (ID: 0b52265db13bf8bc27ad36aad94e870706eb6689)

5. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .

   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

8. hell yeah ! preach ! just one correction tho  transgenderism isn ' t the right word . it ' s just " being transgender " . the term has a lot of baggage from people using it as a slur so for the most part we avoid using it unless joking about people being dick .
   (ID: 77e0b8c51dfb89ff57bd838b86ee4d78a9fe856f)

9. well , i don ' t go around telling everyone i don ' t believe in the bible and all that nonsense . and i believe there are many people like me . it ' s easier to say nothiing most of the time unless confronted by one of those crazy people who want to send you to hell because you don ' t believe exactly like they do .

11. i mean , i guess the fact that someone thought to put together this video and included people who aren  t even twitch thots , but other than that there  s really nothing .
   (ID: 12803a9aad224d0537b68ab83a6cdc6a45d3160f)

12. people hate trenders because it takes a legitimate and real identity and crap we  re born with and turns it into a game . being transgender isn  t fun . dysphoria isn  t fun , even if your dysphoria isn  t that bad . i didn  t choose to be born like this , i would never choose to suffer like i have speaking of personal experience only . dysphoria sucks ass and it genuinely upsets me when i see girls trying take something that  s been a real challenge for me and thousands of others and turn it into a fun little game . i really don  t understand why you  re defending trenders . they  re literally just cisgender people trying to get some oppression points . they aren  t people genuinely questioning their gender because they aren  t in this category , people who can  t transition in any way , etc . they  re taking a label and exploiting it for their own personal gain . they  re going to one day change their mind and then the consequences are left to those who are actually transgender . if you want to see in a difference situation and circumstance why trenders are doing more negative than positive , then i  ll give you one . the people who are sad for a few days and say  i  m depressed  . the people who are a little nervous and say they have an anxiety disorder . or , those people who like cleanness and order and say they have ocd . we all know that mental disorders stem from the mind just like being transgender , our brains don  t align with our birth sex . you can  t choose to have a mental disorder you don  t choose to be trans , you choose to transition yes but you are born transgender . the people who label themselves as such when they have the littlest of symptoms are doing more negative than anything . same goes for here . girls who like boy clothes  etc . aren  t transgender . or those girls who are little or very masculine . just because they don  t like their boobs doesn  t mean they  re transgender . plenty of women don  t like their breasts . for transmen , it  s not only that they don  t like the lumps on their chest  it  s that it  s supposed to be a male chest than a female . our brains are telling us that it  s supposed to be a male chest , but our anatomy is giving us something else . then that  s when dysphoria kicks in and so on . the brain section is actual scientific fact . not some principle . there  s evidence of transgender people  s brains not aligning to their assigned sex . my brain is similar to my father , not my mother , because of the slight differences between the two brains . we are having a discussion here . i haven  t told any trender anything nor spoke to one and said anything bad . there  s no actual way i can ever  police  anyone  s identity . having an opinion is not policing . i  m not gate keeping either . i wouldn  t say this to an actual trender because i  d say it in a completely different way .

13. agreed , i think this list shows how far reddit has its head up its ass . people joke about the hivemind but this list really shows it
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

14. ever heard an old person ask to change doctors because theirs is " a paki " . i have . far too often . you ' d be surprised at how racist some people can be .
   (ID: f7356e924b370675e942b29b9c2184dc895ea5b7)

15. i don ' t . what i do find annoying is people who use irony ineffectively .
   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

16. i am inclined to agree with most of what you said , and i ' ll look at the studies , but i suppose it ' s partially what i was trying to say , no drugs are safe , legal or illegal , if done wrong . i tend to indiscriminately tell people not to do the illegal ones though , since they can destroy your life , in fact it can have nothing to do with the drug and everything to do with the social situations illegal drugs tend to put people in . though i ' m sure you know that much too .
   (ID: 6ea82786a74ccdc85dc1fddd809a575aa4e4efcf)

17. probably because they can . some countries you dont get the right of freedom of religion , so in the us people can express themselves with it .
   (ID: 3ad18913fe75fd4a63c4ae0d0255c37d90fd7144)

18. people saying wrong things on purpose
   (ID: dea1673e29d00bc1a88d1c231b63981344044a2e)

19. One of my favorite things is scars   people.
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

20. it ' s successful because there are a lot of stupid and  or gullible people on this planet .
