7. it does a good job at being a shooter , the single player is just an after thought , i really hate when games don ' t have a worthwhile single player mode to them because some weird reason most develpers probably don ' t even know but just go along with it because everyone does it . i am not a fan of multiplayer especially not online i don ' t know i just don ' t like it . so splatoon went in my opinion from interesting to it is a good concept . it is just focused on multiplayer and the single player seems to have no replay value
