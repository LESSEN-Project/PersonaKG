2. i just want to work on developing strategies that make money . focusing on development and especially ai and ml . it seems like the closest thing to a well paid " problem solver " , plus the feeling that i could " create " money for myself was something i ' ve never felt before and feel regardless of what happens in life , as long as there are markets , you could be somewhat self sufficient . not sure what role that would be called though , they seem to go under many names or none at all . i just want to prepare myself to " get in " to any position to start .

4. nobody said anything about pushing anything on anyone or being pervy . there ' s nothing wrong with saying hi to a stranger . and by rejection i meant it as a broad definition in this sense . normal people should be able to immediately sense if the other person is not up for a conversation . but there is absolutely nothing wrong with seeing a pretty girl and saying hey . if she seems flattered or interested in a chat at all take it from there to the next level by maybe flirting a little or saying something you noticed about her . but to generally assume i meant just walk up to some hot chick in a random location and immediately running up to her with some cheesy pick up line is both wrong and hysterical to even imagine . you shouldn ' t do that in any setting . but talking to a girl you notice in a mall or grocery store is no different than talking to them in a bar or club .

6. honestly after talking to allot of people . i main her and i basically use the sweep as a mental tool . people will almost always dodge the sweep on reaction bc it  s so rewarding , if you delay the sweep it turns into a gb . the only buff she needs is a damage boost .

7. that ' s where i need to be . in a space in my head where i can ignore it or walk away from it . i ' m hung up on being angry that he gets to treat people however he wants without consequence . i honestly don ' t know how you didn ' t react with your father behaving like that ! i ' d have been terrified ! it ' s nice of you to still help him with his medical treatment even though he certainly doesn ' t sound grateful . i can see that having boundaries is important . i guess i need to know what mine are and stick to them at all times . i don ' t know if having cptsd is what makes my emotions take over when he does these things . something to talk to my psych about i suppose ! thank you so much reginaagnon , your kind words help more than you know ! red  heart

8. " sir . " i try to interject but the old bearded man keeps shouting . " i can ' t find a damn thing in this place ! " his face has turned a boiling red , in contrast with his milky white eyes . steam shoots from his ears . " sir ! you ' re looking in the wrong cupboard ! " i shout , " sit down ! let me help you ! " " speak up , boy , i can barely hear you . " he grumbles , " sit down ? oh fine . " i pull up a chair and he settles down into it . " teacup ! " he shouts , and i hurry to retrieve one . i place it in his left hand and he points his right finger at it . a stream of boiling water pours from the tip of his finger like the spout of a teapot . i hand him a tea bag . " so what were you looking for , sir ? " " ahh . just an old book . what ' s the point anyway ? i can ' t even read the thing . can you read ancient greek ? " i admit that i can ' t and avoid mentioning that we are in the kitchen , not the library . i also don ' t know my way around very well , so i ' m a bit relieved . the building we are in is not a conventional home . it is a grand , curling spire dozens of stories high . this would be a problem for the old man if he were not able to float , up or down , straight through the center of the spiral staircase , easily arriving at a floor usually the wrong one much faster than i can climb the steps . " why did you need the book , sir ? " i ask , " what are we doing today ? " " ah the village by the river has a bridge troll they need taken care of . the messengers are on their way here now . " i know better than to ask how he knows this . he continues , " i remember the spell anyway . no one else can be bothered to learn the stupid things . " or no one has the ability . the old man , while grumpy and difficult , is also the greatest wizard alive . he is known as the wizard with no name although he hates the title , assuring me he does have a name . he also says his name is probably unpronounceable for me and might make my heart stop beating . i have been his assistant for digit weeks , in exchange only for room and board . i am an orphan and this is the only apprenticeship i can find , although i know i have been treated much better in town since becoming associated with the wizard . just then , i hear the loud knocker at the front door bang through the tower . " well ? " the old wizard says , " get a move on . " i hustle down the hundreds of steps , watch the wizard float down past me , and arrive at the door as he waves his hand and it slowly opens . two horsemen stand outside with four horses , wearing the light armor of provincial soldiers . the messengers jump a bit then take a step forward . " great wizard ! " one begins , " we have traveled fifty miles to retrieve you ! our town is under attack . " " bridge troll ! " the wizard loudly interrupts . " it ' s just a damn bridge troll and you fools can ' t simply kill the thing . but fine , i ' ll deal with your troll in exchange for a small yearly tithe . " the messengers cringe , knowing how poor their town is , but the wizard doesn ' t see the reaction and they agree on a portion of the harvest for the payment . the wizard smiles , " good ! now that payment is settled , where are your horses ? i know i ' ve been smelling some . " i lead the wizard to a horse and he floats onto it while the soldiers gape . i mount one beside him . " take your time getting back , " he says to them , " it should all be cleared up by then . " we trot off but all movement by the horse seems uncomfortable to the wizard . strangely he nudges his horse to go faster and faster and i urge mine to match him . as we ride the horses seem to bounce less and less . one lets out a loud whinny and i look down to see that their hooves are floating above the surface of the ground . the horses seem to know where they ' re going because at this point the wizard is feeling around in his beard for fuzz or food . we arrive in the town in two hours , much faster than the eight hours the fifty miles would normally take . as soon as we near the perimeter i hear the sound of fire and screams . we slow our horses and trot forward until the troll comes into view . it is a monstrous beast , taller than rooftops , grabbing women and children where it can while the men fight to hold it back and secure the town ' s population in the large central church . " how big is it ? " the wizard asks . " about digit feet tall ? " i guess . he chuckles , " they ' ve been procrastinating , huh ? alright bring me to it ? " " bring you . to it ? " i ask hesitantly . " don ' t make me repeat myself boy . how else am i supposed to handle it ? " i shudder then grab his horse ' s lead . i walk our horses through the town . the soldiers shout at us to get back as we pass their perimeter and we ignore them . eighty yards away the troll notices us . " he saw us , " i say , " straight ahead . " " good , " the wizard smiles . he cracks his long fingers . suddenly , a flurry of words burst out of his mouth . in it , i hear what seem to be thousands of unique sounds adding up to dozens of languages . i hear a goat ' s bleat , snake ' s hiss and baby ' s laugh . i hear words that sound as powerful as crashing waves and silences as deep as the moment before dawn . my vision shrinks into a black tunnel until suddenly the words stop . i see the bridge troll frozen in place . it slowly falls with a huge crash like a massive tree . " good , " the old wizard grins , " now show me to the food . i ' m hungry . "

9. remember that other one where he got the volunteer to murder stephen fry ? he also used the " anchor " and " color " concepts in that one . it think it is bullshit to suggest anyone can be persuaded in this way  as you mention , there are extensive screening and editing processes that db doesn ' t share with the audience . he just really knows how to pick em .

17. i can  t believe i just read that whole book you just wrote lol . but look i can tell you immediately why you don  t wanna give him a chance . bc you don  t like him . period . you just see him as a friend . you never even thought about dating him til your family said something . you never mention having some chemistry or any kind of feelings for him . and that  s ok . yea he sounds like a great guy but if you don  t feel a connection with him or get all giggle with him i don  t think it  s gonna work out . the best part of a relationship is the honey moon stage . i mean you could give him a chance but don  t get all stressed about it . dating is suppose to be fun . especially around our age . goodluck op
