1. the hagwon  public school thing is really up to you . i ' ve only done hagwons , so i don ' t have experience with any experience with public schools other than hearing from friends . seems you get a lot more time off with public school , but get paid a lot more with a hagwon if you find the right ones . public will definitely have more job security , as its back by the government , but if you find a reputable hagwon company , that should be just as good . that being said , i ' ve been relatively happy with what i ' ve been doing . i ' m currently working two jobs and pulling in quite a good bit of dough , so if you can work it out that way , you should do it . as for incheon , i love it here . depending on your work schedule , you could definitely make it in to seoul on a weekday . it takes about an hour and twenty minutes to get to any of the hot spots for me , so if you were to go public and get off at digit , you ' d be fine . if you did a hagwon , you would work later so you could stay out and sleep at a jimjilbang and get back in time for work . cab fair is generally gonna run you around digit , 000w back . dunno about anyang , although my gf lives near there currently . she also says there is nothing happening there . i dunno though .

2. it is an important decision , but you don  t need to put as much pressure on yourself as you may think . not all of the decisions you make at this point in your life are going to be exactly right , and that  s okay . if you don  t like the school you initially choose , you can transfer . if you need to get some of your credits from a community college to save money , no one will think less of you . just work hard and do your best to do what feels right to you . it won  t all be perfect , but things will work out .

3. every job will do , as long as you adjust your living standards . i don ' t want to argue that living coast are way to high in the last few years . and that mini jobbers don ' t get paid enough , is also true . but thats how things are at the moment , so you have to adjust . at most places your job you doing besides beeing in school won ' t pay you an own apartment . the higher the coasts of living are in a city , the more you have to find things to cut out . get a roommate , maybe even more . just buy cheap foods that are on discount and stock them . use a bike if possible instead of public transport quit your gym and start bodyweight training shorten your shower times buy everything possible used . sadly a lot of students have to work a lot , while also balancing school life , without a fair payment . so you will just need to be really lucky with your job or you have to really cut back in your living standarts for a few years . maybe even share a room and give up your privacy . i don ' t wanna get into finding somebody helping you out with money , you probably wouldn ' t have asked if this possibility exists . hopefully we students use this unfairness as motivation to make it possible for the next generation to have a healthy work school balance and getting a fair payment .

4. go , why the hell not ? just be smart and have a plan to gtfo if everything goes south midway through . i think you should tell someone you ' re going , a friend an adviser or someone you can count on if it goes to shit . you will regret not going .

5. beyond how much money you need , there are some other things to think about . furniture  don  t try to move furniture across the country . look for a furnished place to rent  first , or better yet , stay with family at 1st . you  re barely going to be there anyways . clothes  take your favorite outfits , and enough to get through about a month without washing clothes . you aren  t going to have time . your favorites just because i already know that while you won  t wear them again , you aren  t ready to get rid of them just yet . stuff  ditch it , unless it  s something you want to save forever . money  not enough information in your post . are you looking to get your own place when you get there , or can you crash at family  friends house for a few months ? you  re going to make more money than you have time to spend once you get started . you  ll be able to get a really nice place in just a few months , but you won  t be there much .

6. i say go for it ! change is good , and for your situation and everything you described moving is definitely going to be good for you . you don  t want to keep thinking about doing it for years and regret not going sooner .

7. think about your network . can you build one quickly , can you survive without it ? if the answer is no , don ' t go . you are married . how does your husband feel about it ? is your relationship solid enough for long distance . if it works out , what will your husband do for work ? can he transfer ? its your decision , but you are also a team . if he doesn ' t want to leave or can ' t , you may not want to take the job . can your finances handle supporting two households ? if you move to establish the homebase across the country , your husband still needs to maintain the current home . this means a strain on the finances . can you afford it ? do you want to ?
