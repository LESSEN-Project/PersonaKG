1. sounds like someone really hated that whole family . maybe more than one person , poison and dynamite  bombs are very different weapon choices . it seems weird that she would lean over looking at the package for an extended period of time instead of just picking it up like most people would . i guess she could have been extra cautious because of the dynamite at her brother  in  law ' s place but if she was suspicious , why not call the police to come and look at it ?

2. it looked like he was in the pet food section . he may have been thinking , " that cat never catches anything , but i guess this pellet gun should take care of those squirrels . oh well , might as well get him a little treat " and then his life was over .

3. found my step  dad white , aspirated on his own vomit , drunk , and high on oxy . woke him up covered in his own puke , sobered him up , and fed him some dinner . fucking guy then calls the psychiatric emergency response team on me a week later and tells them my child is in danger so they bring cps and perjure themselves saying i was a threat to my family which i hadn ' t seen for six months which leads me to a three year restraining order against my own family . fuck you , mike .

4. my neighbour has paranoid delusions . he believes that every move i make , is some part of my elaborate plan to do him harm . he , " caught , " me going out at digit pm the other night . in reality , it was because i had to post a letter . in his mind , though , it was because i specifically timed my exit to coincide with him putting out the trash . he confronted me , f  bombs a  blazing , and demanded to fucxing know what my fucxing scheme was . he puts me through this shit every other year or so . anyway , yeah , it ' s hard to explain that posting a letter does not mean i give a single shit about him putting out the trash .

5. holy fuck me ! that ' s awful , i feel bad for your uncle ' s friend . , that ' s why i feel so bad for truckers , people are assholes because they think they are faster and can get away . what they forget is that the trucks are way bigger and will crush them like a bug , how did your he handle it after ? i can ' t imagine even though in a way the guy deserved it for being an ass , it still had to affect the driver . edit  spelling
