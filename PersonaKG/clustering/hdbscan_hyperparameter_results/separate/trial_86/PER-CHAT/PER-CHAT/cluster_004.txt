1. look , we are trying to help you , if you were so interested in this bollard , i bet if you spent another digit minutes " looking critically " at it , you would have found a part number and manafacturer . good luck , with you wall mart parking lot explorations .

2. yeah , i have never bought anything from twitch , not even with paysafecard and not payment methods linked . i don ' t even have anything in my purchase history in twitch but still i somehow managed to buy a resub ? but i was anyway planning to buy the digit  resub so i have no clue what to do right now .

3. i should of known that the prices for these pokemon ones were too good to be true . they are quite hard to get hold of here in the uk , so fraudsters have filled the gap in the market by flogging these fake ones . ebay will be on your side to and help you and get you a refund if you receive a fake , it is just a lot of hassle that is probably best avoided !

4. yeah like op said there are two other people here possibly one who are shadow banned so check that out . anyway i ordered some 350s off ali about a week ago and the tracking number begins with ls . they just got processed through the sorting facility , and they haven ' t done anything else . it just takes a really long time for it to get out of the country . give it some time .

5. that  s the whole issue . i contacted support right away , and it  s been digit hours and i haven  t heard from them . i checked my tasks again and it looks like they took care of digit of the digit birds . i recontacted them about the one that is still in my task list . i sent them screenshots of the nest and the error code like i  m supposed to . i just don  t want any problems from big bird if it  s showing in my tasks after digit days , or if i cancel the task .

6. i have had very similar experiences with edgepark though i never ended up ordering from them . just the short list   i only mentioned interest in the omnipod . digit weeks later , received approval letter from my insurance . they had requested rx from a doctor my pcp , not endo without my consent .  misquoted my benefit level to the point of not believing my insurance company about how to code the rx  tried to tell me that they don ' t like to fill the omnipod rx without also filling dexcom  when i cancelled the order after both me and my insurance company yelling at them , the order magically appeared again digit weeks later . went to byram , no issues , very pleased .
