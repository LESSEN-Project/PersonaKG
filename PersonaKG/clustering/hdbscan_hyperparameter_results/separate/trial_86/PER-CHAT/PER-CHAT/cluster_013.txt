1. i don ' t know , it ' s hard to compare power level across franchises . if you take mewtwo from the games ? easy , he ' s already out of pp and is using struggle . mewtwo from the anime ? he might be fucked . i ' m pretty sure snake could have a chance against ganon , but i don ' t know enough about either of them tbh .

2. the game has a lot of counters nobushi counters a lot of heroes cus of her hidden stance ! highlander is one of them

3. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .

4. she doesn  t really rely on being awakened . and she is very good for attack or for any sort of quests , as she gets stronger with the more souls she gets . imo there  s not many champions better at dealing raw damage than morningstar at digit souls

5. they are similar but imo fiora is much better and stronger . how ever i do agree that they kinda counter each other . i suppose it is a skill match up
