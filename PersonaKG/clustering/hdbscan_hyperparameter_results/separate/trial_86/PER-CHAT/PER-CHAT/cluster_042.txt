3. my second year of college a girl named alice fake name took my water bottle . sounds weird but stick with me on this . it was sitting next to me and i left it at my desk while i went to bathroom halfway through class . after i came back it was sitting a little closer to alice than it was to me but i didn ' t notice too much . class ends , everyone leaves , and a few of us start talking about weekend plans . and alice is holding the bottle . i thought " oh i forgot that and she ' s kindly returning it to me . sweet " nope . suddenly she takes a massive gulp out of the bottle . a bottle that i got for free from the lunch room . filled with water that was from the free drinking fountain digit feet outside the classroom . my friend greg fake name is the next one to notice and asks " isn ' t that jen ' s water " alice responds " oh , i thought somebody had left it from the last class . oops " cue another large gulp . greg is instantly disgusted and very confused . he rightly starts asking wtf ? alice tries to defend herself with " it ' s no big deal " and " finders keepers " and the perfectly reasonable " yolo . keep in mind , alice is a sophomore college student who has lived a completely normal american life as far as i know of . five minutes into this discussion , alice gets angry enough to leave in the middle of greg ' s sentence about personal space . no apology . no hint that she understand why it ' s wrong . next day she acted like nothing had ever happened . tl  dr girl in my college doesn ' t understand that stealing free water from other students for no reason is kind of weird .

4. i always arrive super early to stuff because i  m anxious about being late , so i got to starbucks like digit minutes early . this is obviously just a casual coffee date , i met the guy online , wanted to get to know him irl . i order a drink and sit down to wait on my laptop . the guy arrives digit minutes early and comes to greet me and asks if i want a drink . i say no because i already have one . he suddenly gets really upset he can  t buy me a drink . keeps asking me to let him buy one , or even weirder , kept offering to give me money for the one i already paid for ? i just keep saying no , it  s alright , i  m a grown woman lol . so he gets a drink and kinda sulks for the rest of the date , like keeps giving one word answers , doesn  t ask me anything . as soon as i finished my drink he asked to buy me one and i said i actually needed to leave . it was just bizarre .

5. i don ' t know how much of a dick this guy had been prior to the start of the video , so maybe she was riled up for a good reason , but in all honesty , if any store clerk or manager would ever talk about handing out my personal details , even if jokingly , i would lose my shit as well . this is something i have zero tolerance for . it ' s pretty much the most unprofessional thing you can do in such a position .
