1. you ' re alive right now . so what if your youth was wasted ? does that automatically mean that you ' re unable to anything ever again ?

3. me ? i dont have an existential crisis anymore i accepted we probably live in a simulation a while ago sounds stupid but look up neil degrass tyson ' s video on it he explains it really well but you should probably just take your mind off of it and or work toward accepting it and like me it might give you some weird peace knowing that nothing you ever do will matter .

4. okay , so you  re asking for yourself ? sorry , i assumed you , like most people , were just curious . the biggest thing i had was to use my intellect instead of how i felt . i felt like shit and wanted to die , but i knew in my head i wasn  t and people loved me , i was also just curious , and i can  t find out what happens next if i  m dead . as for life itself being meaningless , so what ? just because no one will remember you in a hundred years doesn  t mean you  re pointless right now , you can have a very real impact on a lot of people in a lot of ways . when i felt like i didn  t matter because humans are expendable , i just had to realise that we are , but not to each other .

5. if you ' re in your 40s or younger , there ' s still hope . i ' m working on a theory right now .

6. i get that . there ' s something strange about the feeling of non existence since you are here now and it ' s the " black sailed unfamiliar . i suppose a lot of it is a fear of the unknown as well . what i find strange is that i was speaking to my neighbour last week . he is in his 90s and he was doing his gardening . i was asking him about his hearing as he has just got a new hearing aid and he said " i tell you what , i wish i would just hurry up and die already . i mean , it ' s depressing but it seems to show how thoughts change as we get older as wel . i got over these thoughts nearing my late 20s . obviously i don ' t want to ask how old you are but it will get better !

7. remember how it was before you were born ? me neither . and that ' s the way it will be when we are gone . same exact state . there are many questions we will never know the answer to but it ' s best to concentrate on what we know and what we have  enjoy your life and be good to your fellow humans .

8. possibility that this is best time humanity is living in and after this we are all going down .
