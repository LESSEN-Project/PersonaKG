2. if your on console try not to focus on building the onyl way you will beat pc players is by outgunning them . just focus on improving your aim , that ' s your best bet . i know there was some console fortnite player in season digit that was clapping everybody because he would just get close to them and never miss a one pump i wish i could remember his youtube

3. look up ygopro  devpro online and download it . it is a virtual version of the game , and i believe the percy client has an ai mode that you can test decks against . then i would lurk around the sub a little to see what people are playing , pick something that piques your interest , and start from there . warning  cardboard crack is an expensive and addicting habit , and devpro has cost me a fair bit of sleep after discovering it

4. one thing that helped me a lot was to pick a couple heros to really learn and not worry about the rest . for me it was torb  soldiemcree . then i started to watch jayne vod videos on each of those heros . if you want amazing insights and tips for the heros i haven ' t found anyone to match his videos . one thing that really helped with my aim and how i warm up before a comp match , is to go into the practice range and start shooting the digit moving boys . i stand right in the middle and run around and shoot all of them . i will shoot each one just once then flip around a shoot a different one as fast as i can . it really helped me with the hit scan heros , i can focus people in tight groups a lot better now . some of jayne ' s videos are super long , but you wont get a better guide .

6. well , i have studied but am not proficient with japanese candlestick patterns , chart patterns , i am starting with tape reading , i am trying to learn market cycles , applying the news , correlation between forex  stocks , i would like to learn options and the mathematics behind it . ah , i know what you mean . so , i actually don ' t really know all of that other stuff either . i know the basics , not the terminology . once you understand what the candles actually " mean " then the names and specific " patterns " mean very little . i feel just a basic knowledge of the candles will suffice  but i know concepts nothing i can actual trade with on my own . i really work hard and i put forth the effort  work . i am doing this full time and have some savings to weather the storm while i learn to trade on my own . i would start by finding a basic strategy and then working to improve it . i would say half the battle is just getting " into the zone " or as close to it as possible . there ' s a great book ironically named trading in the zone , by mark douglas . if you ' ve been working this for a bit it would probably be a perfect read ! a lot of the topics went over my head the very first time i read it , after re  reading it though it was completely different to me !  i am willing to switch to one software like e  signal which will do both . i would love some help ! i also want to continue onto python  algo trading afterwards . that ' s the direction i took , i really enjoy it ! i ' m currently trying to focus on scalping , having a go at bitcoin ! this is my progress for the past few months . feel free to dig through the twitter if you want to verify those trades , digit  of them i try to post on twitter to avoid appearing fake lol . cause that was the other thing i was going to say . i would say digit  of " classes " out there are useless . the most important things i ' ve learned are probably things i ' ve picked up from the more legitimate books out there and just digging around online , doing my own research . fooled by randomness is another great book , also algorithms to live by . more concerned with algos i ' m also trying to get a discord going that focuses on productive discussion , not just useless news and fluff . if you want a link just lemme know ! i love to help answer questions , i love all ideas , you never know where good ones can come from ! if you asked me where to start , i would say start with a digit ma , see if you can trade off just using that . then find out where and " why " some trades are good and bad , just build up from there

7. i ' m not sure how you can ' t find rez scrolls , essentially every vendor has them . in regards to improving , you haven ' t given any detail as to what exactly you ' re doing now . what level is your party ? what ' s your party makeup ? what skills are you using ? what ' s going wrong ?
