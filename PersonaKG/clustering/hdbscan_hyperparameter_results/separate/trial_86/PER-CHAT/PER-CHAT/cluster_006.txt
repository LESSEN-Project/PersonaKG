1. this post is too long , but i know exactly how you feel . i grew up in a similar situation , but i had digit older sisters ranging digit  digit years older than me . first you ' re an idiot for letting your mom drive drunk . you should have at least worried about the potential harm towards others . i think my parents weren ' t nice to me as a kid because they wanted to prepare me for the real world and ive come to appreciate it . life is going to be much harder on you if your a male , so you should be able to handle it . also wanting to be a musician i tought myself how to do everything and knowing that my parents wouldn ' t pay for my school no matter what i majored in , i spent digit years getting an ok paying job first . i know you don ' t want to hear about me though . my advice is digit  psychiatrists are witch doctors , dont waste your time of money . digit  distance yourself as much as you can from your family and live your own life .

2. oh so you were one of those " fit fats " i read about on the internet only . you dont think your cardio suffered or your joints , knees in particular wouldnt have been stressed less , or whatever sport you were playing you could have played better if you lost digit  pounds ? you are delusional to think it didnt stress your body at all no matter how young and " active " you were .

3. i lost digit . digit stone  90lbs . then found 56lb of it again . am back on the losing it again . it ' s a war not a battle . don ' t give up if you start to slip . it didn ' t go on in a day and won ' t come off in a day . find your reason that motivates you and will help when what you want right now mmm . chocolate seems more important than what you want to achieve long term . but don ' t beat yourself up if you slip , you ' ve not failed . find like minded people for motivation . seek support from friends so they don ' t put temptation in your way . don ' t be surprised when resistance comes from the oddest places . people who ' re scared that you ' re changing or don ' t want to be the group ' s new ' fat one ' . just keep trying . you can do it .

4. thank you for your words and your reply . it means a lot . i don ' t have any pain , but i think as of recently two weeks or so i probably lost some sensitivity . my ring finger lays against my middle finger just a tiny bit . at the same time , i also haven ' t been using my right hand  wrist to it ' s full ability so perhaps i haven ' t aggravated it as much as possible with what it ' s physically capable of . being scared isn ' t helping it though and i think is what caused the finger  touching . idk . it ' s kind of " tucked in there " , both my doctor and my surgeon told me i lucked out with it . i won ' t get it out myself and i ' ll follow up with my surgeon . i had a ct scan yesterday , i think i will call right now and inform them that whatever they see in the images is bothering me more and more and i don ' t think i can wait until march . sldkjsldkcx
