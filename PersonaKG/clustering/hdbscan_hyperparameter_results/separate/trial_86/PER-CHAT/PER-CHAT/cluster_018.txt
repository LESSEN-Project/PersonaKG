12. oh , we ' re talking about cops ? once in high school , this convenience store owner called the police because my friend and i were smoking weed behind his store out of the way , out by a tree , not even on his pavement . cops show up , we toss the joint , and they want to get us in trouble but can ' t really do much without evidence of actual weed . so they start looking for the joint and my stoned friend bends over to help and one of the cops literally pushes him away . never forgot that for some reason . it was such a hard shove and the friend was really just trying to find the joint to help these cops get him in trouble , lol .
