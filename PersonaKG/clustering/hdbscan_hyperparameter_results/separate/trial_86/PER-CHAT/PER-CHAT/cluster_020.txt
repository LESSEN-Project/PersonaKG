1. when i did a few stupid things as a teenager my dad said , " people only feel sorry for you if you learn from your mistakes . screw up once , god bless you . make the same mistake again , god help you . make it a third time ? goddamn you " i have always remembered that and tried to make sure i don ' t continuously make the same mistakes in life .

2. i was working a food line by myself , and we got a rush of like 9ish small groups , and in the middle of me running around trying to make everything , a woman came up to the counter complaining that i didn ' t cut the crusts off of her son ' s sandwich . if that had been instructed , i would have done so , but i wasn ' t informed that she wanted that , and i was busy as all hell . the dark part of me wanted to hurl a knife at her and yell " do it yourself bitch " but i just asked to wait a few minutes , and i would give her a free sandwich , without the crusts . thankfully she shut up after that , but fuck , i wanted to yell at her .

6. i have a very large advantage in that my father is a huge narcissist . anyhow , this happened when i was digit , however this has happened so many times this is one out of too many to count . it ' s digit am , we ' re at denny ' s , and he ' s just ordered digit minutes ago . apperently he ' s really hungry . he gets up and walks down to the kitchen , and walks into the kitchen . i hear , from half the restaurant away " where the fuck is my food ! i ordered my food an hour ago ! i am never coming back here again ! this is the worst , most despicable customer service i have ever had ! " he then walks back out , and we leave . i ' m sure he made hundred of people feel like shit over the course of a month , let alone the full digit years i ' ve been alive .
