1. sadly that  s a reality of all conflicts , violence does not discriminate however beyond that i don  t know enough about that specific situation to have an opinion .

2. forget about skin color . that  s just completely irrelevant . who cares what color anyone in this story is ? if someone breaks into your home , you have the right to shoot them ! i don  t own a gun but shit like this makes me want to get one . you have a right to protect your home and yourself and the person who broke in is a criminal and should have been aware of the risks ! bring on the downvotes , i don  t care . seems like i  m the only person here with any sense in their head ! why are you sticking up for someone who broke into someone else  s home ? play stupid games , win stupid prizes ! duh !

3. surely there are other avenues to take this information . you reported it to the police department of which luke murray is assigned ? nothing seems to have been done ? take it to another department , go get legal advice , take it to a lawyer , any of these options are better than posting it on reddit , and if this turns out to be a false report then you are committing an act of defamation . i ' m not doubting your honesty , just think you should find another means of having the law look at this accusation .

4. he raped two people . i ' m sorry , but why would we want to prevent this from ruining his life ? let the police deal with this . they ' re pretty good at figuring out what ' s true and what ' s not . you butt out of it and stop defending a rapist .

5. i see the point you  re trying to make . everyone can agree that human slavery is in no way justifiable . at the end of the day this discussion comes down to ethics . on the comment you posted that i had originally commented on you said that the cops should go ahead and handle it themselves instead of sending the k9 . why does the human get the pass to go into danger but not the dog ? the answer is  those cops chose that career . anything that happens beyond that door is on them , they  re there because they love this job and they chose to do this . the only difference was consent . real consent , not forced . the dog , although a very smart animal did not express any decision or have a choice . so here  s where our discussion is going to pretty much come to an end . the dog can  t tell us if it would or would not like to do this . if the dog could speak english and said  i love being a police dog and i want to do this forever  you may be supportive ! dogs can  t speak , but when any animal is raised a certain way and is deprived of any alternatives , no other options in lifestyle are even a thought in their minds . for example  a human child growing up in war , and knows nothing but how to kill and fight and die for their country and has nothing but passion and love for that country could never believe one day that their country isn  t worth dying for . purely because at the stage of puppy or human baby , it  s mental development is heavily influenced by its environment . a german shepard puppy growing up in police training camps with its new assigned k  digit unit police officer is going to know nothing but their trained commands and  i love my owner  . they could love the life or they could dream of something else with no violence . or they could even not have these thoughts at all . we just don  t know . i also want to side with you to say that we shouldn  t put dogs into danger , but we put those puppies in those police camps in the first place for human gain . unfortunately it  s been a trend throughout history to use animals for work or food etc . i don  t like it either honestly . i  m having a hard time disagreeing with you

6. i think it is folly to claim religion or faith are at issue here . you think that without religion this person would not have done this ? the issue is humans are animals and they do some nasty shit . i watched someone set digit people on fire the other day , watched the police shoot a guy in the back and watch him bleed out , watched kids killing insects with glee while their parents watch on , seen soldiers throw puppies off cliff along with many other acts with degrees of nastyness . i don ' t think in most cases these were performed acting as gods right arm or with any religious intent . people do shit because they want to and would probably find an excuse or reasoning to justify their actions . that guy kills because of god , others kill because they play too many video games , others kill because it makes them horny . we are all missing the point . humans are nasty , disgusting pieces of shit and are all capable of horiffic things . its just some people do it where the rest of us don ' t religion or not
