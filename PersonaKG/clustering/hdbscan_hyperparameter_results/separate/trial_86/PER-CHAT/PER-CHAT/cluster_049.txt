1. dude yta she sounds like she lives alone in her apartment so why in the absolute fuck would you take all that food to your family . if you live with your family they feed you don ' t they ? and honestly why would one person make a ton of food . hmm . maybe it ' s because they want leftovers . dude if you manage to stay in this relationship you better count your blessings .

2. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .

3. ah , so that  s the real problem . you  re probably a husband who  s had this same argument with his wife , so here you are to defend it . it would not be any different if the roles were reversed . you  re wife making the money does not excuse her from lifting a finger around the house . it  s not  helping  . it  s her house too . she would not need to  help her husband with the laundry  . she would need to do the damn laundry . every relationship is different but don  t deny the truth . just google search why most divorce happens . women feeling unappreciated and taken for granted is one of the highest reasons for divorce in america . this is for you

4. you can tell him that you appreciate that he wants to get you somehing he thinks is nicer but you like the one you already have . maybe say you ' d rather that extra money goes to something else you ' ve both wanted to fix or change instead .

5. i think that ' s normal to adjust what each of you give in function of your incomes . with my boyfriend we made some calculs with our incomes and we give the same percentage of money for all the month . so when we each give our part , we have the same percentage of money left on our accounts . i don ' t know if it ' s very clear , but i ' m giving you an example . let us suppose that we need digit  for the month for all common costs rent , food , internet , phone , etc . if bf has a salary of digit and i a salary of digit , it means bf brings digit , digit  of incomes and me digit , digit  so i ' ll give digit  and him digit  . we implemented this system when we decided to live together so we ' ve never argued about money . so you ' re making a good choice , money is the first arguing reason , it has to be well thought .

6. to justify spending the money i make , i ask myself " why the hell do you work so hard " it ' s to spend my money they way i want . why do you work so hard to give someone else a comfy life ? they didn ' t take your tests or experience your stress . you have no obligation to pay for someone else just because you make more . also , you ' re not her ex . you ' re you . be you , don ' t try to be them , they split for a reason . to answer your question , i say don ' t compare yourself to someone ' s ex . you can either feel guilty , or you can go broke .
