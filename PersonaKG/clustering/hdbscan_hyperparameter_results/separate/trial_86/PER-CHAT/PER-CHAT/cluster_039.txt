SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 6

1. we are particularly good listeners by nature so that ' s why people tend to dump their problems on us . also , i feel we tend to understand and put ourselves in their position thus being able to say what we might do to help improve the situation . personally speaking , if a friend asks me how i ' m doing i just say i ' m fine since i feel my problems are mine and i don ' t like unwanted advice . so , if i were you i ' d learn how to tune out when people start wittering on about their problems or make yourself unavailable for a while . hope it gets better for you .

2. similar ! i don  t care if my friends go without me but i do care when they insult me . i don  t really care who else insults me whether it be a stranger or family , but if my friends insult me i will think about it for at least two decades and become extremely insecure as a result of it .

4. try to make yourself show only what you want . i have a really good friend , and our relationship is basically founded on me telling stories of my mistakes . don  t worry about them thinking the worst of you , make them see the whole .

6. i find people who have a drinking problem love to judge those who don ' t . i was told once that i ' m only fun when i drink by someone i mostly saw through the bottom of a wine glass , so i stopped drinking and hanging around that person . don ' t allow anyone to cross your boundaries , it ' s not worth it even a little . best of luck !
