2. getting offended and correcting others everytime from your horse doesn ' t make you superior over others . i know he did something wrong and hasn ' t repeated that since but the media should understand that they can do something better by raising awareness on what ' s happening around the world rather than attacking a man over petty issues

4. bro , i highly doubt you can keep an actual conversation with someone that actually has a science degree  take your pretentious ass outta here . as someone in the field , i can assure you there are many individuals with engineering  medical  science degrees from several different backgrounds that have faith in a religion  same way as atheists . you  re just as bad as the bible humping pedos trying to force your perspective on others . the irony in all of this i  ll explain it for you is you baiting the op along with others even though you  re the one that was triggered and felt the need to comment and express your discomfort  that of which , was never really  forced  on you  you can always keep scrolling and living your insignificant life . adios !

10. if they keep that shit to themselves then fine . once they start to verbalize their bigotry then they should understand that whilst they might be free to speak , they are not free from any repercussions .

14. you really simply do not understand logic , do you ? let me spoon feed it to you , since you ' re such a little dumb baby  from your perspective , your beliefs are correct . which means you should be putting them out there . if you ' re right , you ' d be helping people . but you don ' t do that , because you ' re a fucking coward . from a logically sound perspective , however , your beliefs are completely unethical . why ? because you are selfish , and only give a fuck about your emotions while compiling them . as a result , you completely failed to base them on evidence , or reason . if you cared about logic , you wouldn ' t dare believe the bullshit you believe . doing so would be a fucking embarrassment . see , your confusion is what happens when you hide like a little cowardly fucking bitch . this is also what happens when your beliefs have such low standards  you aren ' t accustomed to needing to make sound evaluations , because you don ' t do that to yourself . you ' re logically fat and lazy . so now , you meet someone like me , and you can ' t see the differences between logical arguments that should be obvious simply because you never behaved like you ever had to . see ? those beliefs effected your behavior . they effected your abilities to use reason as a tool for discourse . and because those beliefs have low standards , you have low reasoning ability . if you demanded a high standard of yourself , you would have never made such a basic bitch mistake . see how i ' m right now ? see how beliefs effect behavior in unexpected ways ? you ' re welcome .

18. just recently i was on my school  s subreddit and commented on a post concerning the strike that  s on right now . the post was a rant from an anonymous ta that was full of anger and hatred toward their students . they complained that the school treated them like shit which is why they  re on strike . okay , fine , maybe that  s the case . but then they proceeded to swear at and belittle their own students which makes me want to see their side less . so i posted a comment asking how exactly they were treated poorly and what the whole thing was . i also told them that they should at least try to understand that the strike is financially killing us . i also said that i know it isn  t that simple , but if it  s so bad and it has been for a while , just quit your job . even if it  s hard to find a new one , it  s not worth it . then i got a reply from the same person who posted the rant , under a different account seeing as their old one was deleted , and they threw a whole slew of insults my way . such as  you probably still live with your parents you fucking retard . you don  t understand shit , maybe see the bigger picture before you run your dumbass mouth .  sorry what ? i literally just asked how they were treating you poorly . and i wasn  t even rude . i  m sorry ? i then told them that , i do in fact not live with my parents and if i did so what ? i  m really young . then i asked for them to explain to me , please what exactly is going on with them in terms of how they  re treated so i can understand them better . but instead i got  you  re young so that explains why you  re talking out of your ass . stop rambling on about this fucking shit , you don  t know what you  re talking about .  the fuck ? thankfully people stuck up for me and the ta got downvoted to oblivion . but they had a rebuttal for almost everything and avoided answering any questions in regards to clarifying their rant . the post was then locked due to fear of rising conflict . why does this ta not understand that insulting me makes me want to help and understand them less ? if they had explained themselves it would have been much easier

19. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .

20. well you see since the white male has been the majority for most of history it is now somehow acceptable to discriminate against him . because the idea of everyone being equal doesn ' t apply to " everybody .
