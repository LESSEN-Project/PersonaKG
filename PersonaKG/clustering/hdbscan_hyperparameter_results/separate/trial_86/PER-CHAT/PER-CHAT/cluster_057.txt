1. if 4k editing doesn  t require a gpu idk if it does  i don  t do any myself , then you might want to look at the dell s digit or s digit . i  ve heard they  re good and have really good cpu performance for the battery life , weight and size . if you don  t need a gpu , go for the s digit because you might as well save on size if both the digit and non  gpu digit have the same specs . edit  idk the prices . i  m just recommending what i see everyone else recommending .

2. best value for the money for a novice is the players pure x cue . seyberts they will prolly run you 180ish with digit . 75mm i believe ldc shaft with a kamui soft tip on them . i have been using mine for digit months and i have nothing but good things to say . you can also buy the shaft separately or any other shaft which i think is a good option as well for you if you really like your butt . me personally i like to look at and touch all different butts

3. look for the fabric percentages . generally speaking a designer peacoat with roughly digit  wool or more will cost between digit  digit . thats a pretty good budget target . schott nyc is considered the flagship in this range . a really good deal right now is actually abercrombie which has a digit   naval peacoat at  digit . great deal bang for the buck in my opinion . as usually anything under digit will get you a digit  wool blend or less . in fact lands end ' s peacoat is digit  wool and its selling for about  digit . which shows that a  f has a pretty good bang for the buck deal right now .

4. apr should be the only consideration . ask an accountant that is not a complete moron , they all agree . you will not be able to keep paying it off every month forever , something always happens . your comment is digit  wrong .

5. look up " which cherry mx switch should i get " and also i recommend getting a keypad  macropad with interchangeable switches if your budget is low and just in case you dont like the switches you choose , i bought the amusingkeypad pro and it works fine for me but i switched to gateron clears .
