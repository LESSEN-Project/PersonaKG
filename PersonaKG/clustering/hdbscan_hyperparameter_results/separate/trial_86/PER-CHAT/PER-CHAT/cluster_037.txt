1. people are seldom rational about their sexuality . the flip side is that being in a relationship is so socialized into people from an early age that they fail to recognize that it  s an active decision that you need to make with another person and then participate in , the latter involving a continuous renewal of  wanting it  . you can look at others and feel sexually charged ! that  s human , but failing to recognize the decision you  ve made to be in a relationship is an active process is something that a lot of people end up screwing up . it  s not to make it sound like a chore ! certainly too there are other configurations of and agreements to relationships , but the primary recognition , as far as i  m concerned , is that you have to be an adult and responsible for making a choice to be in it . otherwise , why bother ?

2. its more the " it ' s ok for me to have slept with a lot of people  have sex on the first date because i ' m a guy . but if a girl does it , she ' s a slut . " that ' s a problem imo . if you ' re not being hypocritical than i don ' t think it ' s an issue . i think there is some on the reverse too  " it ' s ok for me to have slept with someone of the same gender , i ' m a woman . but if a guy does it , he ' s gay . " basically  don ' t shame someone you wouldn ' t have them shame you for .

3. but isn ' t this the natural thing to do ? didn ' t evolution say the " hotter " girls are the ones to survive ? just as the more tough , brute force boys are to attract the girls ? denying this almost seems the same to me as trying to convince gay people they should be straight . i ' m all in favor of promoting intelligence , but then we end up with kids that sit behind computers or grow up and sit behind desks all day at work and slowly fatten and waste away . why can ' t we promote kids to be both good looking and smart ? self  esteem is important , both in your personal hygiene  grooming habits , and in your intelligence . i agree super  model only mentality is wrong , but we need a healthy balance , not a swing shift to the other extreme of how we talk to little girls . tell them they look good and they ' re smart .

4. being a male i ' ve never had a period so i honestly feel it would be pretty disrespectful to voice that sort of opinion towards any female as i haven ' t experienced it myself . it ' s like someone painting a wall and somebody else comes up and says your taking a long time . how do they know what it ' s like or the problems that can arise if they haven ' t got any experience of what i ' m doing ? i choose just to be supportive .

5. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .

6. okay but what about men who sleep around ? it  s fine to think this as long as you hold men to the same standard
