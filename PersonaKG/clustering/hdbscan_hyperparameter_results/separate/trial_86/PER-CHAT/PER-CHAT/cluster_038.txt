1. as a veteran , i don ' t expect anyone to go out of their way at all to improve my life . i chose the path i did knowing that i was sacrificing my safety and freedoms to serve the people of the united states . it wouldn ' t feel right to take some big reward . i don ' t need a parade or free stuff or hero worship , and all of those things would make me feel uncomfortable , especially knowing guys who deserve it a hell of a lot more than me . a parking space might not take much effort or be a life changing benefit to veterans , but it shows us that you care and you remember the sacrifices we made and the brothers we lost , and that ' s the most important thing i could ask for .

2. in all fairness , sometimes it works out for people to hire someone to assemble it , especially if they ' ve got multiple complicated pieces . it might take an inexperienced person with no tools a day or two of frustration and sore hands to finish , when they ' d rather take only half a day off work , and spend a day ' s wages paying someone else to put it together in a few hours . my dad assembles furniture for a living , he charges  digit   hr when it ' s just him digit  digit   hr if he takes one of his kids to help , though a lot of that is to cover expenses and taxes for running his own business . so i ' m glad there are lazy people .

4. its all about about perceived status . people like believe if the pay someone for a service then it somehow places them in a position of authority over them . i work in the service industry and deal with this all the time . mostly from the housewife crowd .

5. that is not mainly what we are talking about . sure , occasionally you will wait on a foreign guest but that is not happening all the time . also , most people do tend to do some general research about a country before they just go set foot over there . the tipping culture in america is fairly well known and it  s depicted in their media regularly . but i stand by my original comment , if you are foreign and you come to america and learn about the customs and then say that that  s stupid and you  re not going to tip , you are a cheap asshole .
