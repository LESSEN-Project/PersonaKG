3. oh , thank you for the compliment  to divulge the circumstances though , it was on the way home from my last shift of the week and we didn  t discover the break until a few weeks later  so i actually had a few days to recover and by the time the injury was apparent it had already made enough progress to be ignorable my only regret is that i  ve got a four inch ridge of bone or tissue or something back there along the crack because of the way it healed . i  ll wear a hat until i die i think

7. the craving i had was more emotional than physical , if that makes sense . i was having a bad day and for whatever reason started thinking about my grandmother and thanksgiving and turkey . i was a sobbing mess . but i didn  t end up having meat until after the baby was born . but even then i had no digestion issues .

8. so , this gets removed , but others such as the plane one and the dude staring into the fire whilst burning a fake slave neckchain is ok ? this promotes discussions about the show and is interesting and different .

17. i have only done it a few times and i try to be discreet and watch it while filming . the last time was last year and i posted it to the fan group on fb and youtube . i try to enjoy a live show when i am there but sometimes you get a good seat with a great view and your favorite song comes on and everyone in the venue sings along and you are glad you taped it . i don ' t get those people who film the entire show , especially in portrait orientation .

18. producing an average digit episode anime costs around  digit million , and if you want to provide animators with a liveable wage , especially in america , that ' s going to increase quite significantly . and that ' s when the studios are already established . so i ' d say start by building up some capital .

19. as a girl , i ' d say all my " firsts " , i think i should have waited for the right guy
