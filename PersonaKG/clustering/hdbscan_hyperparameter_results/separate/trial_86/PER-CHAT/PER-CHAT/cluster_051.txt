2. ugh , thank you so much . i feel like it ' s all out of my control , and if i think about it too hard , i start believing all the lies the anxiety and depression start to manifest . thank you so much for making me feel better . i know it ' s all gonna be okay , but anxiety makes it so hard to remember that .

3. thank you ! writting nice things is one of the things that keep me going . i know you will . life has a strange way of always changing the staus quo . if you are happy , that ' s gonna change soon . if you are sad , that too is gonna change sooner or later . you just have to pretend it will be sooner rather than later .
