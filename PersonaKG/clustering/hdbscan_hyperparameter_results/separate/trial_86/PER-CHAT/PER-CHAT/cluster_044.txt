Total from this dataset: 7

1. from your pics the 38mm looks far better . if anything , the 42mm looks a little too large to my eye . but really , don ' t worry about what other people say . you ' ll be the one looking at it most of the time so buy something that you ' ll be happy with .

2. i think you ' re good as you are . never listen to these negative people , just ignore them . your hair looks pretty nurtured  normal , and your breasts might be smaller but that is completely okay , there is nothing wrong with you ma ' am !

3. bravissimo is an amazing place to go . the ladies there just look at you and find the right fit and style for you . for example in a plunge bra i need a 34hh but full cup i go with a 36h . many of the brands they carry are similar in sizing . if you find you are bigger than a d cup i would strongly recommend freya as a brand  comfortable and long lasting . when fitting on bras you might find that you ' re not looking for the right signs . there should be no pain , but the straps and the back are just as important as the cups . always try it on the loosest setting . you shouldn ' t be able to put more than digit fingers in between your sternum and the bra . and the underwires at the front should sit flat on your chest . some cuts and styles don ' t work for everyone , another example , i cannot wear balconette bras , they just don ' t agree with my boobs . hope some of this helps ! look after your boobies and they will look after you .

5. i have to agree with regenboog as you progress through your transition you will feel more comfortable with yourself and your femininity will come through nauturally . clothes are a different matter , if you are pre hrt , its really about how confident you are .

6. dude , you ' re fine as in , " nothing to worry about . you ' ve already got all the suggestions you need . not ugly at all and you actually look quite friendly and approachable , as well .

7. i agree with this . it is impossible to tell someone how they should feel about themselves . but for whatever it ' s worth let me say i imagine you make most men horny . i hope you get what you need from the labiaplasty .
