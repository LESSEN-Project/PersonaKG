3. i don ' t know how to describe this . you guys remember the intro credit ' s to saved by the bell ? it was all cartoon  ish , greens and pinks and other colours swirling around the place ? i would like that general aesthetic to pop into my life again once in a while . i never see it anywhere anymore . everything is so beige or minimal now . gimme my colourful swirly trash !

4. i had never heard this until now . very nice . one of my favorites is ' feel the tide ' . but my all time favorite is ' the cave ' . dancing around my now wife ' s small college apartment listening to mumford and sons for the first time as she sings and we make cheap noodles and lemon pepper chicken is literally one of my favorite memories .

5. i love it ! i think this theme is way better than last year . the bathroom looks great , and i love the vintage  inspired wall paper throughout the house . i think the theme  based comps will be really fun , too . i hope they do a color  wars comp that would be a great food comp , which i doubt they ' ll bring back .
