1. i think that they could ' ve done a couple releases with both versions . the original plan was much more interesting not to mention realistic but they had to make a kids movie

5. i feel like it wouldn  t be so good honestly . i know i shouldn  t judge a book by its cover but the movie  s plot seems too bizarre to me .

6. i mean there having the original cast of zombieland for the sequel , so that does seem possible .

8. true , but if joji does play frank one last time for this , he can  t do the voice for long since his throat got damaged from doing it for a long time , he also won  t do comedy since he said he was done with franks comedy

9. is that actually what ends up happening , or is that just the idea ? i still haven ' t watched those movies , haven ' t figured out a legal way to do so cheaply so i can ' t speak at all to what goes on in iw .

10. that feels like lazy writing to me . things on got are rarely black and white , so to have this mysterious storyline that ' s been developing for the entire series only to end abruptly with no explanation other than some stupid superhero movie villain arc destroy all of mankind mwahaha is a disservice to the entire show .
   (ID: 169c51cc138a4161080068ded4dcf87863ffee36)

11. nah man , even if you put the scenes in chronological order it still has no plot . i  ve tried to appreciate the movie , but nothing happens . compared to other tarantino movies , even ones light on story like kill bill , it doesn  t hold up .
   (ID: c418fa452eafbca022ce1c49b521d4574aa77cd1)

12. it is . we even get a scene during the time travel sequence where the future captain america fights the past captain america . the captain america from the past says " i can do this all day " and the future captain america says " i know " .
