1. your relationship sounds absolutely awful and i have no idea why you ' re still in it .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

2. girl . i don ' t even know you . and i don ' t care if you are a hundred pounds " overweight " . a relationship shouldn ' t make you feel bad . it should encourage you to be your best self , not guilt you into it . i don ' t like the way this sounds , as it sounds very degrading and hurtful to you . your body should have no influence on how much he loves and respects you .
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

3. you ' re not a failure because you had a panic attack . you didn ' t choose to , you didn ' t want it , we can ' t blame ourselves for things out of our control . i hope you win your fight .
   (ID: 68d36e5b5d26327bbb5de8de16430cc93353cbf0)

4. how do i tell a guy who thinks things are going well that i just want to be friends without hurting their feelings or making them hate me ? " hey , x , i ' m only interested in being friends " that ' s all you have to do . if a dude doesn ' t respect that and back off , or if they start resenting you , they were never your friend to begin with and you ' re better off without them . " leading them on " implies you ' re doing that intentionally to get something out of it . obviously that ' s not the case , so you really aren ' t doing anything wrong here . you ' re not obligated to give people a chance romantically , and if you aren ' t into them , it ' s arguably worse to tell them you ' re interested in them romantically when you aren ' t . if you aren ' t compatible and you know you ' re not interested , don ' t go down that path . however they react is on them , and if they get shitty with you for saying that you ' d rather be friends , they were a shit friend because they never actually intended to be your friend .   x200b

5. you ' re taking the cowards way out by ghosting him after saying you ' d give him a second chance . you should practice saying what you mean and meaning what you say . people might like you more
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

6. first of all , get help second , distract yourself . it can be hard now but find something you like to do . it worked for me one day at a time
   (ID: e216f2a1e0d7d814b7ad58452ce6ac21e0b763fc)

7. i understand both of your perspectives . for you , seeing ryan get angry , aggressive and violent is likely triggering your emergency response that you felt when you were on the receiving end with walter . it  s awful . for him , he clearly loves you so much that seeing the piece of shit that hurt you , after a few drinks i assume too , he couldn  t stand to see walter out and having fun , escaping any form of justice for his actions . your argument is concerning . the way he views domestic violence survivors is extremely concerning , especially for a nurse . my advice is to have a rational , calm discussion . explain how his actions made you feel , particularly if they did trigger anything to do with your abuse . also try and understand from his perspective why he lashed out . you know him . but the most concerning thing is how he talked about your abuse . ask him if he honestly sees you as you , not as the dv survivor . he needs to understand that that abuse happened to you but you are not your abuse . at the end of the day , the best advice i  ve ever been given is to apply your situation to someone you love and care deeply about . what advice would you give that person ? you deserve safety , security and happiness . i hope it works out for you sparkling  heart

8. i can ' t tell you how long it will last , but i can tell you that most likely you will not get burned like that again because you won ' t love unconditionally like that again . at least i didn ' t . it is actually kind of refreshing to know that i am now the one that is emotionally in control of my relationships now .
   (ID: 90492fed4b9d785ee43d655875f81a82e68a1263)

9. definitely say something . call her , though . tone can be kind of difficult to determine through text and you don ' t need want to give her any more reasons to push you away even more . " hey , insert sister name . how you doing , casual chatting , blah blah blah . i need to talk to you about something . i feel insert everything you just told us . i know it ' s your wedding and you can do whatever you want , but i ' m starting to think that you don ' t even want me there . if not , that ' s fine bc you ' re kind of being a bitch and i could do without all the cross country trips . if you genuinely want me to be a part of the wedding , then act like it and maybe ease up a little bit " . feel free to modify to your liking .

10. i think the worst thing you can do in a relationship is expect the other person to know what you ' re thinking , wanting , or feeling . i ' m introverted and keep things to myself , but i knew things were vastly different with her when i felt comfortable telling her my insecurities , dreams , and pretty much everything about me  i actually found myself wanting to share all of that with her . it may sound overly simple , but we communicated really well from the get  go .

11. thank you . i don ' t blame myself in a way that isn ' t realistic . i blame myself for not being aware of the warning signs of what happened to me . that ' s about the extent . i don ' t harbor any unhealthy emotions and though i suffer mildly from ptsd i am conscious enough to work on my issues . with that being said . yes , i am still with my boyfriend . the truth of the matter is that he simply isn ' t emotionally mature enough to understand the depths of what had happened . i did threaten to break up with him . the first couple of times he said it to me i didn ' t stand up for myself . i don ' t know why . but the last time he said it i really stuck it to him . i realized that if he thinks this way i can ' t possibly marry someone who will think like that and i told him that . i also told him i will happily leave because i know i wouldn ' t be suffering a loss if that ' s the way he is thinking . for the first time in all the time i have known him he stopped and gave me a very heart felt apology taking accountability for his lack of sympathy and understanding . quite frankly , a lot of other things were said . but it was true and i know he meant it . this is still a red flag for me . if i am suffering from something in the future , am i going to have to be the one to walk him through it too ? just because i am more emotionally equipped to handle ? he ' s not a horrible person . but he is selfish in his thinking . and he is emotionally sheltered . after digit years i am starting to wonder if i want to be the one who does all of the picking up .

12. basically at the end of this year it is as if the whole world shattered for me and i had the possibility to start again . during the summer i got the chance to create some new great friendships , i joined the scouts and most of my current friends all come from that group and i finally built memories i want to remember . it is something i never felt because i ' ve always been classified as weird and i rarely met people really interested in me . so when i met this girl circa four years ago and she made me believe we were friends , she became my world if it makes sense . she manipulated me very easily and then she left me roughly once i started questioning her ways . now i can see through her crap and the only reason i don ' t want to see her anymore is that i feel like everything has changed and i don ' t want to get back to that world of rumors and fake friendships .

13. yasss , i ' ve been asked out by girls twice big pp energy and said no both times . it ' s not even all about the girl tho one time it was just about where i ' m at and weather i want to be in a relationship at the moment . in terms of physical appearance i honestly can only think of two girls i even know of that i like okay she ' s not that cute . the rest are all cute , still wouldn ' t go on a date with digit  of them though just cause of differences in personality and all that . girls don ' t have some magic power , but neither do guys . asking anyone out is a chance . saying that however i still think girls should start asking guys out more . not under the assumption they will definitely say yes , cause they wont . but just because who should guys be the ones always asking girls out .

14. digit you don  t have to meet him if you don  t want to . lots of people never really get closure , and that sucks , but really what is the goal here anyways ? you could easily exchange longer messages over email or something and give him closure that way . digit why are you so concerned about the image he has of you ? are you hoping that something will be rekindled ? otherwise i feel shattering that image that he has of you will probably just help him move on and you won  t have to hear from the ex again . digit even if you do meet up , you don  t actually have to reveal any information about yourself that you don  t want to . just keep it vague . there  s nothing wrong with just broadly answering  i  m taking out some time to figure out my life , i  ve grown out of x interest  etc . if the subject of what you  re doing these days comes up .

15. yeah this is bad man . very bad . that ' s emotional cheating . it ' s legitimate cheating . you ' ve known for a while that your wife loves attention from men . this is problematic . i think the best solution is separation and possibly divorce . you said it yourself , you feel like the bond that you had with her has been broken . don ' t think twice about it because christmas is around the corner . your wife is a cheater . she requires validation from other men that aren ' t her husband . you were there every night after work for her when you were newlyweds . it ' s never good enough for her . you deserve better , op .
   (ID: 8f33db98a9fa29c8f9e44012d79de72291a29519)

16. no you handled it well . i would of done the exact same thing . think of it this way  if he did kill his self and you didn ' t inform anyone , you would feel a lot worse . you ' ve done the right thing . you ' ve broken up with him and told several people so now it ' s their job to look out for him . not yours . you are free .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

17. bad break up ? if so you got to let it go . if not , then go outside and explore somewhere where people are accepting , like a sports bar or social clubs or something where you can add to peoples conversations
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

18. i think you ' re trying to learn but i would not say that a lot of guys are bordering on aspergers . plenty enough are smooth . plenty have empathy . sales principles help build armor . approach anyone you find attractive or seems like a nice person and strike up a conversation particularly if you are shy . this will help you learn to read people as well as show people you are friendly and respectful . when people don ' t wish to engage move on asap . analyze it shortly thereafter but you ' ll getter sense of when to approach people any gender for any reason . and since they won ' t all be romantic interests you won ' t get the shot down feeling if someone doesn ' t want to chat each time . make some female friends who are only friends even if they are blood relatives . they can play wing for you and perhaps accelerate your learning .

19. you  re so strong for making the decision you did though , just remember that . you  re worth so much more than the way he was treating you and you knew that  i hope you realise how amazing that is . so many people haven  t got as far as you have face  blowing  a  kiss
   (ID: 726d5aaac9472ccdcb64345cd6d082bee4eae6fa)

20. text this girl while stone cold sober ! and apologize for sending her the text . admit that you were wasted and that it was irresponsible and disrespectful of you to send the text . apologize and ask her if she can forgive you . if you do this you will be admiting that you did something wrong and that you ' re truly sorry that it happened . even if she doesn ' t respond at least you can take solace to the fact that you owned up to it and are sorry .
