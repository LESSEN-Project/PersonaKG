3. well , i doubt even rockstar knows what it will be about , but your idea is quite great . however , i really have a heart for the specific part of redemption , so i would like to see another character whose path to redemption we get to see , and dutch or hosea we already know they don ' t exactly do .

4. i  d be most excited for a full f4 team  doc doom , and not technically new champs but i feel like some mcu versions of characters like sw , drax , gamora , and others would be cool .

5. i don ' t see a superman game being challenging enough considering how over powered he is . i would go with beyond game .

6. i definitely agree with that boss and the kotor characters . seems like a good time to implement them since no movies are coming out so they could be filler characters .
