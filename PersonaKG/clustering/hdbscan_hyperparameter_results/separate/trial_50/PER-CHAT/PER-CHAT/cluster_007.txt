2. not said , really , but vocalized all the same . so i was sitting on the bus on the way home from high school , and over the years , you come to know most of the other kids on the bus , by name at least . so one of my bus  bound acquaintances in the grade ahead of me , let ' s call her claire , at the start of the bus ride starts laughing about something . now as claire was sitting directly behind me and allegedly having just been told one hell of a zinger , the laugh was loud . loud enough that it really hurt my ear . my first instinct was to reel around and produce an equally loud , pitch perfect imitation of said laugh . claire just looked me dead in the eyes and said " wesleyrobertsimpson , i did not appreciate that . " i ' ll never forget that moment , nor forgive myself for it . tl  dr  never genuinely insult somebody else ' s laugh , you ' ll never forgive yourself .
