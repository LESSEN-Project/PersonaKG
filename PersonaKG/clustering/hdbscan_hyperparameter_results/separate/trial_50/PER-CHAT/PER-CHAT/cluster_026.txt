Total from this dataset: 273

1. why ask a question if you ' re going to incorrectly assume the answer ? i know you were trying to be sarcastic , but it just comes off as smug . i ' m sure you could convince me and others of your argument if you actually tried , but that doesn ' t seem to be your goal here . if you do want to engage in meaningful discussion , i ' m all ears .

2. are you just downvoting people not conforming to your sensitivities ! we are the people you asked for " help . i was right
   (ID: cd0b72d117bf74908c3edaaf3947b089a9dafc0c)

3. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .

4. you have to be a pretentious douche all the time ? i  m sorry if i hurt your feelings talking about michael moore an al gore . what i mean by that was , they hype everything up , and act like they  re the only ones with the answer . in short , they  re tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist , who don  t believe their own lies

5. i was being funny .  shrug  it ' s friday  it happens . if your beliefs or lack thereof are dependent on what other people say , then you need to think some more before engaging in such discourse .

6. but all these things will still happen under socialism . tis is a problem of corruption and conflicts of interest of people writing the laws that enable things like this .
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

7. i feel like our vetting process might be lacking . i don ' t have a real basis for this other than media which leads to a feeling . for instance . i dislike the concept of queue jumping . i want all new immigrants to have security checks and yes , this is bad , but i want more checks for males from the middle east . sorry . but that ' s the truth .
   (ID: f3ae09adef0439462c1015647ee30c8f5b91ac56)

8. it ' s not an argument , i just don ' t understand why it ' s a big deal .
   (ID: c1ea1cc276ed8215509b41a6cc0ff57ac912a19d)

9. there ' s so much wrong in what you wrote . you obviously don ' t know anything about jesus . you probably never even opened a bible before . you just say what you decided , on your own terms , everything you wrote . you just hate trump so much that you got your head up your bum . you just did a paradox on yourself there bub . you successfully wrote a hate speech against people who you assume are hating on others . you hating on people who hate , so you hate yourself !

10. it ' s just that you refused to address my points or say anything but lol you are stupid , since you are so far beneath me and you lack the intellectual capacity for rational discussion i have moved on to doing something better with my time . you know it as well as i do that socialism will when you ' re watching it happen on tv every day and you ' re burned up with impotent rage . i don ' t give a shit what you say about me because i have people in my life who actually love me and care about me unlike trump supporters who are disowned by their own children do to how awful they are .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

11. fair point and i fully agree with you , but you " should  have hidden paxter redwyne ' s username , or seek him out in the forum and inform him that you have exposed his opinion here . because as it is he sounds like an ignorant and may not even know . he deserves a right to reply and clarify his opinion  correct his mistake .
   (ID: 67ef96fb30756c49a9ffdff2579058eb2a3c1398)

12. my my , you do a fine job of " discussing . you screech some hate , you lie and insult me . you sound like every other fox  addled right wing fascist the question is , if you live up to the stereotype , then why shouldn ' t i think badly of you ?

14. all i  m trying to say is , if their goal is to include everyone , why exclude white people ? yes we have done horrible things in the past , but we changed
   (ID: 021c01b3e15fb3077444bd9abdbc0d7c390239b0)

16. getting offended and correcting others everytime from your horse doesn ' t make you superior over others . i know he did something wrong and hasn ' t repeated that since but the media should understand that they can do something better by raising awareness on what ' s happening around the world rather than attacking a man over petty issues
   (ID: 43361d3d352286328dcb058ec017ca0e2d364601)

17. to say that nationalist is more dangerous than muslims that bomb , rape and pillage regular civilians then yes i would say you are far left and you obviously is not very smart if you think that it ' s dumb

18. holy sheets face  with  open  mouth this is the first time someone has responded intellectually and respectfully to me when i let it be known in a trump supporter . i have been in this politics arena since grade school , along with world history , from the time it was introduced to me as a child . i absolutely love these two topics . but i hate so much that we can no longer talk about these things . everyone loves to speak on the at  right extremism . but i become a racist or bigot when i point out left  wing extremist like karl marx and what his ideology brought about in places like russia less then digit years ago . i just want to point out to people that we are playing with fire with these semantics being thrown about on a whim . a intelligent person could never believe that the german population would support a fascist extremist who would murder perhaps digit million jews . but a seed of hate was planted a decade prior . during the depression . in the 30s the jews were made to be the villains because of their " wealth and privilege " so later when the gov started rounding these people up , nobody cared to help . this is what the seed of division brings us . history proves it hundreds of times over . we are americans , but when they divide us we are the nobody ' s they ' ve made us . skin color means nothing , wealth means nothing , sexual orientation means nothing , sex means nothing . they are all tools of division so we have to look to them for the solution . if the whites were gone perhaps the blacks could finally prosper . if the guns were gone perhaps the murders will stop . if everyone had health care perhaps nobody would get sick and die from silly shit . if we had open borders perhaps everyone could freely share in the american dream . but do you think that once the whites were gone the " elites " would stop telling the blacks they are victims ? i don ' t think so , then they would lose their control . if you belive they have some kind of control if we take away the guns , are we taking away the carnal desire to murder as well ? and will the government protect us and empower us , or would they stand on our necks ? i don ' t want to know . if we provide healthcare for all , who ' s in charge of that ? how much will it cost ? and why would it cost that ? they say digit trillion , but why ? why is a blood test digit  why is a x  ray digit , digit  ? if the government can force me to pay digit  income tax for healthcare for all . then why the hell can ' t the government force the doctors and hospitals to drop their prices to make universal healthcare affordable and not a pipe dream ? if we open the borders and let everyone enjoy the american dream . the simple fact is , the consequences of that are we will no longer be able to provide an " american dream " to anyone . this is the best place on earth because we have the best people on earth in between its borders . not everyone is good for you , not everyone belongs here with the best . plain and simple . regular life experiences proves this . the fact that we have prisons prove this . i ' m truly saddened . i ' m saddened my the left and the right . donald trump came in as a man who could turn things around for conservatives . an outsider with outside ideas , and outside money . democrats need someone to step up and take the reigns as well . that ' s the only way of beating trump in digit . a strong outsider , not influenced by nancy and chuck . there ' s is a vacuum that needs to be filled . i pray for the sake of the world it isn ' t someone like ocasio  cortez from ny .
   (ID: fa749ff7262da656e34f21f4b902bd5287bf224d)

19. i was just answering op  s question . sorry if my response offended you . if you don  t want to have in depth discussions about the show and waste your time , why even browse this subreddit ? that  s kind of the point . i love the show how it is i was just giving my opinion of what i would do if i could change it . no need to get upset .
   (ID: 9d6763f3caa1ca2559f1a3c525c70ffea81a61c2)

20. insular people have always done this to protect their own worldview . races , religions , ethnicities , classes , etc . they  ve all been scapegoated and hated for no solid reason because one group feels threatened . i dislike religion because of the use of dogma to legitimize cruelty , but worst of all is hypocrisy . conservatives want to claim to be about individual liberty , unless they feel so inclined to limit any particular group on a whim . christians want to claim to be a bastion of love and patience , but only for a small subset of people who personally serve their agendas . it  s not a difference in opinion that separates you from most of them , it  s iq points !
