1. it has significantly more edm than the first two albums but i still like it better than infamous . i ' m not sure this band will ever get back to the levels of geeving , maybe if they get a better screamer because angelo sounds pretty bad , but i can hope right ?

2. i agree with most of the changes on this list . i truly love the books , but in many ways i think the show is more rewarding to it ' s viewers  fans .

3. imo , it ' s a little too smallville . i ' ll give it time because i love the character but the effects are cheesy , the character buildup was too fast , and it ' s nowhere near the quality of arrow . but the last episode was the best yet .

4. yep . tbh i don ' t mind gameplay that doesn ' t exactly mirror the game . i don ' t care how " realistic " it is . but i do care about how fair it is . the one thing that hasn ' t been changed is the mechanic that helps the losing team , prevents too long of a winning streak or too long of a losing streak . that ea bs that tries to keep us wanting to improve and being reassured that we can be good at the game . it is soooo morally wrong , and i containing my rage is an act of heroic zen buddhism i ' m aware this is an oxymoron .

5. i would argue now ! but everyone gets nostalgic for their own eras . to this day i think ffvii is the greatest game ever made .

6. king ' s x was a such a great band . big wreck is still doing some good 90s sounding rock .

7. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .

8. actually , seeing as adventure time has a huge following of people who love it so much , and it ' s gotten a lot of praise from professional critics , you ' re the one who ' s a lot more likely to be wrong here . just because you don ' t like something doesn ' t make it bad . do you even have a legitimate reason to hate at ? how many episodes did you even watch ? you can dislike something all you want , but your opinion does not decide how good or bad something actually is . at is a quality show , whether you like it or not .

9. i see what you mean . i ' ve never played reach ' s multiplayer so i can ' t say much about the problems you mentioned , though they do seem pretty bad . personally my main draws were more from the single player modes , especially campaign . i thought the alien invasion story was actually quite good , since it showed how massive and powerful the covenant was , and how ill  equipped the humans really were to fight them . it was definitely more grounded and military  based than the other games , but i personally liked that sense of desperation and scale the setting gave off .

10. i liked the books , but they ' re not great , i agree . they ' re easy to read , which is part of their appeal . i do like the large number of characters and how they keep crossing paths , often times without realizing it . i do find the plotting and backstabbing interesting , and the mystery of some of the schemes so you don ' t quite know who ' s is telling the truth or lying or is simply being an ass , it ' s more obvious in the show , so it takes away some of the mystery and guessing . i do like fantasy . i read the lord of the rings trilogy as a kid , and another couple series that i absolutely adore redwall , and the wheel of time but i consider those truer fantasy than got , but maybe that is the appeal of the show . it ' s fantasy , but also somehow more relatable , more realistic , in a way , so it ' s not as " hardcore " fantasy , if that makes sense .

11. fellow xbone player here . i played about digit hours of bf1 and after about digit hours in bfv i honestly prefer it ' s gameplay for the most part . it ' s lacks content and it ' s fairly buggy though not game  breaking for the most part , but we ' re finally getting a frequent flow of maps now , and the bugs aren ' t as bad as they used to be . now ' s probably the best time to get into it , before you get too behind on unlocking weapons etc .

12. which is exactly why j . j . is trying desperately to change the dumpster fire that last jedi was . the reception from the fans was so positive that solo was boycotted by tons of people . that ' s why all you hear is how great the last jedi was and how the star wars properties plans and movie outlays were drastically altered due to the huge positive response to it . you guys liked it sure but the idea that a small minority did not like it is ludicrous . the facts show that it damaged the whole series .

13. ok so for me origins story really disappointed me the combat was great and what not but the levels and and story killed it for me . the story was good at first but as soon as the order of the ancients came into play it just got repetitive , find info track them down kill them repeat . i would do a mission and it would say be one level and then the engines would be digit levels higher sometimes . in odyssey the story doesn  t feel like that to me , it feels different . i prefer kassandra over bayek just better character in my opinion . and i can really appreciate how much variety it gives me in options to level up . oh and i like the new kind of abilities you get instead of what was in origins . just ask if you would me to elaborate on this more .

14. i think the movie is better than the series mostly because the movie used the lyrics

15. couldn  t agree with you more . yes it wasn  t a perfect remake but it was pretty damn close in my books . if people don  t like remakes , i get that . but i can  t understand why people on reddit hate on this movie otherwise . i  m not sure what people who didn  t like it would have changed . the video said jungle book was better ? how ? they were almost the same in turns of animation . i liked it . my friends liked it . like you said the original will always be number one in my heart . but this was a damn fine movie in its own right .

16. i don ' t care if everyone else thinks bojack horseman is a good show , i think it falls flat in several areas . the show has a pretty bad hit  miss ratio with jokes , i don ' t care about most of the characters , and i think critics largely love it because a lot of the show is about show business . anyways , i ' ve seen every episode .

17. no way ! i grew up on the prequels so i have the nostalgia goggles going on . that being said , i rewatched them last year after years of not seeing them and view them differently now . i like the phantom menace , but still think jar jar and anakin significantly make the movie worse . i do hate that the actors suffered immensely after the film but that doesn  t change that their movie parts sucked .

18. tbh there are a lot of 2d games that are better than hzd , such as super mario bros digit and digit . i ' m not saying this game doesn ' t have its niche fanbase that will replay it people such as yourself , i ' m saying it wont be the sort of timeless game that continues getting new players into it years and years after release . it will instead fade into obscurity . the reason it wont age well is , as i mentioned , the fact that it ' s a copied and pasted open world format in an already overrsaturated genre . and it ' s boring .

19. yeah , the potato faces bug me , as far as i can ' t tell races apart very easily in oblivion . but honestly , my biggest complaint is the voice acting , it takes me right out of character anytime i hear a voice . i will get through oblivion , i love the story , and the quests i ' ve done so far are fun , but like i said there are aspects that just drive me nuts . not that skyrim is perfect , it ' s just much much better in my mind . but because i ' ve seen a lot of morrowind is text based i feel i still might enjoy it . and i know most fans see it as the pinnacle of the series . it really makes me wish i started playing es with morrowind , not skyrim so it won ' t feel like a completely different game .

20. it does a good job at being a shooter , the single player is just an after thought , i really hate when games don ' t have a worthwhile single player mode to them because some weird reason most develpers probably don ' t even know but just go along with it because everyone does it . i am not a fan of multiplayer especially not online i don ' t know i just don ' t like it . so splatoon went in my opinion from interesting to it is a good concept . it is just focused on multiplayer and the single player seems to have no replay value
