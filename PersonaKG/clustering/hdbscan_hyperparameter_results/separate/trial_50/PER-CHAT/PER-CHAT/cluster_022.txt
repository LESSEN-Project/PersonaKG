1. there are plenty of mid  range commanders who don ' t go all  out and combo out in the first few turns but still provide a decent amount of utility . i made an anafenza deck  the other day which is not exactly powerful , but lots of fun to play and can still steal wins every now and again . build what seems like fun rather than what will utterly crush your opponents and make everyone upset with you . as for the number of decks , as many as you want ! i have digit currently , and it lets me flip between them depending on my mood .

2. chi brew is better for single target  with serenity , and eventually when you get digit  set and a higher ilvl and class trinket let ' s say average digit  you ' ll want to run chi explosion  ascension for multi and single , as it just gets easier to manage with very little difference in dps . i might be wrong about the last bit as its been a while since i ' ve gone and played ww , mostly brm at the moment . the most important thing to remember is that this is a game , and   you have to play it my way or not at all   personal preference takes precedence over min  maxing unless you prefer to min  max and like doing as well as you possibly can .

3. with a 75hz monitor the going would be the best investment . well darn face  with  tears  of  joy . you can always go headset later . hmm . that ' s a tough call . you can most likely upgrade to the i7 varent of that socket and be fine for years to come but would you rather save that money and put it to a new system is the question . gpu can go in any system you want it the cpu is socket based so i see the hesitation . what is your gpu currently ?

4. like i said , i very rarely see arc grenades beingusedmore can ' t even remeber the last time i saw one , so i see no point in nerfing them further . as for ronin and monarch , i could agree on monarch but ronin needs the arc wave because it ' s literally his only somewhat ranged ability . i get he ' s supposed a cqc titan but that ' s why his ablilites help him close the gap . good point . the weapon balance would be very differnet without as much aim assist . ironically , you ' re forgetting about aim assist in this scenario . the increased difficulty for console players to track is moslty negeted with that , so " high speed " grapple slingsohts even though i don ' t think i ' ve ever seen one pulled off myself are weaker overall compared to pc imo .

5. look for the fabric percentages . generally speaking a designer peacoat with roughly digit  wool or more will cost between digit  digit . thats a pretty good budget target . schott nyc is considered the flagship in this range . a really good deal right now is actually abercrombie which has a digit   naval peacoat at  digit . great deal bang for the buck in my opinion . as usually anything under digit will get you a digit  wool blend or less . in fact lands end ' s peacoat is digit  wool and its selling for about  digit . which shows that a  f has a pretty good bang for the buck deal right now .

6. it depends , what games do you wanna play , target resolution , target graphics settings and budget . for most new builders watch paul ' s hardware , or biwit videos they explain their reasoning behind a build and prices at the time of filming , good luck

7. i dont have the subox but i do have some kanger tanks and i really like these  digit delrin tips from . i have bought several and they are all great . the tapered long black one might be just the ticket for you .

8. i would get a b350 board . they  re not much more expensive and give you overclocking options if you decide you want to in the future .

9. these all look really nice and could make some non meta characters viable . maybe i ' m not really too versed on how good these upgrades are

10. if 4k editing doesn  t require a gpu idk if it does  i don  t do any myself , then you might want to look at the dell s digit or s digit . i  ve heard they  re good and have really good cpu performance for the battery life , weight and size . if you don  t need a gpu , go for the s digit because you might as well save on size if both the digit and non  gpu digit have the same specs . edit  idk the prices . i  m just recommending what i see everyone else recommending .

11. apr should be the only consideration . ask an accountant that is not a complete moron , they all agree . you will not be able to keep paying it off every month forever , something always happens . your comment is digit  wrong .

12. use the wa as much as possible , i did an uchi playthrough and i ended up using it until i got onikiri and ubadachi , the wa will do significant damage as long as you keep dex up and plus it up . also , if you  re running a dexterity build which i assume you are infuse the uchi with a sharp gem and it  ll scale with your dexterity better

13. thanks man i will check how they stand against the others i used
   (ID: c863a7172df41853f354be7adff4b3f9a0cb9736)

14. what do you recommend i upgrade my deck with ? i run cyber dragons from a while ago . just ordered infinity and megafleet to find out that link summoning is a thing . what do ?
   (ID: 3158d7c63f10e871a80f147fb47725c8714163c7)

15. wut ? that makes no sense . what hp are you making ? what suspension are you running ? what wheel size ? so many questions that need to be answered before telling you what tires to get . with driver mod you can do whatever you want , no matter what tires you get .

16. got a generic digit  awakening gem , what champions should i wait foprioritize to use my gem on . already have an awakened hyperion and don  t want to use it on any of my current unawakened champs
   (ID: 11e562551d8ce916c649db9948355e07c68fed96)

17. abq even aqb would be great if you ' re someone like jalter or scathach with high hits on b . course if you ' re gonna crit with the arts it ' d be best to go qba . can see all the values

18. the guy is selling me his venge frame for  digit . a brand new allez sprint frame here costs  digit . is the venge a better choice ? or should i save up for a tarmac since i  m more of a all rounder ?
   (ID: af5ee378b1abffcc7a909dba267af824a56225d0)

19. i made a built for my dad recently and we went with a rm550x or rm650x if i recall . it might be the digit
   (ID: d9e6e1ecc09dc9affbcc8ccb0191ff241370a782)

20. remember , there ' s nothing wrong with playing both . drawing more cards is almost  bloody nekusar always good . if you ' re playing mono  blue bounce i ' d probably recommend going with both , since you can abuse both sets of triggers as much as you like .
