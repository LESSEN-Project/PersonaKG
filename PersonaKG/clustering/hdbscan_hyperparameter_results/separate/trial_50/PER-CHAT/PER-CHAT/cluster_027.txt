1. i  ll answer it , and of course get down voted do to such an unpopular opinion . the slippery slope argument can literally apply to any law regardless of political agreement . giving states the right to govern their own is part of what can happen and in all fairness should . washington and colorado legalizing weed could go down a slippery slope with conservatives saying ,  well why not legalize all drugs or take way the drinking age ?  a line has to be drawn somewhere . also pregnancy test are digit  accurate and can work within a few weeks after conception . not saying this will be an answer to all but digit weeks is plenty of time for most to make the choice . it  s a heart beat , it  s movement , it  s no longer a cell it  s alive .

2. who makes that decision ? who determines what conditions or characteristics are fine and which are not ? disabled adults would be against this idea of yours . what makes you think you know better than they whether they have a right to live ? no , you ' re talking about babies , but babies don ' t get to be adults if you ' d have them euthanized first . this is a slippery slope that starts with ostensibly good intentions and ends with eugenics .

3. why do you think rape and killing of the weak are so common in nature then ? it actually does benefit the species . however , as we became more intelligent and developed empathy , we began to start outlawing such things . also , we don ' t have a moral obligation to anything or anyone . we simply do it because that is how our brains are wired and because excuse me for saying this we live in a society .

4. you really simply do not understand logic , do you ? let me spoon feed it to you , since you ' re such a little dumb baby  from your perspective , your beliefs are correct . which means you should be putting them out there . if you ' re right , you ' d be helping people . but you don ' t do that , because you ' re a fucking coward . from a logically sound perspective , however , your beliefs are completely unethical . why ? because you are selfish , and only give a fuck about your emotions while compiling them . as a result , you completely failed to base them on evidence , or reason . if you cared about logic , you wouldn ' t dare believe the bullshit you believe . doing so would be a fucking embarrassment . see , your confusion is what happens when you hide like a little cowardly fucking bitch . this is also what happens when your beliefs have such low standards  you aren ' t accustomed to needing to make sound evaluations , because you don ' t do that to yourself . you ' re logically fat and lazy . so now , you meet someone like me , and you can ' t see the differences between logical arguments that should be obvious simply because you never behaved like you ever had to . see ? those beliefs effected your behavior . they effected your abilities to use reason as a tool for discourse . and because those beliefs have low standards , you have low reasoning ability . if you demanded a high standard of yourself , you would have never made such a basic bitch mistake . see how i ' m right now ? see how beliefs effect behavior in unexpected ways ? you ' re welcome .

5. to be clear  people have the right to practice whatever religion they would like . they have the right to pursue or not pursue certain things in their personal lives because it goes against their creed . i don ' t want to take that away from people . if living your life a certain way and believing in one god or another makes you feel fulfilled , then live your best life my friend . but laws impact everyone . to make a law in the name of say catholicism and then forcing people of all other religions to follow it crosses many lines . if people want to be able to change their gender markers on their licenses if they want to , they should be able to . but no one should ever force anyone to do so . if doing such a thing goes against your religion , then you don ' t gotta do it . those laws , the ones for people wanting to change their gender , only impact the people who want to do it ! nothing about those laws says that everyone else is legally obligated to as well , it ' s just an option available to those who are interested .

6. by that logic , we shouldn  t allow driving at all because it increases the risks of harm to people and people  s pets . it is already being worked on self driving cars to minimise the potential of crashes . here is a article about that  dough i do understand what you are trying to say , i would still just do rules like that because still , it puts the animals in danger . earlier you said that weed lessens the aggression , but sooner or later other drugs will be legalized where they do make people more aggressive . that is the problem . by just having rules like that it would atleast prevent a few drug users to buy pets , which is better then nothing wouldn ' t you say ? sure it maybe just prevents digit drug users from buying pets , but thats better then nothing in my opinion .

7. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .

8. again , that doesn ' t mean that the choice should be taken away from young boys . just a question  what about their right to vote ? why should we take away a young boy ' sperson right to vote ? or how about their right to make life altering choices ? part of being a parent means , unfortunately depending on how you look at it , making decisions for your kids .

9. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .
