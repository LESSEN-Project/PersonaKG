4. it doesn ' t matter if you said " yes " at the time . you were a child and children can say yes to a lot of bullshit bc they are little morons . doesn ' t make them right . society knows that nothing a child says can be valid and of any importance , hence they can ' t have jobs , buy houses , lease cars etc . she was exercising power over you and exploiting your vulnerability . that ' s statutory rape . you can get her arrested for it .

6. hunters do not ask anyone else to adopt thier morals . hunters are not compelled to kill by tenet but by choice , there are plenty of times i ' ve sat in a blind had a few beers and never touched my bow as deer wandered by . i can say that i didn ' t even try to kill anything today when i get back to the lodge and no one will say that i ' m not longer a hunter . my bet is if you say to a group of vegans that you just a little bacon today or a bit of scrambled eggs this morning the reaction will not be as favorable .

14. hmm and would you say that when you choose to talk it ' s because you feel you have the authority on whatever it is you ' re talking about . that ' s there ' s no debate , you are right and if you didn ' t know for sure that you were you ' d be quiet instead ? outside is alright , but i have to every morning to take care of the chickens and the horse . do you do anything specific outside , gardening , hiking ?
