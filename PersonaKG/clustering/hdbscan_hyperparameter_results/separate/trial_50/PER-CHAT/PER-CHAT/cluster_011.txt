7. lol something like this might happen in the show , but there is no way in hell things will fall in place this neatly . george has made it clear that the ending will be a bittersweet one and this would feel like total fan service . this is like saying at the halfway point of got that starks will overtake the lannisters and go back to north to live a happy life . this series is not kind enough to do things like that .

8. movies are considered a " what if " situation , nothing more . does that include cca ? i realize it is a movie in the u . c . timeline , but i ' ve been enduring zz just praying that cca is canon . but if it ' s not , then there is no point in wasting my time with zz .
