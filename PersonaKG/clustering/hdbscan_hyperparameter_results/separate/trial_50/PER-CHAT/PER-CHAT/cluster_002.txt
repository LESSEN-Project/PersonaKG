2. boom and zoom planes don ' t just lock up in the shallowest of dives digit i ' m asking for god damm better servers because believe it or not a huge amount of players have to deal with this and pilot ping issues are much worse than tank ping issues if you don ' t know what it does it ' s like when me 262s are flung when landing mid air

4. i think there ' s something weird going on when playing online , like some sort of host advantage or something . some games i just can ' t punish no matter what i do and will always get hit out of my fastest pokes , while other times i can punish every single time and the opponent gets hit out of everything they do .

5. i got the camos for it but it felt like it took digit  for it to actually give me green tiger , i think it has issues registering every kill
