1. i don ' t know the first thing about getting fitted ,  you don ' t need to just do some investigating in your area to find a place and they will help you out . hopefully it will be in your price range .

2. beyond how much money you need , there are some other things to think about . furniture  don  t try to move furniture across the country . look for a furnished place to rent  first , or better yet , stay with family at 1st . you  re barely going to be there anyways . clothes  take your favorite outfits , and enough to get through about a month without washing clothes . you aren  t going to have time . your favorites just because i already know that while you won  t wear them again , you aren  t ready to get rid of them just yet . stuff  ditch it , unless it  s something you want to save forever . money  not enough information in your post . are you looking to get your own place when you get there , or can you crash at family  friends house for a few months ? you  re going to make more money than you have time to spend once you get started . you  ll be able to get a really nice place in just a few months , but you won  t be there much .

3. should not be a problem even if you get by yourself , just be confident . you do know how to ride and drive then it shouldn ' t be problem passing the test . as for not having a bike , i suggest you borrow a bike from any friend or relative because they don ' t provide the bike . last resort would be asking one of the people who have got their bikes for the test . for car lisence test they gave me the rto car maruti digit which was horrible but manageable to pass if you know your driving . go through an agency only if you don ' t want to fill applications and are very unsure about the procedure . i got mine done through an agency because i learnt driving through their school . if you know driving and riding i see no problem for you to get it done yourself .

4. timing when to buy a home is difficult since it will obviously be a long term investment . i think you should gauge where you are living to determine if you have confidence in your city and county first . if you do then go out and buy a home that you like and can afford at the best possible price for you . trying to timing the market for a home is just not worth it .

5. i say go for it ! change is good , and for your situation and everything you described moving is definitely going to be good for you . you don  t want to keep thinking about doing it for years and regret not going sooner .

6. the hagwon  public school thing is really up to you . i ' ve only done hagwons , so i don ' t have experience with any experience with public schools other than hearing from friends . seems you get a lot more time off with public school , but get paid a lot more with a hagwon if you find the right ones . public will definitely have more job security , as its back by the government , but if you find a reputable hagwon company , that should be just as good . that being said , i ' ve been relatively happy with what i ' ve been doing . i ' m currently working two jobs and pulling in quite a good bit of dough , so if you can work it out that way , you should do it . as for incheon , i love it here . depending on your work schedule , you could definitely make it in to seoul on a weekday . it takes about an hour and twenty minutes to get to any of the hot spots for me , so if you were to go public and get off at digit , you ' d be fine . if you did a hagwon , you would work later so you could stay out and sleep at a jimjilbang and get back in time for work . cab fair is generally gonna run you around digit , 000w back . dunno about anyang , although my gf lives near there currently . she also says there is nothing happening there . i dunno though .

7. think about your network . can you build one quickly , can you survive without it ? if the answer is no , don ' t go . you are married . how does your husband feel about it ? is your relationship solid enough for long distance . if it works out , what will your husband do for work ? can he transfer ? its your decision , but you are also a team . if he doesn ' t want to leave or can ' t , you may not want to take the job . can your finances handle supporting two households ? if you move to establish the homebase across the country , your husband still needs to maintain the current home . this means a strain on the finances . can you afford it ? do you want to ?

8. depends on your situation really . if you don ' t have debt , lease , and are unemployed and  or working at a replaceable job then its doable . even more so if you have some amount of money saved up . if you ' re moving to a city there are probably a lot of cheap hostels that you could stay at till you ' re on your feet , if you ' re trying to go entirely solo . if you have a friend or relative you could crash at for a while , even better ! as for a different country , i don ' t know , but i ' d imagine getting a job would be more difficult unless you have useful skills . may or may not be relevant , but if you join the french foreign legion , you can register under whatever name you want , get taught the language , and when you complete it you get french citizenship under that name . that would be the ultimate " start a new life " scenario i ' d think . i ' ve only read a little about the ffl , so i may not have all my facts straight , but i think what i said is right

9. every job will do , as long as you adjust your living standards . i don ' t want to argue that living coast are way to high in the last few years . and that mini jobbers don ' t get paid enough , is also true . but thats how things are at the moment , so you have to adjust . at most places your job you doing besides beeing in school won ' t pay you an own apartment . the higher the coasts of living are in a city , the more you have to find things to cut out . get a roommate , maybe even more . just buy cheap foods that are on discount and stock them . use a bike if possible instead of public transport quit your gym and start bodyweight training shorten your shower times buy everything possible used . sadly a lot of students have to work a lot , while also balancing school life , without a fair payment . so you will just need to be really lucky with your job or you have to really cut back in your living standarts for a few years . maybe even share a room and give up your privacy . i don ' t wanna get into finding somebody helping you out with money , you probably wouldn ' t have asked if this possibility exists . hopefully we students use this unfairness as motivation to make it possible for the next generation to have a healthy work school balance and getting a fair payment .

10. my friend was in a similar situation . his parents are british but they moved to south africa and had him there , so although he is a uk citizen he wasn ' t classified as a local student for the purpose of uni fees . you could always try germany . you could study for free at public german universities as an undergraduate . good luck !

11. i think a lot of this would have to do with how much money you have to blow . obviously live it up as much as you can for the last year . the education will probably be mostly the same wherever you choose to go . if you don  t care about the master  s and have your accounting requirements done , i could tell you how to get those digit credits in a month , maybe two at most .
