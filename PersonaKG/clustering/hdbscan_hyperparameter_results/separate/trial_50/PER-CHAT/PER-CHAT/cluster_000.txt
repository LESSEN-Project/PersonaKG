1. i have this habit that is a hold over of my childhood years . i spit in the toilet after i ' m done using it to keep the monsters from crawling out of it . why i thought they were scared of my spit and not other bodily fluids i don ' t know . but unless i force myself not to i do it instinctively .

6. when people touch your stuff . it happens too often that people just pick up my backpack and throw it on my lab instead of asking to free the seat next to me . and for some reason its always women who do that , guys always ask
