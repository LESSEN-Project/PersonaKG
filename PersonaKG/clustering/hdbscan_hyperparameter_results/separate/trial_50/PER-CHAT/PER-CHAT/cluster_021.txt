2. you do need to take steps to improve your life , but a big part of cbt is just thinking positively . recognizing the way you ' re thinking now is irrational , that your problems aren ' t insurmountable , and that you have reason to be hopeful for the future . it ' s annoying that people expect you to be better instantly , but thinking positively is the cure .

4. i ' ve two different path i might advice you   if you loose this much i guess you practise sport in those moments , so i think you shouild try to keep it going even after you loose what you were aiming . but doing sport , by our own , can be hard , that ' s why i wrotea second point .  try to talk about this to people you like , who cares about you . i know it can be hard but having people supporting you is a great way to keep going , and to not feel bad even in defeat . if you don ' t  can ' t talk to the current people you know , you can find a lot of people in the same case of you in groups , forum , etc . gl for your future !

6. just remember what is going on and , when you can , ask yourself " is my illness getting in the way of doing my job " perhaps when you work on your own , let someone else know about your situation so that they can come to you and say " hey      , i think you might not be doing too good a job with your teaching right now . anything i can do to help or support you .

7. i  d still advise an inpatient program if it is that bad , ultimately we  re just a bunch of dudes on the internet , and there  s a reason why they are professionals . while i do not have your condition , i  ve been plagued by mental illness . they key isn  t to stop , erase , or remove it , but to cope , overcome , and live with it at least for me

8. there ' s a lot of good advice in the comments already . but , i ' d like to add one . just pray . talk to god . there ' s no need for formality by clasping your hands or saying thou and thy . just ask some questions , thank him for cool stuff like the grand canyon or gelato . talk about your concerns and your shortcomings . let him know you acknowledge him . if the act of prayer feels good to you , continue it . second , find a community of believers . i recommend looking for an alpha , because i learned a lot as a new believer . god bless .

9. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .

10. thank you for your comment , you  ve made a lot of sense to me . it  s like a switch gets flipped whenever i begin to think about doing something for me . study , art , meditation , even my last therapy session i struggled to keep myself present and awake . having been in therapy for a year now , my therapist has only recently begun talking about dealing with my cptsd so i  ve got a long way to go . hopefully i can begin unpacking my terrible coping mechanisms soon because they really are disabling in so many ways .
