Total from this dataset: 7

1. as i said , noone forces you to pre  order anything so i see no point of hating on it . pre  ordering is just as way to support the developers while still working on the game .

2. i used to play offline so i could enjoy the game with no ads , now it  s like playing while online . forcing me to pay just so i can enjoy the game , i don  t like devs or games that do shit like that .

3. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .

4. to be fair this is what the community has complained heavily about since release . is this not what they wanted ? no sense in complaining about it how it is now if you were complaining about how it was before , as you  ve asked for these changes , specifically .

5. they may feel like that but many of them are ignoring the immense amount of time that went into the other requirements and at the same time vastly overestimating the value of castle wars . i ' ve found it pretty funny the reaction many people have had  when people who set up castle wars boosting fc ' s specifically to cheat games with alts , not the totally legitimate afk fc ' s are complaining about devaluation , and people who called themselves trimmers but hadn ' t finished the breeding log or salty etc are complaining about devaluation , i find it all pretty memeworthy . ontop of that , why weren ' t all these true trimmers pissed when 5k games as diminished ? surely you ' re not really a trimmer if you don ' t have 5k then ? or when people boosted games ? or when people account shared ? i ' ve seen so many twitter posts of people who blatantly cheated their cwar games acting outraged that i just can ' t take it seriously . i ' m someone who trimmed immediately after the rework , and to see people behave like my trim is worthless or that i didn ' t earn it is so gross . i ' ve been trim sans cwars for coming up on digit years . i put in as much effort as anyone else  i refused to cwars on principle for a variety of reasons , primarily because i believed it was a flawed decision from the start , and because of the rampant cheating that went on in the early years of comp that still goes on to this day , not because i couldn ' t be bothered but because it wasn ' t content , and it wasn ' t fair .

6. i literally was talking about the meter but that  s fine we all read differently apparently . my point is it would make more problems than fix problems there are no problems with it if they took away the shot meter . you say it would add a skills gap but you could literally make the game skill  time played where i only see mycareer grinders getting mad , but removing a shot meter and as op said , removing fucking greens will make everyone mad and 2k isn  t that stupid

7. i understand your opinion , but for me , it just doesn ' t make sense . some operators have cutting edge tech gadget and some have way less advanced tech in comparison . i don ' t think it ' s balanced in a realism perspective . but it ' s just my opinion .
