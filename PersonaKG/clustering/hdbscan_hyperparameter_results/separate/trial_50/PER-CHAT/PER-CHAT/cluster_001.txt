3. it worked for me after smoking for around digit years . i haven ' t had one since fall , and i don ' t want one either . some advice . be prepared for some very vivid dreams , but they seem to subside after a while . make sure you drink plenty of water with the pill and eat something with it if you can . it can give you horrible stomach cramps if you don ' t . keep taking it even after you quit , for at least a couple of months , although you can typically taper off to one pill a day after the initial digit months . if you still feel a slight craving after the initial digit months , ask your doctor for another prescription . it gets so much easier after a couple of months . i just had a digit hour drive with an open pack of cigs sitting next to me , and i didn ' t even think about lighting up . good luck ! it ' s sooooo much better after you quit .

4. if you can drop it without getting any academic penalties , i ' d try that . if you can ' t just try the final anyways . don ' t think about failing as you do it . if there is any concepts you learned that you can remember in the slightest right it down on the side like formulas and such . once you finished just know that it is done . i ' ve been where you are at and so has many others . there is no shame in doing a course over again if it ' s needed . i ' d try to find new study habits too for next time .

6. sure you dislocated it ? it has to be pushed back down so it can pop back into place . i had to go to hospital .

7. i would consult a doctor about it , especially if you are sure there is nothing wrong with your calorific tracking .
