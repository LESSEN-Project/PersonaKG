1. just be straight forward with her . i can  t tell you how to bring it up , you need to figure that out on your own , not on reddit . if it comes from you heart and voice , it will feel sincere and she will know . be yourself and just tell how you feel . that is it . hope everything goes alright .

3. i just don ' t understand those women who absolutely want to keep a child without informing the father , want to be an alone and independant moment and then change their mind . that ' s a hard situation for you . does your ex have a bf ? i think you should take your time to swallow the pill , now you ' re a father and you have to accept that . then maybe learn to know ben , what he likes , spend some time with him . does your ex live near from you ?

4. this is such a badass way to do it ! not even texting or explain , none of the  he said , she said  shit that can  t be proved . you just dropped the facts right in there . that  s ballsy  you should be proud of yourself . there  s a very good chance they  ll try to stir shit up with you now , but also a very good chance they  re too scared to mess with you . have your guard up  definitely take the time to care for yourself . being alone definitely better than dealing with people like this .
   (ID: d00e33b2b44f173a4a57d6e7cfed254b471909df)

5. thank you for the response , i  ve been considering whether she  s really worth keeping around anyways . it  s just so hard to cut out someone who you  ve known your whole life .
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

6. i mean sooner or later you  re going to have to face it right ? might as well do it and get it out of the way so you  re not wasting both of you  re time . not trying to sound like a dick . but it  s just going to get worse and his feelings will keep on growing for you . i  ve been in your shoes . it  s a shitty place to be .
   (ID: dd693eb15af7c6fbe95cb372afaf66fb33015bff)

7. does a person who is has reacted as inappropriatly as she has have any chance of listening to " just how unhappy she ' s making " op ? i say live with a friend and don ' t speak to your mum until she comes and speakers to you . if .
   (ID: d2a1dc4371e8662a7c59b93e9c83ebabd252654f)

8. you don ' t want him to move on , maybe ? let him go . you ' ll both fine something better .
   (ID: ddf68ce7beaa491a2da885bdfe48a680bf990b37)

9. well you ' re just going to have to get over your fear of her having a relationship with someone else . cause it will happen . same thing will happen for you too . it ' s not the end of the world . how many girlfriend ' s have you had ? i ' m assuming more than just her because you used the phrase " most recent girlfriend . " most relationships don ' t last , no matter if they ' re romantic ones or not , and i don ' t think they ' re supposed to . you were with this girl for digit days , that ' s nothing . you ' ll find someone else , or you ' ll spend the rest of your life debilitated by your fear of something that you have no control over . i ' m willing to bet that won ' t happen . keep your chin up man .

10. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart
   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

11. you clearly want to pursue her so i don ' t know what you want tbh . on the one hand you could be looking for " devil ' s advocates " who ' ll tell you to go for it  you ' ve basically provided your own options regarding that , looking for people to validate your opinion . on the other hand , you could just be genuinely thrown off by the situation and won ' t mind advice , just as long as it ' s constructive . so playing devil ' s advocate . just go for it op , there ' s probably trouble in paradise , she ' s feeling dissatisfied with her current relationship among other things in her life work stress etc . so why not take the opportunity and " swoop in . but real talk . no matter the circumstances , my stance is " you don ' t mess with someone who ' s in a relationship . coming from a person who ' s cheated once and has been cheated on a few times , its a dick move unless you ' re some callow bastard who doesn ' t care . talk to her and clear out the boyfriend issue before taking it any further  it ' ll save you the trouble in the long run .

12. i know exactly how you feel . i ' m a man and when we were dating my wife was always touching , kissing and the like . i liked it but it was all a little overwhelming . and she is a tender thing so i never wanted to say for fear of making her cry . but i finally made the plunge . she did cry . but she was happy that i was honest with her . that ' s where relationships thrive . honestly . i think you should choose your words carefully , adding be honest .

13. he will find his own way . my sister still has a relationship with them but i am nc with my parents . it  s weird sometimes . but that  s what works for her and this is what works for me , and that  s ok . just give him hugs , and be there for him , because we have to choose our family very carefully  we were given such crappy ones ! sounds like you both are on the same page . and don  t ever give your ssn to anyone who asks . god , so many horror stories of nparents stealing their children  s identities and ruining their lives ! aack ! protect yourself !
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

14. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

15. nobody should ever feel this way . it hurts me that your  friends  would tell you things like that . i would take some time to find a new friend group . if there is a counselor or someone on campus , i would utilize that resource too . you don  t need to feel alone . you have a bright future . i  m sorry this is happening to you .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

16. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .
   (ID: 8285a776fd60b145ed2afc145cdf2b926b93ed8b)

17. if you can ' t let it go and move on , you ' re not honourable . just grow up and move on . seriously , it ' s pathetic that you ' re even putting any of this . be it a joke or not .
   (ID: 6ea2719d7b2aba54e352b1f2b374bd6af6fd406d)

18. i went on because life is about the present and future . if you regret , you will be wasting your time and proving , you can ' t get over someone . be a man  girl stand up and find someone who loves you . there are more fish in the sea , and if she  he left you it ' s because she  he didn ' t love you enough so why waste time on a lost cause . you are beautiful and deserve someone who sees that
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

19. i knew these kind of douchebags in college as well . tried my hardest not to associate with them . also , it doesn ' t surprise me in the slightest that he ' s going to med school . i commend you for your decision , why share your life with a malicious person ?
   (ID: 93e9e943e9d5e6606a938961fd4d02312afb101b)

20. yep . it happens . i noticed that i developed a crush on someone else . nothing wrong with so , and i still care for them just no longer in love with them . it ' s heartbreaking to realize especially when there is no right thing to do that makes everyone happy .
