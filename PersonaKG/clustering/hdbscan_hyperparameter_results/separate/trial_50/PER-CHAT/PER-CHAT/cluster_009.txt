2. it  s actually insane to me how ppl call tat waiter a creep and suggest op should report him to the restaurant . with the given info the waiter really might have just tried to be as friendly as possible  maybe just really likes kids  has grandchildren himself . he even gave her a desert for free , jesus . just to be stigmatized for being a pedophile , potentially being fired ? op , yta .

5. i have a very large advantage in that my father is a huge narcissist . anyhow , this happened when i was digit , however this has happened so many times this is one out of too many to count . it ' s digit am , we ' re at denny ' s , and he ' s just ordered digit minutes ago . apperently he ' s really hungry . he gets up and walks down to the kitchen , and walks into the kitchen . i hear , from half the restaurant away " where the fuck is my food ! i ordered my food an hour ago ! i am never coming back here again ! this is the worst , most despicable customer service i have ever had ! " he then walks back out , and we leave . i ' m sure he made hundred of people feel like shit over the course of a month , let alone the full digit years i ' ve been alive .

6. i always arrive super early to stuff because i  m anxious about being late , so i got to starbucks like digit minutes early . this is obviously just a casual coffee date , i met the guy online , wanted to get to know him irl . i order a drink and sit down to wait on my laptop . the guy arrives digit minutes early and comes to greet me and asks if i want a drink . i say no because i already have one . he suddenly gets really upset he can  t buy me a drink . keeps asking me to let him buy one , or even weirder , kept offering to give me money for the one i already paid for ? i just keep saying no , it  s alright , i  m a grown woman lol . so he gets a drink and kinda sulks for the rest of the date , like keeps giving one word answers , doesn  t ask me anything . as soon as i finished my drink he asked to buy me one and i said i actually needed to leave . it was just bizarre .
