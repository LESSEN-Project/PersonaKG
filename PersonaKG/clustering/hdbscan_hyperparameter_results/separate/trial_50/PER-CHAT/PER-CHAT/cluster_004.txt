Total from this dataset: 14

1. those " alternate life  dimension  reality " dreams always just feel like the " regular life " , but . enhanced . let ' s say everything smells and sounds more accurate , more intense . no unusual sounds or smells whatsoever . on another note , i can ' t recall what specifically happened in them , but i do remember they ' re some sort of " alternate dimensions " , where i made different choices or some things directly concerning me went a different way . e . g i ' m a drug dealer in some slums . when i wake up from them , i don ' t feel my body at all  i don ' t feel anything , i just see . i slowly open my eyes , and i ' m unable to recognize where i am , feeling like i ' ve been moved somewhere else , while it ' s just my regular , real  life bedroom . it takes me a good couple of minutes to realize i ' m conscious and awake in reality . what intrigues me the most about this is that maybe death is just a transition to another reality . i don ' t know . sorry for the poor grammar . it ' s pretty difficult to put this in words .

2. i was in a car accident with my best friend and he died . i was conscious the whole time but remember nothing . those hours that disappeared before i came to in the hospital , it ' s a different kind of scary .

3. you get to be a ghost for a while , then its lights out . but i only believe this because i find it comforting to believe there ' s something non  permanent after death .

4. for me , it felt as if my body went numb . i don ' t feel anything . and i see everything around me , but it feels as if i ' m watching a movie . there was a mirror beside me when this happened , i could see my face out the corner of my eye . just lifeless .

5. ive only had sleep paralysis once , and it had a really creepily over  detailed frog on a bicycle that im almost sure i ' d never seen before

6. when i was digit i vividly remember this huuuge ant in my grandmother ' s carpet . my memory is usually pretty bad but i remember this like it was yesterday because of how much it scared me . looked like something out of a movie . but , of course , we don ' t normally have giant ants crawling around , and so to this day no one believes me

7. most blackouts leave only fragments of memory of the night , like no context mental screenshots , which may pop up in your head for a few days after . takes a lot to get so drunk that you remember nothing at all but i ' ve done it like digit to many times .
   (ID: 864d1fa2ae2c7d60534e62e5a4b00fcb39a2c565)

8. yes , but definitely not in our lifetime .

9. digit weeks ago i got cross faded and became unresponsive . i entered what we dubbed  the abyss  and it was the scariest place  feeling i have ever experienced . it was basically like the place in get out or like being in a dark closet where you can hear everything but cant move or speak .

10. here ' s how i see it . many different universes where something small that ' s different to something drastically different . anything possible could happen right ? what if each one of those , there is a god , but the gods are all on being ?

11. timeline is a circle , everything you die , you reborn again living the same life until you die , thats why people have dejavus

12. havent had this happen . keep in mind that a hallucination is not only visual , just any feeling you get that is not real . currently up researching this because digit increasingly scarier consecutive hypnagogic hallucinations within an hour have me scared to try to go to sleep
   (ID: 7e67ef9bbe60829bc5fc42f502d07270f7dbde62)

13. i don ' t believe so . lemme explain , everytime you remember something you are remembering the last time you remembered it . slowly but surely degrading that memory . our brain would only be able to hold onto the good and bad , the exciting stuff . also when you die you do experience a dream like sequence where your almost relive your life , but it ' s not the same , it would be weird like a dream , inaccurate and inconsistent . it wouldn ' t make sense and with the combination of lost memories it would probably confuse you and ruin you but nobody will ever know for sure .

14. yeah but what gets me about the ocean is that it ' s right there . the universe is absolutely huge and out of reach but the ocean is right next to us and we still know nothing about it .
