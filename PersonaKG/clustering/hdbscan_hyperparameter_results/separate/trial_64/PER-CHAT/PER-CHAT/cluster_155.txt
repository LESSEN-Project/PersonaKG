1. dude this isnt the battle royale sub , this is the fashion sub . concepts and design ideas are more than welcome here . besides , op clearly put some effort into this so you can fuck right off until you find something nice or atleast something actually constructive to say .

2. although apple has obviously found a way to legally enforce its will on the buying public , this is unfair . can you imagine the uproar , if say gm made it illegal to change the tires on a camaro , without their consent ? if i pay for the machine , i should have the right to modify it as i wish . this is another reason i will never buy apple .

3. wouldn ' t go for  digit . he could go to the cops and say he stole his card , or he could kick your ass after he finds out that you basically stole money from him . just be honest and say that he needs to give you the amount of weed  cash that you agreed upon . by the way , if he only shorts you on weed , then you can ask for cash instead . if he cought up the right amount of cash than you could say that you prefer cash transactions only from now on .

5. i am using the word can as a verb the second definition of being permitted to do something . now i was using it in the way to ask someone to allow me to do something and not the first definition of can . so please read a dictionary and come back to me when you have educated yourself . or just say , " you ' re an idiot "
