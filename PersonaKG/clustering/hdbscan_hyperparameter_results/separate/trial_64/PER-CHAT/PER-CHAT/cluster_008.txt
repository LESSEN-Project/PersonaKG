2. on average , yes i did go downhill 9000ft to 5500ft . but my max elevation was digit , 300ft , so lots of ups and downs . i had to resist the urge many times to bury my foot in the throttle . edit  as it turns out you can make an elevation profile in google earth . can anyone guess the route ?

7. makes sense . just funny how all ' s i did was make an observation which is most likely correct and instead of either acknowledging it , or moving on , they have to be so salty for some reason .
