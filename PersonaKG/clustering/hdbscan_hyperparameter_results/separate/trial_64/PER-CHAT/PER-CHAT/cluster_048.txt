1. i ' d like to believe aliens exist , but i wouldn ' t go as far as to say their existence is pretty much guaranteed . that equation is very theoretical and doesn ' t really do much to guarantee anything . i feel like we are special because as far as we know , there ain ' t shit else out there that ' s a terrifying thought . and if you really wanna lose your mind a little bit , i feel like it could still be up for debate that we even exist . all of perception could be a collective dream . anyways i ' m not saying aliens are fake , i ' m just saying what the fuck is real ?

2. hey man you do you , but your story makes me feel a lot better about taking a quick sniff and then putting them back . haha . i felt really guilty about it and never let myself do stuff like that again .

3. something that relates to a talent or a goal of theirs , especially if it ' s a little bit beyond them . for example , if they like drawing , get them some really nice pens or paper , so they feel both validated in their craft but also inspired to do more .

4. it is not a petty reason at all to be angry at this . you said it yourself you guys had a rough childhood and you still have struggles . you are allowed to feel like this no emotion is invalid . im sorry you are going through this , you seem like a really strong person . focus on your school . i believe in you .

5. i have to agree with regenboog as you progress through your transition you will feel more comfortable with yourself and your femininity will come through nauturally . clothes are a different matter , if you are pre hrt , its really about how confident you are .

6. nah , it doesn  t suck . i actually really like it . i feel like it  s something everyone can relate to , and while it is personal to you , almost all of us could probably pick up on the meaning without your explanation .

7. how are you ? well , now that you ask my hemorrhoids are acting up again and i feel really constipated today . so when i leave the room it is probably to take a shit .
