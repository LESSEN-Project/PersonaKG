1. oh , wow . my spouse has so many little weird things that drive him over the edge that i wish he would stop . for example , if i want to go to a restaurant later in the evening and that restaurant is going to close in less than digit minutes , he will not go in . he will freak out , he ' ll get angry , he ' ll do anything but set foot into a place that won ' t be open for another hour . he also insists on being early  " on time " for things that we don ' t need to be early to and things that no one is on time for like , the party starts at digit , he wants to be there at digit , even though we know there will be no one there til digit and we ' ll have to spend digit hours sitting there making awkward small talk with the host and their best friend and who didn ' t expect anyone to show up so early . the really big one right now is that he ' s developed all these weird anxieties around sex and would prefer for me to have it with other people rather than freak him out about it . that ' s the biggest thing that i wish we could just do naturally .

2. i ran around like a crazy person on my honeymoon in new zealand and have no regrets about trying to see digit different places in digit days , but we had a campervan .   x200b  consider how frequently you can handle  want to pack and unpack and carry your luggage to a new location via public transit . using luggage shipping carriers is useful but they don ' t transport it for you in the same real time you ' ll need your stuff . what are your top priorities for this trip ? do you like crowds or nature or a mix ? will it be obon stuff is expensive , closed , and japanese people are all on vacation ?

3. this is the conversation i usually have with myself in my head . man its quiet . i ' m not tired just close your eyes and try to fall asleep anyway , you know when that alarm goes off digit hours from now it ' s gonna suck and you aren ' t going to want to wake up . i wish i had a girlfriend to hold right now . you have a body pillow just cuddle with that . but the feathers stick out and poke me ! stop being a bitch . why do i itch all over ? is it time to buy new sheets ? do i need silk sheets or something to not itch this much ? i must have really sensitive skin . i hate having sensitive skin did my phone just make a notification noise ? it ' s probably a candy crush request or something stupid just check it in the morning you need to sleep . yeah but what if it ' s something entertaining or someone trying to talk to me ? you know it ' s not . rolls over . that fucking notification , what is it ? fuck it . gets out of bed and walks to phone somebody commented on a post that you commented on . see i told you it wasn ' t important . nobody is thinking about you right now enough to make your phone make noise . checks time . shit ok digit hours until i have to wake up . we ' re still good i can handle that . i can ' t sleep . take some unisom . if i take it now i ' ll be extra tired in the morning tho . anyway i continue to think about stupid shit and it only usually gets depressing , until i fall asleep knowing i have to wake up in like digit hours

4. if she ' s insisting but let you pay the other times , let her this time . i dated a guy for awhile who paid for every single thing , which is super flattering , but when i told my mom she was like " you need to pay too ! just make him let you pay " so i felt weird about it . we are told we need to take care of ourselves first , to be independent , that we can ' t be " bought " etc . i think it ' s actually a good sign on her feelings towards you . while i ' m not dating that guy anymore , i offered a lot to pay because i didn ' t want him to think i was taking advantage of his kindness . i did finally end up paying for a few things here and there , which worked out because he never carried cash and i ' m a cash girl . i doubt this will be the new " rule " where she will always pay for herself .

5. in my limited experience  it ' s best to set boundaries clearly , but one issue at a time . you walking up to her mother and saying " you need to back off " immediately sets you up as the adversary trying to cut her off from her baby girl in the most important time . you ' ll be treated that way from that point forward . instead , you need to talk about the individual things with your wife so you have an agreed stance the next time they come up with your mil . it ' s way less likely to lead to war if you can hold your wife ' s hand and speak up for her saying ' we ' ve decided it ' s best if it ' s just us and the medical staff in the delivery room ' , ' we ' ve done the research and want to do x ' , etc . than if you go in by yourself and try to lay down the law to a mother about her child . you can be the one to make the statements , but they need to be phrased as joint decisions with your wife ' s clear if silent support . if your wife doesn ' t want to have those conversations alone alone , that ' s fine . her part becomes to deflect , i . e . " we ' ll talk about it next time we see you " , or just not respond when the mil isolates her on an issue . her backtracking or bargaining alone will kill any progress you make by standing strong together . talk to her about that , too . also , congrats and good luck !
