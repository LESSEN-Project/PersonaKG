3. sometimes i  m asked to judge science fairs . it  s so disappointing to see that teachers approve projects that have zero scientific merit and allow kids to waste their effort pursuing meaningless  findings .  the kids are so proud of their display and project and i  m put in the awkward position of explaining how it  s flawed . yet , if you don  t tell them , you  re no better than the adults that mislead and misinformed them .
