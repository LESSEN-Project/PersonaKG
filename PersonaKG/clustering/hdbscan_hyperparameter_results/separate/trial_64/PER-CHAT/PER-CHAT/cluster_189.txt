1. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .

2. i agree . do you think it ' s white people ' s fault that the number of black people in these fields is so small , like a lot of people think ?

3. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it

4. it ' s insane that people think we all came from two people .

5. or it ' s a bullshit made up story , hoping that they will be one of the first to receive it . reminds me if some guy who demanded to receive his kickstarter shit faster than other people because of some condition . think it was shiftware .

6. people often hide names in screenshots , i think it is  was against the rules to include them .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

7. it honestly not that . i think it  s smugness coming from people who think they are more important than they are .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

8. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .

9. i think that people shouldn  t have to lie about their beliefs . i think their religious beliefs shouldn  t be mentioned at all
