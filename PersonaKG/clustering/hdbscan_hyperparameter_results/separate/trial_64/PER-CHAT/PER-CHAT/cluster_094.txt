4. i see that , but it  s still the fact of if someone doesn  t want to see it , why would you do it there ? just like there are toilets , there are also breast pumps or you could just do it at home . i would completely be alright if it were at home with friends over , but when it is random strangers , just be used you have a child doesn  t mean you get to expose yourself for your convenience
