5. being a nice guy means you are helpful without expectations while " nice guy " is being helpful only to those you want something from . ex . you hold the door for a girl and expect her to have sex with you right there and then

6. the human race is portrayed perfectly in 40k if you ask me but i suppose your right that the " civilised " world doesn ' t want to be reminded that we are the monsters .
