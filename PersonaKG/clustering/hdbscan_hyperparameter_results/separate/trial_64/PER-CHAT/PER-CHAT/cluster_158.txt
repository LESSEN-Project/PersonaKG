5. i made my flair for this subreddit " anti  natalist " , meaning i ' m  by definition and for the convenience  a child hater . i can ' t stand them . i ' m completely pro  government sterilization and am a supporter of voluntary human extinction movement . does this make me a bad person ? no . do i despise parents for breeding ? in many ways , but teen moms are usually the only ones to receive that hatred . will i ever abuse a child ? absolutely not . in short , the only difference between me  an anti  natalist  and the more " child tolerant " of our group is that  they ' re child tolerant .

6. remembering that alcohol does work for it ' s intended purpose . it does make me forget problems and it does make me relax . it ' s hard knowing there ' s a bottle that can do that . almost like a magic potion . fortunately i ' m now aware that the consequences when i drink far outweigh the benefits .
