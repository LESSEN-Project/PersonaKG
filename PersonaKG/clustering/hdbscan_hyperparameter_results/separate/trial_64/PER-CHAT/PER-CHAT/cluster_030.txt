1. woohoo ! 90c per hour pay increase from mcdonalds . wow , you certainly argued that well .  it ' s worth noting though that the wages at walmart and mcdonald ' s remain very far from the  digit level many advocates and government officials are pushing for . now , if you read what i said , i meant an across the board sweeping change . upping minimum wage by digit  would be a bad thing for business . i am going to be the bigger man here and bring about this embarrassment of an argument you are trying to present . you have not acknowledged a single thing that a real business owner has told you about how his busniess works . you have tried to give me old mate ' s opinion as fact because he wrote a book never owned a minimum wage paying company in his life and you haven ' t brought a single example of when a digit  jump in minimum wage was ever worked . you have not convinced me of anything because nothing you have said has brought me evidence of when this happened in a country before and worked . i am not going to convince you because you are so stuck on being right that you can ' t accept what happens in real life when massive economical changes are made .
