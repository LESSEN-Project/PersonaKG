15. the fitnessgramtrade  mark pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues . the digit meter pacer test will begin in digit seconds . line up at the start . the running speed starts slowly , but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal . beep a single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound . ding remember to run in a straight line , and run as long as possible . the second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound , your test is over . the test will begin on the word start . on your mark , get ready , start .
