4. if it is on a smalleinactive sub then it could actually be  hot  compared to other older posts . or they could be controversial and be downvoted a lot meaning they actually have a lot of upvotes .

5. just so i understand  you  re gay but have a girlfriend and this isn  t enough to keep up your charade . you need to make the guys you hang out with jealous by making this girl dress to show off her body . then you  re going to introduce this girl to your family and want her to dress like this again for them . what  s the plan here ? you seem like you don  t know what you want . in another thread , you say you  re coming out to your mother because you don  t have any money . you  re all over the place . any way you could just be your authentic self ? or if you  re going to remain closeted to some in your family , why march this girl around having her partake in your lie ? you could just be single .

6. maybe some entry level buyer ' s guides ? i ' m not super reddit savvy , and i ' m at work right now shhh , but i would be willing to write up some things about straps  well known entry brands and watches when i have some free time this week if that ' s something people would be interested in . i like the idea of this sub though , interested to see where it goes !

7. if they already know everything about you how could it hurt ? i thought they were the feds who else has this power ? the first step to getting help is proving the problem exists . you ' ll notice that black people are starting to get help with police violence now that they ' re able to film the police . do you have everything to gain and nothing to lose but your delusions .

9. i would love to see a show similar to origin that explores amuro ' s experiences during the war in more detail . maybe a loose remake of digit ?

11. i had a similar face with lsd , where i just wanted to trip at every occasion . because i never had a single bad experience , only beneficial ones . thsi phase ended after digit or digit months , my mind needed a break and i didn ' t want to trip even when there was a great opportunity . for me the craving for acid feelt different than to any other drug , it wasn ' t like wanting to recreationaly better my mood like with any other drug . it feelt more like having discovered something new , where you can ' t wait for your next time doing it . it feelt like when i got a new video game for christmas as a kid and after an hour , when my parents made me go to bed , i couldn ' t wait to explore it more the next day . but after some time this always stoped , only to be rediscovered years later . the same feeling was attached to lsd after my first spiritual experience . and the same way it got more and more unexciting until i stopped using for a year or so . and this wasn ' t hard to do , it just felt right to stop now . when the spirit of adventure came back i started tripping again . even if lsd helped me a lot to learn about myself like nothing else could even come close . thinking about my usage in honesty is only possible during times of abstinence . your post sounded similar to my concern at times of frequent use and your concerns are important and nothing you should be avoiding , especially when using strong psychedelics . i could understand my frequent lsd use after it ' s ending and also be ok with having those phases because i never feelt my frequent use was damaging . i would even say such phases are welcomed by myself , when they feel right again . do not rely on what i wrote . this surely isn ' t the only reason for somebody using lsd so often . if you think your desire exists because lsd lets you be happy when you feel depressed , confident when you are shy or just lets you be the person you want to be , but aren ' t capable of otherweise . thats how damaging and addictive behaviors start . lsd may not be addictive in the ways other drugs are , but it surely will make you dependent , if used to escape your sober self . i can ' t tell you what ' s best for you , just go with what feels right for you . just be sure to honestly think about your consumption . when you understand your behavior better , it comes easier to stop or continue . since lsd does not have a physically addictive side , the reason for an addiction arises from your mind . stopping or continuing depends on the reason why you are consuming in the first place . but if you are in doubt , its better to take a break . you probably wouldn ' t have asked here if there isn ' t something worrying you about your usage . i can only tell you that i personally say that frequent lsd use , is one of the least damaging drugs , if not pushed beyond what feels good . just take some time to really organize your thoughts , minds and goals . be honest , follow what feels right for you . lsd is exhausting for your mind , some time to think may offer you what you hadn ' t capacity and time to find out during the time of constant tripping .

16. i was a full blown alcoholic , who treated my friendships as transactional relationships and always had a reason why it wasn  t totally my fault some terrible thing had happened to me or that i had done something shitty to someone else . everyone , including me , was a victim of circumstance and anyone in my position would have done what i did . i got sober over digit years ago , sorted out a bunch of my shit , tried to make up my past transgressions to other people and barring the ability to take direct responsibility for those things , am just trying to live my life better . sometimes i get hung up on what i used to be like , but , can also step back enough to recognize that i can  t redo any of that time in my life and just try to be my best self now . i think past me did some shitty stuff , but , that doesn  t make me a shitty person through and through . i don  t think you can hate yourself into making or maintaining positive changes in your life . present me learned a lot through that experience and especially through getting sober . hopefully , i  ll continue to grow more , keep working on being the best version of myself and , if presented the opportunity , can help others who have similar life experiences .

18. this one is an underwater version of super meat bros , with minor tweaks  this one is a red coin level , which was super hard for me to clear since i  m a casual . it would be easier if i put checkpoint flags after you collect the second red coin , you go into the pipe with goombas coming out of it . it  s not very clear since i didn  t put any arrows indicating you to go in it .

19. then you went to a bad range . i would love to tell you that does not happen but my experience has been it is more common than not . i hope your co worker took the time teach you basic safety and operations , and that you enjoyed your self .

20. not in some states in australia . i used to live in new south wales where my mum had dad forcefully commited . i don ' t remember much about his first few episodes as i was pretty young and my oldest sister and mum sheltered me from it . but from what mum told me my dad is bipolar with a schizophrenic psychosis and ocd tendencies . he does not know who ' they ' are or what ' they ' want but he knows that ' they ' are after him . he started or we noticed his mental state was not right about digit years ago . he is on 120mg of zoloft a day and a daily dose of risperdal i don ' t know the mg dosage for that one . it took the doc a while to get the right mix of meds to treat him those were some fucking scary times . every time we take him to see a new doctor they freak out and try to change his meds and dosage because of what he is on . when we got him to the dr they put him on some meds that didn ' t work he flipped his lid one day , put a 6foot speargun in the back of the car and went out looking for them . i remember him saying " i know where they are today , i have to get to get them before they get me . " mum called the cops and the port macquarie mental asylum they took him and he was in there for about digit  digit months . mum had to fight pretty hard to get him back out though . flash forward about a decade and the doctor we took him to in townsville decided that zoloft and risperdal were no good and changed his meds . he went beyond bat shit crazy , he ended up in townsville ' s acute mental asylum for a while . this was when we found out we couldn ' t have him forcefully commited in queensland , even though mum was his legal care giver they wouldn ' t take him against his will until he became violent or posed a threat to anybody . he hasn ' t lost touch with reality for a while now , that ' s both good and bad though . every couple of years he decides that he doesn ' t need the tablets anymore because he hasn ' t had an episode in a very long time . we all try to tell him thats because the meds are working , sometimes he listens , other times he stops taking the meds but tells us he still is taking them but we know how that song and dance ends . it takes about digit  digit days before his mental state starts to deteriorate and once that starts there is no way in hell we can get him to take meds again . he calls the asylums " hotel california " cause you can check in any time you want but you can never leave .
