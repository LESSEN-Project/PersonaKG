4. good point ama71832 . this is also why i never take cash . we could make a little more here and there , supposing these pax promising cash aren ' t the same ones that promise to tip in the app . but any protection we have is taken away . which means the passenger won ' t be held liable for damage or messes unless you actually took them to court for it . it also means that in the case of an accident , you ' re now liable under your insurance . insurance not enough ? you can bet your ass the pax will sue .
