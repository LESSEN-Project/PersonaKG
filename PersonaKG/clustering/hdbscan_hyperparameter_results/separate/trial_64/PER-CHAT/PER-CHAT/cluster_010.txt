2. may i ask what system you play and what rep you are ? because there is no way in hell you ' re playing high level duels and landing a mix of lights and heavies consistently as kensei . its most likely mid tier at best . people don ' t parry in high tier . they just block . and kensei is left useless at that point .

3. keep your ears open for people coming up behind you . don ' t panic and get out of their way safely . there are cunts in every sport so if you meet one ignore them .

6. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .

7. i hope this becomes a big trend . its so satisfying seeing people die this way
   (ID: 8f5b0c902ce9c2bf19ecdb9205cb3d9f2a7c14fa)

8. i don  t have evidence , there hasn  t been a study that i know of . but what  s happening now isn  t working so it  s gotta change . as someone else suggested in the comments making the people private to media and public would be a better way then my original suggestion
