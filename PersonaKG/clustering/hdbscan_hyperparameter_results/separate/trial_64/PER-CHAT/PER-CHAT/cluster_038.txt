3. i nearly did this to a player , not out of spite but by mistake . two accounts would go around our area , take all of the gyms and golden razz spam anyone who tried to retake them . they ' d just monopolize the area twice a week . asked around , no one knew who they were , so based on the behavior i figured it was a multi  account spoofer with a bot set up to berry feed . nearly reported it , but then i found out from someone at a raid that it was actually just a couple from the next town over who drove around and played super aggressively . would have felt really bad if i ' d reported then although niantic doesn ' t do anything about those reports anyway .

4. i ' m really sorry if this actually did occur , but it ' s just too thathappened for me to believe this . this reminds me too much of the stuff deviantarters with mary  sues post about their characters . maybe it ' s the format . maybe it ' s the fact their dialogue is just so basic this it pretty farfetched
