1. that ' s what it was like for me , maybe the business was dodgy , maybe not though because my other friends who worked in other businesses experienced the same thing . maybe i was unlucky ? but it can affect people in big business .

8. i . had no idea this was a thing . i am digit  a cat person . is this why some people are so aggressively proud of liking dogs more than cats ? i always used to wonder why people are so keen to shove that in my face .

10. the thing your typing on would of been made by people on low pay and long hours or is their suffering ok as you don  t see it ?
   (ID: bdf7e254fb732651bb0373067c57200731f7ca55)

11. because people can sit behind a screen and not get punched in the face which is an unethical thing to do to someone who doesn  t agree with you .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

12. of all the people that have seen this thing i bet at least one has has the old squiggity squirty to this .
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

13. yeah that ' s fair enough , although players like t . brady and sydney crosby actually do do that , it ' s just more difficult for then to build super teams around them . lebron has only been able to carry a shit tier roster to the finals twice in his career , and in this year ' s case a lot has to do with the weak competition in the east . also the commercials , stoppages , and fouls are actually the biggest issue with the nba . the o my reason it seems like the " main theme " is because it ' s them only thing people are responding to . they have no answer for the terrible stoppages , fouls , and commercial breaks .

14. the regional pokemon are supposed to be something special you get for traveling . i ' d always assumed that , once trading came out , it would become something that players who didn ' t have the means  opportunity to travel could get by engaging with other community members . this was kinda the expectation i had , and i knew a lot of other people that shared it . having it come out as a special event was kinda cool , but it changed farfetch ' d from this cool , insanely rare thing to another event pokemon . farfetch ' d went from being more rare than a legendary to essentially another pikachu in a hat .

15. pride is a place for people to be celebrated and excepted , not excluded . if people were excluded from pride , pride would become the very thing it battled to destroy .

16. is this a real thing ? people get accepted into colleges because their parents were there ?
