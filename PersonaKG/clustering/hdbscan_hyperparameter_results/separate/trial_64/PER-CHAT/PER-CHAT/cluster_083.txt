5. have you tried closing all of your vents in case you  re getting it through those ? you could be also getting air in the dash vents . if it  s not sealed you  ll likely get water in too which you could check by going through a car wash . to fix that would be to have the windshield pulled and resetting with new adhesive . my escape has a  wind  noise when driving but that  s caused by the wipers .
