7. then it  s whatever . the point is to keep having faith in him every single day until you die . but there  s many things that need to happen til he comes back , so we can say that he isn  t coming tomorrow because there  s things that need to be fulfilled . i  d suggest you watch this video . it  s a hour long but it  s really worth the watch .

9. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .

12. there ' s really no difference functionality  wise between the newer generations of smart phones . do we really need more powerful phones if we won ' t even use the to their full potential ? do we really need to go thinner instead of thicker for more battery life ? and storage is really dependent on how much money you throw at it . the only thing i see separating iphones and android phones at this point is the os and a headphone jack .
