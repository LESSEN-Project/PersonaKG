3. it ' s clear you ' ve never had depression . my mind wants to do something but my body just won ' t move no matter how motivated i am . i try convicing myself to do something but subconsciously my body knows i hate my life and dont want to do it . it ' s like falling into a deep hole you can ' t climb out of without someone getting you out .

4. i said it bfore but a recentish one for me  grindr date . arrived to guys apartment , expected to be a digit  on  digit deal . i like group situations sometimes but usually it ' s known before arrival if it ' s going to more than digit person , but whatevs got there and guy was jumpy af i don ' t know what he drug was on but it was the least relaxing  chill greeting ever i received . i continued though cos horny i walked in and there was another chap naked and on all fours , on a leash , drinking from a dog bowl water ? vodka ? who know and he just sat on his back paws and looked at me . didn ' t respond to me saying oh hi how are youu ? just stared at me with an expression of anger ? confusion ? supreme horniness ? place smelled terrible and i got a v creepy vibe . said to grindr guy ' actually man i have to head out sorry ' and brushed right past him out the door , left them to their angry lookin non  verbal pet play

5. i dont believe anyone truly gets over their first love , its an internal battle but you ' ll eventually realize you love the idea of him rather than the person . the biggest thing i noticed is even when you were madly inlove with eachother , you were always going to him , mentally and physically . you seemed to be putting more into the relationship than him and thats not a good thing . a healthy relationship requires balance , obviously sometimes the scale is tipped but it takes you both to balance it back out . my advice is to live in the moment rather than the past . its not uncommon to miss him , frankly it would be inhuman to completely try to erase him from your memory . what you need it more balance , but for yourself . dont let your emotions and memories tip your scale , keep your new memories and your new emotions in check on the other end . meet new people , focus on your school work , and ensure you ' re traveling forward rather than backwards . he has moved on , maybe not with the best intentions but you need to move on as well . try to open your heart to the possibity of him being happy without you and you being happy without him . if you can both realise you ' re happy without one another , you will finally have some closure . a stepping stone to happiness is forgiveness and remorse . know what you did to his current relationship and see what you can do to fix it . i hope you can take something from this . best of luck .

6. you aren ' t alone . at least in here . and i thought i was alone in my thoughts . you almost were talking about me . i ' ve never found anyone either . i wish i had a better answer . i ' ve been looking for years and i find no one really . i had one therapist who kept telling me my problems were mine and it ' s because i don ' t love enough . how do you love when you don ' t know what that is . other ' s have said to put others first . how do you do that when others don ' t even see you . so i feel for you in i ' ve never felt i could let go of everything except online and that ' s still behind a mask . if you need to vent , i ' ll listen . good luck my friend .

7. your dad sent his flying monkey when he saw you were slipping from his grasp . treat the flying monkey like you would a narc . even less , i  d say , because this is no way their business and between you and your dad . nothing requires you to even speak with this person . you don  t even have to acknowledge them . because of this was so important , shouldn  t your dad say these things himself ? stay strong .

8. i just read the other bit you posted , well in all fairness . it was his  her ? fault for not telling you straight away . you thought it was a woman , so your not exactly gay or bi or anything incase that ' s what your worried about , and it went no further than a kiss right . just count it as an unfortunate event and move on man

9. fuck that man . you are a human and you need to feel wanted . bang slime women dudes . i get where you are at , so was i . bottom line one thing is ending and another thing is starting , have fun , have sex , party , just love how you always wanted to .
   (ID: 3cd64a42c43aaba8bcfe70482cd19250f58de2f0)

10. it is not a petty reason at all to be angry at this . you said it yourself you guys had a rough childhood and you still have struggles . you are allowed to feel like this no emotion is invalid . im sorry you are going through this , you seem like a really strong person . focus on your school . i believe in you .

11. i know this sounds like a standard answer giving to everyone , but i know that its the best way . i know that because i also was in that position when you have lost so many of your friends , that there is no place to start , to regain them . put yourself out there , and with out there i mean really into the world of the people you want to befriend . when i needed a friend to go to parties with , i needed to go out alone , to find those with similar interest . and is definitely not so hard when you start building up confidence to go up ro people . most people don ' t have a reason to approach you when already having their social circle , so there is no was around for you to just start randomly talking with people that think may be symphatic . nearly all of the people i started talking to reacted super positve on that behavior . some may find it strange at first , same stick to that attitude and evem some of them will become your friensy

12. yes it would be , he already feels lonely for not having a girlfriend . what do you think his friends leaving will do to him ? you might just push him to complete loneliness and sadness . i too have never had a girlfriend and my friends are my emotional support so i feel him . he needs you guys please don ' t leave

13. yes , this piece of you missing sounds like the social part you reserved for people who do not accept you . i am sorry to hear that but no you can seek out new social ties from people who accept you for who you are . i can  t promise it will be easy and you may always miss what you have lost but it will get better if you remain open to new relationships .
   (ID: ead4924f7abc0f9258d2b484a3f379aedee2cc5c)

14. just take your time , i was in your situation too but in digit months i get better
   (ID: 5678e7d82af39057d98ff7906ce8fef81468ba06)

15. you ' re pretty self  congratulatory about your relationship , but the examples you give further down are far different than the struggles some people have in their relationships . failed exam ? not getting promoted ? that ' s life . if you have to pat yourself on the back for staying with someone through that then perhaps you have a different and privileged lens . my read on this thread is that their partner has persistent deep rooted issues that aren ' t improving despite ops best efforts and support . it can take the relationship beyond saving , and it ' s important to recognize that and take care of yourself   if all other options have failed . so revolution outcast ,  digit for the advice from half  elfbard .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

16. you ' re taking the cowards way out by ghosting him after saying you ' d give him a second chance . you should practice saying what you mean and meaning what you say . people might like you more
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

17. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

18. you do not have to be her friend . she hasn ' t earned your friendship . move on . declare yourselves acquaintances who only do things within groups of friends . ask your friend to set you up with a hot friend of hers and you ' ll return the favor .
   (ID: 5bae960970112f75742b080e45f735ad64949805)

19. if i were to stay with her , i would try my best to give her attention back and be the best boyfriend i could be . that  s not how i could see myself as an asshole . the way i could , would be me losing my patience and leaving in two months .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

20. women are not normal people . nothing you can do will make it easier .
