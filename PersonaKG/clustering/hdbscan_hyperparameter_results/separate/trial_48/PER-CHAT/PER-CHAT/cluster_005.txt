1. game was much more enjoyable back then , there is some farmable items and weekly events and thats it . i farmed vhl for digit and a half month now i barely play the game , all i do is afking in yulgar with other ppl with navals and vhl . it ' s most likely a show off game today .

2. i used to play offline so i could enjoy the game with no ads , now it  s like playing while online . forcing me to pay just so i can enjoy the game , i don  t like devs or games that do shit like that .

3. the overall monetization and and grinding you need to do to get some cosmetics and a few guns . if you don  t get the guns by the time the season ends you have to rely on rng from the caches . the gameplay has gotten boring and zombies hasn  t received many good updates besides the dlc maps . that  s how

4. i ' ve not had issues on xb1 , what issues are people having ? there ' s some stupid features for example  when someone joins an online adventure and you have to go to a destination for the next event and the destination is let ' s say 9km away , when new people joining the lobby they get spawned next to the destination and stop all the others in the lobby getting to it in time to get the . other than that i ' m not sure what else is wrong with it . i know the pc one has lots of issues though .

5. something has to change . digit games in one weekend is just too overwhelming and too frustrating . it makes me hate the game at times .

6. i understand what you are saying , and maybe they just needed money for something else like watch dogs legion or far cry new dawn . but if next ac game is another rpg i am really going to give up on it .

7. i don ' t mean balance as in the character meta , but in the community sense . more people are on equal footing . and yeah i agree the prices are ridiculous but unfortunately i don ' t think it ' ll change to much . i wish they would do a system like injustice where you could buy most characters for the farmable currency , but some would be event based

8. as long as they keep putting out seasons ill still play . i love seeing new skins and the live events , even if i stop finding the game fun ill still keep watch over the map and the item shop because i dont want to miss a thing

9. i agree , too many bugs . the banning ' s and other issues have destroyed my league . the ah stuff they are doing , is going to drive away most of the rest . there has been lots of good this year , the league stuff they just did , would be great if most of the best guys from my league weren ' t gone already . and the digit promos they ' ve done so far have been quality .

10. yeah , and the whole living story bs . what ' s the point of that again ? keeping players grinding in different areas ? what pisses me off the most tho is just how fucking random loot drops are , i can kill a mr . nobody in the corner of the map and get legendary precursor while opening every single boss chest once a day for one month gave me fuck all , neverminding the fact that every single weapon but the goddamn legendaries is just so fucking generic it ' s not even funny . at least gw1 had the brilliant idea of having some weapons being unique drops to locations , gave farmers a niche market if they could do something  in gw2 it ' s rng to whether you get a precursor or not .
