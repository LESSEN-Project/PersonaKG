1. a guy on my street used to try to drive us to school all the time and one of my friends used to go with him all the time . my friend always in the newest clothing , shoes , new phone , all that . well one day dude offered me a ride to school and i accepted when i was running late . during the ride to school he stopped in a neighborhood and told me  i will blow you for  digit  flat out said that . so me being like digit and this guy like digit are now face to face and he wants to blow me . i thought about it for a second , kindly declined , he tried to persuade me with more money but i again declined . in hindsight , its really gross to think about it and it still bothers me sometimes knowing a good friend was letting him do it .

2. prompt any upset customers to " let management know how they feel about the long lines " by doing a receipt survey . nps gets affected now dm ask sm whats going on . sm is forced to be engaged with the actions or lack of actions from all team members . we had a similar situation with a sfl not achieving expectations . our sm was blind to this . so we all would paige the sfl by name he would tell cashiers not to paige him by name . they still would call him but he wouldn ' t respond . once the survey ' s started coming in stuff changed real fast . i would say all in all about digit weeks of the bad nps score before stuff changed .

3. why is everyone praising this ? isn ' t this a normal parent thing to do ? or are you just all amazed that a black guy is taking care of his kids ?

5. aside from obvious signs such as abuse , look for subtle psychological abusive things like how the family interacts together . if a lot of times they are together with an attitude of only because i have to be here is a flag to look for , especially if they don ' t enjoy each other ' s company . other things to look for is how they talk about each other when they ' re not with each other  if it ' s all bad  mouthing or lack of respect , concern , or true love that too is surely a bad sign .

9. ianal from what i read in the article , no he can ' t do anything . i would apply for college , send the bill to your grandparents , and proceed from there . try not to let your uncle scare you . i don ' t think anything has to get legal . if it gives you peace of mind , talk to a lawyer . p . s . i would cut ties with the uncle . good luck with everything

13. i love bars ands skiing . i worked at and managed a fairly successful bar for seven years and have also lived in colorado . let me rant  coat hooks . everywhere , but especially under the bar top . the bar must have a bar for your feet . while being in touch with the local brewery is rad , if you are not trying to alienate anyone have one canned macrobrew option . i love beer but after a few craft brews i just want an ice cold bud . it ' s ok to have a small menu but make sure you do what you do well . make sure the menu does not alienates non  drinkers . which is to say if its boring , generic , or if there are good vegetarian options . what ' s the outside space look like ? could you park a food truck tacos ! outside to better maximize indoor space . on space  maybe run a standing level bar around the perimeter for people to congregate and have a place to rest drinks . jukebox . not all the time but if people want to guide the energy of the environment , let them feel comfortable . mountain bars mandate a good bloody mary as well as a good margarita . don ' t fuck those up . do not make it " no ski boots " on bathrooms  i always like the urinals that go all the way to the floor because i get to pee on the floor . however when i am layered up from the cold , doing the business in a union suit gets weird and my aim isn ' t the same . these are just some of my initial thoughts . i have a wealth of ideas and even more opinions . i have dined out for almost every meal for the last decade . i enjoy dining and drinking more than anything  it is my favorite hobby . i love both the dives and the fine dining . be one thing and do it well versus trying to juggle things and not really have an image or vibe or feeling or whatever the fuck you wanna call it when people think of your joint and are like yeah that ' s the spot . good luck i want to open my own place someday .

15. in asian cooking there is no universal brand that is good for all things , most brands become famous for the digit or digit sauces they make and expand into other sauces which they make not so well . also consider ingredients differ from country to country so for example thai rice flour is different from korean rice flour and different from japanese rice flour although all being just called " rice flour " on the package because the rice they eat is slightly different . this is the same with sauces for example chinese black bean sauce is not the same as korean black bean sauce . so if you truly want to know how to cook asian food well , you have to first have authentic regional asian food cooked for you . then you can try to replicate it yourself by experimenting with sauces and whatnot . that said , you can mix and match and have it taste good to yourself , just don ' t feed it to some korean girl and expect she won ' t spit it out in front of you .
