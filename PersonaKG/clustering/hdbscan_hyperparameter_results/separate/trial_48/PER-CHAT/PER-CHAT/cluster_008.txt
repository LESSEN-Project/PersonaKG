1. you ' re talking to a guy who like to browse porn and hentai subreddits your need to prove your philosophical superiority is misplaced .
   (ID: 0163212450bac6366408ac8e1e025d32048839ec)

2. yta . just a little bit though . you made a pdf of your views even after your friend wanted to stop talking about the topic . lay off it .
   (ID: 79917d7ca06e9cf750b82c793acd3eb69f1c905f)

3. funny how you haven ' t actually been able to make a logical counter argument . you ' re just saying " you ' re wrong " without the logical backing that i have . then the " boo hoo whatever dude ! you ' re , uh , just like , uh , a flat earther dude " really , i am ? i ' m literally just like a flat earther ? that is your brilliant counter argument ? that saying it is wrong to promote a lie is exactly as bad as lying ? that is what you ' re telling me ? do you . do you realize how incredibly stupid you just made yourself look ? you just made yourself look like a clown .

4. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

5. your first respons had little to nothing to do with my original post . you just tossed out your own idea . you then mentioned how it would remove the pvp aspect . i responded by explaining why pvp can ' t work in this . when you mentioned that games succeed or fail based on numerous things , i pointed out that dbd devs can focus on those numerous things that could boost the quality to oblivion , if they start using controllable ai . i ' ve stayed on topic . you haven ' t . you ' re a pathtic hypocrite .

6. ding ding ding . youre right . thats what i was trying to say . the gov thinks the nic addiction is more minor than a heroin addiction , so they ' ll keep nic legal and tax it to make money , because thats what governments do . however , they think heroin is more dangerous and would prefer to keep it illegal rather than tax it . seems like we ' re on the same page here .

7. who makes that decision ? who determines what conditions or characteristics are fine and which are not ? disabled adults would be against this idea of yours . what makes you think you know better than they whether they have a right to live ? no , you ' re talking about babies , but babies don ' t get to be adults if you ' d have them euthanized first . this is a slippery slope that starts with ostensibly good intentions and ends with eugenics .
   (ID: 5146a89965a734a4d1ec9ec9145abae872a4569d)

8. that  s very far fetched . you want to argue more than the face value of the comment but i  m sorry , there  s nothing more and nothing less . i know nothing about what you posted of , but have read about the social credit experiment china is rolling out and how those with low scores may not be able to fly . i would assume protesters would cause low points , therefore would disable a protester from flying on a plane and that  s why i commented such . as far as feeling insecure , i have no idea why you even assumed that much . by the way , your title is interpreted as you being sympathetic to both the assaulted and assaulters so your message isn  t effective . i suppose i should have pointed that out instead . good luck on your awareness campaign .

9. religious bigotry is why people like you don ' t get respect . you offer nothing but hate
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

10. do you have any evidence that the murder was ordered by the dnc ? why does one get the benefit of the doubt and not the other ? because one fits your political narrative of harming your opponents . and the other doesn ' t .
   (ID: 73a501f273781aa2c0deb878ecb02dcab3a9d4d3)

11. well you were correct which does say something . i will say that i would hope more minorities would agree with what i ' m saying , those who have experienced the worst of discrimination are usually the most motivated to end it .

12. silence mere surfer . your country lost a war to birds . america is clearly the superior country .
   (ID: b7ca8beb99c98a46de3704213b38cdcc44dbb728)

13. all i  m trying to say is , if their goal is to include everyone , why exclude white people ? yes we have done horrible things in the past , but we changed
   (ID: 021c01b3e15fb3077444bd9abdbc0d7c390239b0)

14. not playing into your hand or giving you the answers you want is not avoiding questions . i have answered each question you asked , if you don ' t like the answers stop asking the questions . once again you think you will paint me into in a corner . you cannot . you will find yourself wanting if you continue to play your social justice warrior , validation game with me .

15. firstly because it was a long response , and it wasn  t angry , i thought u were offended . secondly was daily in capitals i now know it was a mistake and the fact that you told me to go and get the armour myself , which would be pointless as i don  t want it
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

16. would you like to explain to me why you don  t find an entire race attractive instead of getting angry ? or is that a sign you have no rebuttal because i  m right ?
   (ID: 2401680976bbdfe87278659ff11173d22161b22d)

17. i don ' t think most are brainwashed , i think most are scared to speak up against their government . edit  if the government would have treated then right , and let them have a lot material things and would have taken good care of them , then it would have been difficult to to deal with them . from what i understand , news reports coming from that area , is that theya re living in poverty . not too long ago there was a video going around of reddit of a digit year old girl who was starving to death .

18. word , ight . i may not be black , but i sure as shit ain  t no nigger . see , freedom of speech mo  fo . i may not like what you say but i will defend your right to say it . nigger .

19. wow a trumper yeah if you voted for him your a racist moron weather hillary was a bad candidate is imaterial and if you think democratic socialism and socialism are the same thing just shows how out of touch with reality you are . hopefully one day you ' ll go back to school and try again
   (ID: 0def2b70456d7a000d0e2b3611ac80cd2990e21c)

20. forget about skin color . that  s just completely irrelevant . who cares what color anyone in this story is ? if someone breaks into your home , you have the right to shoot them ! i don  t own a gun but shit like this makes me want to get one . you have a right to protect your home and yourself and the person who broke in is a criminal and should have been aware of the risks ! bring on the downvotes , i don  t care . seems like i  m the only person here with any sense in their head ! why are you sticking up for someone who broke into someone else  s home ? play stupid games , win stupid prizes ! duh !
