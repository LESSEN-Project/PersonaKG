2. that makes sense . i have bought stuff for team fortress digit before , but they were weapons to be used in game . it ' s just hard for me to justify more than a  digit for an iphone game that you will get bored of in a few days . but i am sure there are many dedicated app gamers out there . someone has to get to the top of the leaderboards .

5. is there one of these for the extra deck ? sometimes i feel like digit cards is just one to few , and theres so much nuance in deciding how many copies to run in the extra .

10. this was already posted . someone mentioned that there is a possibility of an extra digit   digit  off down the road , similar to last year . yet , many of the items may be sold out by then . so grab what you like if you feel it may not be available . also those normandys are great , the ones on clearance don ' t have the same soles as the updated ones unfortunately .

13. i think it  s pretty obvious that they have grown to a point that they need to follow the money . you can  t blame them but for every single feature that doesn  t drive revenue requires capital . with plex pad not being essential for all users , they literally have a zero rmr driving product that said , you can  t expect endless resources to come from nowhere . the options are   people pay more for what they get to allow them to ease up on other methods of generating revenue  let them get some revenue driving streams so they can soon offer the features they likely need money to develop .  or digit , find something better . right now , they are not as customer hungry as they are capital hungry so they gotta do what they gotta do this is all simply my opinion on all the recent whining about not getting what people want . it  s still leaps and bounds ahead of anything out there
