1. what are you studying ? if it ' s not something you can take to the marketplace and secure a job right away because of your education you may be wasting your time and money . also , if you are going deep in debt for your education beware .

2. every job will do , as long as you adjust your living standards . i don ' t want to argue that living coast are way to high in the last few years . and that mini jobbers don ' t get paid enough , is also true . but thats how things are at the moment , so you have to adjust . at most places your job you doing besides beeing in school won ' t pay you an own apartment . the higher the coasts of living are in a city , the more you have to find things to cut out . get a roommate , maybe even more . just buy cheap foods that are on discount and stock them . use a bike if possible instead of public transport quit your gym and start bodyweight training shorten your shower times buy everything possible used . sadly a lot of students have to work a lot , while also balancing school life , without a fair payment . so you will just need to be really lucky with your job or you have to really cut back in your living standarts for a few years . maybe even share a room and give up your privacy . i don ' t wanna get into finding somebody helping you out with money , you probably wouldn ' t have asked if this possibility exists . hopefully we students use this unfairness as motivation to make it possible for the next generation to have a healthy work school balance and getting a fair payment .

4. apprenticeships ! you can work and get a degree at the same time . you do it with a company , you get a reduced salary , but it means you don ' t have to pay anything , and you get experience in the workplace . you do come out of it with a degree in whatever field your apprenticeship was in

5. i am the first in my family to go to college . i did ok but should have done much better . my dad worked to pay off my school through a small business he started . he paid until junior year when he got cancer . at that point i got loans . i came out of school with about  19k in debt . not bad but not zero . that seems like a small amount of debt but i hustled for digit years throwing everything extra i had at it . then i got married . i hated that i brought that burden on my wife . you never know what may be coming . will your car break down ? will you get  keep a job ? will you have tremendous medical needs ? you can get hit by a bus like anyone else . my advice is this . go to community college and get an associates degree as cheaply as possible . then go to college for your bachelors degree in a field you like may not love and that has some demand . if you do that you  ll never worry about a job . good luck

6. well if it were me i would definitely keep my solid plan a and atleast have the good job that you majored in . but at the same time don ' t just let your true love for writing die . i ' m not positive how to go about it but i feel like you could get your first book published and see how it does ?

7. do it ! who knows , maybe you ' ll fall into another career path you love even more ! i took off several years after college before taking the pre  reqs . i learned a ton , had some great experiences and some not  so  great experiences , and am pretty happy with my decision i guess we ' ll see how my cycle goes . i actually think you ' re very mature  you ' ve figured out what might be best for you !

8. i just want to work on developing strategies that make money . focusing on development and especially ai and ml . it seems like the closest thing to a well paid " problem solver " , plus the feeling that i could " create " money for myself was something i ' ve never felt before and feel regardless of what happens in life , as long as there are markets , you could be somewhat self sufficient . not sure what role that would be called though , they seem to go under many names or none at all . i just want to prepare myself to " get in " to any position to start .

9. more context is needed . it  s not uncommon living with your parents in countries with weak economies . many times , entry jobs don  t pay nearly enough for someone to self sustain

10. i  ve said it before but treat college like a digit houweek job and you  ll do well academically . you  re about to get a ton of time and that can make you think you can do it later . make a schedule . do digit hours a day of studying , writing , and assignments and you  ll do fine .

11. you ' re probably better off talking to a career counselor , or going to a job centre for this kind of thing . you can also check out the book , " what color is your parachute " , for general career advice .

12. ok , honestly same i ' m one year ahead of you , but in the uk , we can ' t just pick up a class . i figured out i wanted to do theatre when i was digit . i hadn ' t studied it for two years , and i couldn ' t pick it up . so i ' m doing whatever i can outside of school . but now i ' ve been hit with the issue of " how the hell do i pay attention to anything in school " you ' ve gotta look at the bigger picture . universities want to see that you ' re a rounded person if you choose to do that , so you ' ve gotta have something else to show for yourself . most importantly , what your dad said about some actors not making it ? no , most actors don ' t make it . it ' s ridiculously competitive , and you ' ll have to work multiple jobs just to keep on top of rent and stuff . or , you can work hard in school , get a solid fall back chemistry for me and then know that you can work a good job alongside auditions . then you can spend longer auditioning and stand a better chance of actually making a living on acting . if that doesn ' t help , then find something in the other classes that interests you . sure , maybe chemistry isn ' t your thing , but that one topic on equilibrium you love . or you hate shakespeare , but you find the casket problem in the merchant of venice fascinating . great ! find little things that excite you and cling to them for dear life . finally , if none of that works , just buckle down and get it done . accept that you will fuck up your life if you don ' t finish highschool so you just have to . talk to your teachers , reward yourself for revision , don ' t be too hard on yourself , but just get it done . it sucks but you don ' t have a choice . feel free to send me a dm , you ' re a theatre kid my age  we ' d probably get along lmao

13. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

14. hey all , so i ' m currently a 1st year physics student in one of the better uk unis and am starting to fear for my future . the thing is i only have enough money to sustain myself for the duration of the course , that means that i will only have the opportunity to do one internship because of how the uk system works , no masters studies , no digit year industry placements . so after digit years i will have a bsc in physics and will be looking for a job . i ' ve tried reading up online what a physics graduate can do , however most of the conversations are geared towards masters and phd ' s and for undergrads they usually talk about majors  minors in the us , which isn ' t a thing here , i only have physics to my name . now , i don ' t care that much if my job has little or nothing to do with my course , as long as it doesn ' t feel like my education was a complete waste of time . though it seems to me like i can ' t get into nucleaoptics  medical  meteorological physics , because they have enough masters and phd applicants . i like programming , but i won ' t be qualified enough to compete against compsci  engineering graduates , even if i take extra modules in them .   x200b  so besides teaching which i really don ' t want to do , am i completely screwed ? i only have one chance at an internship , what sector should i aim for that has no problems accepting physics bsc ' s with a little bit of experience ?
