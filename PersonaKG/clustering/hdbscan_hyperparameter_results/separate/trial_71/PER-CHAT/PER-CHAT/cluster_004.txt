1. not sure if this counts but i was out walking my dog in the when i come across one of my classmates tied to a tree , unconscious and severely dehydrated , apparently some other class mates mugged him , beat the hell out of him and dragged him into the woods , naturally i untied him and explained what i knew to the police and i know very little after that , the two thugs and the victim did not come back to school and the teachers did explained the circumstances , i was never called as a witness , my guess is they plead guilty to whatever charges or because they were minors got a slap on the wrist with a new identity , apparently the victim did recover physically but lord knows what going through that really does to you .

3. no , i never told anybody . it ' s hard to explain , but i just can ' t get it out of me . i was afraid for so long that i would be judged , or that people would " feel bad for me " . i know what happened was horrible , but i ' m in a good place now . i don ' t want unlock that part of my memory for someone else to see , if that makes sense .

5. mortality . i thought of mortality as a distant subject which happened to only others when i was younger . i was a naive kid for sure . lately i ' ve been surrounded by loss and it ' s readjusted my attitude to some things .

6. as a kid , i was traveling with my family to my grandparents . my dad went to the bathroom on the boat terminal and me thinking it would be funny to scare him when he got out so i waited outside the stalls and scared " him " when the door opened . thing is it was some random dude . man i still cringe over that to this day .

7. i was taking a shit in my alternative school bathroom stall , put my phone on the floor so it wouldn ' t fall out my pocket and break , some guys walked in and saw it on the floor , my teacher thought i was watching porn , my probation officer heard about it , i lost my phone to him for a week . that ' s my only story so far . and it wasn ' t even a porn watching story .
