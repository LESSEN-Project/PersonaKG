1. a friend of mine was being a dick on a constant daily basis after a recent event happened . like he would criticize every thing i did like how i played a game or ate food or even laughed . it bothered him so much he had to say something harsh every damn minute . but his comments pissed me off so much after a few months that one day i snapped and screamed in front of all our friends " diego you became a fucking asshole ever since your dad died " and there my moment was .

2. i was working a food line by myself , and we got a rush of like 9ish small groups , and in the middle of me running around trying to make everything , a woman came up to the counter complaining that i didn ' t cut the crusts off of her son ' s sandwich . if that had been instructed , i would have done so , but i wasn ' t informed that she wanted that , and i was busy as all hell . the dark part of me wanted to hurl a knife at her and yell " do it yourself bitch " but i just asked to wait a few minutes , and i would give her a free sandwich , without the crusts . thankfully she shut up after that , but fuck , i wanted to yell at her .

3. i had been at my job only a few weeks . the guy i worked closest with was a real jerk . he gave me one hershey kiss . just to act like i wasn  t embarrassed i said thanks and immediately ate it . everyone else in the office told him that was a dick move . he said ,  just kidding  and gave me the case of beer he carried around in the trunk of his car . he later got fired for being a total slacker and i got his job .

5. the company i work for pays us to go volunteer a few times a year with a food bank we work closely with and donate to and what not . the fuckin nerve of some people that come in there is unreal . you have the super nice and just down on their luck people that are super appreciative for anything you give them , and for helping load it into their cars and what not , then you get the giant pricks who make you put digit bags into their brand new car , then when you get there they open up the bags and start taking out vegetables and whatever else they dont want and demand you bring them back inside and give them extra cake or sweets , or whatever they choose then flip out when you tell them that ' s not really how it works .

6. my mom once went to a popeye ' s where the service was really slow and there was bulletproof glass separating the cashier from the customers . the service was so slow that a guy who was waiting in line was able to watch a few episodes of daredevil in the amount of time it took him to get his food . my brother wanted to leave , but my mom had already paid for our chicken and she didn ' t want to trust the dumb kid behind the counter with her credit card again . the moral of the story is that you shouldn ' t go to popeye ' s restaurants in the ghetto .
