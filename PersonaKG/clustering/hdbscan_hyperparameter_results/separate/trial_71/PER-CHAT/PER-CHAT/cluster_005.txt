1. i mean you could just ask if he wants to hang out just the two of you , and if je suggests more friends to bring take it as a hint he doesn ' t like you like that .

2. 26m here . you basically just described me . so not alone ? though i also dont feel good about this ravenous pessimism toward dating either but can ' t shake the feeling that it ' s all a waste of time

3. i suppose i have some perspective in a way from your girlfriends point of view as i think my girlfriend has similer feelings as i ' m still close friends with a guy i slept with the guy and i where friends long before i should add and it was a one time thing i know it kinda makes her uncomfortable so i try to take in to consideration her feelings about hanging out with him such as i would be with him alone but shes okayish with it because she trusts me .   x200b  so i guess what im saying in your gf case she must feel pressured by her ex into keeping contact and feels terrible about it , i say just try and support her as dealing with abusive ex partners can be a rough experience

4. i think you ' re doing the right thing . i hope the kid understands your decision as soon as he is old enough to get the story .

5. oh , believe me , noah aint the worst shit you could have gotten . i have a name that only two other people have in my country , so . its pretty embarrassing . and well its just a one crush . i know it feels like shes the one , but let her make a decision , and accept it no matter what it is . you can try taking her out on date to show that you aren ' t some random retard . good luck man , waiting for the best news from you !
   (ID: 8487a8406f04273c554e2e578c3a667648916790)

6. i don ' t have experience with cheating parents or spouses , at least not that i ' m aware . i do agree with you that is wrong and harmful to both women . however , if i were in your shoes , i would have to ask myself some questions . first , what do you want to accomplish by speaking with your mom ? you clearly cannot change her behavior by talking to her about it , as you have tried that . secondly , what kind , if any , relationship do you want with her ? if you intervene in some way call the wife , confront the man , etc , you will be further alienating your mom . and lastly , can you live with this knowledge and not intervene if that is the only way to save your relationship with your mother ? if you answer these questions honestly and with great contemplation or not rashly , i believe you will know what course you should take . good luck !

7. then tell her that . in a nice way . it could start as simply as ,  do you mind asking me before you plan to invite your mom to stay over ?  she may also benefit from getting a more substantial friend group in your new area .
   (ID: 5d0b750bf77c2c6e8b41ebf03caf4038a907b876)

8. seems like he has a lot of baggage going on . he ' s sexuality interested in other people and is likely cheating , or going to cheat outside of the rules . if you have rules like you do , you shouldn ' t be together . it ' s gonna get ugly if you stay .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

9. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .

10. did you ever talk about it ? with someone close or a professional ? i mean i was in an abusive relation once , took me a couple of years to get over the most troublesome aspects mostly because i acted like i was ok . but i ' m in a happy relation now . i ' ve just been really open about it with my partner and she knows that there are things that trigger me . she tries to help me with it . it ' s nice to have a partner .
   (ID: 5bb6e2d4db1d5ccf3a1f430564735551dfb4c28b)

11. i don ' t know about the falling in love and all that . but if you ' re looking for advice take it from someone digit years older than you . forget about her . don ' t even think about it anymore . you ' re young as fuck and there ' s plenty of women out there . and don ' t fall in love .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

12. do you have to fight it back ? being sad can be a beautiful thing too ! you can ' t always bother your friends and family but it ' s definitely an option . does it feel like you care a whole lot about those people , so much that it actually hurts , like , in your lower chest ? sort of like something is squeezing ? cause i ' ve had that before .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

13. it sound that those people in your life are holding you back and that isn  t good for mental health . i  m not saying you should get rid of them but certainly make them aware that your life is more than chores or work and everyone needs a hobby and shouldn  t have to hide it .
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

14. bad break up ? if so you got to let it go . if not , then go outside and explore somewhere where people are accepting , like a sports bar or social clubs or something where you can add to peoples conversations
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

15. thank you for the response , i  ve been considering whether she  s really worth keeping around anyways . it  s just so hard to cut out someone who you  ve known your whole life .
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

16. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

17. he ' s digit years older than you and you ' re gonna have a miserable life ahead of you if you stay . you gotta worry about yourself first . you do what you think you need to do .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

18. thank you for your comment , you  ve made a lot of sense to me . it  s like a switch gets flipped whenever i begin to think about doing something for me . study , art , meditation , even my last therapy session i struggled to keep myself present and awake . having been in therapy for a year now , my therapist has only recently begun talking about dealing with my cptsd so i  ve got a long way to go . hopefully i can begin unpacking my terrible coping mechanisms soon because they really are disabling in so many ways .

19. it really sucks when things don ' t work out with someone you love . people make mistakes , but cheating isn ' t a mistake . you don ' t accidentally dip your dick in someone . it ' s a choice . a choice someone who fully loved you wouldn ' t make . i ' m sorry , you probably could ' ve worked things out if that hadn ' t happened . but he did it and you shouldn ' t let him get away with it . it sucks having to live without someone you love , but people make their own choices regardless of what anyone else tells them .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

20. he is trying to pimp you out . i suggest you tell him that his friend can ' t come over anymore . you need to put your foot down because if you don ' t , your going to be sleeping with all of his buddies and whomever else .
