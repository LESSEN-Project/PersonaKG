1. do all the volunteering  internships you can , i suggest thesca . org in the us totally worth their one  time application fee , it ' s super easy to apply for things once you have your profile . be willing to travel wherever you get offered a position . alaska doesn ' t get too many applicants , so it ' s a good starting point  just be willing to go without internet or cell service for a long time . it can get lonely .

2. it  s funny here your talking about rape . most male rape never is even told bc of the embarrassment of being a guy and then second not being believed . anecdote was sexually abused told my mom she didn  t believe me digit toodles females aren  t the only ones who can get raped and even more males aren  t the only  savages  . coming from a digit year old who has a lot of hormones . yea i like a girl and if she doesn  t like me okay . that  s life you sometimes meet people that you like and they don  t like you and vice verse , you just have to find someone who both of you like each other , no i  m never gonna go rape someone . if a thought like that ever comes to my mind i will just laugh my ass off and tell myself what the actual fuck are you thinking brain loudly . trying to push thoughts out of your brain is impossible so i just let my brain free roam as it wishes but i just control my body . basically what normally happens , i think with my brain sometimes and body just goes auto or i do whatever i want and brain free roams . some may say multitasking others may say muscle memory whatever flows your boat . i think more so people need to educate others about the whole idea of rape and yes some people even if it is morally wrong may think rape is okay when aroused or is one of their kinks is wrong . even more sometimes your brain will get thoughts you shouldn  t but the key thing is never acting on them and practicing control

3. probably jordan peterson right now . because he ' s so good at articulating his ideas . it makes me feel like what i can articulate and how i feel about situations are more in line with each other . which it turns out is very important . not to mention his ideas themselves beyond that are incredibly helpful to so many people .

4. imo when you say you believe in something , you stand up for it even when it doesn ' t benefit you . if you believe in freedom , then you have to protect people ' s freedom to do things you don ' t want to do . otherwise you were lying about valuing freedom .

5. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .

10. there came a moment when i thought about all the things i liked about life and had to decide if i wanted to give up on all the things i liked . because once you go away you don ' t get to like anything anymore .

16. i mean sometimes if there ' s a car on fire on the road or there ' s been an accident then if someone uploads it to like their social media saying avoid the let ' s say m25 there ' s been an accident ? i mean going in and filming dead bodies and injured people isn ' t the greatest move but what if your just taking a video of something while passing by ?

18. there was a big difference between child tax credits and the disability element of that and the child element of uc . i can ' t remember the exact amounts as we got moved over digit yrs ago but it worked out at approx digit per week . that was with digit dla child . my 2nd child recieved his dx late last yr so i haven ' t been claiming his extra for long . i also got hit by bedroom tax despite it being medical reasons why both children couldn ' t share a room despite having medical grounds since my eldest was digit and a half . it ' s basically just so much lower than income support , especially for a couple as it was before my husband became my ex now as a single parent i ' m getting used to the new budget still

19. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .

20. just play the game and focus on those viewers who are chatting . the truth is , you will never know why people leave , they just do , for a wide variety of reasons . you will never retain digit  of the viewers who join your stream . focus on what you do well . watch your vods . improve on things you feel need improvement . growth will come .
