4. should always grab any mats available if you have the ap though both needles and eyes are pretty uncommon for a mat requirement but i ' d suggest taking a look at the servant to see if any of your favourites require them . abuse that clairvoyance a fake

5. sounds like she wants you to look .
   (ID: 840f5d9bddf24e024b9a70f13cdde62d41604e77)

6. it is bad in many moments like how the monsters look and that many characters look kinda dollish . what bothered me most were the nipples . the fight scenes still looked great in my opinion and the important characters didn ' t look worse than what you get in your usual anime

8. never assume you are greater than another . you are human giving birth to a human . when you put someone or yourself on a pedestal , they  you will look down on yoothers .

11. watch it again . its after he turns and runs . listen to them talk about it , as well . not even close . and if he had called it and thats what caused kozma to break off , why do him and holiday look at each other like a couple of bumbling idiots immediately after ? regardless of how you think of that particular call , instant replay would be of huge benefit to all teams in the mlb .

   (ID: be374ceda79d95351245599dbc1b4cf212da3fff)

19. this is a reacurring dream . i wake up and every one is dead then i blink and i ' m outside in a dump . i see my cat and pick him up but then he turn to a pile of bones and blood . when i look at my hands they are full of glass . when i look back up i ' m in a bathroom with my sister but she ' s dead . when i start to remove the glass from my hand its a big piece that is about digit inches . then i hear a bang from upstairs and so i go up with a knife . when i reach the top of the stairs i get pushed down then wake up . its terrifying and i try not to sleep anymore .
