9. the most common entry points are  gaunt  s ghosts  follows a company of imperial army soldiers led by comissar gaunt . good for a perspective of the regular soldier in this grimdark setting eisenhorn trilogy  follows inquisitor eisenhorn and is a good source to understand how the imperium works space wolf omnibus  follows the process of recruitment  training  creation of a space marine . the main character knows almost nothing of the galaxy , so he and the reader learn together horus heresy where i started  it actually is warhammer 30k , with it  s story being about the imperium civil war and the rise of chaos across the galaxy . self contained and explains why things are so bad in 40k . the only problem is that it  s a huge series with over digit books though not all are necessary reading . yet i absolutely encourage you to read  em all

17. the judeo  christian god is an absolute of everything we consider desirable , to the extent that it is unattainable and conflicting , all powerful , all knowing , and all loving sound good on paper , but conflict with the presence of evil polytheistic religions tend to have gods that celebrate human characteristics and imperfections . unfortunately , gods that celebrate human characteristics like partying , drinking , war , and sex aren ' t good for " controlling people " everything good is attributed to one god , everything bad attributed to our humanity .
