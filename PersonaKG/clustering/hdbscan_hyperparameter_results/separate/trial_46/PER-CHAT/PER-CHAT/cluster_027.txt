3. yep . i could see spidey getting in over his head with kingpin fuckery and dd comes in as the expert of all things fisk and helps him out . the two have a lot in common in that their secret identities are very important to protect those they love , and that they are very neighbourhood based . in essence they ' re serving very much the same role .

   (ID: 8a914d1b332f7e39fd1f0cbb2c4b483e19f43fd7)

11. i had philophobia . i don ' t know if i still have it . it ' s basically the fear of love . i have it because of my parents . i had to watch them constantly argue . their sick relationship and the fact that they hardly ever showed any signs they loved me , caused some brain damage to me and now i usually can ' t listen when somebody is talking about love , especially very traditional love . i hate family as a unit and i hope i will never have children . also i find newborn babies disgusting because they are kinda a " a fruit of love " .
