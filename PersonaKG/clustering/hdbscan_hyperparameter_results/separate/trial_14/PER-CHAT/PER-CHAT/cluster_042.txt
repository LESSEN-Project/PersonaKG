9. i mean , i get it . we grow up and suddenly we ' re responsible for our own survival , when we only exist because someone else wanted us to . why do i have to get a job and pay bills and all that shitty stuff , when my parents are the ones that put me here ? don ' t know that you can really win in a court of law , and maybe you should suck it up and just deal . but i get it .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

11. the main flaw i see with many answers is threefold . negotiating will be difficult when you don  t know the language . even shakespearean english could be a rough adjustment . depending on whom you are negotiating with , they may just take it . and , if you bring back something that appears too shocking , threatening or evil , you might meet your maker rather quickly .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

   (ID: eb0cdac3cc0d373669b221df2a54b8040cfa1dde)

15. if you ' re doing it once a week , that ' s a habbit in it of it ' s own . now i don ' t know how it will affect your brain . i would just warn you about addiction . it ' s a slippery slope .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)
