1. i ' m pretty sure it ' s before , because in lore it says that doomfist was defeated by winston and put in prison . saying that the fight scene ends with doomfist and winston about to clash i think it ' s pretty safe to say it ' s before prison . i might be wrong though , because the doomfist mentioned in the original cinematic could be a different one .

2. you might think we ' re done . but no matter what you say , we will complete this dungeon . if rocks fall and yolnaak dies , so be it .

4. personally i would say that altair and edward would be the last ones standing . kenway , being a pirate would be prone to fighting dirty and altair was trained from the moment he could walk , if my memory serves pun totally fucking intended , would , and should absolutely kick ass . personally i think that altair takes the cake but it would be a pretty close call .

5. i can ' t say for sure , but i ' m conjuring up scenes in my head of jedi force  pushing multiple droids over at once ? i think that happened . no idea why there would be an issue focusing on multiple things , although as many as the number of grains of sand in a tornado might be too difficult .

6. i wouldn  t say your original post came off as humble . i didn  t think it was arrogant though . all i have to say is , if the women that you  re talking to desire you more when you  re being a jerk , they must have no self  esteem .

7. which capital do you think he wants ? i say let him have washington . he can ' t do any worse . he is god after all , so do you think one capital is enough ? maybe we should offer him two .

8. i think as comments flow , you ' ll realise this may not be so much of an unpopular opinion . nevertheless i must say you articulate yourself well . a  from this stranger .

9. for me i think all my ex ' s would say i am sexually and emotionally unavailable
   (ID: a9b082d677d5caf5ac966fb248caa2e59e1f68ad)

10. i think given the fact that she sat with him all day on the weekend , no . i would say there were circumstances beyond her control making it necessary for her to continue working .

11. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .

12. what i ' m trying to get across is that if you are a poc and a white person saying white pride bothers you unless we are talking in a way meant to harass someone but you , as a poc , can say it some adjustment is needed . it should not matter what your skin color is . it should not give you free passes or exceptions . do i think there are inequalities ? yes . and they are on both sides though one side is more so

13. anti  intellectualism is great to see on what is meant to be a university community . big words , small words , what ' s the difference ? i ' m not posturing . i use the terms that i think best express my ideas . i didn ' t present a counter  argument because isanybodylisten didn ' t present any points that could be refuted in a meaningful way . it was very much , " i see you as being    " . i could say that i ' m not those things , but those are equally weak statements . in what class could you get away with making an assertion without justification ? none . if you ' re comfortable with drawing all of your conclusions about someone from the way they conduct themselves on reddit , maybe you ' re pretentious .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

14. i ' d say no . but i think a lot of it is personal bias or what one would prefer to watch .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

15. i didn ' t say everyone is doing it . but if you think it ' s a nonissue , that ' s on you .
   (ID: 6513b981e1534ff5f0e9f18e4fbf04904704b27c)

16. that ' s funny you say that , i was say the same thing . i think it ' s because of the genetics . nyc has more straight up caribbean and west african folks .
   (ID: a2675f82b975abffb78846564049076f436d7dfc)

17. how do you say you ' re pretty well sized and in the next sentence say how it has been problematic for you but my lizard brain still manages to ignore that and think  " damn , having a huge dong sounds great . " it ' s so ingrained .
   (ID: d7b75c00237dc445cdc3ebc380fbcb79a40b1a5f)

18. i ' m not sure honestly . i have to say the chances of getting hired with no license and no driving experience is frankly , pretty slim . can you get a license ? do you think you can drive safely ?
   (ID: 73c07154e0b2d94bd1f75aecb40a248f845ad21a)

19. i was here to say sushi , now i have to think of something else . its definitely not going to be brussel sprouts . i still hate those
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

20. apparently it ' s a right to carry a gun in church , but gathering to say you think this is wrong is a privelage .
