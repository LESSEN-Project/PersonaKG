1. my gf and i tend to devolve common phrases and words over time to more just nonsense noises . we can have almost whole conversations with bizarre words and noises . we often ponder that to anyone on the outside it might seem we were both handicapped in some way

2. i believe that there ' s a percentage of claims denied that you need to stay above or your job is on the line , if you just said yes to everyone ' s claim you ' d be out on your ass in no time .

3. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .

4. haha i can ' t take credit for this theory , somebody explained it to me a long time ago with a lot more detail and they somehow tied it all in with the prince that was promised , dany possibly being the reincarnation of azor ahaii , jon becoming the night ' s king and somehow bringing peace to all of this . they also said some shit about white walkers not actually being evil just completely misunderstood , and there ' s a legend that the wall is just the icy remains of a massive ice dragon much larger than balerion the black . by the time they were done explaining i was just like woah keanu reeves voice

19. yes he does and no it does not bother me . heck for the longest time , i was the one who was opening and reading his playboys when they arrived in the mail . i am the one who is less in the mood for sex , so porn helps him supplement his needs when i just am not in the mood .
