9. i played an asoiaf campaign using gurps once unfortunately unfinished and one of the things that the gm did was making the combat very lethal . i don  t remember all the rules or homebrews used , but i remember we used the optional bleeding rules . in our game , set still in the targaryen ruling , we were all members of a minor northern house and were caught in the middle of the rising tensions between the bolton and the karstark . technically we were pledged to the karstark , but our lands were closer to dreadfort and the boltons decided to obligate us to serve them . as you can see our game was more political with very few adventuring , but maybe you could start with an episodic campaign , that behind the curtains is growing to became a conflict between houses and only too late the party will notice that they were dragged to the conflict too . like , they start doing random oddjobs for some house and later discover these tasks were actually pivotal to a coup or weakening another house  s economy or whatever .

   (ID: 7225229d29956e8838c19c739f632492e628b1a4)

15. i stand by my assessment . you gave the server money you otherwise wouldn ' t have , and your intent was to convince them to vote for a particular candidate . i understand your position that it was a symbolic gesture , but i don ' t believe you can separate that out from the fact that you did give them money . fortunately , it seems i ' m in the minority on this not unusual for me , so you should have nothing to worry about .
