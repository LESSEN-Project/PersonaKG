5. wicked is definitely not bad is just that i hate gold , if they could at least have changed the sigil to another colour , i would definitely buy it . but so far i will just wait for a good leblanc skin to come .

6. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .

7. sorry my dude the situation here is just not what it was . at first i thought i was gonna get to break the geneva convention for christmas but the state is doing a good job to calm everyone down sadly enough

12. he was a good guy , i knew him , i really liked and respected him . edit as follows . i guess the official released his name . i had him as a instructor in my academey . one of the best ones by far . he always was joking arround and trying to be positive , even though he has just gotten of a busy shift .
   (ID: 33fff1eb23b70e0596f5d02662a23ec6939962f7)

13. good idea ! i might just have to give it a post .
   (ID: b1bca94f8857aebe93a83d1efba4600bf5b4109d)

14. good question , but i doubt that ruby and sapphire instantly becomes less mentally intimate when they choose to unfuse . and just ask greg about how both mentally and physically intimate a gem can be with someone without fusing .
   (ID: 164ef39b0b5e3089c409b28b5fc228cddb653bf1)

15. i should of known that the prices for these pokemon ones were too good to be true . they are quite hard to get hold of here in the uk , so fraudsters have filled the gap in the market by flogging these fake ones . ebay will be on your side to and help you and get you a refund if you receive a fake , it is just a lot of hassle that is probably best avoided !
   (ID: 03bd0b4bb3465eba83e1c9a00af15f7b35f1ec6d)

16. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .

17. do you have any friends that are on the soccer team ? maybe they can help you practice outside of the tryouts ? i  m assuming this is high school so just give it your best shot ! good luck !

18. i really can cook . my husband is just so good at it that i tend to have ' accidents ' when its my turn .
   (ID: bfbfd4c4caa6b137f79275a24c99808ba3d2305b)

19. why do you believe in your god above any other ? they all have an equal weight towards maybe existing , so really it ' s more practical to just be a good person and not believe in something that is beyond comprehension .
   (ID: cb983edd3ccf4e09e71585238c7376bcebac0dc9)

20. it ' s just so good .
