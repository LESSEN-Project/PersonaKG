2. insurance should be and used to be based on risk . legislation has taken that out of the equation in many ways . younger people rightfully don ' t recognize it as their responsibility to pay into a system when their risk is lower

7. i definitely agree with you , and this book isn  t all  no one goes to hell if you believe in mercy  type stuff , it  s the direct word of jesus and there is stuff in there saying if you don  t do what  s right you will go to hell . but i understand your point , and agree that we also need people to realise that if we don  t act on the graces god gives us ourselves , we will go to hell .

   (ID: 85a05d28a3a638ea67074ae6793644f5f667c9f3)

15. i see this is a matter that strongly bothers you , since you post about it frequently . people judge , they always do , they always will . but they judge with even great severity what they don ' t  can ' t understand . maybe you should stop talking to these people you are complaining about . if this is what you seek , i am sure there is a " group " in which there are people that share your philosophy and lifestyle . but most importantly , you should try to stop having a fuck to give to these judgments . if this lifestyle suits you , as soon as you dont hurt people with it , you go dude , you have nothing to be ashamed of . don ' t let others dictate what should or shouldn ' t give you satisfactions .
   (ID: b9f2b8d2786ab9d657bc985cdfa3fe4793afd848)

16. i don ' t but end up hearing about it , anyway . i get why people do care , though . you get emotionally attached and it can be a thrill to root for a team . plus , you ' re somewhat naturally inclined to depending on where you lived . i ' m into fictional shows  movies so i can see some similarities .

17. current problem ? loneliness . how you can you help ? ironically , you can leave me alone . i don ' t trust people anymore .
   (ID: fddeeaa11799939dfe96bc7fae74a22b474aaf20)

18. why do you keep brining this back to race , how does saying that most people who have been alive on this planet had no real impact lead back to " you are ok with more black people dying than any other race " . you are obviously making some connections that i am missing . all individual lives are an acceptable loss so long as the human race survives . i don ' t care about other people losing their jobs , i don ' t care about other people dying and having family members die . i only care about the people i love and the survival of us as a species . i see you added a um , ' gotcha ! ' at the end there so please enlighten me as to how i specifically said i would support blm .

19. even some people don ' t learn from that .  that  s why  god  invented youtube !
   (ID: 70fd28af0eb2c67ebb7ce51abc94c13f1a4f652b)

20. so basically you can not take an interest in another persons culture because , someone might get offended , so should different people from different cultures be separated so that they don  t share and grow from their cultural history  s ?
