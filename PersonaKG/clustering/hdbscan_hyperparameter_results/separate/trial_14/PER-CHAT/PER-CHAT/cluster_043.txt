6. its okay if you haven  t played ds , as long as you acknowledge that piece of information . the idea that the reality of bloodborne and the reality of ds are one is pretty . stupid i must say . therefore its important that we establish a common ground of understanding , you know ? to put things into perspective , you wouldn  t start a race facing the wrong way would you now ?

14. you know what , i  m gonna play devils advocate here and say if you really truly genuinely mean it and are willing to face the repercussions , say  in love with  . saying  i love      is thrown around far too much and has started to lose meaning
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

17. i didn ' t smoke , so i didn ' t know . you could always make a fake email address , and shoot an email to ask if they disqualify applicants for medical marijuana . that way if they say yes , its not your email and you can " detox " . depending on how regularly you use it can take longer than a month though .

18. hmm , this is fairly strange i must say , however there is one more possibility . are you sure you haven  t already entered the dlc ? maybe you already got in . i suggest you go check the tombstone in the hunters dream that takes you to the dlc area and see if you may use it its across from the final chalice dungeon tombstone . if you dont know which one im talking about , the doll sometimes prays there as well .
