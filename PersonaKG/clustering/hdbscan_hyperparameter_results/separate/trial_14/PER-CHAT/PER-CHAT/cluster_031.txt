2. my bad if i was being cruel , this is a book that ' s near and dear to me . i was worried by you saying ' giant waste of time ' , people unfamiliar with the book would visualize a war and piece  sized commitment and disregard ever looking into it . agreed about too many books though .

6. fair . i can see why bringing penicillin to medieval europe is a tempting answer . however , i have to consider that the further back in time you go , and the more broad your cure , the more you risk causing more human birth and an alternate timeline in which war , starvation , or drug  immune diseases wipe out more people that would have died had you not tried . by sticking to a smaller number of people and a more recent event with fewer possible ramifications , you ' re more likely to come out saving more lives than endangering .

7. go for it . no need to overanalyse it ! most of the time , when people post things online regularly , they seek acceptance and validation .

8. i still use " merry solstice ! " since half the people on the planet haven ' t a clue what the word means , they look at me as if i said something in greek . makes me smile every time , and i ' m never really wrong .

10. hahahahaha . no buddy . telling someone words is not a threat to them . actually committing acts is a threat to them . they have shown time and time again that they are willing to actually kill people . stop fucking defending these fucks . they ' re scum . and they deserve everything that is coming to them .
