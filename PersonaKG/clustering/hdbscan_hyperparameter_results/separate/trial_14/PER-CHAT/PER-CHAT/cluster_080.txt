1. you could just unfriend  delete the annoying people off of your feed , it leaves you with the people you actually give a shit about and means you can still at least have an active account should you need to use it in the future .

4. obviously , this argument doesn ' t hold and it  s simply a case of people being irked that non  whites are finally being represented in a larger way . i surely hope you aren ' t assuming that just because somebody is unhappy with one specific historically  incorrect aspect that they do not care about the others . just because somebody isn ' t actively advocating against every historical inaccuracy at any given point doesn ' t mean they ' re using it as a front to deny non  white involvement  most people do acknowledge the participation of smaller groups in the war , but simply find the representation to be statistically inaccurate . i would ask these individuals what they consider of other historical inaccuracies in the game before framing them with what is implied to be a racist undertone .
