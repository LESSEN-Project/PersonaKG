1. i got downvoted on similar posts showing the math too . i dont think people understand the levity of what etsy is going to change .
   (ID: 3dfcdf92c717ed4c117768210afcbbaf9a2ca8a9)

2. i wish my answer was no but probably yes . there ' s still a large population of people in the u . s . that still believes places like fox news and breitbart are legitimate news sources and think trump is doing a great job .

3. i can  t think of a player who has garnered this type of attention from the citizens of the city they play before . it  s honestly amazing how quickly the people of toronto fell in love with kawhi and the stops the collective effort amongst them to keep him here . i guess that  s what happens when you bring about the greatest successes of the franchise within a year .

4. because to you it  s not what one says but how he says it that matters . people voted for trump for his policies not because they think he  s cool and likes the way he speaks . no surprise why those who think obama is cool hates trump .

5. i think that people shouldn  t have to lie about their beliefs . i think their religious beliefs shouldn  t be mentioned at all
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

6. i think a lot of it had to do with inflection . you can interpret something written in a lot of ways . context helps , but people can mistake sarcasm for an insult pretty easily .
   (ID: 278d993cc7cf4f580f0ac9ab56ebf8cb5637a6c4)

7. do you have any proof for who is bot ? you people keep saying that reddit is full of russian trolla and bots , yet you dont shoe any proof whatsoever . i think the collusion story has really left a mark on some people to the point of that they see russians and collusion everywhere
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

8. the photos are photos of my kid and the boyfriend eg my kid going down a slide on his lap etc . i can see why she values the photos  but i think it is unnecessary to share them in this context as the only people in this group chat who these photos are of any relevance to is herself . nobody else in the group chat even knows the bloke except my in laws who have met him once or twice .
   (ID: c0cbd0e097375f98ad98ec291f836a39d55e02c1)

9. i do find it girly  " gay " to not be weirded out by a stranger covering you in lotion and rubbing up on you . how is that exclusive to those who are girly or gay ? that ' s fucking ridiculous . what do you think women and gay people are like ?
   (ID: 372e357e1e3acd2a4dea24aa56a5900a539a9e59)

10. yeah i think people may find my emblem of a crackpipe and ' meth  man ' disagreeable
   (ID: dc1a6ca8b7ce3327dec097f0883d72c2689870fc)

11. true , maybe i need to explain my answer a bit , because it was straight from my mind . what i mean is that art has no  meaning  itself , it  s people who give meaning to the art and therefore you have to think about how you interpret the piece of art , instead of looking for the meaning . i think the op should rephrase his question .
   (ID: 3ee5f4db2879b83a843467f289ac369565b8b3ae)

12. oh okay , yeah i can see what you mean there but i think that there are more people then me that post stuff like this on here anyway . you never answered what makes me an attention seeking whore from this ?
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

13. i agree to an extent , but there are a lot of people who think like this
   (ID: 2de25fc78894b500638825a688a85084af2b72d1)

14. in my culture , if your ears are warm it means someone either mentioned you or someone ' s talking about you . when my ears suddenly inexplicably get warm , i think people are talking about me that exact moment .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

15. governments are elected , and as much as it might sucks to admit it currently , it reflects on the people more than anything else . if you think voters were victim of propaganda , you do need to consider the effect of a culture that loathe education and decades of largely unchecked attacks on free and public education by elected officials . nothing happens in a vacuums .
   (ID: 329d4ecaf6d05cee95ed2e5206f4bd6b59d56c97)

16. it ' s always a thought . like  what would happen ? what would people think ?
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

17. people often hide names in screenshots , i think it is  was against the rules to include them .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

18. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

19. really now . i have worked on ocean prediction models that are needed for better weather forecasts , especially hurricane intensity , and how to find people lost at sea . i can give you hundreds of examples off of the top of my head on why i think your first statement is wrong .
   (ID: 836c1cf8e9db34147646e1dcba5b0a94c666d831)

20. agreed , i think this list shows how far reddit has its head up its ass . people joke about the hivemind but this list really shows it
