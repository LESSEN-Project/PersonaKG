4. i find that pre thinking does me a lot of good in that type of situation . having a course of action plotted , like " go for a walk " for when my brain reverts to purely reptillian type responses is invaluable .

5. i can somewhat understand this with subs like wpd , or cringeanarchy , but waterniggas ? seriously , what the fuck ? that sub is actually pretty wholesome . memes about staying hydrated can turn into good tips on living a healthy lifestyle .

9. omg i wanna see like a little conspiracy pig . with a monacle and it ' s pulling those forensic strings across the room and making connections . it could be a show , " conspiracy pig , " but naw , i mean on the real rgb is probably really sick  injured still and it ' s not good optics  she might have to give up her seat soon . so obviously the longer that can be postponed the better for the dems . i get that .

10. the happy songs do a really good job of covering up the sad ones like my confession , or sayo  nara .
   (ID: 0b52265db13bf8bc27ad36aad94e870706eb6689)

11. is this a new best friend , your post history makes it seem like it posting you have no friends . you should have started with asking if they have a spare phone you could borrow as you look for work . hopefully if you get the job , you keep it , until something better comes along . good luck .

   (ID: 3ee5f4db2879b83a843467f289ac369565b8b3ae)

13. as if stephen a does a good job at covering anything he  s one of the reasons why i hate espn . i love sports , but commentators like him ruin sports for me .

   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

20. obviously great depends on your definition of great . if you like social programs and high life satisfaction levels , you have scandinavia . if you like crushing everyone else with money , media , and military might then america is pretty good .
