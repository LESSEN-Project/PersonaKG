1. for me it was oregairu , when i first watched i was at a point in my life where i acted very similar to the main character , and i hated that . the main characters actions never did anything but make me dislike the character , when i finally realized how similar i was to the mc i decided i wanted to be more positive and get better at making friends . while now i don ' t have a lot friends , i do have more than i used to and am a generally happy person . i think that if i never watched that show i would be much less happy with who i am now . tl  dr  oregairu made me realize the reason i wasn ' t happy is that i hated the kind of person i was .

2. not so much advice , but i had one person tell me recently that ' communication can only go so far , you think you cover all bases but something will always happen that will get you ' and i was like no ? that ' s literally what communication is for ? to avoid bad shit happening in the first place . just communicate and then you ' ll know peoples limits and what they like and what they can ' t do or handle and stuff so you don ' t accidentally do that

3. facebook . i use it for business mostly but have crafted my newsfeed to exclude the crap i don ' t want . i don ' t play any games , i enjoy following my favorite bands and companies , i don ' t give a shit about the info they have , and it ' s been a great tool for attracting new clients .

4. i think most men over digit before that most males would do a pig if it had big boobs prefer the natural look and the covers of these magazines are what women think what men like . the porn industry never realised this and tries to blame its fall in profits on piracy but the reality is that people would rather watch the videos of real people unenhanced by surgery that are widley available online for free .

5. ugh . let me tell you something ! i am indeed one of those  guilt trippers  that you are speaking of . i lost my son . my best friend . my life . he never told me shit . he never asked for help . for whatever twisted mindset he thought he was a burden . yet never was that ever an issue . he was smart and dealing with issues of the world being a sucky place . when i hear people saying they have no one . i like to let them know they do . maybe not the people they wish but others . me . others they will meet in future . i actually give a fuck about these people and i personally want them to have a chance at life and love and joy . i look at it this way . when someone wants to do it , they will . what i say won  t guilt them into not doing it . i feel that my son never came to me because he was so protective over me and not wanting me to worry . others i have talked with are coming out with their sexuality and suicidal ideation is normal but does usually pass . but trust me certain people i don  t feel drawn to say a word to . but i just have to ask . serious question . why are you here , are you suicidal and just waiting for that perfect moment that you can actually do it . or do you come to help others . curious about mental illness . or all of the above . i  m all of the above . i would never want to hurt people the way i was hurt . because i  m so freaking far from focused on my freaking self . i lived for my son . i wanted him to be the best him he could . i took him digit hours to dallas and digit ours home after his digit hour classes every freaking week . we talked . we had a great relationship and any idiot that says ppl deserves grief . you are a very cold and mean person . just like when people say people who commit suicide are cowards . well in all real , the ones that want to and can  t are ! i come here to help not guilt . but ppl need to realize they may think ppl will be better off . its a lie ! however , i would take this grief over my sons living and hurting any day . i just wish he talked to people . not like u that  s for sure

6. i don ' t see a problem with it . as far as fetishes go , it seems like one of the more tame ones . i ' ve never been with a person who had a foot fetish but i think it would be interesting to see how that was implemented into the relationship .

9. if we do not join ' fore the invasion , there will be a repeat of the k  w line in digit . even though a good fight was had , they were still captured . if we join this and bring quality , we can make this a victory for the good of humanity .

10. true story . i treat reddit as a community of people who have mostly seen the same memes and same inside jokes . if i can make someone ' s day just a little lighter , i ' ve succeeded , because i know my bad days are made brighter from some of these redditor ' s preposterous comments .

11. it ' s gonna weight on you for a longtime . the best thing to do might be just to think about it long and hard until you can accept several things  you and that person aren ' t and won ' t be in a relationship again , probably that you still like them as in don ' t dent it , and that it was your fault . you also need to make sure that you ' ve changed . if it was your personality , then you need to make sure you are less like what you were i . e . less judgemental . if it was something you did , you need to promise yourself you won ' t do it again and remember the consequences and pain it brought from doing it the first time .

12. but if you ' re actually looking for a serious answer , smile more . force yourself to smile . even if it ' s standing looking in the mirror thinking about a happy memory , force yourself to see yourself smiling . it will boost your mood . it ' s a cool  down for me .

13. bullshit . no wonder men out there chicken out when they have to approach any real life woman out there . do you see why that happens ? they grow up watching these anime where girls are shown as more manly  boys blush to talk to girls . suddenly these anime  nerds develop affinity for the women who kicks them into the nuts . and these anime girls are shown as physically hit the protagonist . everyone brush it off saying " it is cute " . i do watch anime but i never liked these themes . consider dragonball . dude is one of the strongest warrior in the universe but he is terrified of his wife . and she hits him when he does any mistake . people watching these things laugh at it  say it is cute . man if physical violence doesn ' t look cute when a man does on a woman then you can not have double standards when a woman does it on a man . and this is how you program those boys to chicken out in approaching any real woman . sorry to say mate . but this opinion is you is actually the product of the buffer you ' re making in your own brain to avoid meeting real life girls . real life girls are way better than your waifus .

14. no , it ' s never worth it . crystals for f2p should always be used for refreshes and gear if you are looking into efficiency . phoenix are easy to farm aside from sabine , so keep at it ! one or two cantina refreshes a day will speed up your ezra and hera farm by a lot .

15. do you think he supports negligent homicide investigations for miscarriages ? either a fetus is a person , or it isn ' t  if you push hard enough , i bet you ' ll find that ryan ' s beliefs have the same inconsistencies as most republicans . it ' s not about preserving life . it ' s about punishing sluts .

17. this is gonna sound crazy , but . what if winning this tournament is a bad thing for germany ? because it doesn ' t show them where they would need to improve on the pitch for next year ? scolari didn ' t make any changes for brazil after digit . maybe i ' m talking out of my ass .

18. my guess would be very low . most of the koreans that live outside of korea are from either before the korean war , or are from south korea . defectors may be within those communities , but they wouldn ' t be pro  regime .
