1. once people on reddit can tell that you are a shill you know you hit rock bottom .
   (ID: 53aa6c267ff5eccf891e178786d41ca5df80a5de)

2. true , i know some people that had troubles with it so i thought might as well see if anyone on here needs it .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

3. the last of the mohicans . an interesting thing about scores is , i know so many people who dislike classical music yet they watch a movie little realizing there is an orchestra in the background adding to the moment .
   (ID: 0f3da013abe745c83b2d4eb042abb7fd28f5e872)

4. which was too bad . i got to know people from other countries through the app
   (ID: a04ffec23ab9c2af8d4ac433e06db2b5d1b4bf9b)

5. i ' m gonna be serious for a minute though , i lean towards against high driving . i know a few seasoned tokers who can handle it , but most people can ' t really drive high very well . there are exceptions though , and i would include myself in that . it ' s important to note though , that knowing your limits plays a part .
   (ID: 5c9dd67e95ee5403b2bd9a6848c017674d46396b)

6. i know they ' re better people than me , because they wrote that , but i would have drawn a massive dong .
   (ID: 5173a1d5475490650d7365b2c2b2f2c579d33099)

7. if they already know everything about you how could it hurt ? i thought they were the feds who else has this power ? the first step to getting help is proving the problem exists . you ' ll notice that black people are starting to get help with police violence now that they ' re able to film the police . do you have everything to gain and nothing to lose but your delusions .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

8. wait . there are people that didn ' t know this ? it ' s not something new . ?
   (ID: 8764a223ca1af7d1792e76a58bf3b1209bf73ad3)

9. as an employer i always let people know if they got the job asap . it ' s a dick move to leave people hanging .
   (ID: 1bbc23e34907b47b9acac7ae81e9b24909ce92e5)

10. all of those statements are wildly different from taking children to a circus . i ' m not condoning what happens to animals at circuses , but a kitten slaughterhouse is not something that was organized and operated for the entertainment of the common people . i know that you probably feel strongly about this , but you ' re being ridiculous .
   (ID: 40e7e4fcc325e808f67616071f736d382e20795c)

11. lol . who ' s trying to save face . my original post was not meant to be taken seriously . other people understood that , or were less inclined to jump into a discussion with the " i know something about something obvious to anyone with a high school education   so let me ' correct ' you " vibe we all love so much around here . you also clearly didn ' t read the thread .
   (ID: 17b8a304069d7530607e28f8e04d840e28be0d3e)

12. i know but still , if he do something in spanish a lot of new people will know his channel and suscribe .
   (ID: a7d896fb59c4f2b7ec3c459495a1127d1cfa0bc6)

13. you ' re making some large assumptions about what people who post here would know . you said the film made no sense . i disagree . which parts are you referring to ?
   (ID: 42a8780a6a35c7b2e85acf575fc8cb2ff3c5a6f3)

14. no there are plenty of checks in place . you know most serial killers never break any other laws and are otherwise normal people right ? every legal gun owner has to go through a background check .
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

15. for me , i ' m a ghostwriter for rappers , nobody but a select few friends and my mom know , but i wanna see what other side hustles people have
   (ID: ab5524e568131ce7cb4db227daae4d0f489838e1)

16. gather your buddies or people you know people you can rely on and ask them to look for one with you .
   (ID: fe4ddb52a6f20437e3f3c6003b775cb72c3d048f)

17. so i know that it isn  t used anymore , but when i was in high school everyone said the word  salty  . people would use it in every situation and i hated it
   (ID: f7394472a82dca87877dd18a5a3cb4d3524a8623)

18. true but are people really going to frequently check for the miniscule chance of someone you know being there ?
   (ID: 9d412b0236e1db384766edb9df245de053d643ad)

19. i only know what happens to me when people tell me what happens because i black out .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

20. i would argue that it only works for guesses that the average person has some level of familiarity with . people know about how big a jelly bean is and about how big the container is and can do some mental math . some will be high and others will be low , but it averages out . if you showed people a model of a new bridge being built and asked the crowd for the thickness of steel needed on the center support , you would get wildly varying answer with an average nowhere near the actual answer . so asking the public to give their input on solving an actual problem , determining tax rates , military funding , educational standards , or any number of other things that are actually complex decisions , would not benefit from this effect .
