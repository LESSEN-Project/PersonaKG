   (ID: 4af9aa85350301196466d0e72c4211b6f999f80b)

2. no . what i  m saying is check it if you do have intercourse . it  d be even better to not have intercourse if you don  t want kids or cannot afford the expenses , that makes sense . if you cannot afford kids yet get pregnant , you knew the risks and took them , you should have no right to kill the baby .

   (ID: b5f9b695867ef3b560a4fe7610f75e43b62809f6)

11. i mean you could get an old tape camera , but your best bet is emulation . i don ' t mean to disenfranchise analogue , but the results you want are too specific imo for an original
   (ID: e2865528dd17e86320ca523d3db462efa29e7ca7)

12. it ' s methy , i don ' t want to become a meth . to be honest i don ' t care for drugs , if you need to escape reality you should reevaluate your reality .
   (ID: 03cf8378bcb94745c52eb716a381f55774f3b358)

13. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

14. in the event that you don ' t want people to be able to read the words you ' re writing , your hand is conveniently smudging everything effortlessly .

15. this is a combination of many different insults . i prepared it in case of emergency years ago . " this is usually where i ' d tell you to suck my dick , but i don ' t want the disease ridden void that you call a mouth anywhere near me . so could you do me a favor and go fuck yourself "
   (ID: d54a04c3eba52404f5dd7abb0e459a949dbc7f93)

16. great , a christian that read the bible . now the next step is to chill and don ' t take everything your holy book says as something you should definitely follow , we don ' t want crusades to repeat .
   (ID: e6e1db90a47dca83004beacbcc9004bec464c7d0)

17. our city is trying to figure out what to do about this right now . they don  t want people to drive drunk and don  t want to punish them for making the right choice , but they often need the street in the morning for a market .
   (ID: e1d1404c2d4f1c884debe976d40ee13df3959fcf)

18. yeah , there is no stigma , and your response speaks far more to your issues than to anyone elses . please don ' t try to tell people what they should and shouldn ' t decide they want when all parties have all the facts .
