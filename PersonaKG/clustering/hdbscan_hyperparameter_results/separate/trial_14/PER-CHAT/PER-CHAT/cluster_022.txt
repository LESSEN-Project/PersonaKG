1. there was this girl holding a sword and when i asked her why she just said that she always came prepared . i ' d like to think that she and her friends were actually having some variety of supernatural adventures right beneath all our noses .

2. oh boy , i do have a lot of ridiculous stories according to reddit . i didn ' t think i had really interesting or unbelievable stories but it seems like redditors just do nothing all day every day .

3. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .

4. look i ' m not saying there isn ' t value in those studies , and that parenting style . it ' s just not exclusive like you seem to think it is . try raising children with different types of challenges , like autism spectrum disorder or oppositional defiant disorder , then tell me there ' s a one size fits all . also , confirmation bias . there , now i ' m really out .

6. like these dudes really blame any small thing just because they can ' t get pussy or anything , and they think relatively high of themselves , it disgusts me . maybe all these women didn ' t give him a chance because he has such a big ego .

7. i agree with you for the most part , but some of the halloween items , like the templar ' s spirit for the medic and the squid ' s lid for the demo actually look pretty cool . i think they should just do away with the restriction .

8. well i have a few tips that might help first off it seems like you play fill but i ' d find a role your more comfortable with and stick to that ' ll help your odds of winning alot secondly if you aren ' t communtincating with your team ie game chat or a call , that can help alot lastly it seems like you might have a low rage tolerance , if you think your about get very mad or what not take a deep breath look back at why you died reset your self and pretend the game just started and you have a second chance

9. you think that , and its not easy ofc , but its really just a case of finding someone like you . my husband and i can do ' nothing ' all day . even a week if he ' s off work .

   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

11. timing when to buy a home is difficult since it will obviously be a long term investment . i think you should gauge where you are living to determine if you have confidence in your city and county first . if you do then go out and buy a home that you like and can afford at the best possible price for you . trying to timing the market for a home is just not worth it .

12. " you can just speak plain language to yourself " if you speak words in your head , like think whole sentences , you can change your mindset .
   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

13. i watch porn videos where they act like they love you gf roleplays . it ' s just an act but it warms my heart when they talk to me . i always think " that ' s how it feels when someone loves you .   x200b  it ' s pretty hot too

   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

15. social studies . i can ' t stand sjw ' s that think everything is your fault just because you ' re a straight white middle class male . not everyone is like that , but there are enough to seriously rustle my jimmies .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

16. it just adds to the badass effect , i like to think of it as having my gun out passively but always ready for shit to hit the fan .

20. i  m a ftm , and the first bit of your comment sounded just like me lol . i have everything planned to a t . i read somewhere about ftms being more likely to get induced so for some reason in my head , me giving labor always starts with me being induced . i think i do this because if it  s induced it  ll be planned and i have a weird obsession with planning everything lol . reading this really made me stop and think it might not go how i plan for it to go , which is scary .
