5. at this month ' s office birthday party the muckety muck ' s were talking about recycling and reclaiming garbage . i almost shared the story of my town ' s garbage man red johnson . see , ol ' red had an eye for garbage . and if he liked something being thrown out he ' d take it to the cab  which is the reason he never packed a lunch . but i stopped myself . i don ' t know these people well enough if they have the kind of sense of humor necessary to put up with my smart assery .

6. i don ' t disagree . i ' m inclined to believe there was some affair seeing how terry has never publicly acknowledged it , and bridge clearly has a grudge against him , but i don ' t know how much of the story is true , and neither really does anyone except from the people involved .
   (ID: c08743855177b68f06df5b7637db6f3e62f0baff)

9. people use the word " everyone " in sentences as if they know every single person in the world . " everyone thinks they are the hero of their story . absolute truths don ' t exist . there are gray areas as well .
   (ID: 3171687207fd659f146afaa305fc2ad7b92ea52b)

10. i don  t have evidence , there hasn  t been a study that i know of . but what  s happening now isn  t working so it  s gotta change . as someone else suggested in the comments making the people private to media and public would be a better way then my original suggestion
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

11. what i ' m learning is this disease is extremely mysterious and affects everyone in a different way . my doctor told me lots of people don ' t experience the symptoms and are worse off , they can be doing damage to their esophageal lining for years and not even know it .
   (ID: f14ea91df683dc236b3ffe5956871b69581e71d3)

12. yta . you don ' t know how people are going to react to this . you could end up causing them to swerve or crash .
   (ID: 8f8e540d2085ca2ae45ad16beb12b5ba58fb5ec9)

13. first off , any sane person would know that you don ' t use tinder for that kind of stuff . i mean , smart idea , but it ' s not gonna go well . second off , the guys on tinder might go and hurt your girl . because you don ' t know what kind of people lurk on the internet like reddit . so , yes , you should be concerned and you should talk her out of it .
   (ID: 0da557492b0bbc1cb8e2e7cf174868871996cb61)

14. wow i know what you mean . it ' s hard for me to tell people no so i usually end up in situations that i don ' t wanna be in .
   (ID: b5942acb07bb8a74e4924ef75fa70edb4f626161)

15. it takes over literally every aspect of your life . everything . it gets to a point where you literally have to put yourself before anything else . it can seem narcissistic to people who don  t know what you  re going through , but when it comes between wanting to blow your brains out and everything else , it  s an easy choice . hopefully
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

16. i don ' t know why either . what is it that makes people take an overwhelming interest in what others might be doing behind closed doors ?
   (ID: 6adb1b89bb74c203724e574d02e0735080effe2c)

17. how do you judge who has fully changed in normal every day life ? i don ' t know about you , but most interactions i have with people don ' t include my genitalia in any way .
