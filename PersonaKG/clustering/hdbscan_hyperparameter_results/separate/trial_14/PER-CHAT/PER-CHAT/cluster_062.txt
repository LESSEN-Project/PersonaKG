1. for some , like the darkmoons , you can do both at the same time , but for most the ai is faster . pvp is only faster if you have someone to grind with since its a bit dead atm for the gestures you have to get them all one on character , the same with all the other achievements .

2. as someone who spent enough time on 4chan to be on an nsa watchlist , dicks can go way beyond weird . i still remember a guy posting his dick that looked like a fucking flat top mushroom .

3. in my opinion , it is kind of like fooling a drunk friend . it only turns out well if their ok with it , and even then doesn  t work all the time . i  m no expert , but you probably can  t tell someone  give me all your money  and get away with it .

4. fucking up happens . its okay  if you learn something from it . why not try drawing on yourself instead any time you feel like that ? keep drawing even if it takes up a whole leg or arm . i recommend crayola .

6. well , it uses satellites , which by itself sounds like a lot of flat earther ' s deny as well even though you can see them with the naked eye . and clearly with optics . those satellites orbit the earth on fixed paths . at any time , there are at least three in the sky above you , and by calculating the time that a signal takes to reach you , and the other satellites , it is able to find your position through trilateration .

9. i wonder if it is that when we are waiting for something we measure time against itself . in other words , when one checks the time it is like a reset  like the time before doesn ' t matter . the increments get smaller , yet feel longer . on the other hand big one , little one , take your pick when we are engaged or entertained we are not paying attention to the passage of time .
