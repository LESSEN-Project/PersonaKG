8. well i seem to be somewhat unique in that i can ' t honestly say i relate to any of them , at least certainty not on the level of a lot of other people on this sub . i am very lucky to have never personally experienced any of the problems portrayed in the game . that said i do definitely sympathize with them quite a lot . i ' d say i sympathize the most with sayori probably because my sister suffers from depression , followed by natsuki . then yuri , then monika . i love natsuki the most though .

15. the study doesn ' t say you can ' t be fat but fit , it says societies can ' t be fat but fit . here ' s where the article contradicts its own thesis . " the idea that large numbers of people can be obese and yet metabolically healthy and at no risk of heart disease was wrong " the study explicitly makes no distinction between athletes and couch potatoes and treats them as the statistically significant thing . what garbage . " dr . rishi caleyachetty , who led the study , said it was true that weightlifters could be healthy and yet have a bmi that suggested they were obese .  i understand that argument . bmi is crude  but it is the only measure we have in the clinic to get a proxy for body fat . it is not realistic to use anything else in a gp setting or in the normal hospital clinic . we have to rely on bmi measurements , however crude they may be ,  he said . " while bmi results for particular individuals could be misleading , the study showed that on a population level , the idea that large numbers of people can be obese and yet metabolically healthy and at no risk of heart disease was wrong "
