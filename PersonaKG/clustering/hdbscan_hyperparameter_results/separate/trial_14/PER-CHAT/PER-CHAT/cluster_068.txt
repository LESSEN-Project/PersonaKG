1. i think a lot of people who are at that point don ' t think anybody cares to listen to them , and they have thought that for so long , that it is very hard to reach out to anybody

2. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .

3. lol . not on the topic of coltee ' s shirt , but larissa is extra annoying this episode with these cosmetic procedures . coltee ' s annoying me too . and jay and ashley . i don ' t think any of these people don ' t annoy me any more . maybe pedro .

4. yikes . some people don ' t see further in the future . she might think her best interest is to keep the price high and not negotiate for her clients but she ' s actually losing more money with her bad reputation she ' s building . if you ' re gonna be selfish and follow your own interests at least do it smart .

5. because when you ' re in rome you do as the romans do . unless you ' re obviously a tourist or you don ' t speak english at all , i think it ' s really rude to go out of your way to speak in a manner people around you can ' t understand . my wife does this to me in spanish when she wants to talk about someone we see while we ' re out or whatever and it annoys me to no end .

6. i ' m not the guy begging for karma tho , besides , you don ' t have to be a jerk about it , also , i think not even half the people here give a fuck about your 10k karma

7. not if your education sucks and youre on internet to try and make others think a big penis does the job . lmao don ' t worry , most people saying this are arrogant or uneducated .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

8. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?

9. i don  t think everyone is the same and i understand cultural differences . unfortunately i have been on the end of quite a few indian guys being creeps online . hopefully people aren  t dumb enough to think every person is the same but i  m sorry you have to go through this .
   (ID: 05cbf3ecf2e6aed01f3f564fb918a436b69e48f6)

10. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

11. what the fuck ? i wonder if these kinds of people ever take a step back to question their insanity and then go ahead and do the crazy shit anyway . or if they do question themselves , what sort of stuff do they think is too crazy and don ' t follow through .
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

12. what are you talking about ? you  re delusional . i  m one of the nicest people anyone could ever meet . what is it with you and  oh , you  re in a public space so someone is absolutely going to stumble upon you and your junk  . i wouldn  t be in plain sight , dumbass . what , do you believe that people have x  ray vision or some type of  masturbation radar  ? i don  t think so .

13. " fair game ? why do you think you ' re entitled to other people ' s stuff ? it ' s not yours , don ' t touch it !

14. i agree porn isn ' t the healthiest  most ethical of things . but i don ' t think anyone has ever used the pornhub app to kill a room full of people because his penis was feeling extra tiny that week . priorities .

15. its more the " it ' s ok for me to have slept with a lot of people  have sex on the first date because i ' m a guy . but if a girl does it , she ' s a slut . " that ' s a problem imo . if you ' re not being hypocritical than i don ' t think it ' s an issue . i think there is some on the reverse too  " it ' s ok for me to have slept with someone of the same gender , i ' m a woman . but if a guy does it , he ' s gay . " basically  don ' t shame someone you wouldn ' t have them shame you for .

16. first off , god isn  t real , there is no proof of any kind that god is real . however i don  t think you  ll ever be able to disprove him as well . there  s nothing wrong with gay people , if you think so you  re a bad person . since there  s nothing wrong with gay people there  s nothing wrong with gay people coming up when you think of a rainbow .

17. i went to one and while i do agree that it can stunt social growth when it comes to interacting with women the only reason it affected me is because no one asked me to hang out with them on weekends . all my friends hung out with girls outside of school , there was an all girls school next door . most people here seem to think that social opportunities don ' t exist outside the school gates but as long as my kids do then i can ' t see any reason not to send them to one .

18. no one is saying anything other than the footage was creepy . i don ' t understand what the deal is . are people not allowed to think it was creepy ?
   (ID: 88c35221745da41b29ff5b9f921026de5ccbb6c0)

19. how are you supposed to understand what people think if they only give you a surface level thought and you don ' t challenge them to go deeper ?
