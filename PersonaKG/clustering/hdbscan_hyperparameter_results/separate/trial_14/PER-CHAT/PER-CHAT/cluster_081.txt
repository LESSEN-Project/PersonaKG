2. this is true . add to the fact that our entire media system tends to be owned by very few people and those same few people often own parts of other corporations . what results is a media system that becomes nearly incestuous , promoting other parts of itself sister companies , subsidiaries , etc . at the expense of doing its original job reporting accurately . tl  dr  our media companies are all conglomerates , we ' re turning into a real  life idiocracy .

20. those people do serve a purpose though . they help researchers determine what works and what doesn ' t . that is real research . they study dying people to see what can keep them from dying . that research is useful because it can then be applied to people who are dying of similar causes , but long before those causes should be occurring . this guy suffered for months so that they could watch him slowly die of something that will likely not have any real impact on medicine .
