1. there was an asian kid with tourette ' s in my school who kept making barking sounds like a dog , and all i could think was " you are what you eat "
   (ID: d36987531b50696cc5ce9c9479fdb6d4b00b3ffa)

2. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

3. i think its ok if it advances the plot along . like if a character is sleeping with someone to get information or something . otherwise yeah it seems kinda dumb .

4. forced religion on me rather than letting me see the choices and choose what i believed in . i think i would have followed their religion if they had not been like that

5. i dont think it works like that but ok
   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

6. kerfuffle . is it a word ? im not sure . have i hear it being used ? i think so . do i like how it sounds ? certainly .
   (ID: 20e44d996799f8bb3fe89546818050bf021f4be9)

7. what makes you think that i  m intentionally trying to get their attention and being  creepy  ? smiling at someone who makes eye contact with you is polite , not creepy . giving them a dirty look is rude . it seems like automatically giving a stranger a dirty look screams  i  m pathologically insecure  .

8. " dear death rows of reddit , what was your last meal ? " i think the question was like that
   (ID: 4b127841179d58078b4fbc1377158cb136f3156f)

9. while that is true , do you think if we were still kids , we would be so much involved in topics like politics or terrorism for example ?
   (ID: 7f6694fd3a0ac22f64517c7789d1ce29240c5082)

10. i think it looks ridiculous , even if it has zero health consequences you still end up looking like a wanker lol each to their own though i guess .
   (ID: b489bebca81ea07c422e4a78e54cd162edf2a814)

11. there ' s a film i think it ' s called cannibal family or something like that . it ' s a pretty ok film for its budget . but if i ' m not mistaken someone who was involved in someway with the original . and i think they called it and " unofficial " remake . i could be totally wrong and please call me out if i am . but it might be worth a watch
   (ID: 4ffb044c26007ae2bade7d602b40fcd747aae147)

12. i like the way you think
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

13. i think it ' s like a muscle cramp but in a certain spot which makes the area into a really tight " knot " and since it will be a little denser it hurts
   (ID: d65f8a6de2b4a1b52f7d721549231e1246105e78)

14. ah i feel yeah pepole on those subreddit like there fancy foramted theories well try phrasing it more of a question . post the evidence you have so far and then ask what do yousubreddit followers think
   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

   (ID: 09497187ec9a21bc1613d8054b406811bf86c91c)

18. true , but to me , i think it seems like a question they should be answering rather than asking . that ' s why i ask several questions about working conditions and technologies used , etc .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)
