16. this is a very difficult subject . has she ever been molested ? i was molested by my father , starting at the age of digit . because of this , i ' m fairly certain your attraction would be a deal breaker for me . however , you are clearly an honorable man , and i want to thank you . i can only imagine how difficult this must be for you . i think your best bet would be to start the therapy if that ' s the road you want to take , and have her join you . i think hearing a professional ' s opinion , and understanding what you are dealing with will help her and the inevitable confusion that i ' m sure will come .
