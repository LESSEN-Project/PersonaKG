3. wouldn  t the accounts receivable of banks be completely thrown off though ? the banks would simply be wrecked financially and the federal reserve requirement eventually . someone would make money off of the hedging the risk but i would think that ultimately banks would lose millions if not billions in accounts receivable . hell if it actually happened i don  t think the us would have serious consequences . i think it could happen if everyone started to default on there loans alone .

4. nothing beats the taste of horse on cup day . my family has been eating horses on cup day for years now . i ' m glad you mentioned dogs  we should make a day when we can eat dogs as well . i don ' t think we should race cats though , unless we gave them lots of steroids so they got big enough that small children could ride them . do you think we could eat the cats ? i don ' t think they would taste too good when they ' re roided up though .

   (ID: 43361d3d352286328dcb058ec017ca0e2d364601)

13. the lyrics are literally " this one ' s a contradiction because of how happy it sounds , but the lyrics are so down " i don ' t think it counts , it ' s too obvious . some other twenty one pilots songs would probably fit better .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

14. i don ' t think so . you could shoot your something else off too .

   (ID: 49da7f507a8170f4c701a5006dfb956700a67bfc)
