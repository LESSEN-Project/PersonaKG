4. i think it ' s a nice app . new vocab is presented in a way that is easy to learn and backed up by flashcards , pictures and matching . this is the same way i learnt greek . the interface of the app honestly feels cluttered and out of place imho . it ' s a bit laggy as well . i think it would be nice if the app could be designed around the materiel design or a similar flat design . overall , it ' s a good app and i look forward to using it .

8. no i honestly think it ' s a good idea ! how am i so off base on this ? yes power banks exist , yes solar chargers exist but if you dont have any other options in the moment this could be a super convenient thing to be able to go and buy . jesus by all the downvotes and sassy comments i ' m getting your think i ' m advocating the clubbing of baby seals or something

9. i think they screwed up with the character daario naharis in game of thrones . maybe not the worst casting decision , as huisman does a good job . but they turned what was supposed to be a blue hair gold toothed barbarian into a pretty boy heart throb . come on hbo .
   (ID: faebbe18abd4d1c69e3bb9106178f797255444c5)

12. this is chill as hell . i can see this being the ost for an indie platformer or something along those lines . good stuff ! it really shines as an ost arrangement if that was what you were gunning for . usually i ' d say that the drums would need to be more punchy , but for this laid back type of song , i think it ' s actually better that the drums aren ' t too loud .   x200b  what do you think of this song ? i ' m trying to transition to more electronic stuff so this is the end of lofi for me , but would love your thoughts regardless . good stuff by the way !

15. i was told that i had a good imagination , but i think it was more of a  what do we tell him ? we can  t lie and says he  s smart or good looking or well adjusted . good imagination ? i mean , he doesn  t seem to realize he  s a socially awkward idiot with a face even a mother can  t love , so it  s kinda true , right ?

17. it  s not being  holier  than  thou  , all it  s doing is challenging how we think about the people around us . if you  re a good person , great ! keep on doing what you  re doing . you are the type of person the ad is calling on to call out inappropriate behavior . that  s all .

19. the button may be sticking it could be something underneath that ' s causing it . if you think it could be this , check out some youtube videos on how to take it a part . i had a trigger that kept sticking and once i took it a part and cleaned it , it was as good as new .
