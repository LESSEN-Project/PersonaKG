1. come to think of it you might be right . for all i know it could be some magical chinese wooden dildo in the shape of a fish !

3. i think the utopian society to which you are referring could exist with robots who do all the hard labor . i know that in a sci fi movie this ends badly , but still .

4. i think now we will see the fighting . germa has been around for so long and we dont know shit about them and about big mom past i think we may see another short flashback at the end of the arc , also mother caramel maybe is alive inside bigmom or as a homie .

5. personally . in all seriousness . i paid for services . the first session was a get to know you and administrative stuff . second session was telling her about the issues she wouldn ' t offer advice here , i ' m assuming she had to refer to her books first . third session she asks more questions and i had to come back . i think it ' s more of a " let ' s milk it " because if they helped you on the first visit or two , you wouldn ' t need to come back and spend more money .

8. is that why all of our key players were either fouling out or riding four fouls in every single game of the tournament ? do you know how many times that happened during the season ? none , that ' s how many . can you honestly look at that and not think somethings up ?
   (ID: b13c661d25562198666588e5e66ab35a26f1c5f2)

9. at least i find it easier . the one i know you have to line up approximately , and i think this has a better effectiveness  difficulty ratio than most .
   (ID: 6260fdfdc8a5feec78502a823b8de04ee318e260)

10. i think you misunderstood what i meant , i meant that gbay knows what every other veteran player already knows . so he knows what to tell us , because he is a veteran player he knows what we know . for example this , most veteran players already know these things , but because gbay is a veteran player he knows what information will be new to us . sorry , the way i worded this isn ' t the best .

11. i think this gets buried under the memes but this is what a great relationship is about . for me specially . you meet her . you get to know her . you fell in love . you find your thing and thats special . cheris that thing you have incommon .
   (ID: 4dc8611321f8939824b42f21260d7a2adbf4a5d1)

12. noice . yeah maybe you  re right but i think that  s a little bit of a misconception u know not you  re fault ofc by any means . hope it goes well for u .

13. something i  m discovering is that auto  moderators flag my  do you need a compliment today  posts because they are very similar to dae posts i think . do you know of any subreddits that wouldn  t flag my posts ?
   (ID: a34ef7e69231beba0b698fce11fafc5b69c9d52d)

14. ineresting . i suppose you have a point there . completing weeks and weeks without accomplishing anything can lead to hopelessness , i know that feeling too . it ' s possible that a tighter schedule would be worth it . however , i think the specifics are wrong . if it were me in his shoes , none of those things would help . i turned to school and developed a plan to be self  employed to help me . whatever the case , he has to find some form of self motivation again . i think it ' s up to op , whether or not she thinks this will help , and how to use it .

   (ID: 42a8780a6a35c7b2e85acf575fc8cb2ff3c5a6f3)

17. honestly that sounds pretty expensive to me . i dont know the prices of the parts off hand , but i really dont think it should be 2g to do such little work
   (ID: 46a39b1131e50f9cc061bbaf88e15686e5c9359d)

18. i think i know the one you are talking about , right around the darth maul fight if memory serves . it ' s probably a challenge to follow star wars unless you are john williams .
   (ID: f67193f447733f4c17bdaf0f2eab02eb972eb0b4)

19. you should know that your so ' s real side . personality , quirks , temperment , etc will come out only after getting married ! you will think you married a stranger !
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

20. i do get laid , and i dont think you even know how to please one . however i am an enviro9enthusiast and care about all animals and ecosystems , which you so clearly dont give a damn about . bust since you are all high and mighty . can you tell me where the clit is ?
