3. it  s not really about hiding runes tbh you can just get to see those using the sw exporter anyways . i like having my island empty and it makes the game lag less ! mostly do it for the organization purpose tbh

   (ID: 21bf46058f1cab200cb4b3c2a0165363bbe171a8)

8. gif is properly pronounced jif like the peanut butter . more specifically , the j sound should be the same as the same as in ' jury ' or ' just ' , and the ' if ' should sound like the word ' if . ' that ' s according to the inventor of the standard and word . meme should rhyme with stream .

9. how girls will hype each other up in each other  s comments of their posts like it  s so fake and you can tell most of them are just doing it to be nice
   (ID: cd68f53972cab9fdcbb4876f7761f6654836ff2c)

10. i wish i were joking too women dont tend to talk about how a loss feels or how it ' s not just a loss but more like the death of a dream . " be lucky for the kids you do have " is not a consolation in any way .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

11. well then you are far more than just an amazing body . my fav part is definitely " bitch pussy smell like a penguin . wouldn ' t hit that shit with my worst enemy ' s penis . "

13. fortnite now it  s not because of the meme it  s just that i find the game like , bad . it  s literally shit and only pay to win and no actual fun in playing it .
   (ID: ba6e9b4e1f123022ebad3ecf22065f969929a346)

14. i ' m guessing it ' s harder to count out all the little balls and put them in a bag than it is to just hand them one big item . especially if the kid is picking out different types of really inexpensive items like candy , because they take forever to decide how to spend every last ticket .
   (ID: acecdec2f65b894e4aeb0b0d8b7a744c44568aef)

15. that ' s just my sense of humour . where ' s the fun if we ' re all going to go around acting like grandmothers ?
   (ID: 04b12cbc989702ae4909382de2ac53409fddbbf4)

   (ID: a98df1d16d4e1204ace7856449444a3afbb80743)

18. didn ' t feel like reading all the comments . save your money just have a shake . it has them all .
   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

   (ID: 3171687207fd659f146afaa305fc2ad7b92ea52b)
