1. but he ' s an addict and i believe he was molested by his mother as a kid . he has done some nice things for his kid . he always apologizes or at least does something to get on their goodside . and honestly i think he did the right thing by telling fiona that sean still used .

4. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

5. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .

6. why would a review make the point of saying someone ' s not a genius ? you think i ' m especially not a genius ? you didnt even have to think about it , did you ?

7. i can truly relate to the part where one day you love everyone and the next it all switched up . sometimes i think i have some form of narcissism . how did you find out about it ?

9. i think they did a reality show about that . a homeless man was given a lot of money . can ' t remember how much , but apparently he didn ' t really use it well . but we should try again and again .

10. perhaps , but as i said in a previous post , " inform , " not preach . as i said , sometimes problems are caused . i can think of at least one thing that is worse  living with yourself when you saw a wrong and did nothing , knowing a child would suffer .

11. you  re right . the mother was upset that she was feeding it to her kid everyday , and the kid was gaining weight and was in poor health . you fed your kid chocolate everyday . what the hell did you think would happen
