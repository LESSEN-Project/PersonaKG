4. i was never really bullied in grade school and high school because i befriended the bullies . they had use of me helping them out with their grades , general companionship , and lending an ear to their issues , and i had use for them protection from other bullies , general companionship , so it was a mutually beneficial relationship . i thought i was above it all and would not succumb to their bullying influences , but come high school , something snapped . the good girl who was too nice for the bullies to bother , who nobody really minded , became a bully herself . i suppose it was their influence , and the anger and rebelliousness inside me that i repressed throughout my childhood that made me snap and become mean to specific people , and nice to everyone else . i had a track record of being good that nobody believed that i was capable of emotional cruelty .
