1. i absolutely hate the threads that are deep  seated in woman hating . yet these people cry and moan about not having friends or a life outside of reddit . gee , i wonder why ? maybe if half the people on reddit stopped whining , stopped giving into the hivemind and show girls some respect . maybe , juuuuust maybe , she will like you . also , reddit is not a reliable source of dating advice ! when a single woman goes on a date with you , all your karma points don ' t mean shit . show her you ' re not an asshat and she ' ll like you .

2. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .

3. this is not entirely true . it is in my case . but for the majority of people , they decide to screw around for fun and suddenly become addicted . i don ' t even have an addictive personality , i just like how drugs feel .

4. i get why some people don ' t like the casting choices but why not give them a chance and at least watch some of their performances which by the way i can ' t find much for anya

7. it ' s your choice , and everyone has their reasons . i sometimes feel like people who don ' t drink can be a little judgmental of people who do , but i grew up around baptists so maybe thats why .

8. i have to ask you why you don ' t look this up yourself ? you have to be on the internet to type and submit your comment so why not just do a quick google search ? one of the biggest problems in this country is that a lot of people do not research anything themselves . they simply wait for someone to present information to them . when they don ' t like the information they hear , even if it is true , they dismiss it and when they hear information they do like they accept it even if it is false . it ' s absolutely ridiculous how easily manipulated people can be .

9. it ' s true that some people don ' t care . you ' re right about me sounding like a weirdo from an optics or peceived reality standpoint though .

10. saw someone post something like this the other day . i don ' t understand how people don ' t get , it ' s not at all confusing . users submit any content they like , which gets voted on by the community , and those which get overwhelmingly positive feedback reach the front page of the internet

11. um , no the odds of him having a child are the odds of anyone else having a child . you either do or you don  t . and he could use a surrogate like plenty of straight people do too .

12. there ' s nothing to agree about . i presented a concept for like minded people to discuss . you wouldn ' t walk into a vegan forum and start saying how the idea is stupid would you ? you stated you don ' t like that idea . that ' s perfectly acceptable . you didn ' t add anything to the discussion though other than how you dislike it . obviously you have made up your mind , so you have no purpose in this thread anymore . go talk on topics you enjoy .

13. don ' t complain to the people in the same situation as you , and don ' t complain to your subordinates . if you have an issue , take it higher and work towards resolving it . sitting around talking to your coworkers about how much your job sucks just makes you look like a whiney , entitled prick

14. some dogs don  t like people with hats on . might just be something they aren  t used to . or a bad experience .
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

15. why are you asking this ? like other people said there ' s nothing wrong with it , they don ' t hurt anyone for me as long as they don ' t convince others to be gay i ' m ok with it , they ' re humans just like you and me
   (ID: 2a3d0cc7409627207d71d58affd421983020efbe)

16. this is awesome . fuck those people that don  t like it . you do you . i like this . you  re doing something that gives you enjoyment . fuck the haters .
   (ID: cfe7a9cb95161c48ae666ad8a5dbd72b2c5bea20)

17. people actively search out your username and it ' s history to critique it if they don ' t like your comment .

18. whenever i see people talking about how bad it is to drive i feel like i must be playing a different game . what controls are you using ? i  m using a hotas and vr and don  t have any problems with it at all , in fact it  s one of my favourite parts of the game . i  m wondering if the differing experiences is caused by different control set ups .

20. i don ' t like it . i just . this whole thing is confusing . why do some people hate jews ? i don ' t understand where that ' s even coming from . that just sounds insane to me . do they just not like jewish people because hitler didn ' t ? or is there some actual reason ?
