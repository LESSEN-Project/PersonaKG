1. awesome writing prompt , but i don  t have the time
   (ID: 73729b18763ec2bd335c4301856d4979e2f123b1)

2. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .

3. i agree . i don ' t see why kids should compete with anyone but themselves . sporting events , talentshows , spelling bees . i never really got that . there ' s still time for that later . as a teacher i tend to focus on process and not so much on product . children are individuals .

4. my mom says ,  it  s because you  re on that game all the time .  while that  s partially a factor , i  m on the game so i don  t go into mental breakdowns every night

6. i play in ps4 and i usually don  t get much online interaction until the area after that place . also if you are struggling try relying more on rolling than blocking . ds3 is very different from ds1 in that regard . also , yes , partying is much more difficult in ds3 and takes a lot more time to master

9. let him sit and watch tv all day . ask him what he likes . tell him stories about the two of you and your favorite show  time together . listen to any of his stories , even if they are ridiculous . don ' t expect anything from him , so when he does remember it will be a gift . rotate caregivers frequently to avoid burnout . check out local care facilities , cost , and requirements . join a support group .

10. on desktop all right let me rotate my screen to see the biggest conspiracy of all time that doesn ' t give anything to anyone and costs billions of dollars but fits my absolutely crazy worldview in which government is incompetent enough to leave major flaws in their models which don ' t exist if you look closely but i looked from far enough to see them !
   (ID: e6e1db90a47dca83004beacbcc9004bec464c7d0)

11. if i have to go someplace new for some sort of obligation , i don ' t mind a long  ish drive . it gives me time to get mentally ready .
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

12. yeah it ' s annoying but over time it does get better . it will always be there but you get used to it . i don ' t worry about it much nowadays . if i ever get a flare up or more pain than usual i do the exercises over a week or two and it settles down again .
   (ID: 2ad50e702ea7ef4cc62a34ca116f658d564c0474)

13. i don ' t have to . party time y ' all
   (ID: 13b3de2f6f825774e3e188be0716b795da309ae9)

14. apprenticeships ! you can work and get a degree at the same time . you do it with a company , you get a reduced salary , but it means you don ' t have to pay anything , and you get experience in the workplace . you do come out of it with a degree in whatever field your apprenticeship was in
   (ID: c1af2a10f968ba6f52d825dbf8fc9b8210db72ba)

15. i don ' t understand why you wouldn ' t hire me though . i have my flaws but when it comes to work , i put extra at home every day , whether it be reading a programming language book or a dev . to article , working a bit on my portfolio  projects etc . i can be stuck on a problem because i ' m new to the project code it ' s undocumented because he didn ' t have time for it , my supervisor is often wfh or at meetings . i use stov for question , but it obviously takes time to receive an answer .
   (ID: be7b401bbc0f0d2ea10ea4a90144b4e0986edb9b)

16. from what i see in your copy and comment , it is still the same argument . you ' re arguing over the semantics of permanent incapacity to perform your job , over the direct thought that if you ' re not useful for any length of time you don ' t deserve to keep your job . that ' s what i got out of the comment you copied .
   (ID: 0198e6673943ada6e9fb321073bbf268c79d2ea3)

17. teach them that there is no end to your problems  it is a race with no finish line so take your time and don ' t rush through life only to regret it . i wish i learned that sooner
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

18. what you don ' t see most of the time he ' s shouting at jon snow in all those clips .
   (ID: aadd17a8d6a69666950fca3b48e30391b837e3b7)

19. they don ' t stack . either you need to waste a bunch of inventory space to carry your spares , or you need to bring out a workbench every time you need a boat , which is especially annoying if you crash your boat in hostile territory .
