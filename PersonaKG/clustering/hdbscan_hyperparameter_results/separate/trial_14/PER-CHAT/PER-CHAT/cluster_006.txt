   (ID: 89172208f0be842fb66b4827fa7b5c4d26df07e4)

15. really ? how about you bluepillbeta do some research before sprouting this nonsense . if you don ' t know what the foundation of mgtow is , why try to have a discussion . if you want a serious answer , read the sidebar and if you aren ' t too blind , you ' ll see why .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

16. i don ' t know if i count but my ocd ruined my life to the point i had to be hospitalized multiple times . i can ' t control my thoughts and i want to be productive but my intrusive thoughts just get so bad . i want to go to college and eventually a job but these damn thoughts are ruining it for me .

17. you don  t need to know characters sexuality to play a game . and it  s better that way because hell , they could be gay , you wouldn  t know , so you can believe what you want about them .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

18. that ' s the way i ' d go . if you don ' t want to do any of the things you already know , knowing more means options you might not have considered will open up .

19. it ' s hard enough to get them to help with recovering an account that all the info is known for . if you don ' t know the email address , password , or birthdate , their hands are kind of tied . there ' s no way to prove that it ' s actually your account . i mean , of course you can always try . are your pets the same ? do you remember any items you may have had , or avatar count ? maybe someone changed your info . seems unlikely that it can be recovered , but if you really want it , it can ' t hurt to see what tnt says .

20. firstly because it was a long response , and it wasn  t angry , i thought u were offended . secondly was daily in capitals i now know it was a mistake and the fact that you told me to go and get the armour myself , which would be pointless as i don  t want it
