18. i  m sad . sometimes i eat too much and guilt myself over it and get sad about everything in my life . it  s like an excuse to ignore my work and then focus on the sadness , cause pity is easier than owning up to anxiety and obligations . i  m sad and i want to cry , but there  s nothing to cry about . i like to feel bad for myself because it  s easy , but it  s an excuse . oh well .

19. well heres my opinion , the guys probably very paranoid of you cheating on him , im not saying you would but thats what it looks like . heres what you need to do , if you want to stay with him id explain how hes the one and hes over reacting . tell him that you need some breathing room to do whatever you want but that youll always come back home to him . you should only unblock the guy when he understands to give you space . if you feel like things arent working out anymore because of trust then youd definitely be in the right to break up with him . thats what id do atleast

20. couldn  t care less about the environment like everyone else here does . i want jet packs and virtual reality social media
