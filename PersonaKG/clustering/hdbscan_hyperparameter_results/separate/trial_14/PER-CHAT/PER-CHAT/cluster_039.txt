2. i loved the musical numbers . although i think billy crystal ' s opening montages were hilarious , the theme for this year ' s oscars was a tribute to musical theater so it just made sense to have that opening and the dance sequence .

3. just watching the one card and it ' s got me thinking , what do you think the optimal cage shape is for mma ? or does it not matter as long as it is the right size and there is no sharp corners ?

4. that ' s messed up that the mods harassed you . in my opinion it doesn ' t matter if you liked califronia or hated itim the 2nd one . the i think we all can agree feldman was either in over his head or just flat out sucks . jerry finn is missed by many . he ' s literally a legend in the genre .

10. basically everything you think is the motive  reason  outcome isn  t . it just takes an open mind to get past politics and personal attacks .
   (ID: b91b4f0f2eca5caceeb4492710cd0c8e74b032bc)

11. i ' m not butthurt at all . just trying to understand what you ' re saying and it comes down to them appearing to be more confident then you think they are .
   (ID: f84f00f5008425ec4928909d75ca4bb2e65f91ee)

   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

13. and then they  d likely sanitise it or not serve the food . what do you think happens in a regular restaurant when that happens ? they just leave the blood and hope for the best ?
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

14. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

15. and i think to myself , what a wonderful world . it ' s just so perfect .

18. go , why the hell not ? just be smart and have a plan to gtfo if everything goes south midway through . i think you should tell someone you ' re going , a friend an adviser or someone you can count on if it goes to shit . you will regret not going .
   (ID: f4e4929bb0bef09e7eb72aaccf20c2d9454729c7)
