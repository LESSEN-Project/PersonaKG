Total from this dataset: 157

1. i think the fact that this happened proves for a fact that " we " are not better than this . this subreddit isn ' t even about lol anymore , it ' s about pros and funny lol pictures . it ' s pathetic .

2. ah . still , if you are stabbed and then seek the person out to hurt them , i think you are probably technically violating the rule . only if you are punching them to keep from being stabbed are you in the exception .

3. do you think being deaf would be a better alternative ? if so , is it possible to have surgury to remove the organs that are causing the issue ?

   (ID: fbed02b3d7caf00e8d1533f452f8951cf390df73)

5. a second one ? now as useful as other things i think . unless you have something in mind ?
   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

6. if you think about it it ' s kind of a gone girl prototype .
   (ID: a62b69d15e6c81a1a1acb2d0dd4bf9119038ff09)

7. what is it with europeans choosing to call it maths instead of math ? aluminium instead of aluminum ? what ? you think you ' re cool or something ?
   (ID: f15c79447707a6e701285e8c59cc3aa25d54daa6)

   (ID: 4679181760b739d302b80a7e08480575bf4d30bc)

9. do we have to answer or can ' t you think of it yourself ?
   (ID: 080eedcfaabe8f67b2c0a8da33a3a401906822f2)

10. my situation is extremely similar . what ' s the person in questions named cody ? if so i think we might be talking about the same person
   (ID: 5be7ef463c3ba0c7a9c255bd9769c5f638d2b805)

11. this actually sound like an issue with the pc  mac  s hardware . you could check your activity monitor and see if the interface is initiating some type of search for new software , but i don  t think that  s what it is . turning off the internet is recommended for optimizing your daw . but who are we kidding . i don  t think many prosumers do . this isn  t a very common issue which is another reason i think it  s the computer  s ports .
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

12. probably before the purge . i think it ' s from generalsam133
   (ID: 114e3678c6af9d322985bb4656e33b19c03a0479)

13. education , research , experiences , trial and error , and , most importantly , the ability to think on my own .
   (ID: d06e7949138d7c04b968c15f3dd6f37d07c5a670)

14. i think you should correct your behaviour . if your first thought when something happens is " im completely faultless " and then after everyone else says you ' re the asshole you still seem to think you ' re in the right . yta taking out your anger on others and racist comments are never valid . dont kid yourself
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

15. i wondered that myself . i can only think of it being a further stress relief .
   (ID: 1413da4d65544a15a55a7323945fa06ed3f67f4a)

16. i think the strongest card you have is beelze , if you wanted to build a twilight deck around him you could pick up some lightsworn cards in conjunction with plague spreader zombie . maybe google " twilight deck " for some ideas .
   (ID: 46f455b780faca36116964131a4d0622c465bf7f)

17. i honestly don ' t think he needs any rework , if you are looking for a counter , hold still during the duration of his drone . it ' s that simple . if you get rushed and have to move then that was probably the point of the activation of the done .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

18. i can only think of ' ' minecraft vr ' ' when watching this
   (ID: bd42a28607025a98ff2c7df361f815aea9ee3ea9)

19. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)
