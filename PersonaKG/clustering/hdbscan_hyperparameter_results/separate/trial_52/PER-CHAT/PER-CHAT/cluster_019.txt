15. that  s something i keep thinking about . if she was looking for more romance , why didn  t she try harder with me ? instead , she went to a guy who was probably only acting romantic so he could add sleeping with another guys wife to his list of sexual conquests . so she is either really dumb , or really vindictive . probably a combination of both .
