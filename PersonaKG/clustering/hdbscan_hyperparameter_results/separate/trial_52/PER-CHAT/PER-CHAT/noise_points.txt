1. seriously look it up it was a way to mark slaves , then jews and other religions then jump to the 1900s american doctors claimed it would reduce masterbation . when in reality all it does is remove pleasure along with climax control and lubrication . i will never do it to a baby boy . no one should . if they dont like how it looks by the time they start using it you can do it later in life .

3. even the new tim comes as a gift . and no one claimed that this is more than a slight refresh . nobody has the reason to complain , especially when the new parts are going at the old prices .

4. yep . it happens . i noticed that i developed a crush on someone else . nothing wrong with so , and i still care for them just no longer in love with them . it ' s heartbreaking to realize especially when there is no right thing to do that makes everyone happy .

6. it is pretty gruesome most of the time . sometimes it ' s like far away shots where you can ' t really see anything but you know they ' re dying  dead . i ' m not sure why other people watch it , but for me it made death more real , if that makes sense . as someone who has never actually seen someone die in real life it has been informative . before i watched some of those videos it was like " oh , that sucks " when i ' d hear on the news that someone got shot , stabbed , in a car accident , died in a fire , etc . after seeing those kinds of videos i take more of a pause after hearing something like that . i take the moment to mourn a life that ' s been extinguished , and be thankful for how fortunate i have been . but that ' s just me . though i will say , i can ' t watch the ones with kids . i saw one video with kids and even now i want to vomit .

7. fireball is the best counter for electro wizard users , which isn ' t many , and not many people use fireball either , so what ' s the point

8. this is strong logic to me . even if a gun  toting robber invades my home at night , he ' s going to shoot at me as soon as he sees my gun . i don ' t need to bet on my gun skills beating his gun skills . i ' d rather just live , you know ? i ' ll take my chances on my night stick .

10. i feel quite angry and scared . i don ' t want millions of people , including me , to be criminalized for something they can ' t control .

11. thank you for trying ! i wasn ' t expecting any help , just a vent . it ' s not painful at all so i haven ' t bothered , so maybe i should .

12. true , but to me , i think it seems like a question they should be answering rather than asking . that ' s why i ask several questions about working conditions and technologies used , etc .

13. late to the party but let me explain the real reason they are almost extinct  remember in oregon trail when you went hunting and shot everything and was like fuck yeah a 900lbs of food . my family has been at a grueling pace , and one of the kids has dysentery  we could really use this . then you realize  you can only carry 100lbs . that is the story of the american buffalo .

15. the best advice i can give to you is to either talk to your friend , let them know how you feel and give them the chance to become aware that their behavior is bothering you , or do nothing and slowly back away from the friendship . i am in a similar boat myself . as friends we should be able to voice our opinions and concerns within our friendships and not worry that the other will become defensive or misinterpret our motivations , but sometimes it just doesn ' t work that way because of bias or prejudice or just plain ol ' human error and that ' s when it ' s time to step back . good luck !

18. why does this only work when you ' re alone ? i do this when other people are around . my colleagues only intervene if the conversation turns into an argument

19. makes sense . just funny how all ' s i did was make an observation which is most likely correct and instead of either acknowledging it , or moving on , they have to be so salty for some reason .

20. found my step  dad white , aspirated on his own vomit , drunk , and high on oxy . woke him up covered in his own puke , sobered him up , and fed him some dinner . fucking guy then calls the psychiatric emergency response team on me a week later and tells them my child is in danger so they bring cps and perjure themselves saying i was a threat to my family which i hadn ' t seen for six months which leads me to a three year restraining order against my own family . fuck you , mike .
