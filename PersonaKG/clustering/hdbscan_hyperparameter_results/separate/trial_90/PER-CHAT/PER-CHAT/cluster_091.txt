   (ID: 7c0a90108389e898ab80f1c7af44e170b85c6d76)

8. i hate such mis direction . a movie should be like fight club with subtle clues all around place . maybe its just my preference .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

9. yeah like it changed to the boy somehow being alive ? sorry if i ' m spoiling but the movie is shit so it just made no sense and the plot twist was just shit
   (ID: 09635643777fe30eb3750faad0e2ea7a607f855c)

10. just off the top of my head . race is an optical illusion , bernie sanders doesnt like socialism as much as he likes attention , trump and chris christie are having an affair , and reddit is a cia project designed to gather psychological data on americans .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

11. play arcade but the ones like team deathmatch or just deathmatch . you dont have a team or  your team  doesnt care about losing or winning bc well , its just arcade .
   (ID: a0849f7d6d0829c8bb5f820aa9bf63584c7471df)

12. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets
   (ID: 0264eec5f9f9a43d83f3a82c46341e90961fa3b8)

13. i wonder if there ' s some sort of official eucharist recipe or if you can just bake up your jesus however you like .
   (ID: f3657f57aa348caf1c32ec21ef139ea41a45dc29)

14. they should be set up like recipe combinations like if you guess a powerful combo it will occur with that shortcut but if it ' s not a combo it just cast one spell then the next and wastes a little mp .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

15. it was on reddit and someone said to some innocuous comment i wrote ,  i hope you die .  i could not see anything offensive or rude or even that opinionated in my comment . so i didn  t care . if anything it helped me . that comment reminded me that i shouldn  t take anything online to heart . if i offended or upset someone i would not like that  and i would apologise but if someone just wants to be a rude little fucker it has no impact on me .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

   (ID: 225291489bc1a4ddf3d197a3062fa9ff935f3029)
