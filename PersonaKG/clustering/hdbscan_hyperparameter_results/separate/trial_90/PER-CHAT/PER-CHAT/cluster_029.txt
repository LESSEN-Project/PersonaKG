1. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !
