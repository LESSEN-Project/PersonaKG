5. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .

9. my friend was in a similar situation . his parents are british but they moved to south africa and had him there , so although he is a uk citizen he wasn ' t classified as a local student for the purpose of uni fees . you could always try germany . you could study for free at public german universities as an undergraduate . good luck !
