5. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .

9. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .
