   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

2. guy here . because its always followed with a " why " and that leads to more conversation they don ' t want to have with you .
   (ID: b5f9b695867ef3b560a4fe7610f75e43b62809f6)

5. dude right ? most bees don ' t want anything to do with you along with a lot of other creepy crawlies you find and they won ' t bother you if you don ' t fuck with them . trap it in a cup and put it outside , that ' s probably where it wants to be anyways .

   (ID: 91dc65ba6eef536f17becface16989de7f988dce)

9. fuck them . even the ones who post spoilers without context . even if you post that meme , i don ' t want to go in the cinema expecting those things .
   (ID: a5976f282a96c036f5e4d14957305323c9a5776d)

10. thank them , especially with an avengers movie . they drop a hint about something that ruins the movie for me , i won ' t want to see it , and i typically don ' t sit down to watch a two hour movie without first finding out what half the plot is .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

11. i don ' t normally do this but i imagine it ' s because my stop is nearing and i don ' t want to move in , only to have to move out again shortly . it may also be for the legroom .
   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

12. lol . he ' s in my foundry but i have read so may bad things about him i don ' t want to put myself through that kind of torment yet .
   (ID: 5078613a782f11088cff05f4503056b040cea999)

13. i figure if you don ' t leave me a message . then you don ' t actually want to speak w me .
   (ID: 97c35f21c6a14bb50b6faae9a7b18cd5968c350c)

14. probably current patch apart from very minor changes . they rightfully so don ' t want to change the meta a lot right before such a big tourny .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

15. however often you want . personally i don ' t do it too often personally , but if your facespace friends don ' t want to see . your stuff they can delete you or whatever .
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

16. poor you . maybe people don  t want to hear someone swear on this nice subreddit
   (ID: 726c36ce13fa631676ed5053f62b0f5f7b61eb5e)

17. don ' t want my penis to be lonely
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

18. i always post that i want to eat various things . i ' m not a cat , i just never grew out of that ' explores world with my taste buds ' stage . ftr , i don ' t want to eat this moth  it ' s so fluffy !
   (ID: 649605988d72e34fdcf0c170b6b9fa959a7d483e)

19. i always assume they are not chasing but getting caught in the air currents of people running away . when you move fast there is a tiny area of low pressure behind you and they sort of get caught up in that . walk away slowly and they don ' t appear to follow unless you ' re eating something they want
   (ID: cda2027ff011b74a04f79a766c8e8da339eb1f0b)

20. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
