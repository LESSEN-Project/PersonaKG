1. i know several people who think that is the funniest thing ever on family guy .
   (ID: 627809b826e1a364fb65664e0749e9e9eb90081d)

2. i think you ' re doing the right thing . i hope the kid understands your decision as soon as he is old enough to get the story .
   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

3. i think there ' s something in your teeth . not a roast , a legit gross thing i noticed .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

4. in what way ? wanting to know what specific thing you think makes it shitty .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

5. nope . only for funerals or weddings . which if you think about it are the same thing .

6. i think you ' d be right if a person told their kid " you ' re a disappointment " or " you ' re an idiot who cheats " or something like that but saying " i ' m disappointed in you for cheating " allows that a parent has feelings about the child ' s behavior and lets the kid know that the parent has expectations for the child to not cheat . it is a fine line but i do think there is a big difference in saying " i feel this way about that thing " and " you are that thing " .

7. unfortunately this sort of thing is already happening . i think that ' s why lots of american cops are pretty jumpy and don ' t hesitate when using a gun .
   (ID: a90f01f580b7cc08038958d5c1f659fd492b1f2c)

8. if done right , a collection of vignettes can be incredibly engaging . suttree by cormac mccarthy is a prime example of this , or steinbeck ' s cannery row . one of the things that makes it doable is how the vignettes tap into the reader ' s humanity  there is something they can connect with . i think it ' s a cool idea . who cares if it ' s the in thing right now .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

9. i know more than one because my kids drug me through it . i still think it ' s a kid thing .
   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

10. i ' m going to assume that you , as a police force , have limited resources , and you can ' t possibly investigate every reference to some crazy thing in art . so , if that ' s the case , how do you choose what to investigate ? are you investigating rappers because you think they ' re more likely to be involved in crime ? that could be racist and prejudiced . if you ' re investigating rappers why haven ' t you investigated carrie underwood for " before he cheats " ? start to see why it might be a civil liberties issue ?
   (ID: eb338cca8f5e87e4b6e5d369997ab6dbebf241c5)

11. the only thing i ' m scared about is my parents taking me to the hospital for my thoughts but after reading this has made me think " isn ' t it better for someone to take you there for thoughts rather than an attempt .
   (ID: 168d1161144e63a83a23f04ae4e64bd4b25684c0)

12. i think it ' s a manners thing ? i mean , if you are in the company of others older generation . checking your phone could seem rude . but to them , reading a book in that situation could be too . i think it comes down to being aware of the situation you are in .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

13. honestly , i think the best thing you could do for her is surprise her with your presence on mother ' s day . that would be the best gift ever for her .
   (ID: 1b4a970a63450e21b56e1d38502b30aca032cd3f)

14. how cute , you think you know a thing about what people go through . try being bullied and shunned to an extent at digit different schools , 3rd grade until i went to college . oh , and you would all collectively call me a normie because i have an intimate relationship . don ' t assume you know a damn thing about any person who posts here because you simply dont .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

15. yeah . i see why some women don ' t but i think it ' s an important thing to at least attempt . lets print of cards and be weird together !
   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

16. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

17. maybe you ' re starting to have flashbacks . that , or aliens . only thing i can think of
   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

18. leaving cupboards and drawers open is a man thing . we ' re too busy to close them , i think .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

19. its the new thing . the kids think it is cool
