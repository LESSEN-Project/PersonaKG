2. if they already know everything about you how could it hurt ? i thought they were the feds who else has this power ? the first step to getting help is proving the problem exists . you ' ll notice that black people are starting to get help with police violence now that they ' re able to film the police . do you have everything to gain and nothing to lose but your delusions .

6. masturbation . i mean this seriously . people always say how women " reach their sexual peak in their digit ' s . i think some women are simply not familiar with themselves , comfortable with their sexuality or aware of what really pleases them until they get older in a lot of cases and that ' s what causes this widespread thought . my mother encouraged me to get to know myself sexually on solo before i involved a partner . how can you explain to someone else what pleases you if you can ' t please yourself ?

7. you sir are a golden god . i can ' t tell you how many times i ' ve tried to pause a video at an exact moment and failed . thanks for the tip .

8. nah without knowing the details of the argument but generally if you want your aunt there , you should invite her . not inviting her will be mean and make it seem to her that you are taking everyone else ' s side . i wouldnt reccomend appeasment as your method of life , id reccomend talking to everyone involved and everyone that feels bad and talk with them about this whole situation and whether or not they can be adults and get over it for a day . i think if you like your aunt , would want to spend the birthday with her , the argument wasn ' t her fault and you proceed to not invite her you would be the asshole without a doubt . otherwise try talking to everyone involved

9. it ' s about the dust bowl . especially if you ' re from the states , it ' s worth a read . it ' s hard to believe this happened not that long ago . pretty horrific stuff .

10. nice , welcome to the hobby ! do you have a particular style in mind diver , field , bauhaus , etc ? will this be for every day wear and if so what does your usual outfit consist of ? do you want a quartz or a mechanical ? any other particulars ?

11. no , i think you start as something like an atheist , tell me as a kid how well did you grasp the concept of god ? until you can comprehend the concept you aren ' t going to get anything out of it as a individual .

12. basically they wanted a discount , so of course they  knew the owner  and made a name up . so catching the blatant lie , i firmly say i am the owner , and they turned red and left . funniest lie i  ve ever told , it was obvious i wasn  t the owner but it was hilarious that they believed me .

13. you get desensitized to a lot of the weirdness , though one i love to tell people is that milk is basically just modified , nutrient  rich sweat .

15. if it is on a smalleinactive sub then it could actually be  hot  compared to other older posts . or they could be controversial and be downvoted a lot meaning they actually have a lot of upvotes .

16. probably turn into one of those guys that want everyone to see it because they did and it was beautiful . it would just take a few years to start getting people to look unless shes ripping off blindfolds

17. oh riiiiiight . i forgot that we are in a time where black people getting shot for no good reason but needing help or being not white is hilarious .

18. not exactly sure what you mean , but the only thing to do while peeing is hitting into the bowl , which isn ' t to hard .

20. no , but i watch people do it to all the time . usually in my personal case most people are afraid of me which is why i typically never approach people at all . i do watch while people insult friends of mine just for trying to have a conversations though .
