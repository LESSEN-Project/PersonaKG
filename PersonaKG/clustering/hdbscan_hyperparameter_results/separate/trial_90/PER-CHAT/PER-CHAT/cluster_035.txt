1. there was a mom in michigan whos kids starved to death because she said they wouldnt eat what she made for them . the old adage " they ' ll eat when they ' re hungry " isn ' t true for all kids . it doesn ' t mean they jave autism , either . doesnt mean you have to give into junk , but they should at least have milk or vitamin shake . kids usually like those . sustenance is important for kids especially .
