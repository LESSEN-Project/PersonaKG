5. i didn ' t get the hype as well . i simply think because we both expected to be hyped , we expected something extraordinary . whereas if we had no expectations going into the episode for the first time , it might have been profound .   x200b  i hope this made sense

7. because of how i think when i answer questions , it appears that i am lying . my life has been a series of false positives time and time again . it ' s frustrating and eventually i give up and let the person think what they are going to think .

11. i think everybody should see it one time . one of those movies you wouldn ' t be able to guess the ending in a million years .

13. amlo is just another stooge that protects and propagates the interests of transnational capital . he provides cover and a nice veneer while the capitalists go in and loot the natural resources , markets and labor of the country . much in the style of an obama or trudeau . i have no idea why you think anyone would care what time the asshole wakes up at and why you find this at all admirable . it ' s funny you would leave out the chavistas and maduro . why do you have such little political imagination ? why do you think your liberal tendencies are at all permissible in this sub ? are you another one of these white latin american men that has no problem stomping on the rights of indigenous peoples so long as capital accumulation processes can go on unabated ?

14. i think maybe he ' s referring to the fact that in the rpg rules , sponsored magic is something you choose whether or not to use , and you take debt every time you do . in the novels , pretty much all of harry ' s spells were enhanced with hellfire involuntarily the whole time lash was in his head .

15. by the rules of the internet he must commit seppuku when the next big social networking site takes over . why do you think we haven ' t heard from myspace tom in such a long time
   (ID: 7c3eb339580d281fcb54cb04dbb55f6921fceec5)

16. maybe think more about how you title your posts next time . your title was misleading whether you think so or not
