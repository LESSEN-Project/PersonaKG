7. very high expectations without the resources to meet them . whenever circumstances were such that you didn  t have enough to make them work , guidance was  make it happen .  sometimes our computer systems went out for digit days straight . what do you do then ? make it happen . the recipe for  make it happen  is almost always do this on your own time for no additional pay .

19. school textbooks in vietnam are amongst the tightest controlled , most heavily censored , and most unyielding to change of any " permitted " writing in vietnam . they are gone over with a fine  tooth comb by the party to make sure that the content fits in perfectly with their desired ends . education ' s end is to make the model citizen as they see it , to fit in with the big picture that they promulgate .
