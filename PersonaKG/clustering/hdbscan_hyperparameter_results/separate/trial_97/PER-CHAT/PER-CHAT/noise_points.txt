2. the thing is , phoenix aren ' t meta . they just help a lot early in the game as their tags allow you to unlock ep , thrawn and chimaera . it saves you time and makes you pretty competitive early on in arena .

3. how little free time you have . sure i have all the freedom i need to try new hobbies but between work and the commute and meals  chores , all i want to do at the end of the day is go to bed . and then you gotta push special chores like dr ' s appointments and oils changes to the weekend . i miss when i could play video games for like digit hours in a row uninterrupted

5. i was a little sad when i realized the " gunsmith " doesn ' t actually do any gunsmith  ing . i want to be able to change out sights , get trigger jobs , larger magazines and put a suppressor on my thorn for when my hunter is invisible .

6. so something that actually happened , is not a fact ? no wonder so many turn their back on god , they believe their opinions override facts . nearly everything in the bible has happened , with documented proof for most of it available today , but it is people who think their opinions override facts that choose to not believe the facts . therefore there is no answer that will suit some people until they drop their ignorance and selfish opinions . the stuff that has not happened , has not happened yet . so just because one thing has not happened means everything else didn ' t happen either ?

8. i am so sorry to hear that . i  m sorry you have to go through this but if it makes you feel any better , most women with big boobs are insecure and we don  t like them ! hell , men would much rather prefer smaller boobs on their significant other as opposed to big boobs there was a study on this . plus , you get to wear so many pretty bras ! and , you will always look really good in clothes

9. the messenger by markus zusak , everyone raves about the book thief , and rightly so i think it ' s fantastic , but imo the messenger is a phenomenal piece of literature . the content it explores are real , hard hitting issues , and the narrative styles he uses are unlike many other authors i ' ve ever read . the just utter cleverness of zusak , the twist he throws in at the end is just unique . after reading this book i had one of those hand  over  mouth  rethinking  every  life  choice  what  the  fuck  did  i  just  read  wow moments . seriously read this book , it ' s fantastic and deconstructing it didn ' t ruin it for me , it helped digit year old me understand it better , and have more of the aforementioned moments .

10. unrealized potential . hahahahaha you don ' t have friends and you say crap like that . so you fully realized your potential ? and no one cares about how much you paid for a xbox . people who could actually care would be friends . seriously , try to get friends , it would do you some good . i ' ll help lesson digit  be cool , don ' t be so sensitive lesson digit  the term " bro " is better used when talking to a close friend lesson digit  don ' t insinuate that you have more money than other people . it ' s really douchy and you might be wrong . let me know how it goes , as a fellow human being , i am actually concerned about you

11. i feel the exact same way ! i remember this fanfic i read in like digit and it was so cute and when i found it again i was like  what the fuck this is awful  i think it  s a combination of becoming older and being exposed to better content that makes you aware of how bad things actually were . maybe at the time we read our fan fictions the authors were the same age as us or younger so their writing was not so advanced , but now having grown older their writing has also developed but haha i  m glad i  m not the only one !

16. that is a bit of a interesting thing . we were the both of us in very abusive marriages . we met each other through a writing group her husband ran . her and i met . saw we were both in horrible situations and helped each other get out of them . we fell in love throughout and now our first child will be born any day now .

19. that ' s what it was like for me , maybe the business was dodgy , maybe not though because my other friends who worked in other businesses experienced the same thing . maybe i was unlucky ? but it can affect people in big business .

20. wow , what assholes . " the people you love " don ' t sound very loving .   x200b  listen , it ' s much better to have a great personality than looks . any day of the week . i don ' t want to date a model , i want to date someone who makes my life fun . some people are severely shallow , and don ' t worry , it ' ll end up biting them in the ass one day . just because some awful people have told you that you are not attractive , doesn ' t actually mean shit  because attractiveness is basically opinion  everyone ' s got a different one .   x200b  if i was you , i ' d call out and cut out everyone who said anything negative about you or your appearance .
