5. declining invites is i think a bit too far unless you have reason to expect an immediate disaster , such as a hurricane or snowstorm . here ' s what i would do . digit  keep some basics in your car , primarily water , food , meds and blankets . if you ' re travelling without a car , keep basics in your luggage if at all possible . digit  introduce others to prepping , but be diplomatic about it  start with the absolute basics , and mention for instance how you ' ve been reading about hurricanes  floods  any other fairly common disaster , and you think a few day ' s worth of supplies is a really great idea digit  don ' t start off by saying ' the end is nigh and i will not come stay unless you have guns , ammo and twelve years of mres ' sounds far  fetched but i ' ve met very intense preppers . they ' ll almost certainly just think you ' re both impolite and crazy , which is unhelpful . digit  you have an advantage now that it has happened once . next time you go stay with these friends , you can say ' remembering what happened last time , would it be helpful if i bring some spare water and things along ? no big deal , just though it might help keep all of our minds at rest , what with the kids and all ! ' they ' ll almost certainly take the hint and stock up on a few basic supplies if they can do so .
