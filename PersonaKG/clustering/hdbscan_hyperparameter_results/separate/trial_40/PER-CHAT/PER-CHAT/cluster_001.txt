1. okay , you are a part of a rare few that does not connect those , my bad . but what do you say to the educated brexiters that had their reasons for leaving ? usually saying that they are ignorant or stupid is simply just rejecting their opinion and saying your own is superior

2. haha just fucking with you buddy . couldn ' t help myself . my advice , ignore the haters , there will be plenty of people that agree and disagree with you . people are going to troll regardless of opinion .

3. i know it ' s someone else since you replied with decency . just find it comical how my own view and something that should affect no one still offends people . it ' s a pathetic culture we have going on .

4. you are contradicting your own words boy . i would tag you as an arrogant asshole over everyone else over here . i  m done , have a nice day .
   (ID: abffa241a0eb33d4cf220980872adc9a148514b4)

5. oh i should have checked your user history before i engaged in conversation . i  m not going to bother to continue , you can do your own research . i hope you don  t let your hate consume your life , it  s got to be a shitty way to live .

6. it  s the internet my dude , you aren  t going to change the minds of people who think they  re right . all you can do is flawlessly which is an unfortunate aspect of talking to people on the internet present your counter argument and hope some people are willing to look at things objectively . maybe you  ll convince one person . just present your sources and hope for the best . the biggest thing is to never take the arrows too seriously , it  ll just make you angry because reddit has a mob mentality against anything contrary to the accepted opinion of the day .

7. watch your language . that you can ' t answer my basic questions without filth and hate coming from your mouth speaks a lot about you .
   (ID: 25b8235c988cb167d94968ee893707e9c358cde8)

8. yeah , it ' s a real problem . everyday i hear the same thing , " we should segregate blacks because they are naturally more violant " , and " if you really think about it hitler wasn ' t even a bad person " every fucking day , why can ' t we be a better nation like china that cares about all of it ' s citizens .  s

9. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .

10. i sorta assumed reddit was a place for giving our opinions on situations , didn  t realize my nonliberal views were gonna offend you so much .
   (ID: 8e526eeef1df2fdf1b086c88d0eaaade44307b6c)

11. you still aren ' t getting it , are you ? the reason the main guy said he wasn ' t gay wasn ' t to defend himself , it was to reassure the lady that he is okay that she used to be a man and that he cares about more than that . the reason i ' m tiptoeing with my words is that the sub we are currently on has a rule not to harass and be rude . if we were on any other sub , i wouldn ' t care who got offended because its my statement that i get to make . being just because she is male doesn ' t mean that she is a man . a hetero relationship , to me at least , is between a man and a woman . the woman in this cause just happened to be a former male . i agree facts won ' t , and will never , care about my , or anyone for that matter , feelings . what i disagree with is that you think male  female are synonyms for man  woman respectively , but they ' re not . one is an adjective about sex and the other is a noun about gender .

12. are you against lying ? would you lie to save someone ' s life ? are you against murder ? do you accept that perhaps hitler should have been killed prior to his inauguration ? etc . contradiction is a completely regular aspect of human existence , embrace it or go insane i think . the implication of your comment would be to throw all morals and ethics out the window . i assume that ' s not your actual position , despite it being what you said .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

13. i ' m glad you refinined your point . this however does not eliminate your obvious bias . i ' m sorry that you think presenting a concise argument equates to shitting on people . seems to me you are angry and i have no idea why you would be , unless you really don ' t like your ideas challenged .

14. no one is actually as stupid as you ' re pretending to be , or at least i hope not . your repeated claims are so painfully obviously overcompensating for a small pecker and a weak , cowardly sort of personality . no one is more a ' keyboard cowboy pussy ' than you , any you know that as well as anyone who ' s dealt with your blatant insecurity here or on any other site , let alone in real life . you know what sort of man calls others homosexuals as often as you do ? a man who knows he ' s a homosexual but fears others will find out . you know what sort of man repeatedly threatens to beat others online ? a weak , pathetic coward . and what of those who pronounce themselves highly intelligent ? you may have guessed this , but i ' ll spell it out just in case  it invariably means you ' re as thick as a plank . you are the poster child for something called the dunning  kruger effect . so outrageously stupid that you are unable to even comprehend your blatant idiocy . everyone knows you ' re a moron but you . however , all of us , including you , know what a cowardly , dickless little wuss you are . you ' ve made that extremely clear .
   (ID: 228e4bc3f39aec9ef98403004cf1a66070777182)

15. and you ' re the type of person who thinks so highly of themselves they can ' t even understand a simple joke . get your head out of your ass .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

16. ok , so the post in question was  what evidence is there that male privilege exists ? i am in no way saying we should put out a bad product . but i am saying that none of you or i are biologists and really don ' t know how hard it is . regardless the fact that they didn ' t start until later is bad . how is that so hard to get . i ' m literally not bashing . why are you even defending it ? it ' s not your fault or anyone ' s here . is it that bad to get the word out ?
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

17. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

18. what the hell are you even talking about ? i  outed myself  ? my comment about democrats was part of a response to someone maybe you , i can  t be bothered to go back and verify user names saying something like  spotted the trumptard  to me . there were other comments between those , but that  s the main premise . is the main point of your comment to basically say  hey , twist  digit is a republican !  ? because if that  s the case , you  re wrong . my original comment was to voice my opinion that kaepernick isn  t talented enough to ignore the media circus he brings with him . why you  re making it out to be more than that is fucking beyond me . also , i don  t know why you think i  m going to delete any of this . i stand by everything i said , kaepernick isn  t a great quarterback and he isn  t worth the media circus .

19. how do you know that you are coming at me without facts
   (ID: 23df46bdba3eb265d08b02c9ec5f365cf45ae5fd)

20. why ask a question if you ' re going to incorrectly assume the answer ? i know you were trying to be sarcastic , but it just comes off as smug . i ' m sure you could convince me and others of your argument if you actually tried , but that doesn ' t seem to be your goal here . if you do want to engage in meaningful discussion , i ' m all ears .
