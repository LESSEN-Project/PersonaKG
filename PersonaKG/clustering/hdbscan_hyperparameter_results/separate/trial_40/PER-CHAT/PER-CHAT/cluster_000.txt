1. the short answer is , get in and be the doer , not the done to . if he ' s wishy washy , unless you ' re in super deep , consider the fact that you are the age you are and the people you spend time with rub off on and affect you with you wish them to or not . pull back , give him some space and give yourself some space to evaluate what you want from a relationship . it sounds to me like you want a lack of games and a proper commitment of " we are together and we love one another , so let ' s make this work " it doesn ' t sound like that ' s the case .

2. you should never give in to he demands of someone who asks you to choose your friends over him . i ' m sorry , but that is controlling , insecure behavior . you might " love " this guy but he ' s insecure and feels threatened by anyone who he doesn ' t directly control or have any influence over . think about that . do you really want to be with someone like that ? do you really love him that much ? what if this were your parents or your family who he objects to ? you seem like a nice person and if i were you i wouldn ' t give in to such egregious demands for anyone . you can do better . i hope that you do .

3. nta . as a lesbian and as a human being with good communication in a good relationship , i see no issue with what you did . your other doesnt trust you and is very insecure . i ' d talk to her and if it didnt resolve , i ' d get a new girlfriend that trusts me enough to not cheat .

4. stay strong and don  t break . you  ll be better off without her . kicking this will be like kicking a drug . you  ll be smacked with the urge out of no where . but trust me , you don  t want a relationship with someone who doesn  t want to be with you . no one wins . you got this .
   (ID: ba2b62efe335afb5002057a08f40c489849fc6cf)

5. digit you don  t have to meet him if you don  t want to . lots of people never really get closure , and that sucks , but really what is the goal here anyways ? you could easily exchange longer messages over email or something and give him closure that way . digit why are you so concerned about the image he has of you ? are you hoping that something will be rekindled ? otherwise i feel shattering that image that he has of you will probably just help him move on and you won  t have to hear from the ex again . digit even if you do meet up , you don  t actually have to reveal any information about yourself that you don  t want to . just keep it vague . there  s nothing wrong with just broadly answering  i  m taking out some time to figure out my life , i  ve grown out of x interest  etc . if the subject of what you  re doing these days comes up .

6. you ' re definitely not going to keep a girl for long if your attitude is " when can i expect a girl to show up and be my girlfriend , like literally which day . it ' s not an entitlement that you have a right to . my favorite girlfriends were ones i met when i wasn ' t looking . the harder you try the more it doesn ' t work . even if you do get one that way , your worries about holding on to her are going to push her away anyway .

7. i can ' t tell you how long it will last , but i can tell you that most likely you will not get burned like that again because you won ' t love unconditionally like that again . at least i didn ' t . it is actually kind of refreshing to know that i am now the one that is emotionally in control of my relationships now .

8. well the good news is that you don ' t have to have sex with anyone with whom you don ' t want to . also , stop listening to your family and so called friends who tell you that you ' re unattractive . that ' s just ridiculous and you know better . meet people in real life which is what you prefer anyway . i do too and go ahead and be picky ! it ' s your life  your body and your choice ! one thing though is that there are plenty of people who are attracted to you . whether they admit it or not that ' s another thing but it ' s true . your friends are your allies . trust them but also trust yourself . there is someone out there for everyone . you must believe that .

9. honestly man , i ' d let it pass . my reasons  she might have different ones and a different answer college is like a completely different world than high school . the social dynamics are different , the education is different , teachers , environment , it ' s all different . if your significant other is in high school still , it would almost seem like too big of a gap to span or for you to be able to relate to . you ' re instantly jumping into long distance relationship territory , you said ? that shit ' s hard . you and the other person really have to be prepared for that one . even then , a lot of times , it ' s not worth it . even when you graduate , are you going to go to the same college as her ? my advice to you  donny choose your future around a girl . especially while you ' re young , developing yourself should come first . if you don ' t go to the same one , then chances are it ' s going to be long distance for the next several years . i don ' t recommend that . when high school ends , you ' re going to grow apart form most of your peers . it ' s just the way it goes . your and her future may be going separate ways . i ' d still talk to her anyways . who knows ? maybe you ' ll find that it is worth pursuing .

10. i experience this even now . i think it ' s fine to think every now and then about your situation . it would be impossible to never think about it , but don ' t stay focused on it for a lengthy period , it ' s unhealthy . when i had a job in retail i caught the train home every night . friday and saturday nights were almost unbearable . watching groups of people your age socialize and have fun hurt bad because it would remind me how i ' ll never be able to experience it for myself . you can still find some people to hang around with , maybe from work or education . but i think we should agree that looking forward is the best thing to do

11. you did the right thing for you . your ex sounds immature and there is a good chance he has cheated plenty himself and that ' s why he is so nonchalant about it . his friend is the one who did something wrong . it isn ' t on you to keep his secrets . if you were in that situation you would want to be told , i ' m sure . let him buy you a ticket home . call your people and let them know you are coming back . this just saved you from a miserable life with a selfish jerk .
   (ID: a9b07d3f94647dffebe730771c20ee3ca1af7ec4)

12. i ' ll tell you what saved me . sure meds help but they aren ' t a fix all end all problems . i was still in a very negative thinking pattern but mindfulness saved my life . mindfulness look up eckhart tolle in the power of now . my ocd therapist uses this technique on those both medicated and unmedicated individuals . having great success with numerous clients i just have to let you know . its about being in the present moment . acknowledging feelings and thoughts but no trying to make them go away or suppress them . i haven ' t had a panic attack in digit  weeks ! it works , trust me . it may take a while but i promise you its very much worth it . it saved my life .

13. tell her " i ' m cancelling the trip  i need some time to myself " , and then go somewhere by yourself . there would be nothing untrue or dishonest about this  you do need to get away by yourself and think things through . if your friend asks why , say you will discuss it when you get back .

14. my boyfriend ' s brother committed suicide a few days after i viewed the half of my cat that wasn ' t eaten by coyotes . immediately after finding out , he fell to the floor , screamed , and bashed his head into the wall until i got between him and the wall . friends took us out to drink and while a few of them were in the bathroom , he told me that he would kill my cat a thousand times over to bring his brother back . later he apologized , but ever since that moment , he was changed in my eyes . before his brother died , my boyfriend was such a kind , thoughtful , giving , and wonderful person . he doesn ' t sound like it with what i ' ve just described , but he really was . i believed that i was the luckiest girl in the world . he didn ' t want me to go to the funeral , but instead host thanksgiving for his friends . many people at the funeral asked where i was . over the next few months , i did everything that he asked . as time went on , he interacted with me less and we fought more . we live together and it ' s now become common that we go a whole day without ever touching . watching the man that i love suffer on a daily basis breaks me . i ' m devastated about what our relationship has devolved into , and i feel terrible that what he ' s experiencing is likely much worse , yet i still complain . i hate that i get angry so often now , but it ' s because i feel cheated and i ' m not sure where to go from here .

15. i have been in a similar situation . you just got paroled my friend . look at it this way . you can be happy now . that relationship ? that was never going to happen and your attachment was just going to make you more miserable as time went on . now you finally have the opportunity to find someone who will make you happy . you  re like truman burbank stepping out of the studio and into the real world .

16. oh , honey . sending hugs . can you ring a friend for a chat ? you need to speak to someone who knows your worth . i hope it gets better or , if not , you find what you need . good luck .

17. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

18. i understand . i feel ya . depression is certainly not a dealbreaker for me , since i have it . it  s just that i  m constantly trying to better myself and get outside my mental filing cabinet of toxic thoughts . i try to be optimistic towards new beginnings with men , but the ones i meet are just bathing in their own sadness . even though i  m depressed , i know i  m lucky . i don  t think you should feel guilty for being sad , what do they say  you have to go through it to get past it ? something like that .

19. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him

20. hon , you need to think about yourself here . i know that can be hard , especially if you ' re a giver by nature , but it ' s true . if you don ' t feel safe , comfortable , and respected in your relationship , you won ' t be truly happy . and that may not seem like the end of the world now , but it will in time . eventually , bitterness and resentment can start to grow and you ' ll find yourself hating the person you once loved . if you don ' t think you can be happy dealing with his bipolar disorder , it ' s ok to move on . it ' s better that both of you find partners you can truly be fulfilled and happy with , even if it means going through some pain first .
