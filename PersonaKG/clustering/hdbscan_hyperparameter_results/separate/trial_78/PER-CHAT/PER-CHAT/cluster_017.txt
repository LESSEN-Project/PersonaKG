5. i guess my solution is that when a couple feels like they ' re ready for a child , they apply to the government and they get one . they could also have their own kids , and if they felt like they had a kid but couldn ' t take care of it , they give it away to the government as well .

8. lgbt doesn ' t have my best interests considered . any group has potential to become a hivemind , so i ' d like to avoid that as well . asexuals seem like they should go their own way , but many feel they belong with the other minorities .

10. something that relates to a talent or a goal of theirs , especially if it ' s a little bit beyond them . for example , if they like drawing , get them some really nice pens or paper , so they feel both validated in their craft but also inspired to do more .
