1. oh ok the term for that is " genericized trademarks " like how everyone calls an adhesive bandage a band aid , or in this case people calling all sodas " coke .
   (ID: fe6b1b66071dc00d37ec62082f207f9acbbd0642)

2. my biggest fear in life is that my future child will turn out like one of these people .
   (ID: 7e02a4261574d15ddacbade93c3caecae6a33fa7)

3. obviously , this argument doesn ' t hold and it  s simply a case of people being irked that non  whites are finally being represented in a larger way . i surely hope you aren ' t assuming that just because somebody is unhappy with one specific historically  incorrect aspect that they do not care about the others . just because somebody isn ' t actively advocating against every historical inaccuracy at any given point doesn ' t mean they ' re using it as a front to deny non  white involvement  most people do acknowledge the participation of smaller groups in the war , but simply find the representation to be statistically inaccurate . i would ask these individuals what they consider of other historical inaccuracies in the game before framing them with what is implied to be a racist undertone .

5. my reason to play the game is because i have fun doing so . challenges are only going to cause people to ask for rewards for those challenges .
   (ID: 7ee28e75f6892a783098b002e4b064fa768322bc)

6. i hate that there are so many unknowable variables in this game , be it stuff like this , strong gamesense , or even pure luck but people always assume cheating first
   (ID: b13c661d25562198666588e5e66ab35a26f1c5f2)

7. i like how the actual meme got upvoted but when people try to enforce it it gets downvoted
   (ID: 89a0689162d7d341f5389b93a7b5fc391663c68d)

8. people ? i despise the media for doing it .
   (ID: b70c0c020fa60fd16329a7c04f4d71a7514815c1)

9. exactly what i thought when i found this . if it were that tasteless to let non  asians wear traditional asian hats , why stock them in your store for non  asian people to buy ?
   (ID: 6cb8904cf2faf74f712ddb1c620007fe43bf46df)

   (ID: 2608313794dc26cc5adf438bd6602e11da2cd151)

13. men are just mad that they  re being asked to be better people . if the ad doesn  t apply to you , there  s no reason to get mad at it . if you  re getting angry at it , you  re probably a part of the population gillette has asked to be better .
   (ID: 12803a9aad224d0537b68ab83a6cdc6a45d3160f)

14. hmm . that  s funny . i thought it was the transphobic people who respected emotions over scientific research and proven fact , how strange .
   (ID: 9d6763f3caa1ca2559f1a3c525c70ffea81a61c2)

15. what ya mean jk , that  s probably exactly the case . two cheaters , do you guys not work in a place with a decent amount of people ? people cheating with each other everywhere
   (ID: 882504fd18f4b9c4e5c3e7cc63572027f0f40f4e)

16. blood diamond . i had no idea that was going on in the world until i saw that movie . truly saddening and disturbing to see how persecuted those innocent people were over a rock . now anytime i see a diamond in a store window i wonder if it  s a conflict diamond .

17. how about you act like the biggest fool and you aren ' t even together and you already made her cry and yet she chats with you and sometimes meets you , while normally people who be so far gone you would probably have a restraining order .
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

18. more like there are too many fucktards on twitter who are dumb enough to fall for 4chan trickery . do people not use snopes any more ?
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

19. though this particular instance of your feeling is about harry potter , the deeper seeded feeling seems like a lack of self worth . do you find other symptoms of this ? do you sometimes take non critical comments about you critically ? or feel attacked by other people  s comments or perceptions of you ?
   (ID: f14ea91df683dc236b3ffe5956871b69581e71d3)

20. people like to stay where they are i see it as a lack of self  respect if what they ' re doing is harming their quality of life .   x200b
