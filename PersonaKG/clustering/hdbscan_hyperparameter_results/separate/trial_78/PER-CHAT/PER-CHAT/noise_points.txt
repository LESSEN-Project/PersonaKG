1. the is is a good answer . the words really just very broadly define what they do . when it comes to implementing these things , it  s a huge variety that  s hard to really categorize .

2. you stopped your meth fueled drunken satanic orgy ! bcuz that all that ' ' worldlies ' do with all their spare time  to assist a family member ? daft indeed ! as an anti  elder , i have to say , you are being a terrible , terrible apostate . all kidding aside , that shows your unconditional love , and proves the gb ' s lies about us . well done .

5. well , first of all , sounds like you ' ve got a great community right there . but that ' s still the minority . i lived in an area heavily dominated by another team and a whole lot of spoofers . my experience was generally twice a week i managed to squeeze myself in to the bottom rung of a gym and collect digit gold , and based on the people i talked to at raids this was pretty common . i think there ' s a higher concentration of people on silph that were unhappy , but most players were pretty satisfied .

6. i drew this in about an hour . i drew a background as well , but didn  t shade it in or bold the lines because i didn  t know if i would even like the finished product . what do you think of it so far ?

11. i had stitchfix for a few months . i have a short torso and long legs , so some of the proportions didn ' t really work out for me . my stylist rotated every month even if i requested the same one . i kept a few cute pieces , but i decided after a few months that i prefer to pick things out i know i ' ll love !

16. sounds like a rough situation , if s is really obsessed i guess not doing anything don  t help , so you got to take action . i would suggest telling s you don  t like her , and hope for the best .

20. yes . live in the bible belt , so . " abstinence , abstinence , abstinence ! just abstain and you won ' t have to worry about getting knocked upknocking someone up or stds ! what ' s an std , you ask ? you don ' t need to worry about that , just abstain ! " our school had like digit pregnant girls my senior year . god forbid you tell kids about condoms and birth control . so where did we get our information ? from misinformed teenagers older than us , or from the internet . i think a lot of that content fucked me up and gave me unrealistic expectations of what sex could and should be . i ' m still unlearning a lot of it , but it would have been really nice to not have to go to those sources for wrong information in the first place .
