7. do you have proof of such a war looming ? again though , you have to have a reason for starting a war , can ' t just declare war because you think someone might attack you at some possible point in a possible future .
   (ID: 1ef80f0cd1a51487ac416f9fabc71571cf7add26)

8. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .

14. they think that being different and being superior are the same thing . " i listen to music less well known than you therefore you ' re a pleb that just does what everyone else does "
   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

15. i ' m actually still just on the side of liking it , but it ' s getting tougher . gaping plot holes , uninteresting storylines , painful characters , terrible dialogue , such poor consistency of any in  universe tech that i have to call most of the sci  fi elements one big continuity error . and that ' s not limited to the newer films . just started watching the original trilogy after tlj , and think i have to accept they ' re just sci  fi films for kids . i think they have some really great core concepts to work with , but then the actual stories that are told in the setting get ruined by the issues above .
   (ID: 1b160a23109a802786ef06d0b2abff0841f4eb37)

16. ok after your first post and then this i think we all need a full body shot . you ' re just wonderful .

17. damn , i guess i ' d never thought about that side of things . do you think that the subreddits that took their place are poor imitations , or maybe that the old community forums just relocated ? disclaimer  i wasn ' t never involved in any community forums before reddit so it ' s a genuine question
   (ID: f114f40c03e5812464be61882b264a0abe2a545e)

18. i remember there was a video of a guy raping a person he just murdered . been so long since i saw it but i think the dude had schizophrenia and the dude might have been asian . gloomy world sometimes .
   (ID: cae6d1fb1a818280e66de4a71148560d2d217d70)

19. i think it ' s best to avoid eating the peel in the future . just a heads up winking  faceraised  back  of  hand
   (ID: f196a2237599ccbc38d8a87d7979cf398c4db6d5)

20. if it makes you or them uncomfortable there ' s nothing wrong with it , but if it ' s more of a " i think it bugs them " you should just ask if it does then go from there .
