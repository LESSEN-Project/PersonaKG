17. either way . in my experience , if you broke up with someone for anything other than just " not feeling the spark " friendships are strained at best . one of you always has feelings for the one who did the dumping , there ' s always that twinge of jealousy and bitterness when that person dates someone else . it ' s toxic . in the rare instance where it was a mutal break up , ok . but other than that , it ' s usually asking for trouble .
