1. is there anything i could do or say to her that would make it easier without it being too weird . we have only gone out once and i feel like asking her how she feels about me leaving would be too soon right now . like i should try and take her out again and see how it goes ?

2. hon , you need to think about yourself here . i know that can be hard , especially if you ' re a giver by nature , but it ' s true . if you don ' t feel safe , comfortable , and respected in your relationship , you won ' t be truly happy . and that may not seem like the end of the world now , but it will in time . eventually , bitterness and resentment can start to grow and you ' ll find yourself hating the person you once loved . if you don ' t think you can be happy dealing with his bipolar disorder , it ' s ok to move on . it ' s better that both of you find partners you can truly be fulfilled and happy with , even if it means going through some pain first .

3. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .

4. just do something , it doesn ' t have to be much , but it has to be an act of self  care . it ' ll help .

5. you have to remember as a child those pets are one of the few friends they have at home . i  d try breaking the news as soon as you can so she can at least try to understand . just tell her your situation and what you had to do .

6. i understand . i feel ya . depression is certainly not a dealbreaker for me , since i have it . it  s just that i  m constantly trying to better myself and get outside my mental filing cabinet of toxic thoughts . i try to be optimistic towards new beginnings with men , but the ones i meet are just bathing in their own sadness . even though i  m depressed , i know i  m lucky . i don  t think you should feel guilty for being sad , what do they say  you have to go through it to get past it ? something like that .

7. sounds to me like you ' ve been screwed over a lot and are making the best of your situation . sure , the person you live with is your mom but you ' re paying your share . you ' ve got a roommate you just happen to be related to . you ' re doing what you have to do to take care of your kid , no shame in it .

8. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .

9. she  s taking my advice and basically just dropping subtle hints to see if she is bi or gay . asking her outright could go multiple ways and , like you , doesn  t wanna risk her friendship but is contemplating if it  s worth the risk since if she is bi or gay they might end up in a relationship . so it  s a difficult scenario . see what kinda friends she hangs out with since gays tend to congregate in my experience and find out what her previous relationships were like if she  s had any . so far it  s going pretty well and hannah is pretty sure she  s bi but still needs to find out more before she moves forward with it . oh yeah i actually had a situation similar to that with my partner , neither of us knew if the other was gay or straight or not . i  m pan so and i  ve dated girls and guys in the past , they  ve dated only one girl and regretted the relationship . after i found out they were pan too because i noticed a lot of their friends were gay , they had an even amount of girl to guy friends , they never denied being gay , etc so i asked them out and apparently they liked me for months on end . now we  re in an almost three year relationship . i hope all goes well for you smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

10. bad break up ? if so you got to let it go . if not , then go outside and explore somewhere where people are accepting , like a sports bar or social clubs or something where you can add to peoples conversations
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

11. tale a day . sit down and talk . spend all the time finding something easy to talk about . don  t let her leave . if she gets mad tell her why , explain very clearly why you  re sitting her down and just talking all day . let her know that you are just worried . this isn  t her problem alone , it  s very much about both of you and you need to make her understand that the main reason you get in a relationship is to help each other and be happy . take all the time you can without hurting your own mental health and spend it with her . i hope you and your so will get past this and go forward even happier than ever .

12. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .

13. well you ' re just going to have to get over your fear of her having a relationship with someone else . cause it will happen . same thing will happen for you too . it ' s not the end of the world . how many girlfriend ' s have you had ? i ' m assuming more than just her because you used the phrase " most recent girlfriend . " most relationships don ' t last , no matter if they ' re romantic ones or not , and i don ' t think they ' re supposed to . you were with this girl for digit days , that ' s nothing . you ' ll find someone else , or you ' ll spend the rest of your life debilitated by your fear of something that you have no control over . i ' m willing to bet that won ' t happen . keep your chin up man .

14. what you ' re telling me sounds like he doesn ' t care and it makes you feel bad , so leave him . you deserve to be cared about . don ' t let anyone tell you what you care about isn ' t enough .

15. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .

16. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .

17. either accept it or you may have to see if you can switch rooms if you feel that you can ' t . calling him out on it will make you look like a massive dick and make everyone uncomfortable , seriously there isn ' t anything wrong with it and it ' s just one part of him  other than that he ' s probably a great guy .
   (ID: 1ab4a61fa2bafda0a2f05eb20a92c419c1c93284)

18. you ' re not a bum ! the fact that you came here to post this means you still have hope ! honestly , i was feeling down like you too , but then i stumbled upon guide to purposeful success and it really helped me find a purpose in life , which i am pursuing every single day now , and it ' s been great ! hopefully it can help you too .
   (ID: eca32d278abf2524af02edbb3cc3041ed8b0b880)

19. move out . do you know how many people have problems like this because they live together first ? he has no incentive to marry you . you ' re probably sleeping together and living exactly like you ' re married . so either you need to take all those privileges and perks away to motivate him or let go of being sensitive . not trying to be harsh . but you got yourself in a pickle here . honestly ask yourself if you ' re in his shoes , why should you go through the risk and trouble of getting married when you can have what you want ? why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free ? old saying

20. i  ve been in the same kind of situation , a couple of times . you did the right thing ignore him for a few weeks or even months until you feel like he  s learned from it . then unblock him and message him
