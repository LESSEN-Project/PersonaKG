SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 102

1. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .

2. it ' s not my responsibility to relieve you of your ignorance . if you want to say things that are wrong , feel free .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

3. anti  intellectualism is great to see on what is meant to be a university community . big words , small words , what ' s the difference ? i ' m not posturing . i use the terms that i think best express my ideas . i didn ' t present a counter  argument because isanybodylisten didn ' t present any points that could be refuted in a meaningful way . it was very much , " i see you as being    " . i could say that i ' m not those things , but those are equally weak statements . in what class could you get away with making an assertion without justification ? none . if you ' re comfortable with drawing all of your conclusions about someone from the way they conduct themselves on reddit , maybe you ' re pretentious .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

4. overreact much ? your response highlights what is wrong with what passes for " debate " these days . no matter what point you make , no matter how unbiased you try to be as a person , there ' s always somebody there getting off on making their favorite point by framing your words to mean something completely unrelated to what you meant .

5. i ' m confused on your stance on racism . in another comment you claim you were denied into a committee of sorts based on you being white . so you understand what racism is . yet you make a statement like only asians and jews are good at math . sounds to me like you ' re delusional . a stereotype is formed from ignorance and ignorance comes from not understanding or not wanting to understand  which fuels racism . so unless there was a misunderstanding , i think you and i have different definitions of what racism actually is .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

6. why ask a question if you ' re going to incorrectly assume the answer ? i know you were trying to be sarcastic , but it just comes off as smug . i ' m sure you could convince me and others of your argument if you actually tried , but that doesn ' t seem to be your goal here . if you do want to engage in meaningful discussion , i ' m all ears .
   (ID: f3f34b7b903c833de2625265da4585abdc86ab7c)

7. why does it matter how i respond to you ? your argument is invalid .
   (ID: 4126a6a9d5a548a6bed5e0c4992792b1c10f2b92)

8. never said i ' d stop replying to you for good , i made it clear i was talking about the specific post i said it in . it really wasn ' t a struggle , just search dbd on f13 sub . doesn ' t matter when it happened . it happened and you were proven wrong and can ' t handle that fact . i made a reddit account a month ago , yeah . not sure why new accounts have to be considered troll but . cool ? if anything , just proves my point that you ' re always paranoid . i mean i don ' t reply to nothing , but like everything else mentioned , keep living in denial , i guess .
   (ID: 8bc3c38873da8df8d450deb17fd3c4a602037c65)

9. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

10. wait . i never which side someone is on . please tell me if you are stupid or have common sense ?
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

11. . and you should , rightly , let reddit speak for an entire group of people , right ? you , as an american , aren ' t too bright .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

12. hey i am just going by the reports of the " journalist " . i wasn ' t the one who just called them out for being racist without cause . i am saying they are racist because that ' s the report . just like this article . if someone can be a racist just because a journalist writes a story then i can call them a racist because another journalist wrote a different story . you ' re mad because i believe another article , that you don ' t . yet you are the one trying to prove me wrong for some reason and when that doesn ' t work you start saying i have mental disorders and call me names . do you see me calling you names or saying you have a mental disorder ? the things you say , say more about you , than me .
   (ID: eb44ac8abd83c3fd1451fb507a8dac0c4f6e39e2)

13. read  watch the fucking news . you sound like a total fucking idiot when you don ' t know what the fuck is going on around you and you make so many fucking stupid political statements when you don ' t fucking know what ' s fucking happening . don ' t correct me on something that you don ' t have a fucking clue about . fucking damnit .
   (ID: dadc9911849239b0d3b98ea480d7a3be43208f42)

14. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

15. say what you will , but your homophobic posts speak for themselves . check your priveledge
   (ID: 0847b0a0c2f6c5c595a8cbe2207c0959b37df0c4)

16. okay , we get it . you want to change the subject now that you ' ve been called out .
   (ID: 8bc3c38873da8df8d450deb17fd3c4a602037c65)

17. it  s the internet my dude , you aren  t going to change the minds of people who think they  re right . all you can do is flawlessly which is an unfortunate aspect of talking to people on the internet present your counter argument and hope some people are willing to look at things objectively . maybe you  ll convince one person . just present your sources and hope for the best . the biggest thing is to never take the arrows too seriously , it  ll just make you angry because reddit has a mob mentality against anything contrary to the accepted opinion of the day .
   (ID: 8b20a772d1697ecc1b19f9f6451e7346e8b98987)

18. i guess i did make some assumptions . i apologise . thanks for explaining . like i said , everyone is entitled to an opinion . thanks for sharing yours
   (ID: bb403667518ffc82f0508e3aee8741ea63cec050)

19. yes yes your right i ' m wrong . have a nice day .
   (ID: dceaf5128ce079240dc5048df74d704163edc3a5)

20. but the left has a ' my way or the highway ' mentality do you not even realize how biased you just were ?
