2. thank you ! writting nice things is one of the things that keep me going . i know you will . life has a strange way of always changing the staus quo . if you are happy , that ' s gonna change soon . if you are sad , that too is gonna change sooner or later . you just have to pretend it will be sooner rather than later .
