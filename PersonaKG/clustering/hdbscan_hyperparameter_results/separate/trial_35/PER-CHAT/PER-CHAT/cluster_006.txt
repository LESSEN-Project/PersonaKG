19. how does denouncing something mean you are associated with it ? saying you condemn these people and their actions isn ' t a bad thing ?
   (ID: 23d8dae7213e264b515a84a02f18e02f44dbe192)

20. awareness is half the battle , imo . humanizing the victims and putting a face on the douchebag responsible for these atrocities is a big deal . furthermore , posts like op ' s just encourage the the people who currently don ' t give a shit to continue to not give a shit . that ' s not how you fix problems . you fix problems by convincing those people that they should care . when you convince a lot of people that they should care , then there is the chance that some of those people might actually choose to help in some meaningful way .
