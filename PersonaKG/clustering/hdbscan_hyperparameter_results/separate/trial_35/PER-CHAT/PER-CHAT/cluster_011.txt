9. ok . i ' m genuinely curious . what possible course of action could you have done differently , to " save me " from the " burning world " as you put it . that required me beliveing in you ? what possible new resource do you gain from my belief in your " prediction " that will stop the world from burning ? or at least save me from this fiery premonition of doom ? p . s . i don ' t think listened and end is a good rhyme , and it maybe would have helped your case more if you rhymed all your " song ' s " verse .

15. wait , starbucks cups weren  t recyclable already ?  wtaf ! who thought this was a good idea and why wasn  t this against some kind of law . good lord . how many wasted cups are we talking about ? what year is this anyway ? i may need a coffee and a lay down , wow .

16. i can see their point , personally what i would do is give him a conditioning stint in the ahl and let him rip it up for a bit there , get his confidence back and then call him up . right now he is not playing really well  he is also not a very good skater slow , which causes him to take penalties when he is trying to back  check .
   (ID: e1cbdeb83fa8cc2b0116602e30a66c61a37f98b8)

19. geisha house was pretty damn good to be honest . i had no idea he owned it and was shocked he did . it ' s actually , or was one of the most popular places . service , food , everything was good . it was always jammed packed so there has to be a side story of why it closed . he had to make money off of that and by money he made a shit load . he must have been a gambler .

20. what ' s good is the most fire song in my opinion
