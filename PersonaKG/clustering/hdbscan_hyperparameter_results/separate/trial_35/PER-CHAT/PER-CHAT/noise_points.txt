5. i think that some people are just not worth our time . if they dont want to get the chance to meet an amazing person that is their loss . not everyone can say they like their job so that is a very good thing to be able to have . dont let your coworkers get you down . you work hard for your money and are good at it , look forward to spending time with the people you love outside those walls even if its a phone call .

7. if there is one thing that i learned about drumming from whiplash is tempo is all that matters lmao . i ' m psyched to hear that though . i grew up on rock band and guitar hero myself and drumming was always my favorite and best instrument to play . i never had enough to get a proper kit though , and i have to imagine my roommates would find it unacceptable for me to do so . what are some trademark songs you know how to play ?

11. i see what your getting at . gauntlets are kind of out of place from the rest of jumpchain . it ' s alot harder to write about them because they ' re usually less of an open sandbox and most people don ' t actually want to write a story where you lose out on a gauntlet so tgere isn ' t much tension there . at least the benefits of body mod carry over to all of your forms .

12. i was thinking plasma bursts from the sun . it would cause the burning without the radiation . i was originally thinking it could be gamma ray bursts  but there ' d be so much radiation there ' s no way anyone would have lived . but i also find that it ' s a trick question  it doesn ' t matter . that ' s all in the past . all that matters is surviving right now .

   (ID: d72952657a3571deff985040e565d95d8206db60)

14. i don ' t think that is laughter . it is probably saying " get your friggin ' grubby man hands off my body "

15. just watching the one card and it ' s got me thinking , what do you think the optimal cage shape is for mma ? or does it not matter as long as it is the right size and there is no sharp corners ?

16. you  re right . if you look at what i said you  ll see i was trying to explain that chickens produce and expel eggs like humans , not that they were the same . obviously i didn  t do a very good job !

18. they are not quite playmates since they are pretty much ignoring each other . i am just happy i can have them in the same room and can spend more time with each of them . condescending karens are everywhere lol

19. " sifty . as a child this was the word i used to describe the uncomfortable feeling of hearing someone rubbing their hands together . that is literally nails on a chalkboard to me . it ' s also what i called the feeling of having dusty hands or feet , or rubbing flour between your hands . ex  " i need to wash my hands they feel sifty "

20. that ' s what loved ones are for . being dishonest will just make it worse on you ' re part and his , he will feel like a complete asshole even tho he asked will probably still know somethings not right , and he will feel like shit because of it , and will probably get angry . because he ' s asking for a reason , not just asking just to ask . he will ask again . i suggest you tell him . even if you keep it simple . just say you ' ve been sad . but i think he should know .
