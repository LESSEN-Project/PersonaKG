1. you aren ' t alone . at least in here . and i thought i was alone in my thoughts . you almost were talking about me . i ' ve never found anyone either . i wish i had a better answer . i ' ve been looking for years and i find no one really . i had one therapist who kept telling me my problems were mine and it ' s because i don ' t love enough . how do you love when you don ' t know what that is . other ' s have said to put others first . how do you do that when others don ' t even see you . so i feel for you in i ' ve never felt i could let go of everything except online and that ' s still behind a mask . if you need to vent , i ' ll listen . good luck my friend .

2. should i tell her ?

3. hey we can go slap cows if u want . anything is better than making a permanent decision over a temporary feeling or circumstance . i don  t know why she  s being like that but she isn  t worth this kind of negative feeling . i know it doesn  t feel like anything else can help but sometimes it  s bc we are so invested and holding on so tight but when we let go it can be a big relief . just remember that her love isn  t what defines you so whether she loves you or not , your value is unchanged . people will love you the way you deserve , it just sucks we have to wait for it sometimes .

4. i can only tell you i would have preferred for it to be done privately . maybe send him a text , invite him over and let him know that you have some pretty rough news that you would prefer to talk about face to face . then just make sure he is sitting down and explain what has happened . there ' s no real need to rush it , there ' s also no right or wrong way . there is the facts and your feelings and you have to navigate both . i don ' t know this guy from a bar of soap but general rule of thumb is that guys are pretty simple . give him time to process what you say . he will probably have questions . work through them together . at the end of the day this has happened and if you feel the right thing to do is tell him then you ' ll make it work and he can choose to either take it well and be supportive or take it badly and run through a glass door in a panic . i hope it goes well .

5. she probably doesn ' t have feelings for you , it was the drugs . that being said you still cheating on your boyfriend and that is uncool . you could keep quiet i guess , but the guilt will likely continue to eat at you . you should probably tell him the truth and not put yourself in a situation to cheat again .

6. i would recommend advice for this , but i ' ll try to help as well anyway i think you ' re just friends by convenience . you ' re on the same team , you live near each other and give each other lifts , but beyond that , he has better friends and you don ' t . i ' ve been in that situation , there ' s not much you can do except to to find other , better friends , and accept that that ' s where your relationship is at . if you ' re scared to do things around him , find other friends and don ' t value his opinion of you so highly , that way if he does judge you , who cares ? as a rule , if a friend makes you feel uncomfortable in some way when you ' re around them , get out , find a better person to spend your time with   x200b    x200b

7. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

8. thank you for your comment , you  ve made a lot of sense to me . it  s like a switch gets flipped whenever i begin to think about doing something for me . study , art , meditation , even my last therapy session i struggled to keep myself present and awake . having been in therapy for a year now , my therapist has only recently begun talking about dealing with my cptsd so i  ve got a long way to go . hopefully i can begin unpacking my terrible coping mechanisms soon because they really are disabling in so many ways .

9. i can relate , when i was dating this ome girl earlier this year id rather hang out with her than do anything else , she just made me happy . heres the thing if you hang out with them too much there eventually gets to the point where you get bored of them , lose your interest in hanging out with them . i know i know you might be saying that you wont and some people can be like that and never get bored of them but incase you do take a step back but not to far back , they ' ll think something is up when in reality you jusy want to create distance to rekindle the flame of loving their company . thats my opinion atleast
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

10. nah . you two are obviously looking for different people . you want a first date hookup and she wants something more long term . at least you were blunt and now you both know how the other feels .
   (ID: 90779ea1e5aa2ec3ed3a1fa6b99a8207c0d66d3e)

11. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them

12. yeah this is bad man . very bad . that ' s emotional cheating . it ' s legitimate cheating . you ' ve known for a while that your wife loves attention from men . this is problematic . i think the best solution is separation and possibly divorce . you said it yourself , you feel like the bond that you had with her has been broken . don ' t think twice about it because christmas is around the corner . your wife is a cheater . she requires validation from other men that aren ' t her husband . you were there every night after work for her when you were newlyweds . it ' s never good enough for her . you deserve better , op .
   (ID: 8f33db98a9fa29c8f9e44012d79de72291a29519)

13. it ' s clear you ' ve never had depression . my mind wants to do something but my body just won ' t move no matter how motivated i am . i try convicing myself to do something but subconsciously my body knows i hate my life and dont want to do it . it ' s like falling into a deep hole you can ' t climb out of without someone getting you out .
   (ID: 1921dc07cd609c210cb71a0176afa3dfa4fa3772)

14. definitely say something . call her , though . tone can be kind of difficult to determine through text and you don ' t need want to give her any more reasons to push you away even more . " hey , insert sister name . how you doing , casual chatting , blah blah blah . i need to talk to you about something . i feel insert everything you just told us . i know it ' s your wedding and you can do whatever you want , but i ' m starting to think that you don ' t even want me there . if not , that ' s fine bc you ' re kind of being a bitch and i could do without all the cross country trips . if you genuinely want me to be a part of the wedding , then act like it and maybe ease up a little bit " . feel free to modify to your liking .

15. you individuals can ' t do anything . my depression began with being ostracized . i suppose the best thing you could do is not bother me .
   (ID: fddeeaa11799939dfe96bc7fae74a22b474aaf20)

16. what do you think he  d do ? it  s it  s hurting you that much then you need to act before your emotions start consuming you . i wouldn  t take any of it personally though . some guys just like sleeping around for fun , and don  t realise how much it can hurt others . there  s millions of good guys in the world that are just around the corner . write this chapter in your life off and start a new one tomorrow .
   (ID: 0b40e1731a58e377af57361e27d4264ac065a5b8)

17. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

18. i can think you should be honest with your feelings . i say with experience and to ignore or overlook it can be more destructive than anything else . if she genuinely likes you , she ' ll come back . if it ' s just the physical stuff the friendship will fizzle out . that ' s the worst part though . fwbs ruin good friendships most of the time .
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

19. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart
   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

20. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .
