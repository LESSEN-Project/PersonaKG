5. no . but being clean taking a shower helps . ladies like it when a fella listens to what they have to say , and treats them like a friend . smiling , saying nice things , and validating their feelings really helps . something that i think that most incels fail to realize is that ladies get lonely too . they get bullied even worse them fellas do . plus , when it comes to sex , they have to worry about being seriously hurt . i mean put in the hospital with injuries hurt . if you hope to one day achieve your wildest fantasy , you will first have to learn how to treat them . not frightening them is a good 1st step . incels that i  ve talked to prescribe to ideas that are frightening to ladies .

7. not so terrible but , in shared living spaces , people drunk  high moving my cooking food off the oven so they can use it . here i am in another room chilling , waiting eagerly for my food to cook , go back out digit mins later and my food ' s been moved to an off hotplate , while some prick stands there with their food on the on hotplate . cunt , i was using that !

9. im waiting for kunimitsu and negan , and i know several pros and cons . pros are you know the most of the match up , move , what safe and what can be punish . cons are sometimes you do wrong input for example yoshi ender i always use with f3  digit but some times i mix that with miguel button input . also , having your brain expand the size of the entire roster , sometimes i found myself think of all the move i use when i fight those character , for example like if i fight yoshi , i would expect my opponent to only use what i also used but nope he use other tech so i find it difficult sometimes . sometime you you underestimate your opponent because you know most of the match up , and other than that , you can mix some move into other character for example yoshi didn ' t have savage but you think he has cause you play most of the roster . in short it can confuse you .

13. i work in product development and while i haven ' t had any moral dilemmas nearly as big as these , there are often issues to consider . what if i can design a better widget , but our factory can ' t produce it so we would have to outsource it ? consumer gets a better product , profit margin might even be higher , but we decrease internal production and hurt other employees . it is kind of funny how the phrasing of this could cause reddit to hate or love it . stifling innovation seems to clearly be a bad thing , but there is tons of hate when people hear about companies that close their factories and produce goods elsewhere . if your new product is different enough , it is possible that the current factory can ' t be modified to produce it without basically gutting the whole place . even then your workforce has no experience producing the new item , so if you want good quality right away , outsourcing the manufacturing of the new design is the only viable solution .

14. if you ' re careful , yeah you can stealth it . it took me over digit tries , but if you ' re careful with how you move to the house  the actual cooks won ' t even get shot .   edit   i thought you were serious . going on the thought process that you were serious  i was going to convince you to keep trying to stealth something that is literally unstealthable . it was out of spite , really . i had to make this edit , because reddit doesn ' t like it when people comment .

15. cannmart shouldn ' t condone those prices and just not sell their product then . i know it ' s not that simple but damn those poor patients at agro greens .

16. i honestly think it  s super sketchy whenever someone doesn  t have a profile photo . like okay ? you get to pick and choose people through their photos , but they don  t get to do the same to you ? and sometimes they even say stuff like  can  t put my photos up because of work  some other ambiguous reason  . like who the hell are you that people can  t see your face ? and if that  s the reason , you shouldn  t even be online dating . as for your guy  like how likely is it even that some criminal will be looking for him on a dating site ? social media maybe , but dating site is a damn stretch . i say leave it . he seemed to heavy with the pet names too quickly so cringy btw , especially since you  ve not even met . and i definitely wouldn  t want you to introduce him into your kids  lives . i feel like you sensed all the red flags already , but just needed some confirmation from other people . don  t get too hung up on this one guy that you  ve not even met yet  there will be other men out there that are less sketchy and more open with information about themselves .

17. i own a meat company , we sell steak chicken seafood and pork , we set up big circus tents in the parking lot of the malls , when i don ' t have enough business coming in , i go drum some up . but why does it matter what i am talking to people about , or what i am selling ? all that should matter is , is it illegal , or is it not ? i have all of my required health permits from the state of tx . but this health permit obviously is not good enough for every single incorporated city who has a city council , who can make up any kind of ordinance that they feel it ' s like making that day .

18. if you found them because you were also using the app , then you can ' t really be mad , but you should definitely talk , discuss being open , or just break up . if someone else found them and showed you , just break up .
