1. you could have said " oh yeah , cool " . instead you got defensive and downvoted me . a fucktard says what ?
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

2. that  s your opinion . and as far as i  m concerned my opinion you can believe whatever you want . we aren  t talking about beliefs we are talking about classifying science vs pseudoscience !

3. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .

4. lol only total alt  right scumbags claimed that the nazis were left wing , now you have no credibility it ' s not for you because i know you ' ll never change your fuctupmind it ' s just to get you to say something stupid so the kids will know that your philosophy is a meaningless nothing just like those who espouse it .

5. . and you should , rightly , let reddit speak for an entire group of people , right ? you , as an american , aren ' t too bright .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

6. we  re talking about australian laws and politics , so digging your heels in and pretending like we all have to bow to your laws and historical events is again , not a good argument . being egged in this manner is not considered assault here . it  s not violence . it  s silly  that  s the entire point . what is violence is hate speech . in my opinion fear mongering is too . killing digit innocent men women and children is violence . don  t get me wrong i think egging people is a fucking stupid method of protest . we not too long ago had a pm get head butted by a dude called dj funknukl . that is assault and he got charged . i don  t like that pm he  s a piece of shit but doesn  t deserve to be on the receiving end of violence . what is very different is the act , the intent , the events of causation and the parties involved .

7. cool , dude . you seem stable . yeah , so far you ' ve called me stupid , an idiot , a piece of shit , and a dick  man , all i did was post a comment , that in no way attacked you . but thanks to your anger problem , which i ' m guessing you got from your dad , you ' ve made this into a much bigger thing than it needed to be . but yes , how dare i be concerned about the seeming trend of cop  related civilian deaths in the country that i live in . so , you ' re right , i ' ll start packing for brazil right away . i was wrong to question police authority for the job they literally signed up for . so , we ' re done , right ? can we please be done ? ok ? thanks for wasting my time

8. it  s the internet my dude , you aren  t going to change the minds of people who think they  re right . all you can do is flawlessly which is an unfortunate aspect of talking to people on the internet present your counter argument and hope some people are willing to look at things objectively . maybe you  ll convince one person . just present your sources and hope for the best . the biggest thing is to never take the arrows too seriously , it  ll just make you angry because reddit has a mob mentality against anything contrary to the accepted opinion of the day .

9. thanks for proving my point . what point did i prove ?  can argue that there is good and bad practical result from the study of physics results from the study of physics atom bombs is not the same things as physics speed of light in a vacuum or weight of an elementary particle itself .  not only in the physical realm but the spiritual realm . what is a " spiritual realm " , what evidence do you have that such a " realm " exists ? where is this realm ? how do we access it ? how do we measure it ? how do we test it ? how do you determine what is and isn ' t part of the " spiritual realm ? you will have to show that such a thing exists before i can debate with you about it .  see how we don ' t agree on the basic premises of the debate ? it ' s not a disagreement , it ' s a misunderstanding , on your part .  oooh , edgy . i don ' t coddle delusions . you can piss of with your snark and get off your high horse if you want to actually talk about this stuff .  but . i can argue that religion is an evolved mechanism for time binding moral and ethical meta  narratives that has aided people in learning how to interact with each other and behave in social groups . that is not mutually exclusive from my definition .  in that way it has alleviated suffering for millions of people over thousands of years . again , not mutually exclusive from my point of view .  who is right ? i have evidence for my claims . you do not . there is no evidence for any such " supernatural realm " on which a lot of what you claim is based on , and so , i am right .  that you even refuse to see that more than one idea can be true at the same time means you have no idea what you are talking about . i never said that " more than one idea can ' t be true at the same time " , but it ' s not something i would disagree with . the earth can ' t be flat and an oblate spheroid at the same time . the sun can ' t orbit the earth , and the earth orbit the sun at the same time . fusing hydrogen atoms together can ' t produce helium and beryllium . it looks like you do not know what you are talking about when it comes to physics . i can point you to some reading material if you ' d like to learn more , but i ' m not going to give you a physics lesson here on reddit .  the real answer , for people who think instead of just blurt out declarative statements based solely on their own opinion assumed to be objective truth you condescending tone isn ' t welcome . if you ' re going to talk to me like that , you can fuck off and scream your nonsense in to the void , or go over to  flatearth where they welcome conspiracy theories .  is that the debate cannot have a winner because   the two parties do not agree on terms , like what " good " means . you . never tried to establish what " good " was . nothing in your comment talks about goodness . you talk about some spiritual realm , and then make some bogus statements about physics , which leads me to believe you are not arguing in good faith and just want to push your narrative . i ' m perfectly fine if the debate does not have a " winner . we aren ' t on stage in front of an audience , and i would venture to guess very few people will even read these comments . that your goal is to " win " and not to understand , again tells me you are arguing in bad faith , with no intention of learning anything .  we have almost no detailed records of events from digit  of the time period debated . detailed records are not the only evidence from which we can derive facts .  essentially this debate is a farce for hanging your confirmation bias on pot , meet kettle . the same applies to you , bud .

10. you also told them to stop whining . which is all you do on this sub . to those that have a different opinion .
   (ID: 8bc3c38873da8df8d450deb17fd3c4a602037c65)

11. but the left has a ' my way or the highway ' mentality do you not even realize how biased you just were ?
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

12. lol ad hominems are a sign that you ' re triggered . calm down and see it for what it is , humor . if you cannot i certainly can ' t help you . i ' m not going to respond to you after this reply you ' ll just have to stew in your misguided anger . have a great day smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

13. overreact much ? your response highlights what is wrong with what passes for " debate " these days . no matter what point you make , no matter how unbiased you try to be as a person , there ' s always somebody there getting off on making their favorite point by framing your words to mean something completely unrelated to what you meant .

14. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .

15. i think at this point your just upset that a little american boy has a different opinion then you and your trying to make me look like a dumb homophobic nazi
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

16. lol internet points wow . i never argued with self defense you completely ignored my point because it fucks you up to know you that i was right . but you maggats just want violence and hope that it turns into some wild west shit but people who  ve actually seen it know differently . work on your reading comprehension buddy .
   (ID: 54271e4114265f638c8e4c59d7a3b35b6caa55bf)

17. i  m arguing because you say stupid things and can  t accept the fact that your post is not fun , smart , or helpful . you argue like a child and need to learn that not everything you say matters . you don  t want to argue , don  t respond . your the one who posted a garbage post with moron comments . you get off reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

18. posting something that i as a muslim support doesn ' t make me a cunt . you using a generalising term clearly shows the upbringing you ' ve got . wow . shows where you stand ? oh wait . nowhere !
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

19. that ' s a very shallow assumption . also you can ' t tell me i can ' t . you ' re not even contributing any ideas related to the thread so why are you here anyway ? to put me down ? you ' re wasting your time . i got what i came for which was a little bit of light shed on a subject that i was more curious to learn about .
   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

20. why does it matter how i respond to you ? your argument is invalid .
