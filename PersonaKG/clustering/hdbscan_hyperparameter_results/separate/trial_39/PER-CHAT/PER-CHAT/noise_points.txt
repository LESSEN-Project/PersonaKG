1. alex wakes up late , like he usually does during summer break . he grabs his phone off the charger to check the time . he ' s surprised to see dozens of notifications from reddit . his post got tons of replies . he smiles , thinking he must have written a good story on writingprompts . he had written a pretty standard serial killer story . his only twist had been that the killer would target people that were already suicidal , so the cops had trouble tracking him . but these replies don ' t really make sense . i bet you did it are you a psychic bro ? or a serial killer ? smart to kill suicidal people . not so smart to post all about it on reddit . he has no idea what they ' re talking about , but knows he needs to get dressed and get the lawn mowed . he hops out of bed , brushes his teeth and gets pants and a shirt on when he hears the doorbell ring . alex runs downstairs to answer it  his parents are already at work . two tall serious men in suits are standing there . " are you alex fulworth ? " one asks . " yes . who are you ? " alex replies . " we ' re with the fbi . " he says , flashing a badge , " we need you to come answer some questions . " they sit alex in the backseat of their black suv and drive him to the local police station . in the interview room he ' s able to glean that someone really did kill some suicidal people in his town , and they think that he ' s connected . " it was just a story on reddit ! it doesn ' t mean anything ! " alex insists . " wait here , " the fbi agent grumbles . " he really doesn ' t seem to know anything , and we don ' t have any evidence other than his post , " one agent says to the other . " yeah , fine . maybe it really was a coincidence . we can let him go and warn him not to leave town . " they re  enter the room and one shouts in surprise . alex ' s head is rolled back in the chair . an agent runs to check his pulse while the other calls for an ambulance . " no pulse . get the ambulance here but he ' s dead . " the agents scratch their heads in disbelief for a moment . one suddenly pulls out his phone . " no way . " he mumbles . it is right at the top of writingprompts . the prompt had been posted for two minutes and already had a dozen upvotes . a suspect in a murder case is killed in fbi custody , leaving no clues .

2. we go through things in life that are terrible but you overcame and now you  re in a position where you can help your sister navigate through probably the same type of experience . that in itself should be encouraging to you that you probably can get through to her .

3. that  s because they  re in a different part of the world with their own war going on . they don  t have time to worry about northern gossip .

10. last  minute entry ! kellie had been feeling kind of down , but nobody at the castle had a clue why , not even the digit problem fixers emmettthe summoner , king , prism , and stan knew why .  maybe a trip to the beach will cheer her up !  sharena suggested , the others agreeing .  if anything could cheer her up , it  s emma in a swimsuit !  prism said , the others groaning at that statement . one hour later   okay kellie , you can take off your blindfold now !  alfonse said .  i can kind of understand the blindfold , you guys did say this was a surprise , but why the tissues in my nose ?  kellie questioned , taking of the blindfold and finding the answer staring her in the face . emma , in a gorgeous bikini . the tissues immediately went red .  hey kellie ! the others told me about how you were feeling and their plan ! so , is it working ?  emma asked . kellie didn  t respond . why must i never have any ideas at the worst possible times ! well i hope you enjoyed this mini story !

13. i do this a lot . i don ' t like wearing shoes that much but if you go full on barefoot people treat you a lot differently than someone with shoes on . as soon as they see you with no shoes on they automatically start pre  judging my character , i can see it in the way they stare . but if i wear socks people almost never notice , and you can get into any store most of the time , whereas barefoot people will try to kick you out .

15. why care what other people think ? as long as your both safe it really doesn  t mater sand end of the day people are going to talk whether you do good or bad . it  s your life , live it how you see fit .

16. absolutely correct , even the ncr and legion started using their own currency , why would the east coast with its abundence of water need caps back by water , its also like a digit year old currency at that point

18. man , i feel you , i prefer watching the anime too . i ' ve found out the hard way . if you search anything up about naruto , you are guaranteed to get spoilers . generally avoid discussion videos bc they dip into manga territory . this subreddit ' s rules are pretty good with spoilers , just avoid anything tagged with spoilers .
