   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

12. so , why an account dedicated to furry porn ? why would you think of that ?
   (ID: c1e8a543083ba89c9353a25d98386cffe1addefc)

13. i think you should correct your behaviour . if your first thought when something happens is " im completely faultless " and then after everyone else says you ' re the asshole you still seem to think you ' re in the right . yta taking out your anger on others and racist comments are never valid . dont kid yourself
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

14. thank you ! i ' m in a lot better of a place then i was a few days ago and now i think the storm has passed so now i can prepare for the next one

16. i once matched only happens very rarely some random chick who said she loved pokemon on her profile . so me coming up googling the best pokemon pickup line i could think of . " if i was a magikarp , id splash on you " she never responded .
   (ID: 4beccb79954eaf4ba6b69b6ac31b148b48f4f579)

17. i think the fact that this happened proves for a fact that " we " are not better than this . this subreddit isn ' t even about lol anymore , it ' s about pros and funny lol pictures . it ' s pathetic .
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

18. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

19. if that  s what you think .
   (ID: 01d4ddab8cb9e73e5e85941c592482da1b3c6bcd)

20. food with trendy buzzwords  infused , aioli , tahini , asian . update as trends continue to devolve . that and advertising in general now that i think about it
