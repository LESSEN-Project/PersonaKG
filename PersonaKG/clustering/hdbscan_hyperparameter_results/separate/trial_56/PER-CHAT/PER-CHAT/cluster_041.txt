9. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .

10. hahahahaha . no buddy . telling someone words is not a threat to them . actually committing acts is a threat to them . they have shown time and time again that they are willing to actually kill people . stop fucking defending these fucks . they ' re scum . and they deserve everything that is coming to them .

   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

15. happens all the time .
   (ID: d8681af7ff5797fb2ffcb9a4a08f377463526e2d)

16. i believe it gives you a little bit more time as you still have enough time to walk under them before your timer is up and you can log out , and they would have to pathfind to you which takes longer than someone standing beside you . although i guess you could just barrage them and run while logging , i dunno .

20. emailing would definitely be your best bet . your wording of the email i extremely important , and i  ve been told by my research mentor that a majority won  t answer you . you have to keep on emailing not spamming them , wait a few intervals of time before emailing again
