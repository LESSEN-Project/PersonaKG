3. thank them , especially with an avengers movie . they drop a hint about something that ruins the movie for me , i won ' t want to see it , and i typically don ' t sit down to watch a two hour movie without first finding out what half the plot is .

4. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .

5. i don ' t normally do this but i imagine it ' s because my stop is nearing and i don ' t want to move in , only to have to move out again shortly . it may also be for the legroom .

6. dude right ? most bees don ' t want anything to do with you along with a lot of other creepy crawlies you find and they won ' t bother you if you don ' t fuck with them . trap it in a cup and put it outside , that ' s probably where it wants to be anyways .
