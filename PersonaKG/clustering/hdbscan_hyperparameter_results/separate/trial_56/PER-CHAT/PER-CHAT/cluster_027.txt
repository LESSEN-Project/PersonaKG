7. no , it ' s quite normal to be sedated for it . you generally have to ask for them to keep you awake . it sounds like a failure of the anesthesiologist if they were unable to keep you sedated , and it ' s battery unless you told them you want to be awake plus you described it as what sounds like battery to me .

11. it ' s yours so you can do what you want . like other ladies have said , you should get it appraised , then sell it or regift it . you ' re not obligated to keep a gift , no matter who gave it to you .

12. balancedsuperpowers i like it more than godteirsuperpowers or shittysuperpowers because it provides a bit more of a dilemma i would like to go through there and kinda debate with my friends if you would want that superpower downside combo

13. in the days where everyone wants access to free information , we have plenty of sites to provide that access . sites like documenting reality , liveleak , goregrish and best gore . they help preserve the legacy of what rotten was . it ' s not some sicko fetish like reddit seems to misinterpret . we want to be reminded of how bad the world can get , so we may appreciate our own lives and those of everyone else .
