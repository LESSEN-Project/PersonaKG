   (ID: 47697a08dc01689d8119bf9bd578194eb66d157c)

10. very late to this but one thing i have realised is , don ' t tell anybody your true end date for your sentence . tell them one year later . why set yourself up for harassment and being targeted by fellow inmates who are jealous of you ?
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

11. sometimes i  m asked to judge science fairs . it  s so disappointing to see that teachers approve projects that have zero scientific merit and allow kids to waste their effort pursuing meaningless  findings .  the kids are so proud of their display and project and i  m put in the awkward position of explaining how it  s flawed . yet , if you don  t tell them , you  re no better than the adults that mislead and misinformed them .

   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

16. i ' m sorry if i was confusing in my reply . i ' m not trying to discourage anyone . i actually consume soy products daily . i was trying to convey that if you are concerned with phytoestrogens you should check with your pcp . i would also tell a meat eater the same if they are concerned with a certain aspect of thier diet .
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

17. hmm . my parents give me the same bs about not getting enough sleep too . i  d tell them about it and see if you could give them a solid argument as to why you  d like to have the ability to stay upsmiling  face  with  sunglasses

19. yes , it was incredible . particularly given that the ferrari f310 was an absolute dog even in optimum conditions . schuey had irritated the hell out of me for the previous couple of seasons my flair will probably tell you why but nobody could deny his genius after that digit season .
   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

20. she probably doesn ' t have feelings for you , it was the drugs . that being said you still cheating on your boyfriend and that is uncool . you could keep quiet i guess , but the guilt will likely continue to eat at you . you should probably tell him the truth and not put yourself in a situation to cheat again .
