2. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .

5. nta , rsvps are there for you to know how much you need to buy . ans if people are showing up with other kids and said nothing about , they shouldn ' t be surprised that they got nothing . things like this make me mad and the guests get pissed like its your fault they bought uninvited people with them .

7. no , not at all . i don  t know anything i  ve done in all my life relating to a beautiful african american woman with a child that even resembles what happened in my dream last night . the community i live in has like digit people of color out of digit , so nobody i met in real life could be subject to this either .

11. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .

12. i ' ve already decided i ' m life in prison gay . whether i ' m the top or the bottom depends on the size of my cell mate i guess . i ' m not real sure how the gay people work that out ?

13. and make youtube the platform everyone wants it to be . twitch thots will no longer be a thing . and everyone gets monetized no matter what unless you ' re extremely racist

   (ID: ccc20fb024de820a5ad1bfc4117d69d6b7c3a6c9)

15. that ' s the reason why i ' m afraid of coming out . i don ' t want people to look at me and think " it ' s that gay kid " i want people to know me by who i am . not just my preference
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

17. omg ! so everday when i go to school i have this teacher . hes my social studies teacher and lets call him mr hardy . everyday he always tells us these wierd and awful fake jokes and facts . he says things like ' the earth is flat and oh ! heres a good one . water is wet . its very annoying . hes one of those people who go on the internet and believe litterally anything .

20. this is strong logic to me . even if a gun  toting robber invades my home at night , he ' s going to shoot at me as soon as he sees my gun . i don ' t need to bet on my gun skills beating his gun skills . i ' d rather just live , you know ? i ' ll take my chances on my night stick .
