2. im not a sjw or a feminist , but being transsexual just means you changed your sex , so yes it is very much real however biologically impossible . i do agree that all that pronouns shit . its ridiculous and pathetic really . the best argument against it really is that its a violation of freedom of speech , which just proves that they only want change when it benefits them .

20. what you really want to do is find out what exactly is the source of your back pain . it could be a rib out of place , a rotated hip , twisted tailbone , bulging disc , etc . then you can start exercises to target those . if it ' s just generic sore muscles , then you would benefit from strength training to keep those muscles in shape .
