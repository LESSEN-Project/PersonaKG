1. if it ' s something you deal with daily , you just do it everyday until it seems like part of your routine and you kind of forget how horrible it seems
   (ID: 44f5ba2e2e79c07f77ae334e708119f166a6aca0)

2. ah yes , the worldwide  feared british nukes would totally scare russia into submission , it ' s not like russia has c  300s that are proven to be capable of stopping nato ' s balistic missiles or anything like that . also , if russia were to produce just one more tsar bomba  class nuke and drop it on top of the british isles , the uk is gone and so is ireland , the northern part of france , the benelux and possibly parts of nothwestern germany .

3. just off the top of my head . race is an optical illusion , bernie sanders doesnt like socialism as much as he likes attention , trump and chris christie are having an affair , and reddit is a cia project designed to gather psychological data on americans .

5. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets

11. i was raised in a community that believes men should decide everything and you as a girl should just do as told , that goes for big stuff like getting a job or small things like how much makeup you wear . thank god my parents never raise me like this , but sadly , almost every one in my community believes this . even young peppers .

12. they why has the whole logo changed at the top of box changed ? marvel bobble heads do not change like this . for example , you have the punisher funko pop . there are a few different versions . the marvel logo remains the same , but they just put the different version in in brackets by the name . ie ' the punisher thunderbolts '

13. real are worse than atleti at the moment . even on paper , atleti seems stronger . real just has many players who peaked a couple seasons back like kroos , modric , marcelo , ramos and carvajal , and have become very inconsistent now . add to that permanently inconsistent players like isco , vazquez , etc . and compare them to atleti ' s squad .
   (ID: 798fc9f22ec2a1c21f6d387916d4d56336b802ef)

14. i like my women like i like my men . no punchline . i ' m just bisexual .

16. you shouldn ' t you shouldn ' t hit anyone , but it ' s worse when you ' re obviously a lot stronger than them and it ' s not a fair fight . just like you shouldn ' t hit children as an adult .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

17. they do entire days where it ' s just constant drop offs like that , everyone else managed fine without doing that .
   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

   (ID: ecc98de1e575d7e863a2124b364b8ed586778ba5)

20. they should be set up like recipe combinations like if you guess a powerful combo it will occur with that shortcut but if it ' s not a combo it just cast one spell then the next and wastes a little mp .
