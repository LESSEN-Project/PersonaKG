1. i ' m responding to this   if you told one lie in your life is it fair to describe you as a liar ? i ' m saying , not your whole life . but if you ' ve told a lie in the past week , i would describe you as a liar . there ' s a period of time somewhere between a week and a lifetime that it should be forgiven .

2. i actually enjoy being as loud as i can when someone else is in the next stall . i even will show you a weird photo from under the stall . then i finish up and get out before you so we never meet and you are left with this experience that would truly be a once in a life time moment for you .

4. my suggestion is spend quality time with grandpa . you can earn money for the rest of your life . time with loved ones is priceless . if you are more concerned with the money then i can ' t help you .
