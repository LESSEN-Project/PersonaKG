10. i ' m a bit confused on what your asking but i ' m going to assume your asking can you use your vive without your monitor plugged into your gpu ? if that is what your asking idk about vive but if your pc is on and you use a rift it puts you into a launch screen type thing so if the vive has that then yeah you can .
