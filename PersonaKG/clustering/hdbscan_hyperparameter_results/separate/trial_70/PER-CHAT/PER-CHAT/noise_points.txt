1. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .

3. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

10. probably nothing and i ' m so sad about it . last year we found this really amazing resturaunt that we really liked but it ' s kinda far . so i had hoped to make it our thing to continue going to it every year for valentine ' s day . i also made a clay mold of my hand giving the finger and did it up all nice . it ' s like an inside joke thing and i know he would have loved it so much . so now it ' s just sitting in my room waiting to never be received by the person it was made for . minda wanna destroy it and smash it to pieces because im so mad and upset .

12. due to a motorcycle accident , i have a huge scar across my head i was wearing a helmet . i was really self conscious about it and it stopped me from interacting with others . you have to just say fuck it and put yourself out there and let the person you ' re interested in make their decision . don ' t try to cover it up and just let the world see it . there is no way you will be concerned with it digit  of the day every day and pretty soon you will come home and realize you didn ' t even think about it all day . that will be the end of it .
