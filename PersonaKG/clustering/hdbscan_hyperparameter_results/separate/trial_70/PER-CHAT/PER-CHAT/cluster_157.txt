1. a brief look and i am guessing it is real . i can ' t take any more than a brief look as my liver is already in open rebellion and i think exposure to that site would probably prompt a few more organs to join it .

2. unfortunately , this happened a few days ago , and i think i would look stupid and weird , especially if it was nothing to do with me lol

3. if your talking about thecruel , well you can look it up yourself but i think someone else starting updating freeshop or something along those lines

5. i think the idea is to hide the piercing so you look more presentable at a job interview . that said , this would probably be more questionable than the earrings .
