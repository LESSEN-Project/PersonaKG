2. in places with no rent control is it very easy to end a tenancy agreement . the landlord is being civil and giving you more than enough notice to find a place and move out , i suggest you do . there are much more underhanded stuff a landlord could do to end a tenancy agreement purposely for example , entering in your unit without your permission and guess what ? they won ' t be charged with b  e , the only thing that happen is your lease is over .
