1. it  s actually insane to me how ppl call tat waiter a creep and suggest op should report him to the restaurant . with the given info the waiter really might have just tried to be as friendly as possible  maybe just really likes kids  has grandchildren himself . he even gave her a desert for free , jesus . just to be stigmatized for being a pedophile , potentially being fired ? op , yta .

2. my eyes are bleeding . even if all these emojis are a part of the joke which just makes no sense in this case , it ' s still really painful to see

4. if you found them because you were also using the app , then you can ' t really be mad , but you should definitely talk , discuss being open , or just break up . if someone else found them and showed you , just break up .

5. nothing really . i was allowed to watch just about whatever and even if i was told not to , i would watch it anyway . i understood things a lot sooner than most kids as a result .

6. that ' s not really her goal though , is it ? if westeros was being run by a benevolent ruler , she would still be invading the continent to reclaim the iron throne . she just happens to have lucked out that someone worse than her is currently in power .

7. basic self care of hygiene , drinking water , and feeding myself . on a really bad day , just hopping in the shower and washing my face can help a lot . i also watch a lot of stand up comedy and cuddle with my dog . trying to get outside for a walk helps a lot , even if it ' s just to the mailbox and back . i also personally am anti  meds for myself , no criticism for others , but i do take vitamin d because that is the most gentle and natural antidepressant .

8. nudes shouldn ' t really be required . when you ' re in a relationship , just the thought of em ' makes you happy . counting the days till you get to see em ' again .

10. the vaping itself , actually . all i care about is a device that works . if it works , i ' m happy as a clam . nobody bothers me about vaping . in fact , i get more condescension amongst vapers than smokers . everyone else seems either really interested or just minds their own business .

11. surprisingly no alcohol was involved . the guy in the vid my classmate is just really stupid .
