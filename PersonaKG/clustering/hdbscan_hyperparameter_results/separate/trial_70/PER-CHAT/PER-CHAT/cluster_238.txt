1. i agree with this digit  . when i put my blinker on to get over , more than half the time , the person i ' m trying to get over in front of speeds up to stop me from getting over . so i just quit using them .

2. yes it sucks and having digit  learnings to complete is a bit much . they are there for a reason and if you just skip through without retaining any if the knowlage idk what kind of employee you would be . just take them one at a time .

3. this woman must have talked to my wife . she started out with a dildo just slightly larger than my cock . over the years , she ' s purchased progressively larger and larger dildos to fuck me with . she recently purchased an american bombshell with balls . it ' s about digit inches long and almost digit inches across at the widest point . the first time i saw it , i protested quite a bit . she smirked and said , " just the tip sweetie . " that was a couple months ago . last weekend she went balls deep with it .

4. wow ! that ' s a lot lol thank you . i own a aspire breeze and it says on the packaging that i should not go over 70vg or 6mg . so after reading this i could go past digit but it would just take more time to wick ?

5. digit years is a long time . probably while the cops are busy with all the dumbasses . i will just commit tax fraud and take out a loan . move to japan . never pay anything off .
