Total from this dataset: 8

1. talk to him about it . if he seems to dislike it as much as you do then i  m sure you can find a common ground of when in the hectic schedules it  s more likely to happen if either of you initiate .  dry  spells happen in every relationship at some point and it  s important to talk about it and reassure him it  s not a guilt trip rather seeking open feedback because you feel so strongly about it .

3. this i disagree with . i get that you don ' t feel safe and that sucks , but it ' s a totally different level of unsafe . men are afraid of getting robbed , sure . women are afraid of getting raped and killed . i always have mace on me , and if a man doesn ' t walk me home i carry it in my hand . edit  of course men can be too . it happens , statistically , a lot less often

6. not a lady , but i ' m pretty sure nothing is so small you can ' t feel it . it ' s just so small you get no pleasure out of it . to truly feel nothing it ' d have to be shorter than digit inch and thinner than the opening between the labia .
