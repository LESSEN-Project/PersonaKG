5. my thoughts on them , while not having seen them , is that i probably won ' t watch them . documentaries are supposed to be even  handed approaches to complex situations , but often end up being propaganda with a little egalitarian flavor . i have absolutely nothing against vegetarianism or veganism or pescatarianism or whatever , just documentaries with a mission .

6. it ' s a text message . if it was urgent , you should ' ve called , imo . we ' re all adults and we ' re busy living our lives . a text message just frankly isn ' t a priority .

7. i try to do the accents from whatever tv show i ' m watching . i ' ve just watched true blood so i ' ve been mixing in the occasional deep south phrase now and then

8. it would be nice if this girl i ' ve been trying to go out with would just message me .

9. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .

10. i ' ve heard it helps to start cleaning up something small , and then grow from that . even if it ' s just putting a fork into a drawer , it ' s important to start somewhere .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

11. i  ve been engineering for years and it still happens every now and then . you just realize it faster . this is how you learn .
