2. ditto . i tried to totally give it up this year for one year , but decided that wasn ' t for me after four or five months because i just wanted to taste different things . i like trying different drinks at sampling events , or having a free glass of wine at a company function , but i won ' t pay for it . it ' s like junk food at a party , it ' s there , it ' s free , and it ' s tasty , but not something i seek out . i don ' t really like drinking it enough to purchase it myself , and one or two drinks put me to sleep , so i don ' t see the point for me .

4. i don ' t really like doing business online , because you have to give them your bank data and stuff .
   (ID: e6c4a2b8e8c999b54ade342babc3d7b48868cc6d)

5. i ' d also recommend showing your friends some of the really entertaining old films i ' d go with rear window , charade , and tootsie having friends who are into the same stuff as you can be very helpful , just don ' t start them off with really obscure stuff because you risk turning them off to old stuff if you show them something like the seventh seal or stalker first

6. " no talking . no more talking " " you don ' t pay me enough to talk to me like that " no really , they haven ' t paid me in four weeks .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

7. it takes me a few minutes to really focus on my text book , so it helps when i ' m in a quiet place , maybe with a candle or something that calms me down . for some reason studying scares me  like i won ' t be able to comprehend the material , or i ' m reading the wrong things , so anything that helps me relax i try . for that reason i don ' t like studying in a public place . music helps too but sometimes i get distracted by the words .

8. i don ' t really see how you could die from it , unless the hair follicle somehow got infected or something . that sounds like one of those internet " facts .
