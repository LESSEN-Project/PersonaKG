2. i just recently began an unarmed playthrough on a kajiit . the unarmed damage is insane if you do things right , and it ' s lots of fun to use the wrestling move finishers . the youtube channel fudgemuppet has loads of ideas for new and interesting builds . i strongly suggest checking them out to find one that suits you .

8. i just read the other bit you posted , well in all fairness . it was his  her ? fault for not telling you straight away . you thought it was a woman , so your not exactly gay or bi or anything incase that ' s what your worried about , and it went no further than a kiss right . just count it as an unfortunate event and move on man

9. yeah . it added up . it ' s hard , and unfortunately will probably happen multiple times in the next decade or two . by all means i hope you can find the right one early on . just basing that off the " typical " run .

10. it ' s true right now . we just can ' t see it or be told what happened there .
   (ID: 2623e4996f6df0e5814dbede4fbc9c1f13de4382)

11. no it  s not a conservative belief . it  s satire from the onion . taking something that is clearly a joke and trying to use a straw man argument when no one was debating you just shows how afraid you are that conservative ideas are in the right .
