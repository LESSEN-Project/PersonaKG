1. thank you gunther  w for chiming in . i like the design concept of the coils but i kinda figured they might be " too good to be true " i ' m not sorry i tried them , but i really like the starre with their stock coils more .

2. it ' s one of those situations when you ' re really good friends with the person and you wonder if asking for the money however small the amount gets too formal in your very informal friendship .

6. they really screwed up by having little finger give sansa to the boltons . he had her eating out of the palm of his hand , and then for no good reason he married her off to an unstable family that gave him no tactical advantage whatsoever . now , it seems like the writers have no idea what to do with him other than have him lurk around making googly eyes at sansa . i really , really , really hope they have something good planned for little finger  it be a shame to just kill off such a crafty character because they have no more use for him .

10. that ' s really interesting thank you ! in my mind i always believe that businesses would seek vc but it ' s really interesting that they proactively seek you out , which kind of makes sense because if i had a shed load of cash to invest i wouldn ' t be sat around waiting for the golden goose . good luck in your business , it ' s a fantastic idea !

15. absolutely ! it ' s such a good show . watching the characters come to their own conclusions whether they be true or false is really interesting . if you like broadchurch , i recommend fortitude .
