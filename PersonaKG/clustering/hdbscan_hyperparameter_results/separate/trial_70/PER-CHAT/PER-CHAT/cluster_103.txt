2. nah , it doesn  t suck . i actually really like it . i feel like it  s something everyone can relate to , and while it is personal to you , almost all of us could probably pick up on the meaning without your explanation .

3. i feel like it depends what you use it for ? if you use it just for fun and  or as a little treat for yourself , then no . but if you ' re using it as an escape from shit like " negative emotions , " then you might . i was always told to be responsible with pot and that it ' s best not to resort to using it if i ' m having a bad day . because then the day might come where you ' re having a really bad day , and you try to find your pot , only to find that you ' re out ! you ' d have no idea how to then cope with your emotions and would be , in essence , " addicted " to it . honestly , i feel that the only exception to not using pot to deal with your emotions would be if a doctor prescribed it to you for that reason .
