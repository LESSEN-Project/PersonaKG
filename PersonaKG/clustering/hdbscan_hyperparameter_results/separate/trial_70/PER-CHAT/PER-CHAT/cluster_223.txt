5. sounds like freezing sperm would be the best option in your case . whatever you gotta do to get things done . you can always have the option to throw away your dna later on , at least i would hope . it ' s not like they can sell it to women without your permission . it may be possible to fight this in the court , but of course it would be a bit more than several hundred dollars . either way the situation is terrible .
