2. the title would probably be called , " slice of light . " the plot o my movie would probably just be the story of my life , focusing on minor issues with my life like failing a test . i would probably be narrating over different parts of the story , similar to tfs ' story of trunks . it would probably have some parts very brief , the parts that i dont remember very well , and the vivid memories would be very detailed and exaggerated . an example of this would be when my parents told me that we were bnb going to move . it would end with the present  me on winter break with my family , in the eighth grade .

3. when you are ready then talk to him about it or seek a professional counselor . it seems to me that you are not open with talking about these  obsessions  and that can start to impact your relationship or life because your not willing to open up . it  s just going to eat you up inside . he may be patient , but is this healthy for the both of you ? . probably not . anyway , i hope everything will get better soon .
