10. i wonder if it is that when we are waiting for something we measure time against itself . in other words , when one checks the time it is like a reset  like the time before doesn ' t matter . the increments get smaller , yet feel longer . on the other hand big one , little one , take your pick when we are engaged or entertained we are not paying attention to the passage of time .

   (ID: fb5e95e954b3ee83c39276138f0fa3b854970db4)

15. it ' s not about time . you just have to immerse yourself by moving to a place where the language is spoken and it will flow like a period .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

18. there  s a sub called  entitled parents  that  s full of things like this . it is difficult to have a child with special needs . you deserve to have a nice time , just like everyone else . but , you can  t ruin everyone else  s time in the process . if your child is screaming and yelling , you have to leave . you  re not being discriminated against , no one is picking on you , you are disturbing a place with a set of rules and you have to follow those rules .
   (ID: f18b19a52bbf1505af84d01563a51626d4ae363f)

19. hmm , try it like this  " i ' m not racist , but why can  t black students shut the fuck up and learn like everybody else ? " it help ' s identifying you as you are early in the sentenceand doesn ' t waste someone ' s time reading racist bullshit

20. for some , like the darkmoons , you can do both at the same time , but for most the ai is faster . pvp is only faster if you have someone to grind with since its a bit dead atm for the gestures you have to get them all one on character , the same with all the other achievements .
