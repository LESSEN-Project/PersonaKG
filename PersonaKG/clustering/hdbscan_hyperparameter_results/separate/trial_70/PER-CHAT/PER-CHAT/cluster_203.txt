1. some stupid people think being gay is a defect are are trying to treat it . but , like i said , they ' re stupid .
   (ID: 4bb0a21212688dbc67fe64d6f42fca297fed4f4f)

2. no . okay , think about it like this  people are made up of atoms , and when you die your atoms go off and become other things . this means that every girl would most likely be made up of atoms that were once in a dude , so if you bang her you are technically banging a dude , and that ' s fucking gay .

3. i think the article is bit misleading because a lot of people that i know have not replaced watching tv for different hobbies . i think people have switched to watching videos online as part of netflix , hulu plus , and bitorrent which is illegal . also , people use dvrs now and watch tv at later dates . the nielsen ratings do not capture these statistics and therefore , they are understating how many people are actually watching broadcast or cable tv .

8. it ' s always a thought . like  what would happen ? what would people think ?
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

9. it ' s insane that people think we all came from two people .
   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

10. it honestly not that . i think it  s smugness coming from people who think they are more important than they are .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

11. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

12. i agree . do you think it ' s white people ' s fault that the number of black people in these fields is so small , like a lot of people think ?
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

13. i do find it girly  " gay " to not be weirded out by a stranger covering you in lotion and rubbing up on you . how is that exclusive to those who are girly or gay ? that ' s fucking ridiculous . what do you think women and gay people are like ?
   (ID: 372e357e1e3acd2a4dea24aa56a5900a539a9e59)

14. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

15. i think it ' s perfectly fine to call people out on their shitty spelling and grammar . now everyone knows what our opinions are . hooray !
   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

16. people often hide names in screenshots , i think it is  was against the rules to include them .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

17. or it ' s a bullshit made up story , hoping that they will be one of the first to receive it . reminds me if some guy who demanded to receive his kickstarter shit faster than other people because of some condition . think it was shiftware .
   (ID: b25bdf3935142c93d642393810cba283ec3b801f)

18. i think it ' s super cool when people come up with things like this , props to you for putting in the effort !
   (ID: ae523af408f5ede28b0592f69a7488ab41bb519a)

19. i think most people miss the problem with her name . the problem is stupid parents naming kids stupid names . that is the real problem .
   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

20. same here ! i guess we can plan something for the end of the month . perhaps on the 28th ? hmm , where to go though ? i can ' t think of anything personally . suggestions people , suggestions !
