2. idk , i thought about having skaven being able to conquer anything . i ' m not too well versed in the skaven , but i think it ' d be weird to see them defending the walls of a human city . i ' m probably wrong on that though

5. i think you should correct your behaviour . if your first thought when something happens is " im completely faultless " and then after everyone else says you ' re the asshole you still seem to think you ' re in the right . yta taking out your anger on others and racist comments are never valid . dont kid yourself

10. the guy with the parachute is basically yelling " hold this crap right you pussy , i ' m already here , there ' s no coming back . the girl is praying and the dude holding the little parachute that opens the big one is shitting himself saying that " the shit ' s gonna hit the fan . that ' s a very ruff free translation , but that ' s the idea . i think it ' s more funny the way they are saying than what they are actually saying , but i can ' t translate that .
