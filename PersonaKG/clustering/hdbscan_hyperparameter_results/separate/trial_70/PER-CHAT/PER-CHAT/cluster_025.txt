5. that ' s honestly worse to me . none of the dozen people in the household noticed the kid was gone , or if they did none of them said anything . usually in big families the older kids are at least partially talked with watching the younger ones . several people dropped the ball .

7. i enjoyed the 90s way too much . i just downloaded music from the radio to my tape deck . i had e  mail , but the only people i would mail with were the people i met on vacation . i had a mobile phone , but it wasn ' t that important . i would get a text or a call in the weekends from friends asking to hang out . you could still do stupid stuff without being worried you ' d get yourself filmed . we did a lot of drugs . it was such a great decade !
