8. off topic about this picture but on topic about the bikes do these bikes have better baskets ? like are the holes on the side of the basket huge because the baskets are useless if you wanna keep your phone or anything in there because they will just slide out . like today i used one in miramar and i had a can of iron bru import from scotland i think and it slid out the side of the basket and pierced a hole in the side causing it to squirt out this is one of the older bikes
