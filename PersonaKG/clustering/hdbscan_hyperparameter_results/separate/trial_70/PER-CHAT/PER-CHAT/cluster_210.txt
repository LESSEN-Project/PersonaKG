1. i know this may sound ridiculous to many , but one of the most dominant memes in the wingnutsphere is that obama cannot function without a teleprompter . santorum is a poster  child for dunning  kruger . he would walk into that debate thinking " i ' m going to teach this boy something . " and that is exactly what his base dreams of .

4. it the perfect compromise they get to pretend to do something and we get to pretend that we give a shit ! off course if that only as far as isp are willing to take it . but we all know it not going to stop there the moment isp start messing that much with the internet they be asked to do more and more again and again !

7. i ' m going to throw out some wild speculation ahead of the announcement . i haven ' t head anyone else mention this name probably because it ' s stupid . landon donovan . we know he was in salt lake in the off season , and talking to the front office . it never made sense that he was going to come out of retirement to play here . maybe that ' s not what they were talking to him about .

8. you know what  s worse there  s a common theory going around that he knows about  is helping the others . dude knows the human race is in danger of extinction yet still keeps a pointless war going for his profit .
