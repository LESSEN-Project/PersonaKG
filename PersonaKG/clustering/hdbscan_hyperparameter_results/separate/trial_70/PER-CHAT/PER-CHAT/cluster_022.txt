1. i ' m a christian . i believe that jesus preached for us to do things like love , be compassionate , generous , and honest . as such  i believe in evolution and human  caused climate change , because the proof is overwhelming . i believe that being gay is neither evil , nor a choice . god created gay people , just as he created me . he loves them , too . i refuse to believe that god would be so cruel , as to set gay people up for failure . i believe that money and religion cannot mix . either you serve god , or you serve your greed for money . not both . there is no such thing as a racist christian . there are plenty of racists , though , who call themselves christian . if you truly love christ , you love your fellow human , no matter the ethnicity . i sincerely wish that the many cinos christian in name only in the world would recognize their own hypocrisy , and denounce dogma , when it clearly causes suffering , inflames hatred , or requires hefty lying to oneself .
