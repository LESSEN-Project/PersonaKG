5. by the simplest and most accurate definition , it ' s a particular act that you personally sexualise more than just about anything else . it doesn ' t have to be innately sexual . just like sexualities and , closer in relation , fetishes , nobody knows why fantasies exist . but there is speculation that the reason they remain fantasies is because people rarely see themselves participating in real life .

6. we are alone . that ' s the hard truth in life . we are alone and we will always be alone . friends are someone to laugh with , yes . but when you are feeling down , they will just go and get someone else to laugh with .
