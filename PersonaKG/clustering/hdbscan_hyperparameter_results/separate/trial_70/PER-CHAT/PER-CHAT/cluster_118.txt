1. still , leaving a digit year old kid by its own it ' s pretty shitty thing to do and has no excuse . she could have taken you to the neighboards or to some families  friends . serving you dinner and blowing her head off without saying anything is horrible . what were you supposed to do ?

5. probably the rapid advance in technology . we went from doing the same thing for digit years to space travel in a span of about digit years . nowadays we compressed what would be a several ton vacuum tube computer to microchip computers many times more powerful , yet small enough to fit in the palm of our hand .
