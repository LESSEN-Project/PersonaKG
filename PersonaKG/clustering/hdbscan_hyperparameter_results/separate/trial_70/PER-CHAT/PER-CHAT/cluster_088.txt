2. no offence taken , it ' s not just about the pvp , it ' s also about farming , which is fine if that ' s how others want to play . i was of the understanding that fw was about conflict and dominating the enemy , this can be pretty hard if the enemy just warps off when i turn up , if you ' re at ' war ' then be at ' war ' . i can understand why these ideas may not be for you in particular , but maybe , just maybe , a lot of others may be just as frustrated as me and actually want to have some gf ' s . i like different points of view as sometimes brilliant ideas can evolve , how  what would you like to see done to improve fw ?
