1. out of curiosity , how much of that is old people ? i could understand if they have a hard time actually reading the signs . otherwise , yeah , that is pretty weird . totally separate question . do you find the job draining on your writing , because it is annoying ? or are you actually more free to write than you would be if you were doing something academic ?

6. " fuck off " thank you for your input . when you ' re on the clock you ' re expected to at least meet corporate and customer expectations . if you can do neither then any job that relates to working with people is not for you . when you ' re off the clock and on your time you can do whatever pleases you .
