1. the problem is that if you love someone , you really can ' t settle for just being friends with them . you really can ' t . it hurts . i ' ve been in this situation multiple times , and i can completely understand someone being frustrated by this , but you have to consider the possibility that it hurts to love someone who doesn ' t love you back . i hope that cleared something up !

4. the dire wolves have been in the show since the start but i never really felt like they were all that big and scary , i love how this scene really shows that off , however it was the end of that . ps  she could have easily rod the wolf over the horse .

6. it ' s been a really rough year for me and it ' s so encouraging to see jack so happy and kind . what i love most about jack is that he really seems to care . i get a feeling that he has less of a " youtube persona " and more that on youtube he shows off a true energetic and happy side of himself .

10. i would love to use my most out  there as middles , because they might be too much as firsts , and it would get annoying dealing with questions or having to explain it , but i really do like weird names .
