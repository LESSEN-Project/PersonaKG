2. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .

4. see it ' s hard to describe , but he ' s not one who likes to get embarrassed because he gets super upset and angry . he totally lashes out , so i figured with an instance such as this , maybe wait for him to come to me ? or is that the same as like we ' ll basically never talk about it ?
