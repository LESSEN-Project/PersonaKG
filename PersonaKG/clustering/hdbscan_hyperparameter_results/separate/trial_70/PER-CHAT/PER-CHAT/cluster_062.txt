6. i stand by my assessment . you gave the server money you otherwise wouldn ' t have , and your intent was to convince them to vote for a particular candidate . i understand your position that it was a symbolic gesture , but i don ' t believe you can separate that out from the fact that you did give them money . fortunately , it seems i ' m in the minority on this not unusual for me , so you should have nothing to worry about .
