2. " don ' t be afraid to be truly bored or alone with your thoughts . " i can ' t remember the situation , but the general idea was to not be afraid of having nothing to do . your mind can create some interesting ideas , given the opportunity . boredom can be a gateway to discovering yourself or a new creative outlet you can use to express yourself . the counter to that tends to be that your mind can also create some rather worrying ideas too , but i don ' t think that was really the goal of the idea .

5. similar ! i don  t care if my friends go without me but i do care when they insult me . i don  t really care who else insults me whether it be a stranger or family , but if my friends insult me i will think about it for at least two decades and become extremely insecure as a result of it .

6. i think what he ' s getting at is the idea that if someone is mentally unhinged example , a psychopath they don ' t really have control over what they do . the brain is the control center of everything we do . if its fucked up , then the person is basically screwed .
