4. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .

5. and why should people listen to you instead of basically anybody else ?  your basic dumbed  down quests that a monkey could do after reading your post i would think this is just your speed . i appreciate you trying to punch up and take on monkeys , but what did they ever do to you ?
