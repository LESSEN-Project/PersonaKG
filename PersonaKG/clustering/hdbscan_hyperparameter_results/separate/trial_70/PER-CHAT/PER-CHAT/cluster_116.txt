SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 8

1. we have a certain sense of accomplishment to make up for it . think about it  we ' re mundane folk who figured out how to alter reality on our own . no bloodline , god or otherworldly being helped us .

2. yeah , kraus make some weird stuff . if you think theyre neat , check out some old altmans faucets . i think altmans closed the buisness though , so they ' re not made anymore .

3. if you even use that feature its stange enough . i dont think beating off to it could make it much worse .

4. i think they should make it epic and legendary , keep it the same in all the other ways
   (ID: 52e0e376c09b4862d8eea84ae547c3466a2aac4b)

5. i think the other episodes are finished as well , at least that seems to make the most sense to me .

6. . no , it doesn ' t , but i can see why dooku would make you think that
   (ID: 800762ac8d54632109094a4e9132fe0aed711561)

7. yeah . i dont get that . even as someone who likes trump , this is something i think is okay to make fun of . he even makes fun of his own typos like when he typed covfefe
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

8. wouldn  t the accounts receivable of banks be completely thrown off though ? the banks would simply be wrecked financially and the federal reserve requirement eventually . someone would make money off of the hedging the risk but i would think that ultimately banks would lose millions if not billions in accounts receivable . hell if it actually happened i don  t think the us would have serious consequences . i think it could happen if everyone started to default on there loans alone .
