2. the actual best thing to do would be to do what you said , but make it so that the viruses slowly unload themselves throughout the year to inflict as much pain as possible . and make sure that none of the viruses can spread . if someone didn  t visit the website , then they shouldn  t get bad stuff .

3. you could also do the same thing , but while rolling make note of what outcome your hoping for . then ignore the roll and pick the one you hoped for .
