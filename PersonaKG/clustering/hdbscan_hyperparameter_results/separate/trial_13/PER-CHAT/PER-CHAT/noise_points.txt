1. no because what they did to me made me strong . and also it was a long time ago and they probably regret it so much at it might be killing them alredy .

2. i did , it was alright . your mileage will definitely vary with how into your partner you are and  or how much you like big parties . if you ' re just going with friends , then i hope you like fancy parties , else you won ' t get much out of it . if you ' re really into the digit  digit  howevermany people you ' re taking as dates though and enjoy romance then yeah it ' s pretty romantic . it ' s not cheap , though , so consider how much a formal dance setting and a fancy dinnerdate appeals to you , because that ' s about all there is to it .

3. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?

4. it  s okay . i  ve done this in the past by lightly banging it with my hand whenever i lose as well . we  re are all human . i didn  t break it though , but one time my brother did . he was playing fifa and he legit got so mad he swung the controller against the wall and he broke the xbox day one controller .

5. like someone in the comment said , you honestly dodged a bullet there , imagine being friends with someone who shit talks about you behind your back . he thinks he is all high and mighty with 10k followers wtf . be yourself op you will eventually find more friends

6. i don ' t know much as a canadian . but from one perspective it sounds like a huge mistake , and i ' m glad that we are no longer under british rule . from the other perspective , it could be great for them . either way , with this , the imminent change of monarchs , trump and growing worldwide trend in far right conservatism . the world economy is about to be flushed right down the toilet . we ' re all fucked .

7. it depends how close i am to the person . if i ' m very close and i value their happiness above my own comfort i would tell them digit  . painful as it is they are better off . get evidence if you can , they may not believe you .

8. i ' m not catholic anymore . also , i ' m not really into my college major and have no idea what i ' m going to do after graduation . also , i ' m a little depressed and socially anxious , more than they know , anyway . keeping up appearances on all fronts now . the catholic one is the one they ' d most likely kill me for if they knew . joke answer , kinda  masterbation . i feel like most of these aren ' t major secrets . i ' m just not emotionally close to my parents so they just happen to not know a lot of stuff about my life .

9. i ' ve been told i never smile , and i do not do well with people . looks like it ' s something to work on .

10. we saw a dark skin dude and my brothers kid digit years said  " look that man is made of chocolate "

11. i agree with this digit  . when i put my blinker on to get over , more than half the time , the person i ' m trying to get over in front of speeds up to stop me from getting over . so i just quit using them .

12. its your body . as long as you ' re old enough to be doing it , i don ' t care . i just don ' t want it around me outside of vaping . in my experience vaping doesn ' t have a horrid smell to it .

13. oh boy , do i have the song for this ! behold !

14. for me it ' s the idea of surrendering all control to someone else and having nothing to worry about . i also like the feel of a diaper , that will seem odd to most but for those of us who do have a diaper fetish it makes perfect sense  it can be about them hugging the genitals or about the comfort you get from them . the main thing to remember is that every adult baby is different so just because one adult baby likes it not all of us will .

15. people " bitch " about it because of situations like in this clip . that guy was in a charge for less than a half  second , was sprinting a different direction than the one he was charging , and still got the instant kill . fundamentally , he should be doing no more damage than shanking a guy with a knife under these circumstances  his bayonet charge is missing the " charge " portion . the main balancing mechanic behind the charge is the windup time and the sound of someone charging , but both of those are obsolete in a situation where you can just enter the charge state at the last possible moment and instantly kill someone .

16. that ' s awesome . but it ' s more so , why do people think they should talk about this stuff at a elegant function when people are eating ? like , okay you are a mom . does that change the fact that you ' re talking about shit while people are trying to eat ?

17. then i guess it ' s not gonna happen at all which is okay too . don ' t ruin your work environment . those are some bridges that shouldn ' t be burned . you can control your emotions . only you chose what you think and feel for a person .

18. to be completely honest , i was terrified of painting this . this is actually my 3rd attempt of painting this mask the other digit times , i wasn  t super happy with it . the secret is taking your time and patience of course . it makes me really happy that i give you confidence , and just remember , if you don  t like the final product , you can always remove the paint and start again .

19. cuckquean exists . there is a subreddit for it . so " the genders are never reversed . " is void as an argument . polyamory and open marriages . polygamy also doesn ' t seem so fair for women . open marriages are open on both sides ? aren ' t they ? if you ' re rich , you ' ll be picking up girls as you pick up your nose . if the woman is not that good looking , she ain ' t getting shiet . we " men " usually overestimate women ' s ability to get laid . subject digit  i don ' t even wanna link guys ' cams the man can always go bi   x200b  funny thing is , if a man is in such relationship , it is by his choice ! so if he thinks of it as unfair , he wouldn ' t take the choice . conclusion  life is not fair , but my personal opinion is  fairness is a myth .

20. what you can do is try a new hobby together as newbies . is there something you want to start that both of you have no experience in doing ?
