7. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .
