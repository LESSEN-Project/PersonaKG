5. we all go through this . what eats us up the most is not knowing something but when we do get the chance to find out the truth it always makes us more sad and miserable . so it  s the force that protects us from self harm . yeah of course we want to know the truth so we feel better about ourselves but i . the end it just sets us back and we are left there with the knowledge that our ex did not find us up to their par anymore . really who gives a shit ? they left you , time for you to prove that you are better then them and live your life . live the life you always wanted to . fuck that bitch haha . go have fun and do you .

6. girl . i don ' t even know you . and i don ' t care if you are a hundred pounds " overweight " . a relationship shouldn ' t make you feel bad . it should encourage you to be your best self , not guilt you into it . i don ' t like the way this sounds , as it sounds very degrading and hurtful to you . your body should have no influence on how much he loves and respects you .
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

7. absolutely . how do you reconcile the love you feel for your family member and the knowledge that they ' re a total monster ? it ' s gotta be so heartbreaking .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

8. thank you . i don ' t blame myself in a way that isn ' t realistic . i blame myself for not being aware of the warning signs of what happened to me . that ' s about the extent . i don ' t harbor any unhealthy emotions and though i suffer mildly from ptsd i am conscious enough to work on my issues . with that being said . yes , i am still with my boyfriend . the truth of the matter is that he simply isn ' t emotionally mature enough to understand the depths of what had happened . i did threaten to break up with him . the first couple of times he said it to me i didn ' t stand up for myself . i don ' t know why . but the last time he said it i really stuck it to him . i realized that if he thinks this way i can ' t possibly marry someone who will think like that and i told him that . i also told him i will happily leave because i know i wouldn ' t be suffering a loss if that ' s the way he is thinking . for the first time in all the time i have known him he stopped and gave me a very heart felt apology taking accountability for his lack of sympathy and understanding . quite frankly , a lot of other things were said . but it was true and i know he meant it . this is still a red flag for me . if i am suffering from something in the future , am i going to have to be the one to walk him through it too ? just because i am more emotionally equipped to handle ? he ' s not a horrible person . but he is selfish in his thinking . and he is emotionally sheltered . after digit years i am starting to wonder if i want to be the one who does all of the picking up .

9. basically , if he  s a changed man , why is he bringing this up now ? if he  s moved past this , why does he feel the need to express this ? being love and validated aren  t synonymous . you can love your pops , but think his actions are wrong . furthermore , people are in love with what they think liam is . who outside of his close friends and family really knows him . how many people loved kevin spacey before he was ousted ? i dont think you understand what i mean when i say he  s seeking validation . he wants people to say  yeah , i understand how you could have those thoughts  . that  s why it  s selfish , it  s self serving . he could have said ,  i was a racist who unjustly went around hunting people i knew nothing about hoping to kill them to satisfied my twisted definition of justice . instead he churched up the story to try and justify is actions . like i  ve said , if a white person raped his friend , would he have acted the same way ? i  m willing to wager he wouldn  t . we can be empathetic , we aren  t monsters , but we don  t have to validate it . these are the thoughts of a fucking racist .

10. i don ' t have experience with cheating parents or spouses , at least not that i ' m aware . i do agree with you that is wrong and harmful to both women . however , if i were in your shoes , i would have to ask myself some questions . first , what do you want to accomplish by speaking with your mom ? you clearly cannot change her behavior by talking to her about it , as you have tried that . secondly , what kind , if any , relationship do you want with her ? if you intervene in some way call the wife , confront the man , etc , you will be further alienating your mom . and lastly , can you live with this knowledge and not intervene if that is the only way to save your relationship with your mother ? if you answer these questions honestly and with great contemplation or not rashly , i believe you will know what course you should take . good luck !

11. i didn  t have an excuse for why i didn  t tell the husband he was being cheated on . but i did say that i was shocked by her actions and while it was sinking in and i was trying to figure out what to do , she ended up confessing to her husband . it was an ugly mess for sure , but i was concerned about their children who are friends of my child and me being an  outsider  to their family dynamic . also , i was not told any of the details of her affair , including who it was with , so how could i approach the husband with zero information ? and then have the kids be like  your mom is trying to break up my parents  and suddenly my kid is involved . my husband and i had an opportunity to speak with the husband who was cheated on , as we wanted to assure him he was still our friend and he had our digit  support should he need anything . and , the answer to the original question is , cheaters are assholes . not the person who was put in the middle of the situation by a manipulative , pathological liar .

12. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

13. if i were to stay with her , i would try my best to give her attention back and be the best boyfriend i could be . that  s not how i could see myself as an asshole . the way i could , would be me losing my patience and leaving in two months .

14. if you feel as bad as you say you do , then whatever threat he made shouldn ' t even matter . do it .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

15. anytime . there ' s also the amount of alcohol he drank to consider . honestly i ' ve thought about getting a squad for my roommates over that alone . a bottle of jameson is a lot of liquor , i don ' t care how much you weigh . whatever you decide to do , keep yourself safe . i hope it goes well . do not let him back into your life after this . you ' re through with this fuckin scrub , and you have better things awaiting you .

16. long ass post but i ' ve read every single word of it . congrats on your successful transformation . leave while you can . you are still young and have a long way ahead of you . i really hate manipulative person and hope you find a better person . but i would suggest telling her about the divorce in advance if you don ' t want to hurt her too bad but even then , you wouldn ' t know what type of shit she ' ll pull . it ' s going to get better from now !

17. tell him and see his reaction . if he is such a great man that wants to be with you , he should have no problem sticking up for you and making sure his family understands that that behavior will cease . if he reacts in their defense and does nothing , you know it  s not worth pursuing . mommas boys are a serious no  no for me , good luck .

18. he didn ' t almost collapse a grooming gang trial and it utterly transparent that you only all of a sudden give a shit about the victims because you think it bolsters your point of ' football man bad ' . you didn ' t care about those girls before and you don ' t care about them now and that is precisely why someone like tommy robinson came to prominence .

19. jesus christ that is extremely hurtful and immature as hell from her . why doesn  t she date someone her own age ? that  s like right next to pedophile . i  m am so sorry you saw that . i can  t image the pain you have . does your bf know about this ? like if he does and that doesn  t make him cut her off then don  t date him anymore . and  chemistry  is such a bullshit word . the sex tape is probably from when they first started dating or something like that and that  s when the relationship and the sex is most fun . i  m not gonna tell you to just get over it bc what she did is extremely shitty and you have every right to be hurt . tell him and if he doesn  t do anything about it like cut her off completely then leave . and if she starts bugging you then send her ass y  alls sex tape lol . be strong girl . don  t let that tape get to you .

20. i had a friend . my best friend . i accepted who he was , whenever he has a girlfriend he begins to be on a high horse and judge everyone . he wasn ' t the greatest . college dropout , dead end job , but our clique of friends still loved him . then he started to have girlfriends and began to judge people for what they do . he judged my friend with benefit and so on . eventually he had his third girlfriend and essentially stopped picking up all our calls and invites to boardgame night and beer night . something we been doing for digit years , all cause a girl thought it was lame to have boardgames . eventually we started to do other stuff like go out and take trips . we never spoke to him ever again and from what i heard , he has two jobs just to support his gf ' s party habits . oh well . i cared . once .
