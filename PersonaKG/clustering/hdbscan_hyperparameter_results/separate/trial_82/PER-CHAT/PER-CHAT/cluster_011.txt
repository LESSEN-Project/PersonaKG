1. that ' s just mambo jumbo to me .
   (ID: 41b9459dbd87b475322566af693bf5fe2a47086d)

2. i used to be an extreme example of this . i ' d assume intercourse meant he loved me and ultimately wanted to marry and have kids with me . thank god for guy friends setting me straight . main reason to disclose and have some sort of talk is to filter out girls who think the way i used to . they may not be stalker psychos but were simply raised with a certain set of beliefs and have peers who share them .

3. just do it .
   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

4. i think it ' s more of a confidence issue for me . if he makes the first move than i know that he likes  wants me rather than me taking the chance and getting rejected . although i have asked out all of my past boyfriends so i don ' t require it .

5. there is a breech of trust when incest happens . family members are some of the only people in life who you should feel completely sure don ' t want to be around you just so they can fuck you . if you take that away , ultimately you will miss the feeling of being around people you know don ' t find you sexually compatible , but still like you anyway .

6. well guys do tell me i ' m hot , but they say that about so many guys that i think it ' s just something they habitually say and it really doesn ' t mean much . it ' s also such a 1980s saying that i ' m surprised anyone still uses it lol ! i suspect they ' re just settling since they couldn ' t get any of the hot guys .

7. if you  re four months into the relationship , i think they  d be happy to hear  i love you .  that  s just me and my partner , though . best way to do it is  hey , person  s name ? they respond  yeah  or  what  etc i love you .

8. just me being me .
   (ID: b863480affffa35b0ead5c7bc5daa4c4099c0cee)

9. the bluetooth is just a way to cover up that we are actually talking to ourselves
   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

10. well yeah of course , but most if not all guys are clueless then misinterpret reactions to mean a completely different thing than what she wants including myself . could you be a bit more specific with examples perhaps ?
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

11. why are you assuming that it ' s fear that keeps guys from popping the question ? some guys just don ' t want what you have .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

12. in my experience , it usually means that their friends are just the type to do that sort of thing and it has very little to do with attractiveness , and they usually do it because they know the other person will do it back . some people just won  t do it because they think it  ll make you uncomfortable . it just depends on you and your friends personality , really .
   (ID: fa9acab3fbd86b1f64e6380ef31b49912dae0c74)

13. not at all . you ought to establish that , however , just in case he has taken it as ' this is a romantic date . '
