1. okay , a reason . your comment is intellectually base and not worthy of debate . how ' s that ? now goodnight my precious troll .

2. actually i only wanted to talk about you and not to you because i know you act like a child and knew the level of stupidity would reach all time high like this " conversation . but believe what you want , i don ' t care . i ' m done wasting my time here .

3. lol , ok ok . i ' ll stop . dude , for you own sanity . realise that this is a shitpost . my account is a shitpost account . you are arguing with me on a heavily down voted thread that almost no one will ever see . look in the mirror , remind yourself that you are a human being that doesn ' t need to get upset about idiots on the internet that are clearly doing stuff to get a rise out others . cause dude . it ' s not ever gonna stop . get used to it .

4. i just think that people who get mad at trees and reindeer on government buildings are just getting mad at a part of christmas that pretty much the entire country celebrates , and isn ' t even remotely christian . gotcha . as a us citizen i pretty sure you ' re aware of our world champion status at getting butthurt . nothing official or otherwise will keep grumblers from grumbling . officially removing its religious status whatever that looks like would just provoke an even bigger response as i see it .  yeah , i ' m not trying to . i ' m starting to think i should have made my frame a little more concise as to what i meant by christmas being ' not christian ' . ya , this is the reason i think people are kind of lighting this idea up . it ' s what made me think the reasoning had an emotional basis   as stated it ' s a bit off  balanced .

5. but all these things will still happen under socialism . tis is a problem of corruption and conflicts of interest of people writing the laws that enable things like this .

6. so why is it the democrats can do it with proof and they get shrugged off , yet one person makes a fake claim about a republican with no proof , the media runs it for weeks , investigations ensue , and suddenly he is the evil racist ? welcome to america where the left didn ' t care about facts , only their ignorant opinions .

7. i  m sorry , but it does have to do with religion . it was largely a rejection of paganism by the levites that brought it to the forefront of judeo  christian  morality  . it was reinforced throughout greece and rome by the spread of christianity and wedged its way through northern european society by way of brute force and religious indoctrination . it may have started as a cultural phenomenon , but it only held on through the passing of religion as if that was ever a passive process , but that  s a totally different conversation . to argue it has nothing to do with religion is as intellectually dishonest as it is historically inaccurate .

8. they are facts as you see them . your need to mock makes you an asshole and is a mistake i am trying to correct i a way you understand . further mockery . who ' s denying the facts , anyway ? to me its not what your doing its how your doing it .
   (ID: f15c79447707a6e701285e8c59cc3aa25d54daa6)

9. i  m arguing because you say stupid things and can  t accept the fact that your post is not fun , smart , or helpful . you argue like a child and need to learn that not everything you say matters . you don  t want to argue , don  t respond . your the one who posted a garbage post with moron comments . you get off reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

10. the way i see it , it ' s okay if it protects you from imminent harm , like using violence . otherwise , it ' s not .
   (ID: c978d968d1c4e9730afc6b7b09cbdd832546a06f)

11. i  m not talking about your initial comments , i  m talking about the whole conversation . and during this conversation , you  ve been all over the place . you  ve told me that you  re just giving me food for thought and i shouldn  t actually change what i  m doing , then you blatantly told me you  re telling me to change what i  m doing . you  ve called me apathetic , then you  ve told me i  m taking it personally . i should stop reading into your comments , but you get to interpret mine however you want . now you  re saying you enjoy disney movies , but you draw the line at writing quotes on the board . that  s not where i draw the line , and i  m sorry you feel that  s wrong . we could discuss the meaning of that song and why i specifically chose that lyric , but i  m not really wanting to open that can of worms with so many other things already on the table . what you  re not seeming get is that i  m not trying to do any mixing . i  m not making grey , as you suggest . i  m keeping the two issues entirely separate . and the definition of apathy is showing a lack of emotion or an indifference . i am telling you that i have thought a lot about my stances on these issues and am far from apathetic .

12. to be clear  people have the right to practice whatever religion they would like . they have the right to pursue or not pursue certain things in their personal lives because it goes against their creed . i don ' t want to take that away from people . if living your life a certain way and believing in one god or another makes you feel fulfilled , then live your best life my friend . but laws impact everyone . to make a law in the name of say catholicism and then forcing people of all other religions to follow it crosses many lines . if people want to be able to change their gender markers on their licenses if they want to , they should be able to . but no one should ever force anyone to do so . if doing such a thing goes against your religion , then you don ' t gotta do it . those laws , the ones for people wanting to change their gender , only impact the people who want to do it ! nothing about those laws says that everyone else is legally obligated to as well , it ' s just an option available to those who are interested .

13. yta , from your comments you come off twice as hard as one .

14. thanks for proving my point . what point did i prove ?  can argue that there is good and bad practical result from the study of physics results from the study of physics atom bombs is not the same things as physics speed of light in a vacuum or weight of an elementary particle itself .  not only in the physical realm but the spiritual realm . what is a " spiritual realm " , what evidence do you have that such a " realm " exists ? where is this realm ? how do we access it ? how do we measure it ? how do we test it ? how do you determine what is and isn ' t part of the " spiritual realm ? you will have to show that such a thing exists before i can debate with you about it .  see how we don ' t agree on the basic premises of the debate ? it ' s not a disagreement , it ' s a misunderstanding , on your part .  oooh , edgy . i don ' t coddle delusions . you can piss of with your snark and get off your high horse if you want to actually talk about this stuff .  but . i can argue that religion is an evolved mechanism for time binding moral and ethical meta  narratives that has aided people in learning how to interact with each other and behave in social groups . that is not mutually exclusive from my definition .  in that way it has alleviated suffering for millions of people over thousands of years . again , not mutually exclusive from my point of view .  who is right ? i have evidence for my claims . you do not . there is no evidence for any such " supernatural realm " on which a lot of what you claim is based on , and so , i am right .  that you even refuse to see that more than one idea can be true at the same time means you have no idea what you are talking about . i never said that " more than one idea can ' t be true at the same time " , but it ' s not something i would disagree with . the earth can ' t be flat and an oblate spheroid at the same time . the sun can ' t orbit the earth , and the earth orbit the sun at the same time . fusing hydrogen atoms together can ' t produce helium and beryllium . it looks like you do not know what you are talking about when it comes to physics . i can point you to some reading material if you ' d like to learn more , but i ' m not going to give you a physics lesson here on reddit .  the real answer , for people who think instead of just blurt out declarative statements based solely on their own opinion assumed to be objective truth you condescending tone isn ' t welcome . if you ' re going to talk to me like that , you can fuck off and scream your nonsense in to the void , or go over to  flatearth where they welcome conspiracy theories .  is that the debate cannot have a winner because   the two parties do not agree on terms , like what " good " means . you . never tried to establish what " good " was . nothing in your comment talks about goodness . you talk about some spiritual realm , and then make some bogus statements about physics , which leads me to believe you are not arguing in good faith and just want to push your narrative . i ' m perfectly fine if the debate does not have a " winner . we aren ' t on stage in front of an audience , and i would venture to guess very few people will even read these comments . that your goal is to " win " and not to understand , again tells me you are arguing in bad faith , with no intention of learning anything .  we have almost no detailed records of events from digit  of the time period debated . detailed records are not the only evidence from which we can derive facts .  essentially this debate is a farce for hanging your confirmation bias on pot , meet kettle . the same applies to you , bud .

15. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .

16. i mean , i explicitly told you do x , y , and z if you want to improve , but hey , that doesn ' t count right ? i even offered you a bet where winning it meant you made a life improvement , but that doesn ' t count right ? you know best still . i ' m blocking you now . you are one of the saddest , most pathetic , most repugnant fucking things i ' ve ever encountered here . seriously , it ' s difficult to even consider you a human . you ' re more like a parasite . a disease , that infects everything around you with revulsion at the sight of you . how fat are you ? how fucking ugly are you ? how much of your existence is spent in that incel sub ? frankly , spend all or your time there . no one wants you anywhere else . you are fucking disgusting . i am going to delete every post i ' ve made here , simply because i want to eradicate any evidence i ' ve encountered you . you sicken me that much . you ' re suicidal ? well don ' t do it . keep living , like this , forever . that would make me happy . keep living .

17. ok i ' m not putting anymore energy into this so there you win have your invisible winning points , now scream your extremist views somewhere else where neckbeards can bathe in it

18. it  s the internet my dude , you aren  t going to change the minds of people who think they  re right . all you can do is flawlessly which is an unfortunate aspect of talking to people on the internet present your counter argument and hope some people are willing to look at things objectively . maybe you  ll convince one person . just present your sources and hope for the best . the biggest thing is to never take the arrows too seriously , it  ll just make you angry because reddit has a mob mentality against anything contrary to the accepted opinion of the day .

19. i also didn  t say that , but yes he  s not a good person . dude you have assumed so much of me without ever explicitly saying anything about those subjects lol
   (ID: c0f309bee7152ab458da8ec03fbb1e17fa2876cd)

20. where do we start .  what does intelligence have to do with the right to live . pigs are smarter than dogs . which one is it ? does intelligence matter or not . if it doesn ' t , then why did you bother saying that ? yes , intelligence matters . human lives matter more than insect lives , to the general population at least .  dogs would be owned only by people who really need them who decides what really needing them means ? is it only for guide dogs ? no therapy dogs ? no comfort and stress relieving dogs ? if you ' re lonely as fuck and depressed , you can ' t get a companion , treat it well and love it , no you have to kill it because dog food is made of meat ?  in effect we would save some acres of rainforests that would have been used otherwise to feed the animals those dogs eat . so we shouldn ' t even feed them now ? we should just leave them to die of hunger or being killed by another animal anyways ? which will happen , because predators eat prey . simple as that . humans are the only animals with the capacity to choose otherwise , and it is a choice , not a requirement . also , you think they eat the fucking rainforest itself ? as in the trees ? or the plants , because if everyone was vegan , we would eat even more , right ?  one doesnt need a dog to survive i don ' t need a phone to survive . i don ' t need electricity . i don ' t need to wipe my ass after i take a shit , but i do it . why ? because life is not solely about survival , and if you think that , i don ' t know what you hope to do in your life .  would you slaughter a goat for your dog yourself ? if it were him or the goat , i should let my dog die for a goat ? a goat who will probably die anyway , being killed by one of countless predators as it is prey . dogs are predators . i care about him , he counts on me to live . i don ' t know the goat . it ' s just a goat , i ' m not going to die or have my dog die for it .  i bet many vegan pet owners would go sick from the sheer amount of death they caused . show me the argument . show me a movement saying that pets should be slaughtered . i don ' t care if the opinion is held by vegans , doctors , monks , or fucking talking trees , just show me that any collective group of people other than you has come up with this abomination .
