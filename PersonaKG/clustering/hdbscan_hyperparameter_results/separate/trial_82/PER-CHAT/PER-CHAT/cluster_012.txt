1. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !

2. here ' s how i see it . many different universes where something small that ' s different to something drastically different . anything possible could happen right ? what if each one of those , there is a god , but the gods are all on being ?

3. well , i doubt even rockstar knows what it will be about , but your idea is quite great . however , i really have a heart for the specific part of redemption , so i would like to see another character whose path to redemption we get to see , and dutch or hosea we already know they don ' t exactly do .

4. maybe they meant it in a more metaphorical sense ? i mean if you ' re immortal your " humanity " is considered dead as dying is an attribute of being human  if you saw someone today and they couldn ' t die , you ' d think them unnatural .

5. i ' ve always found this idea of them all going into the soul stone kinda weird . we don ' t even explicitly know that gamorra went in there , unless the writers have revealed something i haven ' t read about . we know thanos was able to communicate with her after death , but why the assumption that that was inside the stone ? also , her death was much more closely associated with the soul stone than the snap . even if gamorra went inside the soul stone , why would we assume everyone snapped also went inside ? the other stones are all perfectly capable of killing someone , so why should the combined power hoover the souls into one stone ? genuinely asking if there ' s concrete evidence behind this ' in the soul stone ' thing , not trying to be a dick .

6. i think we can all admit we have no idea what is going to happen , but all the theorizing makes it fun to watch . i like the idea of gabriel , though .

7. i think now we will see the fighting . germa has been around for so long and we dont know shit about them and about big mom past i think we may see another short flashback at the end of the arc , also mother caramel maybe is alive inside bigmom or as a homie .

8. no , it had them stay in the neverzone during running with scissors , marco dies in the neverzone but star brings him back to earth , which somehow brings them back to earth . i think it was on fanfiction . net or ao3

10. hahah ! like they would make three matrix films . i think you might be trolling .

11. the closer to the finale we get , the closer i get to thinking that we are and have been in both seasons seeing a lot of cr4  dl simulation relating to bernard and william  mib . i haven ' t fully fleshed out what that could mean , but i am not sure that we are seeing much in the way of " reality " when touching on some of the storylines we are following weekly . with that said , it puts me in a spot where i don ' t really know where they go from here besides some contingent of woke hosts infiltrating the real world , but with a less obvious twist of some kind .

12. i hope stark and the captain survive the end game .

13. no  one really knows for certain . you can speculate all you like but no  one definitively knows .
   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

14. let ' s not think of that . i ' m still reeling from all the major deaths from ' the walking dead ' i binge watched all seasons to catch up . not sure i can handle that for charlie .

15. that feels like lazy writing to me . things on got are rarely black and white , so to have this mysterious storyline that ' s been developing for the entire series only to end abruptly with no explanation other than some stupid superhero movie villain arc destroy all of mankind mwahaha is a disservice to the entire show .
   (ID: 169c51cc138a4161080068ded4dcf87863ffee36)

16. hopefully given a break . like , a few lifetimes waived or something . i think about this often .
