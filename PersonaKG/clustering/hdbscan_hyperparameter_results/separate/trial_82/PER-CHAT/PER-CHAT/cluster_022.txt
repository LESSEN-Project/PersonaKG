11. its nice to here all those things . i could give you one advice for creating memes dough . have you heard of meme generator before ? its a mobile app for free with all sorts of meme templates and lots of customizability . the great thing is if you are not home you still can make a meme on the go ! that is atleast what i always do and i can ' t recommend it enough . still thanks for all the support dough , it has been kinda hard making memes lately because i have a sorta writers block . you may have noticed that i upload daily which i dont recommend . so its always nice to hear nice things like that

12. i appreciate the offer , but i ' m trying to learn how to do this . do you have any advice you could offer me instead ? your song is very cool . i like how it ' s pretty stripped down but doesn ' t feel empty or lacking in anything . very chill

14. this is a very smart looking app . a few things that stood out to me as a software architect  i ' m not sure whether the iap unlocks this but it would be quite nice to be able to swipe back from full screen images like you swipe from everything else . it ' s especially a speed bump when using a phone with the right hand and not being able to reach the top left x one  handed . i ' m quite sure you have a bug in your comment folding . some comments fold gracefully but some fold the ops name too and then make it reappear below the fold which is a bit disorientating .

15. that ' s amazing ! i wish i could afford this ! very fairly priced for the detail you put in !
