1. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .

2. i don ' t think it matters if he lied or not . i think the only question we need to ask here is " did he use public money to pay her in any way ? " . if not , then i don ' t see the problem here .

3. you think a decade and a half of blacklisting , effectively destroying his ability to have a career and a prosperous life , is a just reactioon to what you classify as dumb mistakes ?

4. look at two people being able to civilly discuss a bit of a hot button issue on reddit ! while i agree about espn probably not wanting to put down too strong of a stance on an african  american for ranting about racism , she went beyond that with character attacks of someone specific just so happened to be our president in this case and seemingly contributing to an already boiling pot of emotions in the country . her hosting a sports show is debatable , i doubt many viewers are tuning into the digit for anything sports  related . that being said , espn has fired , demoted , or seriously disciplined sports analysts previously for less than what hill tweeted because they previously tried to portray an environment of " we are here for the sports , we don ' t have room for political discourse " ultimately , there is a much different atmosphere being portrayed coming out of bristol over the last few years . i don ' t think there was any place for what schilling said , like him or not . making statements like that about an entire group of the population the transgender comments is irresponsible and detestable , but just a few short years ago , statements like hill ' s would have been met with a very similar fate also .

5. yes i think he did do i think he is a good president , no . did he do a good thing in that situation , yes . i think you are taking this post in the wrong way . also , it  s absurd to say not giving up your net worth isn  t a sacrifice , just straight ridiculous . bill gates has made it his mission to help unfortunate others if your trying to say he hasn  t done enough to be rewarded you are just acting silly . that man has made it his mission to help others . and regardless anyone who has been president of the united states has made a huge sacrifice for their love of the country . don  t get it twisted i  m simply stating celebrities get to much praise for simple acts of kindness .

6. just because it ' s his house doesn ' t mean he ' s not an asshole . he gave no mind to his future pil and their dept . he ' s being an irresponsible child . i ' d appreciate it if you gave a counter argument so you can ellaborate you ' re point an important meta you should readhttps

7. out of interest do you think you should be able to send anything you want to anyone else ? if not where do you draw the line ? i think almost everyone can agree that threats of violence should not be protected under freedom of speech . that said , thank you for offering your take on this , it was very informative .

8. i might sue him for taking away my daily entertainment . the other politicians might be upset as well . trump makes them look like angles .
