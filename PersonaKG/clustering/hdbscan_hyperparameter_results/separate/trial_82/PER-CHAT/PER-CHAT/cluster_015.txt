Total from this dataset: 21

1. not eat too much salt and get better sleep . sometimes a good adaptogen helps to keep the serotonin flowing , like rhodiola rosea . all in all it ' s usually an atrophied muscle you have to exercise . just like how people are full of shit when they say they can ' t run , focusing , socializing or managing can be learned because the brain is very plastic . just stick to subjects you enjoy and work to empathize with other people and listen to their stories . some people are simply boring or self centered , but there are also a lot of interesting people out there . like good books , you have to seek them out , and stick to being around them and then over time socializing because rewarding because there is commonality between you and the person you found . indeed , the beginning requires getting out of your comfort zone and making the effort . it is so worth it though .

6. thank you for your comment , you  ve made a lot of sense to me . it  s like a switch gets flipped whenever i begin to think about doing something for me . study , art , meditation , even my last therapy session i struggled to keep myself present and awake . having been in therapy for a year now , my therapist has only recently begun talking about dealing with my cptsd so i  ve got a long way to go . hopefully i can begin unpacking my terrible coping mechanisms soon because they really are disabling in so many ways .

7. there are some idle thought tricks you can do . for example when you feel your mind wander imagine an awesome palace or castle you rule . then imagine the inside of it . fill it full of awesome shit you like . then you put things you need to remember in it . might be a bad example but its similar to what i think about when falling asleep . the essence of it is putting important thing in your idle thought processes .

8. im gonna tell you , mate , taking your life only hurts the people around you . not one single person is thinking life would be better without you . high school is no determination factor anyway , life changes after high school and you can make life what you want it . you can start and entirely new life for yourself , you ' re moving on to how you want to impact the world . i know talking to someone isnt at the top of everyones lists when it comes to mental health but from experience , it really helps . reddit is a really good place to get your emotions out mate . there are lots of people on here with the same problems you ' re going through and we ' re trying to overcome it together . we ' re here for you , mate .

9. i feel like im at edge because i honestly thought i had real willpower to stop and now here i am failing multiple times . constantly persuading myself to give in and juat have a drink and now i cant even last longer then digit days without a drink . its heart breaking and im afriad about how this has come to be . i juat dont know anymore

10. yes , our minds love to punish ourselves when we are low . i promise if you truly try you can feel better and once you do it will be easier next time and so on and so on . feeling like this i truly know can be dangerous . don ' t be afraid to talk . get it all out . it ' s ok to be sad . but you have to tools inside your head to make yourself better ! remind yourself that you are worth it red  heart

11. you ' re not a failure because you had a panic attack . you didn ' t choose to , you didn ' t want it , we can ' t blame ourselves for things out of our control . i hope you win your fight .

12. you only experienced that " good " because it ' s in reference to a previously experienced " bad " . the cycle will always repeat itself . bad things dont last either , keep pushing .

13. i cut myself today for the first time in awhile but only had a serrated knife which hurt a lot more so i didnt really get that into it . also made plans for my next suicide attempt . i haven ' t had any money in a really long time though so i ' m pretty much just window shopping for ways to make a charcoal grill with as little money as possible . i fall between screaming in my head to please let me die and begging for some kind of purpose . then i start to think of what being an actual person would look like and all i can think of is all the gross horrible shit i ' ve done . i really wish i could fall asleep in some happy dream and never wake up . i wish i could die and my body could live on and fix the world . i want good things to happen to everyone around me i just so desperately dont want to have to exist anymore .

14. i know what you mean . i used to get panic attacks that lasted days , weeks even . my situation was so bad . i ' m glad i found mindfulness . good luck
   (ID: f9d3bf7ce779e854aa865f12a7dfaaee14a65cfa)

15. oh , honey . sending hugs . can you ring a friend for a chat ? you need to speak to someone who knows your worth . i hope it gets better or , if not , you find what you need . good luck .

16. same mate ! i can get aggressive with ovd triggers sometimes , small doses of edibles through the day keep the symptoms way manageable if not gone
   (ID: 46cf1fc2a9c8dec12fa16589117be75cf1571e1d)

17. i ' m sorry but you look like you ' re suicidal and trying to build up the confidence to do it with everyone ' s bad comments .

18. lsd made me realize that i was overthinking most everything , and that most problems like that are just made up in your head . it really changes your mindset . would highly recommend taking lsd  mushrooms at least once .
   (ID: 4a5a9ac8eab027b38804427b3c8c5e19c8991de3)

19. i hope you ' ll one day be able to see past this and get through it , and that the non  suffering times get longer for you .
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

20. i ' ve always loved smoking up but since the panic attack everytime i smoke up i think about the time i had the attack which makes me panic again . i really hope i overcome this because smoking was one the things which gave me bliss .
