1. yeah like op said there are two other people here possibly one who are shadow banned so check that out . anyway i ordered some 350s off ali about a week ago and the tracking number begins with ls . they just got processed through the sorting facility , and they haven ' t done anything else . it just takes a really long time for it to get out of the country . give it some time .

   (ID: f179711c18514780c1b0257643d893ef1cf5a081)

3. ok , thanks for the feedback ! when i tested it i landed on the platform with the goomba spiny stack and didn  t notice it . i definitely agree with your point , i  ll be more careful about that in future levels !

4. a spawn of a server i am in has this problem , but magnified by digit . it go so bad once the admins had to  butcher a shit load of times just to make sure the raids were gone . i got screenshots and would be happy to send them in .

5. oh i thought there was a different aspect too , where the more boxes you open he more likely you are to get a new brawler . i think that part applies to all rarities

6. does it do that on its own ? i thought mine only did that cause of the knife .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

9. check the log , it should tell you why . it means something is wrong usually .

10. other is a lot of , well , other . it  s a bunch of cached crap . backing up a resetting might do the trick
   (ID: 0f6c6c4bd3531c7f028b4bf901123522dd67c300)

   (ID: 23fec2f7c8ba98af71f4a2c258416abc85f5c0a8)

13. what do you mean you dont use it ? it ' s always running . doesnt your watch blink green on the back showing the sensor is active ? because as you can see mine is not
   (ID: e807b18e05d35f02282740d90e8c63546558b267)

14. what ? i thought it disappeared after you moved  shot ? is this a bug or how it is supposed to be used ? that  s fucked honestly if you can do that
   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

15. do you own one ? range anxiety i heard is a thing but apparently it  s not as bad and when you put where you are going into the map it calculates how much charge and if you should pull in to a charger and how long it  ll take
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

18. there ' s only about three of those that i don ' t use but any of em could be causing your problem , or even a weird interaction between a few of them
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

19. i haven ' t heard of that before . it might be you using scorestreaks while the camps need you to only use the maddox . try no scorestreaks and that might work . it sounds like the sort of thing you get in a new update .
   (ID: 420a86ecfb9d645349db591746d0cdeba4b68f37)

20. why not 450ms ? is there ' s something with frames and things being in the hundreth place ?
