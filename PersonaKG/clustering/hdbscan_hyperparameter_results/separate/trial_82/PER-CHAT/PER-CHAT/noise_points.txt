4. yea but i do kinda understand why they havent done it yet since they have alrady kinda made a schedual for digit and they will have to fit it somewhere so it may slow down the development of other stuff like the new war since even tho its not that hard of a thing to do it still takes time to do it .

7. it ' s certainly possible , but you have to have the correct style flare tool to make it match up to the fitting properly . i forget the distinction of what ' s different about the factory ford flare double bubble vs ? but there ' s something weird about them and it ' s not the typical flare style . wrong flare style means the line wouldn ' t seat and seal so it would leak . i stand by the junkyard recommendation , lkq owns a lot in my area socal , i think i paid  digit  ft for that line , so like  digit ?

9. maybe you ' re nb ? maybe you still have to figure it all out ? you don ' t owe anyone an explanation . but it sounds like your friend is supportive no matter what which is the important thing .

13. there  s def been more funny , but tedy bruschi  s face on first take when stephen a had one of the biggest fuck ups i  ve ever seen killed me and is something i will never forget .
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

14. honestly , i ' ve been trying to think about that . like , the first thing that comes to mind is like oh if you get marked as a sex offender then you can ' t live in certain places or go to certain places and you can ' t get a job blah blah blah but if you don ' t have to work then that doesn ' t really matter , since you can just order foods on amazon and have enough money to live wherever you want without working . thankfully i don ' t really know what all the lasting impacts of convictions are , but because of that i ' m suspicious that there ' s something out there that could still ruin you even with that kind of money .

15. just relax . masturbating is supposed to be fun . how could it ever be fun doing it the way you ' re doing it ? how is it possible not get off from your own mind creating things and scenarios , that you sexually desire ? i ' m just gonna say " bullshit " everyone loves daydreaming about sex . so if you can ' t turn yourself on mentally  don ' t enjoy doing that , and you also don ' t like porn i call bullshit again why the fuck are you even trying to masturbate ? are you sure that ' s what you ' re doing ? i ' m just fucking with ya don ' t get all butthurt now lol of course you can ' t orgasm . in order to get " off " you first have to learn to get " on " masturbation is a natural fluid process , one that shouldn ' t ever take this much effort . you ' re fucking yourself from fucking yourself . stop it .

17. i work in product development and while i haven ' t had any moral dilemmas nearly as big as these , there are often issues to consider . what if i can design a better widget , but our factory can ' t produce it so we would have to outsource it ? consumer gets a better product , profit margin might even be higher , but we decrease internal production and hurt other employees . it is kind of funny how the phrasing of this could cause reddit to hate or love it . stifling innovation seems to clearly be a bad thing , but there is tons of hate when people hear about companies that close their factories and produce goods elsewhere . if your new product is different enough , it is possible that the current factory can ' t be modified to produce it without basically gutting the whole place . even then your workforce has no experience producing the new item , so if you want good quality right away , outsourcing the manufacturing of the new design is the only viable solution .
