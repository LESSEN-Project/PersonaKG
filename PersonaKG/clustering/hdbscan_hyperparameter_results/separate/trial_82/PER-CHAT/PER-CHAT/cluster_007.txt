3. i think im going to try to introduce myself like " what ' s up im addison , my friends call me aj " because addison itself is a pretty feminine name but it ' s the only one i could get by with bc of my unsupportive parents

5. you ask her out , you flirt for a couple weeks or so and then you pause for couple of days . during those weeks she enjoys the attention , then during the pause , which preferably is for digit  digit days she gets confused , thinks about you , what you mean for her . and then you get back to asking her out , flirting and she is hooked , she already has thought about her feelings for you . just don ' t overdo it . you do this trick more than twice and she will think that you yourself don ' t know what you want .

6. simply ask ,  hey , do you wanna go out ?  guys don  t wanna make assumptions about your intentions and look bad , especially in a society where a guy can be criminalized for being interested in a woman . a shy guy will absolutely not take that risk , so if you  re interested , you should let him know .

7. hanging out , talking , and kissing . you are dating .

8. if you just met them like at a party ,  tell me about yourself  is a perfect opener that allows people to take it where they want . if you have developed some rapport , asking about people  s brothers , sisters , and parents  remember their names , and if they sound positive , ask what that relationship looks like  would you say you act more like friends or are you the protective sibling  . if they sound negative , venture elsewhere or play it safe and ask something more open ended like ,  who are you closest with ? who do you tell stuff that nobody else knows ?  the provocative questions like that last one is a gambit and can either turn people away or build intimacy quickly .
