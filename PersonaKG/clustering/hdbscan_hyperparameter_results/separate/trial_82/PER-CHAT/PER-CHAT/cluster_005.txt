4. i would say make sure to stay caught up . if you are having trouble doing your work , just start it . i know that  s kind of  oh thanks i  m healed  . but in reality most of the time my problem is just starting . once i get in the  zone  i could go for a while . late ass response sorry but still happy to help

5. i don ' t know for sure , still struggling myself to be honest . but going with the same analogy , if we can all let go of a clenched fist , can we also do the same with our thinking ? there have been moments when i got so tired of thinking that i simply just let go . and in that few moments of letting go there was a feeling of true liberation . usually my mind works like this  i think of something " bad "    i tell myself that i shouldn ' t think of that bad thing but i can ' t    i tell myself i should stop thinking about stop thinking about that bad thing but it only gets worse    each time i think of anything a judge in the background says it ' s good or bad and that i should do this and don ' t do that    i get anxious because the vicious mental cycle starts stacking up into a shit storm . but whenever i ' m in the " letting go zone " , the thoughts still happen , but the judge kinda disappears . " i shouldn ' t think like this " becomes just a thought judging another thought , instead of you judging your thoughts . the best i can come up with to describe this feeling is total allowing . super sorry for the rant !

6. why does what you do in your free time have any bearing on what you do at work ? in your mind , is it impossible for someone who likes to get high to refrain from doing so at work ? if you drink beer or alcohol , how is that any different ? should having a beer at home disqualify you from driving a forklift at work the next day ? these are genuine questions .

7. not relying on buying more stuff with the hope to increase my happiness , something that ' s so common in canada . not everyone of course but so many .

8. digit tip , be the " i ' m down " guy . overtime , a few minutes after quitting time , travel . those little extras make you stand out and they will give the overtime , most importantly keep you working . i know you were asking in terms of outside of work but this is the advice i give apprentices that always ask how they can get head or how they can make more money , but it all comes down to the same thing , if you keep working you keep getting paid .

11. sir , you just mentioned something which i ' m going through . whenever i have enjoyed doing things in my life , i became good at it . when i looked back i see that whenever it matters the most , fear of failure cripples me down . when things were not significant to me , i turned up doing good . pressure of performing when it matters the most gives birth to my fear of failure . i know that without pain there will be no gain . thank you for your words .
