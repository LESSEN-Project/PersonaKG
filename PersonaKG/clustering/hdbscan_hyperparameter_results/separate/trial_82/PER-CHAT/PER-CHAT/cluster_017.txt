1. thank you ! i also feel the same way about the post that was made earlier calling people on this sub pathetic . just , why ? this is a place where people come to vent and get out what they can ' t in other places . for them to say we ' re pathetic for doing what the sub was made for is just rude . why can ' t they just unsubscribe without being a dick ? what did they get out of calling other people pathetic ? i just don ' t get it .

2. no one upvotes constructive suggestions like these on reddit here . some idiots write posts like " thank you tencent , for adding this cosmetic . i ' ve always wanted that since the beginning " and it gets insane upvotes or something like " you shouldn ' t complain about this game cause it ' s free and we should be thankful " just shut up bitch and you don ' t even call yourself a gamer if you only pubg mobile and nothing else

3. ok so let me answer all of your questions and give a retort . yea i stayed up all night to watch it drop . yea i played all the missions with my friends . yea i did get burned out quick because i played the game . those missions where a fucking cake walk and the work that you call her for is just errand boy shit that doesn ' t pay well . we have absolutely no verity in this update . look at it , it ' s the exact same as after hours but you get a not free casino . you have digit easy as hell missions that can be completed in less than digit hours given you have people that aren ' t retarded doing it with you . and a penthouse that is just another way to spend your money that isn ' t practical . the casino is probably rigged . we don ' t have texas hold ' em , witch is in any casino within my area midwest digit more fucking bullshit cars that are no better than the last updates batch . and a plethora of other ways to milk you out of your money . this update is bullshit and everybody knows it . oh and for the " passive mode fix " that shit should ' ve been in the game since day one . rockstar had every chance to fix that shit when they did gunrunning , smugglers run , and after hours . yes i do like all the fixes that they have done , those are nice . the only thing i want is an enjoyable experience that is filled with fun for all players alike that won ' t burn out after digit fucking hours .

4. i used to play offline so i could enjoy the game with no ads , now it  s like playing while online . forcing me to pay just so i can enjoy the game , i don  t like devs or games that do shit like that .

5. i have to agree honestly . as much as i like skins with different styles , this new mentality of " i dont like their hat , get rid of it " and " make this character blue because i said so " is so uncalled for

6. honestly , i think most of us hate the pc culture that is spreading as well . we just dont want to get into an argument , so we go along with everything . i definitely agree that people need to stop getting their panties in a wad about stupid shit and begin focusing on the real issues . however , it will probably never happen .

7. that wasn  t me who said that lol . i played the shit out of the first destiny . every dlc , did every raid , all of it . the game is absolute shit . i understand that that  s my opinion , but i truly do not get how people like that game . didn  t even waste my time buying the second one . so disappointing that bungie abandoned halo for this garbage

8. i didn ' t take offense , i did find it to be laughable though , worst marketing move of the year . so far .

9. i can ' t stand instagram however i don ' t like the people who use the site , you do you , if you want to use that cesspool of garbage , that ' s fine . the reasons i strongly dislike instagram , is particularly because it is made by the owners of facebook . i ' m not saying reddit is superior , or anything like that it is just because of the history of facebook , history of anti vax users . i

10. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

11. which is exactly why j . j . is trying desperately to change the dumpster fire that last jedi was . the reception from the fans was so positive that solo was boycotted by tons of people . that ' s why all you hear is how great the last jedi was and how the star wars properties plans and movie outlays were drastically altered due to the huge positive response to it . you guys liked it sure but the idea that a small minority did not like it is ludicrous . the facts show that it damaged the whole series .

12. if you can ' t countenance a person ' s art because the person is trash , that ' s totally your own personal choice . i just don ' t think that social pressure to boycott art like that is healthy . people should be allowed to choose for themselves if they want to consume that kind of culture or not .

13. i get what both of you are saying . i never intend for this post to get up voted so much . i was just super excited . it was my first post on reddit . but post like this is what has kept me going . the overwhelming support is awesome . and other people have encouraged me to go after the dlc . i don ' t see anything wrong with that . we play and post cause we are having fun . what ' s wrong with that ?

14. oooh snippy . look , most people aren  t going to run into entitled people like this but all the god damn posts complaining about the apparent fake posts or people claiming someone  s story is fake when it  s fairly reasonable is preeeeetty annoying .

15. so the fuck what if i don ' t have more time to dedicate to something that didn ' t grab my attention ? why do you feel the need to defend a game or convert people to be fans of it ? that kind of attitude is just annoying . if you want to convince me it ' s good , tell me what is so amazing about it oh and why are you talking about the witcher ? that game was okay , nothing special . .

16. i see . i feel people want others to exercise to conform to their standards using health and physique as a dumb excuse rather then caring about someone being happy . ofcourse it is different when someone is obese but you get the message . also , many sports are boring and gyms are full of toxic shits anyway .

17. i think the fact that this happened proves for a fact that " we " are not better than this . this subreddit isn ' t even about lol anymore , it ' s about pros and funny lol pictures . it ' s pathetic .
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

18. so it upsets you that other people get excited for things you don ' t like ? i guess you only like what people tell you is popular .

19. i guess you could see it that way but most people are enjoying coming back to the game now that most of the kids moved to fortnite .

20. " i just don  t understand how it could possibly disappoint you so deeply when you haven  t yet experienced the game in its entirety " trailers are meant to sell a product . what we have seen is disappointing . what we have seen is so disappointing , we do not wish to experience the rest of it . " i guess what i  m trying to articulate is essentially an old saying i  m sure you  re familiar with that basically goes  can  t knock it  til you try it .  " we have tried it , a lot , many times . its fucking pokemon . they arent selling us something new , this is like taking an oreo cookie , removing the cream that everyone likes , just selling the disk , and charging more for it . " which is the approach i myself have chosen to take having started my pokemon journey as a young digit year old boy myself when i was gifted by my parents a copy of  pokemon red  and just moments prior to that , a green  gameboy color  that i still have and play to this very day from a guy who lives way up north that goes by the name of santa clause " well i guess someone had to rip the bandage off eventually . im sorry man , but santa isnt real . " it was on that day and from that point onward i continued to travel from region to region , league to league meeting tons of new friends and pokemon along the way ! i will never forget what pokemon has done for me " then why are you endorsing a game that will not allow you to keep using those pokemon that you love ? i mean hell , they want to throw your pokemon in a jail cell , and make you pay them to keep them alive . " i could care less about a few silly graphics or poor animations " honestly , so could everyone else . if dexit didnt happen , people would have let it slide , but if criticism is being dealt , people are going hand over fist to get it all out there .
