1. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .

2. just last week a girl at my job would always want to chat with me , she ' d even wait for me to get to break so i could sit with her . i thought it was weird and couldn ' t figure out if she was being friendly or not so i ignored it i suck at reading signals now she doesn ' t bother . oh well

3. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted

5. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

6. i had a date once and the girl had no social skills . like she couldn ' t hold a conversation . i don ' t ever struggle to make conversation but this was a real shitter . in the end it was just me talking at her . the worst part is i would talk about things and she would never add to the conversation . just " yes " or " no " answers . eve now i wonder if it was me that was too talky ?

7. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them

8. i think you ' re trying to learn but i would not say that a lot of guys are bordering on aspergers . plenty enough are smooth . plenty have empathy . sales principles help build armor . approach anyone you find attractive or seems like a nice person and strike up a conversation particularly if you are shy . this will help you learn to read people as well as show people you are friendly and respectful . when people don ' t wish to engage move on asap . analyze it shortly thereafter but you ' ll getter sense of when to approach people any gender for any reason . and since they won ' t all be romantic interests you won ' t get the shot down feeling if someone doesn ' t want to chat each time . make some female friends who are only friends even if they are blood relatives . they can play wing for you and perhaps accelerate your learning .
