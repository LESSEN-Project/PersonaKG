1. can you provide a link to the original research ? sounds interesting but i can ' t seem to find anything searching for it .

2. hmm . i never thought about it like that . it seems as though i ' ve been out scienced again . i guess this is what they mean when they say " scientist will admit when they ' re wrong " .

3. i believe that the origins of the universe cannot be explained and because of this i think there might be a god . science seems to be doing a pretty decent job at doing this , though . but generally , you ' re welcome to suppose all you like in the absence of evidence as long as you don ' t confuse ' think there might ' with ' know there is ' .

4. i believe so . however , it ' s hard to say what advantage it really had . also , we don ' t know what exactly allows us to imagine in the first place .

5. i know that ' s how it happens , but the placebo effect is effective sometimes . i ' m just saying that somebody is very religious will have more chance of believing they are being healed . so more chance of them actually improving .

6. but reincarnation is a supernatural occurrence that ' s only based in religion . the closest to what you are describing is jainism . it ' s still a religion though . i ' m just busting your chops though . all great fictional stories use selective liberties with facts . don ' t let my nitpicking screw with your story ideas . if all authors did that nothing would get written .

7. same here . my study of religion led me to conclude they were all manmade . the way that i see it we all have certain drives for meaning , for purpose , for morals and certain emotional needs getting over the fear of death , wanting to reconnect with dead loved ones , wanting a sense of meaning in life , etc . and religions each navigate a way in which they can fulfill these human desires . and i think that the religions out there today are still in existence because partially they tended to fulfill these the best .

8. yeah yeah , so it doesn ' t really fall under the category of what your saying as " learning religion " .
