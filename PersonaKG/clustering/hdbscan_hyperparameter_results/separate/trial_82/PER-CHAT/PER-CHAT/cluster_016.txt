1. remember what it felt like before you were born ? yeah that  s sounds like the most reasonable answer to me
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

2. you ' re alive right now . so what if your youth was wasted ? does that automatically mean that you ' re unable to anything ever again ?

3. me ? i dont have an existential crisis anymore i accepted we probably live in a simulation a while ago sounds stupid but look up neil degrass tyson ' s video on it he explains it really well but you should probably just take your mind off of it and or work toward accepting it and like me it might give you some weird peace knowing that nothing you ever do will matter .

4. if you ' re in your 40s or younger , there ' s still hope . i ' m working on a theory right now .

5. surely there ' s comfort in knowing there ' s absolutely nothing you can do about the eventual heat death of the universe . it ' s out of your control so just let it be . you don ' t know that this universe doesn ' t collapse down to a single point and birth anew with another big bang . either way i ' ll be long dead so it matters not

6. the beginning is life , the end is death . it doesn  t matter how you spend the in  between , as long as you chose what you do
   (ID: 507a68eb71bd6ad59b6eb966ab94fb9c2e599bc8)

7. there ' s more to life than what it is for you now . there ' s a whole fucking lot , little guy . you live , learn , experiment and feel a lot of things along the way , and you never even know what it ' ll bring you , which is the most fun part ! just like good ol ' retarded tom hanks once said
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

8. remember how it was before you were born ? me neither . and that ' s the way it will be when we are gone . same exact state . there are many questions we will never know the answer to but it ' s best to concentrate on what we know and what we have  enjoy your life and be good to your fellow humans .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

9. i can be happy . now trying to get there is oddly frustrating . hell of a climb i have . but i ' m willing to do it . . and i do have cancer
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

10. well once there was always dark . if you ask me , the light ' s winning !
