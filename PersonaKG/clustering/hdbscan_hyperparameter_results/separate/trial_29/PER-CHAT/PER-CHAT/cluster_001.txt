18. dude , i think the main part of social skills is knowing different social clues  hints people give . for example  someone on their phone  they are busy and find it rude when people try to interrupt them someone looks really happy and approachable  most likely would be willing to talk to you someone is responding in few words , doesn ' t sound very engaged  probably not interested and sometimes , these social ques can help you determine how well the conversation is going , and maybe signal that you ' re doing something wrong

20. if you just met them like at a party ,  tell me about yourself  is a perfect opener that allows people to take it where they want . if you have developed some rapport , asking about people  s brothers , sisters , and parents  remember their names , and if they sound positive , ask what that relationship looks like  would you say you act more like friends or are you the protective sibling  . if they sound negative , venture elsewhere or play it safe and ask something more open ended like ,  who are you closest with ? who do you tell stuff that nobody else knows ?  the provocative questions like that last one is a gambit and can either turn people away or build intimacy quickly .
