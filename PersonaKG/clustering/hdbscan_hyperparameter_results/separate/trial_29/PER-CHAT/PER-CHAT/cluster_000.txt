1. but we shouldn  t say that being obese is okay as a society , but if you want to stay fat thats your choice but you shouldn  t spread fake ideals
   (ID: 23df46bdba3eb265d08b02c9ec5f365cf45ae5fd)

2. insular people have always done this to protect their own worldview . races , religions , ethnicities , classes , etc . they  ve all been scapegoated and hated for no solid reason because one group feels threatened . i dislike religion because of the use of dogma to legitimize cruelty , but worst of all is hypocrisy . conservatives want to claim to be about individual liberty , unless they feel so inclined to limit any particular group on a whim . christians want to claim to be a bastion of love and patience , but only for a small subset of people who personally serve their agendas . it  s not a difference in opinion that separates you from most of them , it  s iq points !

3. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?

4. probably because they can . some countries you dont get the right of freedom of religion , so in the us people can express themselves with it .
   (ID: 3ad18913fe75fd4a63c4ae0d0255c37d90fd7144)

5. how did that turn out ?
   (ID: 7e8d23b8f1f993c239648b064d6f3e414288a7dd)

6. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .

7. i am a snob , i take music very seriously . was i being a dick ? yea . but i cannot help but talk shit about rancid . and the thing i said about dumb old punks , you gotta remember it ' s some of the ones i know personally . the ones who get drunk and harass people at shows , and  or support trump . while those are the minority , there is still an alarming amount of them . btw if you are a trump supporter please unsubscribe from this sub and murda urself my man

8. of course they " shouldn ' t " thats not the real world its the same as saying ' if everyone was nice there would be world peace ' its just word vomit that means nothing . the punishment would be letting the potential kid live in a fucked up life and you know that .
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

9. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

10. honestly , i think most of us hate the pc culture that is spreading as well . we just dont want to get into an argument , so we go along with everything . i definitely agree that people need to stop getting their panties in a wad about stupid shit and begin focusing on the real issues . however , it will probably never happen .

11. according to smirk boys mommy , they were ' black muslims ' . so which is it , israelites or muslims ? btw , that excuse makes zero sense  " a group of people were harassing us so we went and harrassed a different group of people that had nothing to do with it . exemplary logic there . and yes , i have watched the videos  there are several of them capturing it from different angles . i saw a large group of teenagers wearing their maga hats surrounding a group of natives who were there for the indigenous people ' s march and yelling over their song . also yes , the elder walked toward the kid who could have stepped aside or walked away . instead he just stood there smirking . i ' ve also seen the half assed ' apology ' by the archdiocese claiming that they will be dealt with possible expulsion . these poor picked on little christian kids  s were there for a prolife march  so why all the maga gear ? why aren ' t they wearing march for life hats or t  shirts ? and why were they at the indigenous people ' s rally instead of their own ? it ' s pretty obvious that they wanted to stir the pot and start trouble . well done kids . mission accomplished . enjoy the shit buffet you created for yourselves . i hope the stench of it follows you for years to come .

12. the left is never happy and is relentless . this is exactly why if we let them take away ar15s they ' ll just come after shotguns  handguns next .

13. tending to attract attention    doing it for attention . i  m saying you are wrong because you are unilaterally defining motives for a large group of individuals without actually providing evidence other than  well i can  t think of another reason  . you are the one who made the claim that all flamboyance is for attention , you need to defend it . also , your definition of flamboyance doesn  t even serve your point . nowhere there does it talk about loudly talking about their sexual encounters . my reason for pushing he idea that is that , because you seem to be ignoring the fact that straight people literally do just as much as  flamboyant  gay guys . if your issue with it isn  t that they are gay , you need to have an issue with anyone talking about their sex lives loudly which again , straight people do not just people who are flamboyant . my point is , if people  s private conversations bother you , no matter how loud they are , don  t listen to it . whether they  re gay or straight , or male or female . it  s not a personal problem for all straight people , it  s an issue you personally seem to have . it  s also not really a double standard because loudly yelling about your sex life , regardless of sexual orientation , in a workplace is frowned upon . like i  ve said , you don  t seem to have an issue with the fact that , whether you care to admit it or not , straight people do the same thing as well , so yea , right now it does sound like your issue is with gay people .

14. i add comments instead of editing , because i doubt people will re  read my comment . worried , maybe not , but you were the one who wouldn ' t take my word for it . sources dont usually help people that already have their minds made up .

15. in my teens i wasn  t very sensitive to the subject . definitely use derogatory words and definitely wasn  t befriending anyone who was openly gay . but then i moved to ann arbor to work at my aunts bar and the very first two friends i made where gay but i didn  t know for like a month . that really opened my eyes . these two are amazing people , and after talking to them i couldn  t believe all the hate they have to face day in and day out . and i used to be apart of that . i can  t believe i used to think and act like that to another human just because of one difference . i will never use homophobic terms again and i pray that everyone in our society regardless of sexuality will receive the respect and happiness they deserve . i will always stand up for love for the rest of my life

16. well , i don ' t go around telling everyone i don ' t believe in the bible and all that nonsense . and i believe there are many people like me . it ' s easier to say nothiing most of the time unless confronted by one of those crazy people who want to send you to hell because you don ' t believe exactly like they do .

17. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .

18. except for my very first post where i said lgbtqwhatever , because that  s what those napoleons like to be called , please , show another one of my post , where i was arguing ? i simply stated what i strongly and firmly believe . now back to people , who like to suck dicks , being fuk in the ass , licking each other  i don  t care what they like to be called and what they think they are . they are mentally ill people to me . i could make myself more clear .

19. you have a perceived notion on the us government ' should ' run . which you literally just proved my point . you don ' t understand how they actually work .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

20. word , ight . i may not be black , but i sure as shit ain  t no nigger . see , freedom of speech mo  fo . i may not like what you say but i will defend your right to say it . nigger .
