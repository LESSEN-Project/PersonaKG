1. that makes sense . have you actually jumped into elite again or are you just asking ? i took a digit month hiatus playing other things until the itch came back . when i get bored i play something else for a while . it ' s good to check back once in a while for updates  digit . digit is coming soon , so that ' ll do some stuff . i also wish the exploration mechanic was a little more like what i ' ve seen of nms , but i imagine fdev wants to go all out with elite feet and atmospheric landing , so it ' s over the horizon at the moment . i think i started to feel like a ship was " mine " after i worked my ass off for it and had unique experiences in it t  digit , courier , and clipper for me , but what you ' re saying makes sense . i ' m just rambling at this point . is kerbal really that engaging ?

2. ok so for me origins story really disappointed me the combat was great and what not but the levels and and story killed it for me . the story was good at first but as soon as the order of the ancients came into play it just got repetitive , find info track them down kill them repeat . i would do a mission and it would say be one level and then the engines would be digit levels higher sometimes . in odyssey the story doesn  t feel like that to me , it feels different . i prefer kassandra over bayek just better character in my opinion . and i can really appreciate how much variety it gives me in options to level up . oh and i like the new kind of abilities you get instead of what was in origins . just ask if you would me to elaborate on this more .

3. hey dude ! ive never seen the orville . something i keep meaning to watch but keep getting distracted . from what i hear about it it  s more of a love letter to tos ? might be wrong ? don  t get me wrong  i completely understand why some fans are turned off by disco , but i just feel that having trek back on tv , in whatever format that is , is a good thing . i sometimes feel that the hardcore fans can become a tad blinded by their own personal head canon and what they want that they forget that purpose of anything new is attract not just old fans but new fans as well . i personally accept that this isn  t an easy task . trek has such a rich history and continuity that in order to attract anyone new and to show that their is potential for more trek shows you can  t just throw all of that onto someone new . dr who is a good example  easily accessible yet bringing in more and more mythology as it went on . disco is literally just finding its wings and personally i want more trek shows to be back where they belong  on tv for all to enjoy and not just pandering for the sake of it . it was obvious that anything new was going to have a hard time , just look at the new star wars . sometimes you just can  t please everyone which in itself is an impossible task to do .

4. of all the things i dislike about the sequel trilogy , the way it deals with the new republic is the worst . maybe it ' s because i grew up reading the eu , but as soon as i read the opening crawl of tfa i thought " resistance ? that ' s just stupid " and the republic ' s destruction is literally a set  up for finn to ask " where ' s   poochie   rey "

5. i prefer for comic book worlds to remain mostly static . i ' m not totally against change . without change , dick grayson would still be robin . however , i don ' t like when characters have been one way for their entire publication history and the writers change them for the sake of " diversity " . that ' s lazy and insulting to the fanbase . if it ' s really so important for them to include more minority characters , then they should write new and interesting minority characters . it would be so much better if riri williams were to fight alongside tony stark rather than in his place . have amadeus cho join the hulk family along with rick jones , jennifer walters , and betty ross . it annoys me when writers basically say to their audience , " oh , you ' d prefer to read about johnny blaze rather than robbie reyes ? too bad . johnny ' s gone . robbie is your only option . " i wouldn ' t mind these new characters if i still got to keep the old ones . you can always count on brian michael bendis to ruin everything . the only good thing that man ever gave us was jessica jones . other than that , everything he ' s written has been trash . he ruined iceman and turned iron man into a digit year  old girl because he ' s a terrible writer who can only continue to sell books with pure shock value . marvel is a pathetic shell of its former self and i ' m not sure it will ever recover .

6. i see what you mean . i ' ve never played reach ' s multiplayer so i can ' t say much about the problems you mentioned , though they do seem pretty bad . personally my main draws were more from the single player modes , especially campaign . i thought the alien invasion story was actually quite good , since it showed how massive and powerful the covenant was , and how ill  equipped the humans really were to fight them . it was definitely more grounded and military  based than the other games , but i personally liked that sense of desperation and scale the setting gave off .

7. completely agree . as far as content goes , dc is really playing their b teams . there ' s also gotham , which is another batman show , basically without batman . dc is really great , which is why it ' s such a shame to see them flounder around like this . i ' m arguably more of a marvel guy all around  but batman is still maybe my favourite . i love superman too , and grew up with the animated series of both . you ' re right that they need something on that scale to get people interested . better , even . they need something like game of thrones level of scope , but that isn ' t too mature like got is  and it has to have main line heros . do a traditional batman or superman story , but do it well and tell it from the beginning not a prequel . hell , do a batman beyond or super sons shows . then you keep the core of the cast but tell it from a different angle . just do something that feels like a core dc experience .
