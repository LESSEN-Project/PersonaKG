1. virginity is a made  up concept . it doesn ' t affect your worth in any way , shape , or form . you should choose to have sex when you feel it ' s right for you . if you want to have sex just so you can say you ' ve done it , that ' s also fine . you should just do what you want , basically so long as it does ' t harm anyone else obviously .

2. your perspective on sex at your age and while in college is wise and will get you places . the last thing you want is to get a girl pregnant . hang on to your current beliefs , let everyone else throw their lives away . wait for someone who you can see yourself in a relationship with and go from there .

3. hey , first off , i wanna thank you for being real with how you feel . and congrats to losing 90lbs , that ' s absolutley insane ! the first thing i thought of was the concept of " stinkin thinkin " and how our mind sometimes plays sick games on us by saying we are " not good enough " in reference to tinder , , , anyone can make a profile so why would you deny yourself the opportunity to have one if you want one and try it . you may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome . but it starts with you making one and knowing that if others can have it , you can too . also youre so young that you can bounce outta this mindset . first i would take your chance on the girl you want . ask her to the gym or something , and if that doesnt work , go in on the tinder and try what have you got to lose ? nothin , but a mindset that needs updated . im sorry if thats harsh because i do empathize feeling that way , because ive been there but ive found the way out too by putting one foot in front of the other and takin that chance with a girl . i believe in you bruddah

4. no big red flags here . you look attractive from this angle . unless you are hiding something from the waist down that is a deal breaker . this particular pic makes your complexion look very pale , but that ' s not a bad thing , at least in my opinion .

5. but isn ' t this the natural thing to do ? didn ' t evolution say the " hotter " girls are the ones to survive ? just as the more tough , brute force boys are to attract the girls ? denying this almost seems the same to me as trying to convince gay people they should be straight . i ' m all in favor of promoting intelligence , but then we end up with kids that sit behind computers or grow up and sit behind desks all day at work and slowly fatten and waste away . why can ' t we promote kids to be both good looking and smart ? self  esteem is important , both in your personal hygiene  grooming habits , and in your intelligence . i agree super  model only mentality is wrong , but we need a healthy balance , not a swing shift to the other extreme of how we talk to little girls . tell them they look good and they ' re smart .

6. but we shouldn  t say that being obese is okay as a society , but if you want to stay fat thats your choice but you shouldn  t spread fake ideals

7. youre in 9th , youve got loooong ways to go . one day you  ll come across a girl who will make you feel infinitely better than that girl might have ever made you ir could have made you . what im saying is , youll know when you find your first love , and i can guarantee youll look back at this and laugh .

8. i ' m around the same age as you and i ' m digit  sure i ' m bi , hun there should be no such thing as it being too early to know who you love !

9. i ' m not sure how you don ' t have a slew of comments here , but i ' d say that you ' re better built that digit   of the overweight us here i ' m sure someone will object with that . i ' d say that you ' re a catch for most anyone and if you had some desire to get more defined , you are at a perfect starting point . from what you ' re posting here , i ' d think that your body isn ' t what ' s kept you single . get on out there and have confidence .
