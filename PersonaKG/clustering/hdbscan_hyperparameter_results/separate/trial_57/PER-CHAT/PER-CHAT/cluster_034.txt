4. i see your point but for an equal relationship where both parties are happy you need to care for your partner too , maybe it  s something you don  t really care about but i mean that  s how i do my thing and you do yours .

6. i want to be faithful , but i don ' t want to be the one who gets screwed over and ends up alone . i feel like the way to prevent that from happening is to play along with this game , and not take this dating thing too seriously until i ' m certain that the girl i ' m with is the one i want to spend the rest of my life with .

7. yes , if said person a lives close enough for me to pop in when i want to set a date or talk to them in general amd b they are cool with me actually doing that . tried dating a guy with only limited cell service and from another city . it was just too much work .
