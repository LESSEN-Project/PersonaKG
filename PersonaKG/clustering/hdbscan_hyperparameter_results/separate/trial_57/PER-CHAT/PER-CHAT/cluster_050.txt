1. watch tv or movies in the language you ' re trying to learn . you will be amazed at how much you can learn from just hearing the same words over and over again and matching it up with the context of the scene . then you can test yourself by removing the subtitles for a couple of scenes .

2. it is a matter of degrees  digit . one on one and someone i am familiar with , family and friends  non issue a new acquaintances or co  workers  stand back and observe their behavior and try to find common interests before talking to them ! group situation , if sitting in a discussion circle or classroom  might listen until i have something to contribute ! standing in front of the group talking  i am very out of my comfort zone  worried that my tongue twist words , my mind is racing and i lose my train of thought , or chasing something completely off topic op , i hope that answers your question !

3. dude , i think the main part of social skills is knowing different social clues  hints people give . for example  someone on their phone  they are busy and find it rude when people try to interrupt them someone looks really happy and approachable  most likely would be willing to talk to you someone is responding in few words , doesn ' t sound very engaged  probably not interested and sometimes , these social ques can help you determine how well the conversation is going , and maybe signal that you ' re doing something wrong

5. pay attention in class . if you can ' t make sure you learn and research the material . a good gauge it to know when you can reverse the information you have for analysis or association with other matters . or if you are able to via impromptu explain concepts to your friends . by the time the mid terms arrive you are prepared with a foundation , all you need is sleep and a quick glance at the glossary for a refresher .

7. i wanted to expand on this just a little bit . don ' t feel awkward asking questions . i always felt awkward asking questions because i was afraid that i would be the only one who knows the answer . it turns out that the majority of the time there is somebody else wondering the same thing . so don ' t ever feel embarrassed to ask . it helps a lot
