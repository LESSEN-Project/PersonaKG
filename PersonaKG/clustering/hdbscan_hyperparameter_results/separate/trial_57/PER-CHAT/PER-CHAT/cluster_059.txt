1. forget about skin color . that  s just completely irrelevant . who cares what color anyone in this story is ? if someone breaks into your home , you have the right to shoot them ! i don  t own a gun but shit like this makes me want to get one . you have a right to protect your home and yourself and the person who broke in is a criminal and should have been aware of the risks ! bring on the downvotes , i don  t care . seems like i  m the only person here with any sense in their head ! why are you sticking up for someone who broke into someone else  s home ? play stupid games , win stupid prizes ! duh !

2. i see the point you  re trying to make . everyone can agree that human slavery is in no way justifiable . at the end of the day this discussion comes down to ethics . on the comment you posted that i had originally commented on you said that the cops should go ahead and handle it themselves instead of sending the k9 . why does the human get the pass to go into danger but not the dog ? the answer is  those cops chose that career . anything that happens beyond that door is on them , they  re there because they love this job and they chose to do this . the only difference was consent . real consent , not forced . the dog , although a very smart animal did not express any decision or have a choice . so here  s where our discussion is going to pretty much come to an end . the dog can  t tell us if it would or would not like to do this . if the dog could speak english and said  i love being a police dog and i want to do this forever  you may be supportive ! dogs can  t speak , but when any animal is raised a certain way and is deprived of any alternatives , no other options in lifestyle are even a thought in their minds . for example  a human child growing up in war , and knows nothing but how to kill and fight and die for their country and has nothing but passion and love for that country could never believe one day that their country isn  t worth dying for . purely because at the stage of puppy or human baby , it  s mental development is heavily influenced by its environment . a german shepard puppy growing up in police training camps with its new assigned k  digit unit police officer is going to know nothing but their trained commands and  i love my owner  . they could love the life or they could dream of something else with no violence . or they could even not have these thoughts at all . we just don  t know . i also want to side with you to say that we shouldn  t put dogs into danger , but we put those puppies in those police camps in the first place for human gain . unfortunately it  s been a trend throughout history to use animals for work or food etc . i don  t like it either honestly . i  m having a hard time disagreeing with you

3. if the worst thing a person can do is kill another person , there is something inherently wrong in our government doing that same thing .

4. street gangs want power for profit and respect from other groups . religious extremists only care about themselves . it  s less about power and more about them looking good to the diety they believe in . i worked in retail for digit years , i dealt with my fair share of people who will speak to checkout staff like shit but wouldn  t dare repeat the same sentence on the street . i chalk it up to them being treated like shit either at home or at work and so they release their frustration on people who they know can  t talk back or break their nose .

5. we  re talking about australian laws and politics , so digging your heels in and pretending like we all have to bow to your laws and historical events is again , not a good argument . being egged in this manner is not considered assault here . it  s not violence . it  s silly  that  s the entire point . what is violence is hate speech . in my opinion fear mongering is too . killing digit innocent men women and children is violence . don  t get me wrong i think egging people is a fucking stupid method of protest . we not too long ago had a pm get head butted by a dude called dj funknukl . that is assault and he got charged . i don  t like that pm he  s a piece of shit but doesn  t deserve to be on the receiving end of violence . what is very different is the act , the intent , the events of causation and the parties involved .

6. i think it is folly to claim religion or faith are at issue here . you think that without religion this person would not have done this ? the issue is humans are animals and they do some nasty shit . i watched someone set digit people on fire the other day , watched the police shoot a guy in the back and watch him bleed out , watched kids killing insects with glee while their parents watch on , seen soldiers throw puppies off cliff along with many other acts with degrees of nastyness . i don ' t think in most cases these were performed acting as gods right arm or with any religious intent . people do shit because they want to and would probably find an excuse or reasoning to justify their actions . that guy kills because of god , others kill because they play too many video games , others kill because it makes them horny . we are all missing the point . humans are nasty , disgusting pieces of shit and are all capable of horiffic things . its just some people do it where the rest of us don ' t religion or not

7. i don ' t understand your point ? are you ok with having someone kick your ass for jaywalking ? if not then we can agree that vigilantism isn ' t permitted .

8. it ' s hard to judge if someone need to go to an asylum or in prison . i think that most of serial killers have just a thought , a goal , a way of seeing the world , that convince them or not to kill . stupid example  hitler . he had really stupid belief but i dont think we can call him mentally illed . or maybe , i don ' t really know much about him . anyway , we can ' t put in an asylum people who have different belief or who draw the ethic line further than most of us .

9. you seem to think i ' m a trump supporter because you don ' t like what i have to say . well i am a resigerter dem . and i hated trump long before he was president . i never liked regan since the iran contra . i just don ' t see why a news group that has been pointed out for being racist is calling a dead person a racist . too what end ? what will this accomplish ? what do we all have to gain from knowing a dead person is racist ? remember when howard cosell said " look at that monkey run " talking about a black football player on national tv ? we should write an article about that too right , because racism is the hot ticket to free press right now .

10. i have never stated that disobeying an officer means you deserve to die . i don  t think that at all , i think that anyone when encountering the police should obey an officers orders because it gives you the best chance of getting through the situation with a a better outcomelesser charges and b reduces risk of bodily harm . please don  t put hateful intentions onto me as i wouldn  t apply them to you . i  ll i want is for people to be more informed on police work , by doing so we make lives easier for everyone
