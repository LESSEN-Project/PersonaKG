1. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .

2. what  s even more comical is your mindless assumption that everyone is an american . how dare i comment on your president ? well i , like you , live in a democracy , and my freedom of speech allows me to comment how i want on reddit , and to also express the opinion that your president is an embarrassing fuckwit . as for my opinion , of course it isn  t irrelevant you pompous ass , it  s no more irrelevant than yours , your neighbors or even your sad leader . america has so much global influence and sets itself as a global leader that the the world is pretty much fucking obligated to have an opinion of you and your country . mostly you lot are delightful and interesting but sometimes , as is the case with your current president , we are frankly baffled as to what the fuck you thought you were doing when you voted him in . but really , with your anachronistic collegiate system and non compulsory voting , it  s frankly a big spin of the wheel for you guys . or in donald  s case russian roulette . and while i  m at it fuck the australian political situation too , and their fucking glass houses .

3. well you were correct which does say something . i will say that i would hope more minorities would agree with what i ' m saying , those who have experienced the worst of discrimination are usually the most motivated to end it .

4. which is what i believe but if you are to take any trending reddit or tweet it makes your country seem very black and white again this is to an outsider looking in personally i think your president has done good and he has done bad , much like every other country ' s leader . hey , would you look at that , a european and an american have managed to have a civil discussion on wwii and american politics without throwing insults . this isn ' t right . fuck your stupid sports teams , you ' re not world champions if it ' s only teams from your own country taking part .

5. i would certainly agree with you on healthcare although from an outsider looking in it seems a very controversial topic in your country but to most non americans your health care is lunacy especially when we see medical bills running into the hundreds of thousands although i ' m do appreciate some of these may be dramatised for upvotes i was explaining an american colleague a short while ago that we are entitled to at least digit months off full pay for maternity leave , she was gobsmacked .

6. all i  m trying to say is , if their goal is to include everyone , why exclude white people ? yes we have done horrible things in the past , but we changed

7. like any other social  political meme , the only affected are the ones accurately depicted in said memes . if you are not an automaton there ' s no reason to feel offended for it .
