5. without any legal knowledge , i would say that concealed carry permits are obviously made to protect you , and that cops cant assume that a gun shaped bulge is a gun . so i assume , to avoid shooting and killing law abiding suspects , they would yell out " i think he has a gun " allowing the suspect to say " i have a permit " then lay on the ground or something along those lines . and even if they dont have it , i wouldn ' t mention it or touch it and just let them find it , then ask you why you had a gun or just figure it out after inspecting your file , because if you have a conceal carry permit , your name and other identifying data would be in some sort of private government  police database on the event you are arrested .
