1. that ' s funny you say that , i was say the same thing . i think it ' s because of the genetics . nyc has more straight up caribbean and west african folks .

2. right so my school is the exact opposite . the girls can wear their skirt however they want as long as you can ' t see their underwear , you sometimes can get away with not even wearing a tie , your shoes need only be black and " polishable " but people still just wear black runners , you can wear what ever you want for p . e . and people insult each other so much that it ' s weird if you don ' t . it ' s a very tallaght thing to say things like " i was inside your mother " or " your mother loves my dick . it ' s not just an xbox live " i fucked your mom " we ' re sophisticated about it . the first years drink more than the sixth years and loads of people do drugs mostly weed . the underage drinking is rampent and to be honest i don ' t think it ' s really a problem because despite being kids , they enjoy it reponsibly soooooo .

3. i had people look at me weird riding around with a full face . i don ' t wear power ranger gear or ride a sportbike , which i guess people in il think a full face is only for that kind of guy . part of the outfit , they think . i look out of place . fuck that , i like my head .

4. i don ' t get why people thinks it ' s acceptable to do this . if you scold them for it they go , " you don ' t understand , you ' re not a parent . " i understand you don ' t talk about bodily fluids while others eat . you teach your kids that when they ' re little , so why are you doing it ?

5. i mean , a random person being uncomfortable shouldn ' t be a reason someone can ' t do something . fat people walk around in speedos on the beach at the time and i ' m sure people feel uncomfortable but just because they ' re over weight we can ' t make them cover up . that would be discrimination .

6. maybe it ' s just me but i don ' t think i ' ve ever really been around people who really care that much about how others get their rocks off , and i ' ve lived in three different countries all over the world . sure , people might crack a joke or tease someone for it , but i don ' t think anyone really cares any more than they would if they found out about any other fetish . it ' s simply a non  issue . that ' s why the parades  culture thing feels so bizarre to me . it ' s as if they are deliberately attracting attention and criticism by shouting about something that the general public couldn ' t care less about .

7. do people who smell bad really get pulled out of places ? i  ve never heard that before . how would you propose keeping it out of social settings without legislating it then , if you don  t want to make those actions illegal .
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

8. i go to a very liberal school , and everyone ' s chill . i used to go to a girls school i ' m ftm and no one cared . kids today are so calm with that stuff . you might get ignorance , but nothing horrible . ofc i live in london , so if you ' re in the bible belt of america or smth it might be a different story

9. yup ! because apparently people kept asking her why her teenage daughter had e cups . omg ! i  m so sorry to hear that my aunts have said the same thing about me . i absolutely hated going to parties and literally avoided all social events that required women to dress in fancy dresses because nothing would fit me and my mum would literally humiliate me at every store . and to make matters worse , my aunties would always say things like  ugh , why does your mum even bother trying to find you dresses that fit ? you  re hopeless . start saving for a reduction

10. i went to one and while i do agree that it can stunt social growth when it comes to interacting with women the only reason it affected me is because no one asked me to hang out with them on weekends . all my friends hung out with girls outside of school , there was an all girls school next door . most people here seem to think that social opportunities don ' t exist outside the school gates but as long as my kids do then i can ' t see any reason not to send them to one .
