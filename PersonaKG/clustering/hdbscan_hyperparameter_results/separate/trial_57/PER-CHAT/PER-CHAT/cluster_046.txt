3. i am manual as well . maybe that is the issue ? funny thing about who to bring in as a double team is highlighted by the triangle . it shows why in the middle of calling a guy it can change . not a fan of that but has always happened that way and now you can see it .

4. ok it very possibly could be runes . what should be my line  up then with my current digit  team ? it is toa normal . i couldn ' t play during the last free rune removal day , so there is some rune swapping i had planned but couldn ' t do . i never miss days but that one particular day i just couldn ' t play . so angry .

5. here is how you test it . take the side panel off and play the game if the temps are bad then it ' s your graphics card . if the temps are good then it ' s a air flow . also did you install new drivers ?

6. if you can ' t switch by pressing a or x then you got to go on the settings to fix it .

11. it ' s in the pda , one of the tabs . it ' s got each signal and a check box or something to turn it off . once i found it , it seemed pretty intuitive to me . if you still have trouble i can send a screenshot later when i get home .

14. sorry on mobile so i booted up the game today and accidentally clicked kyf instead of killer  the game lagged out for maybe a straight minute and then loaded killer without me backing out of kyf and selecting killer killer loaded weird , i had all the perks at rank three but all four perk slots , both addon slots and the offering slot were locked and all the cosmetics except mike ' s bloody mask eventually it smartened up but never did give me my mask back or take away the overalls . i ' ve even played a few matches and still nothing

17. remember to drag your health pot on the r icon . good job , you basically became immortal for the early game . yeah it ' s fun that they made an ability that heals for digit at green level if you include the shield .  reaper  s edge and legendary amulet of energy are nice on lucie . i would usually take ravager on lucie since it increases damage and healing so it boosts the lucie r heal , plus the max health bonus is very nice , but reaper is definitely 2nd pick for me .   x200b  but yeah overall sls seriously needs to nerf lucie a lot , digit seconds more on space doesn ' t do much when you can hit legendary e through counters and shields .   x200b
