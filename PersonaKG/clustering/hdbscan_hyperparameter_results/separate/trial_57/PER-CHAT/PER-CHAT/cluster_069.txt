1. i read it last year and didn ' t really care for it . i think the religious  mystical aspects didn ' t appeal to me , and so much of it was about that . i ' m not going to read any other books in the series .

4. this isnt the carmack  romero doom we all grew up with . its a breed of it own with lots of the original ' s elements combined with the developer ' s own visions and i fucking love it . lets face it , its not likely we will see another doom exactly like the original , which is why i will still always play the original . but i am in love with what i am seeing now .

5. idk , i  m able to relate to nearly every message and character in the book . halliday  s created the most immersive  video game  in the universe and yet it  s so much more than that . people get lost in it .  the missing millions .  all just because he wanted people to like what he liked . and that somebody like wade who had quite literally nothing but passion and skill for the same things was able to beat his game . i think cline wrote every character perfectly , being able to understand their plights , i mean even sorrentos character was compelling , somebody you really wanted to hate . the references were insane . i didn  t even grow up with the old school games but the attention to detail was incredible . in an era where aaa titles don  t even come with enough content for digit month , cline was able to imagine up a place where everything was under digit platform , the whole world shared halliday  s creation , gunter or not . free learning , unlimited content , whatever your hobby was , it was in the oasis . i  ve never wanted something to be as real as i do the oasis . but the themes hit home too . the problems with being overly connected , letting the real world pass you by . the want and need to not let corporations rule the world . i just think it  s amazing start to finish . i understand liking something and later feeling differently but man , this book , i don  t think i  ll ever get tired of .

7. the fact that with one piece of personal exposition in the entire game can set the entire story down an epic path perfectly is how it captivated me . the ending was by far the first and best plot twist i have ever had the pleasure to experience . the last metroid is in captivity . the galaxy is at peace .
