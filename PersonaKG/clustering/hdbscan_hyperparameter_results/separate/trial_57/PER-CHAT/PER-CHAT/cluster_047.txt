1. i always wondered why people like you feel the need to be dicks on the internet . is it because in real life you  re pushovers who don  t know how to earn respect or stand up for your selves ? is this your outlet ?

5. yep , you ' re totally just ignoring this . you didn ' t make a comment about how you were unsubscribing or respond to my comment . i can see how you just mind your own business and ignore things . you ' re totally not acting like a whiny snowflake at all .

6. fair point and i fully agree with you , but you " should  have hidden paxter redwyne ' s username , or seek him out in the forum and inform him that you have exposed his opinion here . because as it is he sounds like an ignorant and may not even know . he deserves a right to reply and clarify his opinion  correct his mistake .

7. no worries man i was just trying to suggest that we greet newcomers like this with advice instead . something like " you need to chill . for your own good . or you ' ll be disappointed . or something that makes them feel welcome . that last guy deleted his thread . didn ' t seem like he felt welcome at all . and he was just happy to finally have made up his mind .

8. it ' s funny how you make fun of me because i made a mistake and you make even more of them .
   (ID: f491028c794855d1611365b07d4525f7b98173ae)

9. i am following the rules of this sub , and spreading out my posts . none of my posts have had the same core point nor were they copy and pasted versions with each one being written completely originally and from scratch so i am not spamming . i am providing detailed arguments of the lore , and discussing those arguments with others here . and in the process i have remained respectful to those who disagree with me , despite several trying use insults to make me back down . an echo chamber is not healthy for the community . and if you want me to leave the subreddit completely simply because you disagree with an opinion on the lore , that is exactly what you are promoting .

10. why would sjaak say anything negative . doesn ' t make sense . that ' s why i said seems like there ' s only two options in your world to praise or to criticize i downvote almost never . but this conversation asks for it
