1. i live and study in s . a . i ' m not from here though . there are pros and cons to living here . one of the pros is the cultural diversity and also the quality of education i think people quality education only exists in western countries . i ' m doing my fourth year right now and everything is fast paced and the workload is too much . there are only digit people in my class so it ' s more intimate . someone mentioned the effects of apartheid . it ' s digit  accurate . the racial stuff is still a bit tense i haven ' t experienced overt racism but they ' re working on it . i ' ve noticed that south africans usually stick with their racial groups but find a mixed race group of individuals and you ' ll be fine . the crime is terrible but it definitely teaches you to be alert all the time . this is something i wasn ' t before so i guess i learned something . face  with  tears  of  joy

2. please note  i am sorry if i sound ridiculous or well off the mark . i ' m from nrth qld , and have no real sense of what the city of adelaide is like . i am happy to not live near the heart of the city , so long as my labouring  standard job type partner can work close enough to the home , there is a nice school in the area , and there would be a doctor or hospital close enough if one of us or my kids needed emergency care . also being from the north , our threat is cyclones so i would be clueless and terrified in a fire . so i would not be the best to live in the middle of a fire threat zone etc . thanks for being patient and i do google earth the area a lot . i like the look of the suburbs in the area i circled but i ' m not sure if they are actually suburbs or if they are small communities considered " way out .

3. think about your network . can you build one quickly , can you survive without it ? if the answer is no , don ' t go . you are married . how does your husband feel about it ? is your relationship solid enough for long distance . if it works out , what will your husband do for work ? can he transfer ? its your decision , but you are also a team . if he doesn ' t want to leave or can ' t , you may not want to take the job . can your finances handle supporting two households ? if you move to establish the homebase across the country , your husband still needs to maintain the current home . this means a strain on the finances . can you afford it ? do you want to ?

4. they are not exactly the same . the prescribe dextroamphetamine in the usa and dexamphetamine in australia and new zealand . i am adhd and have been diagnosed and medicated in all three countries . my australian doctor told me that they are the same chemical compound but not the same molecular structure as each other . in my experience dexamphetamine dexies as the aussies call them doesn  t have as high of a climb or crash as dextroamphetimine like adderall i can actually feel myself come up and crash on whereas the dexies were a lot smoother of a ride .

5. im canadian as well ! our choices were public school a vs . public school b , since our part of the country doesn ' t have private schools most people go where their friends go . are there like high schools based on your interests , like art  focused , math  focused , english  focused schools and so on , or is it more like some that are just straight up better than others ?

7. austin , madison , ithaca are full . if you want to be really hip , find the next cool town . as weird as it may sound , omaha is the town that most reminds me of those cities twenty years ago .
