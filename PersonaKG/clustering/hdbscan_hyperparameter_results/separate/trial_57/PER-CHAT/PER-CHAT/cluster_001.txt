1. it depends on if your area has a shopkeeper ' s law or not . if it does they may be legally allowed to detain you long enough to determine whether you ' ve stolen anything .

3. basically they wanted a discount , so of course they  knew the owner  and made a name up . so catching the blatant lie , i firmly say i am the owner , and they turned red and left . funniest lie i  ve ever told , it was obvious i wasn  t the owner but it was hilarious that they believed me .

4. " hi and welcome to apple care , my name is kidkrid , how can i help you today ? " worst job of my life . the people that called were digit  brain dead and i had managers who liked to think they were running a gulag . being called in to see a manager was basically a nice way of saying you were about to interrogated over " excessive " toilet breaks or taking too long to help a customer . yeah you read that right . if you couldn  t fix a problem within a specific time , you were supposed to make the poor bastard call back and jump the hoops with another tech who likely had nfi what he  she was doing . yup . a lot of those techs are clueless . don ' t bother calling apple unless it ' s a hardware fault and you can ' t get to a store . google will fix your shit for free , assuming you have half a brain . tl  dr apple can suck a rancid cock .

5. upon parking my car , my co  worker chimed in with " watching you pull in makes me wish your dad pulled out " my parking job was fine , btw . we just roast eachother at every opportunity .

6. i got a job through an agency . once my probation period was over , to keep me on they ' d need to pay the agency a fee . they asked me to say i found another job to the agency and keep it a secret . i worked there for a few months , the finance crisis hit and that division of the company folded making all the employees unemployed . because i ' d been there less than a year , they didn ' t have to pay me severance package .

7. due to the blatant disregard to what happened . why risk your job after working there a year and lose the reference for future jobs ? why choose a place that would inevitably get you caught and fired ? the fact that he couldn ' t stop laughing after he was busted . he could have easily been an asshole who just doesn ' t care , but he never really gave that impression during the time i knew him .

8. anywhere except where op works . i didn ' t even get a reprimand . the guy didn ' t ask to see any sort of supervisor . sounds like i was being rude , i know , but in my line of work , you can give as well as you get . its sort of the best version of customer service ever .
   (ID: 20b71c431f98b1f88ec1b3e7ada79d31df65a8c2)

9. i had been at my job only a few weeks . the guy i worked closest with was a real jerk . he gave me one hershey kiss . just to act like i wasn  t embarrassed i said thanks and immediately ate it . everyone else in the office told him that was a dick move . he said ,  just kidding  and gave me the case of beer he carried around in the trunk of his car . he later got fired for being a total slacker and i got his job .

10. i think some people might be missing the point of your question , like how do they know exactly which glass belongs to who ? with regards to refills ? cause taking a drinks order isn ' t hard if you do it all the time . but giving back the same glass ? i ' ve never given the same one back , fresh glass everytime , unless the customer is in front of me at the bar and asks for it specifically in that particular glass they already have .
