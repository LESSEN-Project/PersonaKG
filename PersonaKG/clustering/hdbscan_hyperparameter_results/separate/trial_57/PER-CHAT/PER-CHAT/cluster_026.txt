   (ID: 60d49a425809d6f450335028a75a5202d3b84678)

   (ID: 62c69b1a271bb5e2ce4d49d965429de0d3e1baf0)

5. everyone  s there to improve , most people who know this aren  t paying attention to anyone else and most likely enjoy seeing other people there to better themselves . imo anyone who shames other people for trying to do that is just an asshole

6. yeah , man , and this marijuana is so toxic , too ! i have to hold it in when my boss goes by because i  m just addicted to the distraction from life it provides . you know , kinda like social media . oh wait ! i don  t let potentially bad habits get in the way of my life because i take responsibility rather than blame something that has to be initiated by me . reddit doesn  t just have trolls . some of us are just pedantically logical , i guess .

7. they do it because they don ' t agree with a comment because they are insecure and negative people
   (ID: f17c5192b8fcf82d4857fe8b8d226705db4093e3)

8. i think it may just be because those who agree with you have nothing to say because they agree with you . that and what i said above .
   (ID: bcc358a962db9a4f0dfe3ff1da87a6880605e292)

   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

10. so you can dish it out but not take it ? are you surprised to find that when you ' re rude , other people are rude back ? welcome to the world , sweet summer child .
