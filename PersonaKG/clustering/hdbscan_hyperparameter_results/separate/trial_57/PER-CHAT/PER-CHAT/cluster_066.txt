3. actually , seeing as adventure time has a huge following of people who love it so much , and it ' s gotten a lot of praise from professional critics , you ' re the one who ' s a lot more likely to be wrong here . just because you don ' t like something doesn ' t make it bad . do you even have a legitimate reason to hate at ? how many episodes did you even watch ? you can dislike something all you want , but your opinion does not decide how good or bad something actually is . at is a quality show , whether you like it or not .

4. i don ' t know if u know this but primer was made on a budget of  7k . that ' s practically a home movie when compared to any standard hollywood movie . it ' s praised for its creativity and concept and nothing else . also you don ' t need humor in every movie . some movies are meant to be serious . humor is not the only thing that entertains people . i would say it wasn ' t as per your taste . it ' s a fine movie and it entertained me .

5. disliked infers general distaste . there is almost always a few diamonds in the rough . i think i can say i persally dislike a genre that has like digit artists total that had the poetic real life stuff . there is nothing real in rap or hip hop these days . hell nothings real in any music . it ' s all pre recorded , written by old white guys and remastered to hell and back . or conversely shouted drunken stoned out ramblings of people with more fame then brains .

6. i couldn ' t get past the scene where the guys lifted up the kids shirt to see if they had boobs . digit . this doesn ' t happen in real life digit . nobody thinks like this digit . this doesn ' t happen in real life .   x200b  and this is coming from a high school student who has many lgbt friends i ' m gay myself   x200b  i do hate this constant pc shit too . like , yes , it is good for there to be acceptance in a show , but when a message is forced down my throat , i feel almost compelled to take the exact opposite standpoint ? am i alone in this ?

7. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show

8. i haven ' t seen it . i still love the books though they ' re fun but it ' s the fandom that i hate
   (ID: 339d06087e421a1cf86d695af2a2088546f9dc91)

9. i have had people irl that did not like it , or had various complaints about it , but none of my irl die hard fan friends have been as passionately against it like all of the keyboard warriors . i will say that more casual fans that i know enjoyed it or thought it was alright versus the die hard fans i know . quite a few die hards i know did not like it , some at all , but have been nowhere near as upset as the online community seems to be . i guess by the pure definition of divisive , my statement does mean the movie is divisive , but i don ' t have the experiences irl of the feedback being as vitriolic as it is online . that may be a better comparison or question now that i think about it . most any movie is going to be divisive to an extent , but the vitriol for this one at least in my experience outside of the internet seems to be relegated only to the online community .

10. i keep wanting to watch rick and morty cause it seems like a fun show but literally everyone i  ve met irl who watches it literally makes me not want to watch it . walking in the halls of my school and hearing digit different people yell  pickle rick  really turns me off of the show . a shame really as i would like to watch it .
