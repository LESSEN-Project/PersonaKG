Total from this dataset: 9

1. i don ' t get where this suggestion comes from , that someone who doesn ' t want to be with anybody must have low self esteem . quite the opposite . those who are comfortable with themselves have far more self esteem than people who can ' t live without the validation of another person  other people . relationships are for the weak .

2. why are you asking this ? like other people said there ' s nothing wrong with it , they don ' t hurt anyone for me as long as they don ' t convince others to be gay i ' m ok with it , they ' re humans just like you and me

3. there is a breech of trust when incest happens . family members are some of the only people in life who you should feel completely sure don ' t want to be around you just so they can fuck you . if you take that away , ultimately you will miss the feeling of being around people you know don ' t find you sexually compatible , but still like you anyway .

4. people are seldom rational about their sexuality . the flip side is that being in a relationship is so socialized into people from an early age that they fail to recognize that it  s an active decision that you need to make with another person and then participate in , the latter involving a continuous renewal of  wanting it  . you can look at others and feel sexually charged ! that  s human , but failing to recognize the decision you  ve made to be in a relationship is an active process is something that a lot of people end up screwing up . it  s not to make it sound like a chore ! certainly too there are other configurations of and agreements to relationships , but the primary recognition , as far as i  m concerned , is that you have to be an adult and responsible for making a choice to be in it . otherwise , why bother ?

5. got to be pretty insane to be against it . once a marriage doesn ' t work anymore that ' s the only option .

6. okay but what about men who sleep around ? it  s fine to think this as long as you hold men to the same standard

7. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .

8. i guess i just don ' t see an issue if all participants of the polygamist relationship are consenting adults . who am i to take away rights from people that i have nothing to do with or understand ?

9. not being preachy but maybe look at potential partners other aspects mental  spiritual , lifestyle choices etc . and see if those are healthy  attractive . people can change but if you are dating someone in a rut , it will be ten times harder for them to better themselves once dating and that ' s the real ugly side of relationships . if you think you are shallow about appearances then you might be using it as an excuse to not address other flags from that person . unfortunately it is so easy to rate people based on image so it ' s just a constant effort to remind yourself .
