SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 8

1. i don ' t care what they prefer , to be frank . shemale is unacceptable but ladyboy is . just imagine the logic in that when shemale is slightly more accurate . if you can ' t use logic to help facilitate your mental illness , then you probably shouldn ' t transition to begin with . i will say this though . trans chicks may be fast approaching the point of no return in telling their difference from biological women , but they still tend to be more humble than said women . i ' d sooner trust one of them not to steal from me than i would a natural woman . because they actually have to work to look how they want . a biological woman hasn ' t worked a day in her life .

2. act natural , because why would you put such a big filter on yourself if you were to actually marry that person . it  s pretty unrealistic that you would keep the filter on for the rest of your life .

3. the relationships i ' ve valued most came from the women i didn ' t initially think were the most beautiful . life has nothing to do with looks . if you don ' t have a real relationship until you ' re digit , consider yourself lucky  it ' s all a waste of time . bullshit this , bullshit that . most dudes just want a hole to stick their cock in and are willing to lie to you every word they say to get that . some women have figured that out gonewild exists for a reason . don ' t feel dependent on a relationship for happiness or validation . that ' s only going to be a let down . once you feel happy with yourself , love will come naturally . ask anyone over digit thats been through a few divorces  you have to love yourself to love another . anything else is lying to yourself to pretend to feel happy .

4. don  t go for it . it  s an asshole thing to do to crush on another girl while you have a girlfriend . i feel so bad for her . you shouldn  t go for your friend  s girlfriend . your friend  s . either enjoy the relationship you have or don  t have one at all

5. if you don ' t care about whether she likes you or not why do you care about how she looks ? her hair doesn ' t actually impact your life in any way from what i can tell . let her do her and you do you , everybodies happy .

6. maybe don  t make it obvious your a sub at first , ease into how you like your sex after you  ve built a rapport .

7. if you worry about  style  you  re letting some clown decide your life for you . screw it . be yourself .
   (ID: 0a256f5eb4d0481e09649002ce3285a96bf18329)

8. forget about how you ' re supposed to act to be a man . just be you . for example , you ' re about to be of legal drinking age . you want a sherly temple at the bar while everyone else is doing shots and chugging beer ? fuck them . get your sherly temple and drink it with pride . trust me , it ' ll work out .
