1. sounds like you need to get out of the relationship you are in first . sounds like the least you could do for this person you are married too .

2. basically at the end of this year it is as if the whole world shattered for me and i had the possibility to start again . during the summer i got the chance to create some new great friendships , i joined the scouts and most of my current friends all come from that group and i finally built memories i want to remember . it is something i never felt because i ' ve always been classified as weird and i rarely met people really interested in me . so when i met this girl circa four years ago and she made me believe we were friends , she became my world if it makes sense . she manipulated me very easily and then she left me roughly once i started questioning her ways . now i can see through her crap and the only reason i don ' t want to see her anymore is that i feel like everything has changed and i don ' t want to get back to that world of rumors and fake friendships .

3. yta . those things are important to discuss in therapy . and even outside of therapy , she is allowed to confide in a close friend or two . gossiping and talking shit about your relationship is rude , but being honest and open with a therapist and even w friends is healthy . feeling like you need to hide details about a relationship is a red flag .

4. this wasn ' t your fault . yes , it was inappropriate masturbate in someone else ' s house especially govern the fact that you had already had a run in before , but , and i can ' t stress this enough , you were not at fault . you did not have sex with a married woman . you were raped by a married woman . it must be beneficial for you to speak to a professional , one who specializes in working with rape victims and rape advocacy . there is no right way of doing way to proceed , but a professional can help you find the best way for you . our would be beneficial in my opinion to have a record of what happened , should she end up pregnant . a therapist or rape counselor will help document what happened , but will only release or testify of you allow it . if you need to vent , feel free to message me . i ' m not a professional , but i ' m more than happy to lend an ear .

5. i don ' t really see how you weren ' t supportive of her . she seemed to make her mind up on plenty of issues without you and you ' ve tried to approach them all in a logical way . also she purposeful tries to do things that hurt you ? that ' s unsupportive . you might have to let her go . i think it ' ll be better for both of you .

6. just let go . it isn ' t worth it . there is nothing he can tell you that will make you feel any better . " closure " is a mythological beast , an elusive unicorn that everyone in your position hunts for . " if only i could understand " and " if i just knew what happened , i ' d feel better " are its mating calls . don ' t trust it . it lies . there is nothing that will make you feel better , more resolved , more ok with the break up . it won ' t happen . it ' s sad that he has some of your things , but unless they are priceless , irreplacable family heirlooms , let them go and just move on .
   (ID: 87dcb06b0e31b35730fe93ce7dcbef85e6078b40)

7. sounds like she  s too shallow to understand your pov and what you  ve been through . personally , that trait alone could make or break a relationship for me .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

8. i  m sorry i can  t offer some kind of fix all solution for you . it  s a tragic thing  years later and my mother  s still stuck in her old ways . the only thing you can do for them is try to be supportive . as i learned , though , some people . they really just don  t want to get better . it  s a sad life to live , and it hurts to see , but there truly isn  t much you can do . patience is key , and if they can truly find it in themselves to seek a better life , then they will  it may take days or it may take years . overall , it  s just a question of ,  is it worth it ?  do you truly want to stick around through thick and thin , then the answer is yes . unfortunately , i believe you  re already doing all you can by being a supportive friend . maybe he  s not quite as far gone as my mother was , and a family  friend intervention could at least get the wheels turning ? other than that , i regret to say that i have no advice . best of luck xx

9. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .

10. it takes as long as you need . i know that  s not a concrete answer but everyone is different , and everyone handles this kind of stuff differently . but it  s important to not force yourself to move on because you may suppress some feelings that you never fully dealt with . it  s okay to be sad , and it  s okay to be sad for a while  there  s no need to rush .

11. my boyfriend ' s brother committed suicide a few days after i viewed the half of my cat that wasn ' t eaten by coyotes . immediately after finding out , he fell to the floor , screamed , and bashed his head into the wall until i got between him and the wall . friends took us out to drink and while a few of them were in the bathroom , he told me that he would kill my cat a thousand times over to bring his brother back . later he apologized , but ever since that moment , he was changed in my eyes . before his brother died , my boyfriend was such a kind , thoughtful , giving , and wonderful person . he doesn ' t sound like it with what i ' ve just described , but he really was . i believed that i was the luckiest girl in the world . he didn ' t want me to go to the funeral , but instead host thanksgiving for his friends . many people at the funeral asked where i was . over the next few months , i did everything that he asked . as time went on , he interacted with me less and we fought more . we live together and it ' s now become common that we go a whole day without ever touching . watching the man that i love suffer on a daily basis breaks me . i ' m devastated about what our relationship has devolved into , and i feel terrible that what he ' s experiencing is likely much worse , yet i still complain . i hate that i get angry so often now , but it ' s because i feel cheated and i ' m not sure where to go from here .
   (ID: 8042e52d2fe542ecd5ded40d7b66f7fc91ed07f3)

12. what am i suppose to say ? what ' s done is done , no need to keep feeling guilty and letting it eat me up for months messing with my mind and shit . just letting go now and not letting it bother me sounds way better then letting stuff fuck me up like most people do .
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

13. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .

14. that  s too bad . once you find someone who you think is perfect except one thing and they don  t feel the same way or they take an endearing quality like memeing and throw it away it must be rough .
   (ID: f270f54ee5a501d23ceae23084513e682d0cfd32)

15. yep . it happens . i noticed that i developed a crush on someone else . nothing wrong with so , and i still care for them just no longer in love with them . it ' s heartbreaking to realize especially when there is no right thing to do that makes everyone happy .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

16. she needs to get out of her mind that she is being  forced  . nah , fuck that shit . i rather have my family be mad at me than see that pos . part of being an adult is looking out for your wellbeing cause most the time family doesn  t understand that . good luck .
   (ID: 3590b3fd811042b17c3ff7f8b851664408a349ef)

17. you were just being worried about your brother . there ' s no shame in that . if anything it shows that you are a good brother for caring about him so much . just make sure you don ' t let your worriedness impede on his school experience .
   (ID: 3e1762624e55cdfb0929da3e1a1c438675e0c217)

18. nta  i mean it is a dick move to break up over text that way especially while someone  s deployed . however , i don  t think that matters given that he was an abuser and a deployment would give you a chance to leave him without him reacting violently , not letting you , etc . his reaction of threatening to hunt you down says everything about him , what  s he going to do ? beat you ? kill you ? you don  t need such a horrible man in your life . maybe it  d have been more respectful to do it over video or phone i guess but that also just would have opened you to more abusive traumatizing behavior from him , probably would have been worse to hear it in those ways rather than text anyway . i  m sorry for what you  ve gone thru and the decisions you  ve had to make here . as for your friend , does she know how he  s treated you ?
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

19. umm well , my lies are what led to this tbh . i promised her change and i didn ' t . i was busy with ending college and trying to get into grad school and just didn ' t want to deal with everything . i will always regret that mistake , i can ' t tell you how much regret i feel for letting her down after all this time . i have apologized many times , but she just doesn ' t care , she ' s fed up and i completely understand her . i know we ' d still be together if i didn ' t make my mistakes , i take full responsibility . but she was my first love and i wasn ' t ready from something as intense as her . always knew she was the right girl at the wrong time . but she doesn ' t have feelings for me anymore , so i have to move on and find someone else . if our paths cross again or if i meet someone else i will never make my past mistakes ever again . i have learned my lesson . the hard way .

20. its not your foult . if she just dumped you like that becouse of your mental health than she is a bitch and doesnt deserve you . try to find a woman that actually cares about you . there are many fish in the sea so dont loose hope . i hope the for best for you . sorry for bad english
