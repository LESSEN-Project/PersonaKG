1. a colleague recently told me something similar in business . focus on the immediate work , not on the result of every part . focus to get the immediate task done , and the next thing will be more grand and you ' ll do it better   leading to the outcome you want .

2. one thing that worked for me is procrastinating my suicidal thoughts . yes , i want to kill myself , but what about that movie coming out next month that i really want to see ? guess i ' ll have to wait . and then i ' ll find other reason to stay .

3. don ' t waste time  it ' s so precious ! and by the way , i ' m absolutely not saying every moment should be productive or that you should even try to be productive all the time . but try to be a bit accountable for what you did with your free time . did you watch a new movie ? have a good time with a friend ? make something , write something ? too many times as a teenager someone would ask me " what did you do after school yesterday ? " and i just had nothing to tell them . i was a vegetable , i didn ' t do anything meaningful at all . it ' s inevitable , sometimes you get tired or stressed and you take some time to do nothing at all . but every year my to  do list gets bigger and i have less time to waste . rather than asking what you should want to accomplish , take a moment to think about what matters to you  whatever that is  the people you want to get to know better , the places you want to go , the movies you want to watch , the things you want to learn . why not do those things when you have the time ?

4. do things you like and try not to think about it too much .

5. its a good feeling but i also struggle with not really being able to decide what i want to do . ive narrowed it down to social work but i really stopped being able to picture myself in the future so now that i am in my junior year of college and have to make decisions about what i want to do after , i struggle because i have so many options that i didnt really consider , because i assumed i ' d be dead by digit

6. yeah true living in the moment sounds like it would do the trick since i think my issue is that i worry about the future . thank you

7. i hated my master ' s so maybe i shouldn ' t be answering , but i guess make sure to really love and enjoy what you ' re studying and doing your thesis on .
