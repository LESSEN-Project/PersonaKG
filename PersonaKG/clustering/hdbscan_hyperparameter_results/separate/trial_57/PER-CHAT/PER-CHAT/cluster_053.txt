1. demons of the punjab . the story was compelling , it looked great , it put a spotlight on an often forgotten piece of history , and it didn ' t feel quite like anything the show ' s done before . it takes you away . i thought the antizone was cool or at least my inner digit  year  old did and it made me cry over a talking frog , which is more or less exactly what i want from this show . rosa . pulled off a somewhat questionable premise for a show like this , started some conversations , and i actually did like that the villain was just some random alt  right coded dipshit . the witchfinders . it was . pretty fun . i ' m not sure if the beginning deliberately called back to the line in beast below about the doctor not interfering with other peoples or planets unless there ' s children crying , but kudos if it did . the woman who fell to earth . i was excited when i first watched this because jodie was good . the ghost monument . it was bad in a different way from when doctor who was the last time it was bad , and for a moment that can feel similar to being good . resolution . just like dalek except without everything that made that good and a clunky joke about those damn millennials and an uncompelling subplot about ryan ' s dad . the tsuranga conumdrum . boring . it pretended it had a big theme about hope and stuff but it didn ' t . seeing gifsets and stuff i thought that the pting would appear near the end , and before that it would seem to everyone like all the problems were caused by some hostile force instead of a little animal just trying to survive , but that would ' ve put a theme in the actual story and we can ' t have that now can we ? arachnids in the uk . also boring . maybe if they ' d given the appearance of biggest spider an actual buildup and had had the team have to think to come up with a nicer way to kill the spiders that actually made sense it would ' ve at least been memorable . the battle of ranskoor av kolos . i had fun watching it , but that was because i was making fun of it and was also drunk . kerblam ! man , you ' re really going to use this show to tell a story about corporate exploitation being good actually . i kinda want to vomit . what happened to not just giving up and making a stand and saying no ? i get that not everything i watch is going to have the same political opinions as me , but there ' s that and then there ' s like , basic morality .

2. i should have loved green room because i like movies following its premise , and i ' ve seen it digit times now because everyone says it is so good , but honestly imo i ' m not a huge fan . it takes a long time to get started , the songs they sing are not pleasant to the ear , and the dialog is so hard to hear it almost must be watched with subtitles . the whole time they are locked in the room and negotiating was intense , but after they break out i got very bored . i ' ve tried to make myself like it , because i think it was reddits top voted film of that year . i didn ' t think it was awful , but i don ' t think of it as a ground breaking horror movie like it follows or babadook . alia shawkat , anton yelchin , and imogeen poots were the standouts .

3. catch me if you can , spielberg knows what kind of movie he wants to make and everybody else involved seems to understand it as well . also the best use of the f  bomb in a pg  digit movie

4. pulp fiction . interesting directing but the plot as a whole was awful and the witty dialogue couldn  t make up for a lack of a sense of purpose . an issue i have with many nonlinear stories is that it detracts from the tension in certain scenes . it  s like when you  re reading a book and see that there  s still digit pages left , so you know nothing bad is going to happen to the main character .

5. i saw that movie once in elementary school , teacher skipped all the good parts including the end , always thought it was a bad movie since . even worse it was the same teacher that allowed i am legend to be shown in full

7. i nominate bird box as tribute . never has something that  s been so shoved down my throat  oh my gosh youd love it !   scariest movie ever !  disapointed me so hard . how did they get so many a  b listers on this mediocre film ? the dialogue was meh , they never showed the monsters which , you can do that . if your suspense is really good which this wasn  t . and that ass pull character growth where it took this woman five years to love these kids through flashbacks was lazy writing ! . but maybe i  m just jealous , cuz netflix hasn  t touched my psychological thrillers .

8. can ' t be any worse than the andy garfield spider man movies . luckily he just didn ' t bother with finishing that trilogy .

9. i haven ' t even fucking seen it , but if it doesn ' t end with a lot of dragons , they ' re doing something wrong .
