2. i understand intersex . i get transgender . you wanna be the opposite of what you are . you identify with being the other sex . i ' m talking about people who claim they are neither . no , you were born with a vagina or a dick . you can ' t be neither just because you fucking feel like it .

6. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .

7. i  m not hating on christianity , i just don  t want people assuming i  m christian when i  m not . also , i just don  t like wearing religious symbols when i don  t practice the religion , because to me that seems kind of insulting to the religion . while i don  t know what chaos magick is , i can promise you that i only use magick for good . the point you completely missed in my last comment is that i do not know everything about wicca . now please calm down and stop being rude
