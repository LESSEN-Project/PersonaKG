1. lsd made me realize that i was overthinking most everything , and that most problems like that are just made up in your head . it really changes your mindset . would highly recommend taking lsd  mushrooms at least once .

2. lol ! thanks for the tire analogy , it was so vivid in my head as im a car fanatic . this is great advice , thank you so much . i found a lot of insight from this . i do understand i need to find a stepping stone to find my way you through . i live in nyc , so i found a spot down by the east river where i feel the most tranquil . i close my eyes for a few minutes and try to focus on my breathing which i think is an amazing sensation . mantras arent really in my zone yet . if you dont mind me asking , what were some of the obstacles you faced ?

3. thank you for your comment , you  ve made a lot of sense to me . it  s like a switch gets flipped whenever i begin to think about doing something for me . study , art , meditation , even my last therapy session i struggled to keep myself present and awake . having been in therapy for a year now , my therapist has only recently begun talking about dealing with my cptsd so i  ve got a long way to go . hopefully i can begin unpacking my terrible coping mechanisms soon because they really are disabling in so many ways .

4. i have postit notes everywhere , stuck on the inside of my car , dining room table , bathroom , i mean everywhere and those little pencils from ikea . it helps a lot . i know it sounds " nuts " but i try and practice conversation on my own , in my car especially . i normally have about three conversations going at once in my head anyway  schizophrenia and it helps me sort out my thought processes  thread it ' s by no means perfect but it helps .  but thee single most important thing is not to give one single f    ! about what people think as it only makes it worse ! and adds to the angst . i find meditation really helps , but , and i mean but , it was really hard to start with . there are loads of guided meditation on youtube . it ' s a great way to realign your thought processes .

5. i didn ' t want to assume you were a longtime or a hardcore alky but you never know . that can also happen if you stop taking benzos like xanax suddenly if your body has become physically dependent on them . and you ' d know by now cause you would physically feel horrible and would probably get the shakes and stuff like that . i ' ve forgotten to take klonopin for a few days and you end up feeling like shit .

6. yes , our minds love to punish ourselves when we are low . i promise if you truly try you can feel better and once you do it will be easier next time and so on and so on . feeling like this i truly know can be dangerous . don ' t be afraid to talk . get it all out . it ' s ok to be sad . but you have to tools inside your head to make yourself better ! remind yourself that you are worth it red  heart

7. great analogy with the spiderweb , it rings true to me ! i haven ' t had as much exposure to death as many people , but had it punch me in the face early last year with the death of one of our dogs . a grim , sudden , didn ' t make it to the vet in time death . i ' m finding that as i get further from that cold day , it does help to focus on the positive memories of the person or pet , and take some heart in knowing that the good times that you had with them were part of what gave them joy in life .

8. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .

9. " sucking it up " is a bad phrase to use imo . idk your life , but " accept " is a word that works for me . i am me , the world is the world . if you ' ve been sheltered , use every experience as a lesson that helps guide you in your journey exploring the world . going back to your bad trip , personally i think it ' s your body trying to tell you something . we have amazing , intuitive instincts that are buried within us but we ' re afraid when they try to tell us something . even if it ' s scary , you have to embrace what you feel so that you can get to know yourself a little better . baby steps are absolutely ok for this process .

10. when my mom passed , i lost my entire world and the only person who ever had my back . i had been the only child of a single mom , we were all that we had . i could barely handle life when she was sick and after her death . i was basically existing at times . sometimes just existing leads to surviving , the difference can be hope . i was devastated when my mother died slowly from glioblastoma . i was alone and scared , for almost a year i just lost myself . nobody noticed or said anything . i decided one day that i was still here for some reason despite many attempts to exit . i started building on a goal a day . i eventually started living again and rebuilding my entire life . the old me was sadly gone , it left with my mom . but the new me emerged and she actually enjoys life again , i  m getting used to her . i  ve built a new life that she will never know and it  s hard but also necessary for me . do some people not make it ? of course . do some people survive ? absolutely . i choose to uplift , but i  m also very rooted in the darker reality . i will never sugar coat the devastation of the loss nor the benefit of time for most people .
