1. well yeah of course , but most if not all guys are clueless then misinterpret reactions to mean a completely different thing than what she wants including myself . could you be a bit more specific with examples perhaps ?

2. time isn ' t as important as substance . if i talk to someone for three years but our conversations never go beyond " how are you ? what are you up to ? " i don ' t know them better than someone i ' ve talked to for two days about hobbies , or ideas , or current events , etc .

3. a multitude of reasons . he may just want to check up on you and see how you are doing

4. well usually but not every time . you really just never know . i ' ve had girls that friendzoned me call me up a year later that just poured it out on me that they " should have seen it sooner " and crazy stuff . unfortunately i didn ' t care by then

5. just last week a girl at my job would always want to chat with me , she ' d even wait for me to get to break so i could sit with her . i thought it was weird and couldn ' t figure out if she was being friendly or not so i ignored it i suck at reading signals now she doesn ' t bother . oh well

6. not to often at least not from my friends . that ' s why they are still my friends we expect to be told how it is and we correct from there . it really does good things for relationships you should try it if you haven ' t already .

7. i take it to mean when a guy fakes being nice or is only nice to get  something  from a girl . is that right ?

8. imagine somebody that bores you to tears . now imagine the most interesting conversation you have ever had . attraction is when you can ' t tell the difference .
