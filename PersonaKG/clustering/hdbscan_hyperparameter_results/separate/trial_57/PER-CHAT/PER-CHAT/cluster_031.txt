1. not me but my friend got high off of inhaling a dryer sheets . he did it as a joke cuz he found it in a sleeve . he told us that the entire day was just gone from his memory and the day prior as for some reason he went to another high while we were walking home . he said it ' s pretty terrifying and he would never wish it on another person .

2. when i was really young , my mom had a dream that a tsunami came and wiped out our house , taking my little brother with it . she woke up in a panic and tried to call my dad but couldn  t get a hold of him . they had divorced a year or so before and my dad liked to take my brother and i on spontaneous camping trips . the night my mom had the dream , he had taken us to this great spot with a playground and a pool . my brother and i were swimming without my dad and i turned my back for a second . i had to dive in to pull him off the bottom and help him breathe again . i saved his life and i was so young i barely remember it . we didn  t have cell phones when i was a kid so we got home to a dozen panicked voicemails from my mom . my dad of course instantly called her and the first thing my mom asked him was if my brother had drowned . this wasn  t the first or last time that my mother has had dreams that seemed to warn her of danger or draw her to something . i don  t know if i believe in the supernatural but her stories always make me wonder .

3. me and a group of school friends would always go camping in our local woods most fridays after school . however one night was slightly different  we  d always pitch in the place which was a flat grass field area with the woodland trees surrounding . we set up tents , started getting drunk as teenagers do etc , and suddenly one of the girls noticed a man about digit yards away in the bushes stood up and just staring at us . none of us had the balls to approach him so we stood our ground shouting stuff and staring him out . weird thing is he didn  t look like he was breathing and hardly moving . hours went past and as it got darker we eventually lost sight of him . a few of us stayed up all night while the rest slept to keep guard incase he approached . as morning came he wasn  t there and no sign he was ever there . to this day , none of us knew who he was or what he wanted . we didn  t go camping again after that .

6. i used to smoke pot daily , gave it up suddenly and had some vivid dreams afterwards , they say you don ' t dream when you smoke weed for a long time , my brain seemed to be making up for lost time one night , i had this dream i had verbally assaulted a female work colleague , it was so real to me that i thought it actually did happen the next morning , i went to work that day and apologized for my poor behavior , she was so confused and she said it never happened . to this day i am unsure if it did or not .

7. i was in my house about to go sit in my front room to watch some tv . i have digit cats . a black one and a black and white one . the black cat  coco  is mostly a house cat . the black and white is named  loco  . i walk into my front room a see a black cat and as i  m in my own home i assume it  s my cat coco . as i go to pet the cat i realise that it is not my cat but just another random black cat . i scream and the cat gets scared and runs into another room in which my other cat loco is sleeping in . i shut the door if that room not knowing this until i open the door and the cat runs out and into my garden . luckily , all cats were ok but it scared the hell out of me . we have caught this same black cat in our house a couple of times now . it  s not really that scary compared to other stories but it  s the scariest thing to happen to me .

8. when i was digit i vividly remember this huuuge ant in my grandmother ' s carpet . my memory is usually pretty bad but i remember this like it was yesterday because of how much it scared me . looked like something out of a movie . but , of course , we don ' t normally have giant ants crawling around , and so to this day no one believes me

9. so this h happened like a year or two ago but it still bothers me  so i was laying in my bed with my phone and headphones in . i quickly turn my head to the side and through the corner of my eye i see a really skinny shoulder and kind of a face . i turn back and it was gone . it couldn ' t have been a family member because no one in the house at the time had that kind of body . still creeps me out

10. for me , it felt as if my body went numb . i don ' t feel anything . and i see everything around me , but it feels as if i ' m watching a movie . there was a mirror beside me when this happened , i could see my face out the corner of my eye . just lifeless .

11. that ' s creepy ! what did they look like ? do you think it ' s possible that they have the ability to interact with you through your dream state ? like say , if they were psychic beings vs physical beings ?

12. yeah in similar fashion i am a hindu , i ' ve also heard stories like that but i ' ve never seen a thing tbh . and in hindu culture the traditional is to mostly fire the dead . but in some cases they also berry them . it ' s called " shradh " . it ' s peace act to rip body  soul . if it hasn ' t done properly then the ghost is still on earth roaming is the saying .

13. i woke up late in the middle of the night because i heard a baby crying . i lived with just my parents who were pretty deep sleepers . it sounded like it was coming from straight outside my window . i laid there for a long time just to make sure it wasn ' t a dream and it kept going . after about digit minutes i noticed the sound sounded as if it was moving around the house , but much faster than a baby would be able to move . i laid in bed for 30min listening to it terrified . the next morning i told my parents and they insisted it was a dream , but a few weeks later i see on facebook a media release from the police saying that this is a strategy that robbers are using to lure people out of their house and then then beat them and rob their homes .

14. it  s a dark cloud over your existence . a cloud of sorrow and remorse and guilt and fear . it reminds you of the reality of impermanence and makes you fearful of the fact that we don  t get to see all of our plans through . the worst part is that nobody else can see your cloud . they imagine it for a few weeks , but the best of intentions ultimately leads to faded sympathy . use your cloud to motivate yourself . start working on your dreams now . above all , know that the cloud gets just a little smaller every day . it  ll always be there , but it won  t overwhelm your whole sky like it is now . it becomes manageable , i reminder . it can even become pleasant in this way . it  ll always hurt , but less and less as time goes by .

16. i ' ve had the begeebies scared outta me digit times in the rocky mountains . the 1st time was early spring in the rockies . still lots of snow on the north side of boulders and shaded ravines . camping and fishing . woke up in the middle of the night with a bears nose pressed against the tent wall . right in the back of my neck . they have gawd awful breath btw . i was helpless . no gun . learned a lesson . don ' t go out there without a large handgun bear sniffed around for a minute and left . i counted to digit minutes and left the tent for the safety of a vehicle . 2nd time i was fishing by upper twin lakes . kept getting an uneasy feeling that somebody was watching me . hair on my neck standing up . stopped fishing and turned around to face the woods . squatted down and began scanning the woods . digit yards above me was a large female mountain lion that could have easily pounced on me in a few seconds . she didn ' t move until she was sure i ' d spotted her . then she took off in a hurry . i know she was stalking me , but once she knew that i ' d spotted her . no element of surprise and she left . 3rd time was early season elk hunting by copper mountain . i was with my friend , but he was digit or digit yards away . i thought the bears would have been hibernating by 1st elk season . well , one of them started stalking me . it was digit  30am and we were hiking up to a ridge above the treeline . another hour to go before we got there . already an hour away from the truck . damn bear starts snorting . trying to wind me . he started doing half circles around me . back and forth from my left to my right . in half circles . it ' s dark . i couldn ' t see past digit yards with my headlamp . turned it off and stood still . i could hear this bear running around in the snow , but i couldn ' t see it . i had a rifle and a digit mag in a chest holster . still scared to death . got my digit in my hand now . this bear screwed with me for digit minutes . until it started to get light outside . he finally wandered off and i kept hiking . with my digit mag in my hand . 4th time was another mountain lion . more elk hunting up high , near treeline . me and same buddy had camped around digit , digit feet . just inside the trees . mind you , we ' ve hiked miles at high altitude , in the snow . our tents were lightweight and offered no real protection from animals . we hiked into the late evening and set up camp in the dark . woke up the next morning and found mountain lion tracks within inches of our tents . coffee not necessary that day . i was instantly awake . this lion had been right near our tents in the middle of the night . we found a spot on a rock that was digit feet above us where the big cat had sat and looked down on us during the night . never scared me enough to make me stop hunting and fishing . just carry a large caliber handgun . chest holsters make me feel safer . don ' t take women camping in the mountains while they ' re on their period ! blood attracts predators !

18. that cold shiver that goes all the way up your spine when your in bed and you hear something in your room that cant possibly be anything that you remember seeing when the light was on .

19. i was in a car accident with my best friend and he died . i was conscious the whole time but remember nothing . those hours that disappeared before i came to in the hospital , it ' s a different kind of scary .

20. never done weed but i  m gonna say not too similar at all . anesthesia has you in your right mind but you randomly do things and say things that you were even screaming at yourself not to do . and the action doesn  t even register in your mind . it  s like it never happened . plus you don  t remember much either .
