13. let me make it easier for you . the sku , and what you paid doesn  t matter . you bought an older model for  digit when that was a deal . with new prices on material and manufacturing methods , they can sell new ones for  digit . that  s including better updates parts . no one will give you  digit for yours . and i  m not here to shit all over your post . i  m here to inform you that if you really want to sell it , you  ll have to take more of a loss . i  m also here to make sure other people don  t over pay for things . and if someone pays  digit for this , they are over paying .

20. everything is bullshit if you don ' t have an answer to it . personally you pick it if you can get bursted down a bit quickly , and there ' s probably digit key heroes that are pretty tanky and do quite some damage . other than that the attack range is so much better , you ' re illusions get it too and you can take t3 and barracks in like digit seconds
