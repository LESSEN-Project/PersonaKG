20. they really screwed up by having little finger give sansa to the boltons . he had her eating out of the palm of his hand , and then for no good reason he married her off to an unstable family that gave him no tactical advantage whatsoever . now , it seems like the writers have no idea what to do with him other than have him lurk around making googly eyes at sansa . i really , really , really hope they have something good planned for little finger  it be a shame to just kill off such a crafty character because they have no more use for him .
