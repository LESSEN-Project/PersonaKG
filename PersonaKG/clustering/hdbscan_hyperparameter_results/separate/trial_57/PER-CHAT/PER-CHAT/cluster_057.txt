1. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .

2. reproductive control is another form of human control . why do you think suicide is a mortal sin in christianity ? because it keeps people from checking out and forces them to stay under the control of the church . i control everything you do you become my slave , yet religion wants you to be a slave , they want to " command " you on what to do and not to do . and before people say " that isn ' t the way my church is "  looking at you methodists  i can say modern american christianity is like weekly book clubs . yeah you ' ll discuss the book , maybe , but most of the time it ' s socializing , gossiping , and just hanging out . but some religions still hold to the slave master chain and demand you be a slave to allah shit , gave that one away

3. to be clear  people have the right to practice whatever religion they would like . they have the right to pursue or not pursue certain things in their personal lives because it goes against their creed . i don ' t want to take that away from people . if living your life a certain way and believing in one god or another makes you feel fulfilled , then live your best life my friend . but laws impact everyone . to make a law in the name of say catholicism and then forcing people of all other religions to follow it crosses many lines . if people want to be able to change their gender markers on their licenses if they want to , they should be able to . but no one should ever force anyone to do so . if doing such a thing goes against your religion , then you don ' t gotta do it . those laws , the ones for people wanting to change their gender , only impact the people who want to do it ! nothing about those laws says that everyone else is legally obligated to as well , it ' s just an option available to those who are interested .

4. the way i see it , it ' s okay if it protects you from imminent harm , like using violence . otherwise , it ' s not .

5. why have sex when you know that it is made for reproductive purposes if you aren  t willing to face the consequences ? and i would say we add more because it  s better to be alive and not murdered
   (ID: c0f309bee7152ab458da8ec03fbb1e17fa2876cd)

6. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

7. who makes that decision ? who determines what conditions or characteristics are fine and which are not ? disabled adults would be against this idea of yours . what makes you think you know better than they whether they have a right to live ? no , you ' re talking about babies , but babies don ' t get to be adults if you ' d have them euthanized first . this is a slippery slope that starts with ostensibly good intentions and ends with eugenics .

8. do people actually think like this ? you can ' t control the sex of your kids . well actually i think nowadays you can , idk how expensive it is what difference does it make if you have boys or girls anyway . if everyone had boys , there ' d be no one to reproduce in the next generation .

9. while i like the grand notion of basically forcing certain breeders to become virtually extinct , this may fare better for the other side . many people don ' t want kids and still can ' t get sterilised because they don ' t have kids . kind of a paradox . a really dumb one . some who end up with kids end up resenting them . i believe if those who truly want this treatment can get it , a large portion of bad parents would be eliminated before the deed is done .

10. sure . in my mind they  re nearly the same thing though . let  s take downs syndrome for example . i believe denmark is basically aborting digit  of their babies with downs . and these people certainly experience life differently than someone without downs . but many of them are also very happy . i hope you don  t feel i  m being argumentative , but another way to approach this topic would be asking  people with disabilities  serious illnesses , do you wish you were never born ?  i think plenty would say absolutely not . if an adult decides not to procreate , that  s their choice . but i don  t want the government telling me i cannot have a child for any reason . especially because they believe it wouldn  t be  good enough .  just my thoughts ! cheers .

11. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

12. yes but it ' s not about the morality of the consent in my argument  my argument is that the people are going to form a government anyway , with mostly consent . there will be people who wouldn ' t want to be governed and would prefer a state of nature , but it ' s a very small amount of people . the moral consent argument comes from things like liberty , equality , justice and democracy  principles that people generally accept as good governance . again  not perfect , but the best ideals for a government that does things not everybody likes . what is the alternative ? a state of nature where people will just form a government all over again , like i said , perhaps an even more oppressive government than the one we have now that evolved of many hundreds of years via reformation ?

13. i can  t say i  m the same as other pro lifers ofc , but i  m all for contraceptives and better sex ed . and the problem is that sure it  s in your body but it  s still life inside you and it telling you that it  s murder . and if you don  t want to deal with the consequences of your actions , do everything you can to prevent pregnancy  abortion . if it still failsabstinence works too then give them up for adoption
