1. yes and no . i can only hope that this push to have people vote translates into an increased candidate pool in the future , which would in theory give us a much better choice to vote for than any of the people we have today .

2. so am i supposed to expect the government can do better for me by taking my money rather than let me use it to my own advantage ?

3. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .

4. ding ding ding . youre right . thats what i was trying to say . the gov thinks the nic addiction is more minor than a heroin addiction , so they ' ll keep nic legal and tax it to make money , because thats what governments do . however , they think heroin is more dangerous and would prefer to keep it illegal rather than tax it . seems like we ' re on the same page here .

5. i disagree . it does do something . it helps thousands of people have food for a short while . i am sure that you ' d be pissed if you were part of the famine affected communities in somalia and someone said " we were going to send you digit tons of food but some guy on reddit said that there isn ' t any point in it , so we decided to spend the money on big screen tv ' s and taco bell " maybe it won ' t solve the problem but it ' s better than doing nothing .

6. but all these things will still happen under socialism . tis is a problem of corruption and conflicts of interest of people writing the laws that enable things like this .

7. i believe so and because of it we have bad  no parenting our number one problem , narcissistic bosses , and bad leadership . what do u all think we can do to change the trend ?

8. that ' s something that people often turn to , like " people will be out of jobs " but there ' s still things that need to be done within a universal healthcare system . there are still plenty of jobs that people can do .

9. of course it has , if you have the freedom to spend your money than you have the freedom to do it like a retard don ' t get me wrong capitalism is great , but everything has a downside .

10. i disagree . i give a serious fuck about crossfit  it is horrible . have you seen the way they do pull ups ? have you read how many injuries are caused by cross fit ?

11. i mean even the most ardent marijuana supporters must concede it makes people less active and lazy . what are you talking about ? sure , some pot smokers are lazy , but are they lazy because they smoke pot or do they smoke pot because they ' re lazy ? there ' s a lot of really lazy unmotivated people that don ' t use any drugs at all . how would you explain that ? maybe we could just blame video games or something else in that case ? some people are just lazy . you do know people of all professions smoke pot , right ? i ' ve smoked pot since i was digit . got a pilot ' s license , college degree , and have run my own business for the past digit years . just about all of my friends smoke weed and they have all been employed for decades doing just fine . they have spouses , are great parents , own nice homes , etc . you know what makes people less active and lazy ? being hung over . i ' d much rather my employees smoke weed at the end of the day to wind down and get to work the next morning well rested . you ' ve bought into the narrative that has been preached to you since birth . this , coming from a dare graduate lol .

12. i understand that , but you can  t just replace digit  of medications with weed . if you could , that would be a medical miracle unlike anything the world has ever seen . i understand your point , and i agree that the prescription drug industry is one of the most evil things this world has to offer . that terrible industry is the reason why many people believe that you can just smoke weed or use essential oils to fix your medical issues , and it isn  t those peoples  fault . i don  t want you to think that i  m trying to be disparaging , because i know both of us have had very different walks of life , and we will never see things the same way . i  m sorry for the shortness and rude tone of my first comment towards you , but it  s very dangerous to say that weed is better than the vast majority of prescription drugs .
