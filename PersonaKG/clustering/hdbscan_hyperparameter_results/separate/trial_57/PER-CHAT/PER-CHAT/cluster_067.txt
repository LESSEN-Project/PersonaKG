1. no mans sky always were a good game . you suckers just say it is  was bad because the creator overhyped it and lied about some features . blame the creator . not . the . creation . thats not just about nms , its about every fucking thing  your wife died giving birth to your child ? blame yourself for making her pregnant or dont blame anyone thats just one example . and also the game became really good after those updates . fuck you . haters gonna hate .  digit

2. brecci was good though , this isn ' t . i wasn ' t saying it was the remington , it ' s the only comparable in one shot kill type of way . it ' s bad when i ' d rather use fists in half the gun fights tbh . and the sg12 isn ' t garbage unless you can ' t click the trigger more than two times . any average player can use the gun like any other , sure it ' s no saug , but it ' s still way better than the mog12 . it ' s just depressing .

3. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

4. game was much more enjoyable back then , there is some farmable items and weekly events and thats it . i farmed vhl for digit and a half month now i barely play the game , all i do is afking in yulgar with other ppl with navals and vhl . it ' s most likely a show off game today .

5. i would argue now ! but everyone gets nostalgic for their own eras . to this day i think ffvii is the greatest game ever made .

6. that  s what i said , i never really thought they were that cool to begin with , my friend thinks they will rise to be level with white apex because of the  limited crates  like      boy ! nooooo ! what ich yu tinken

7. damn dirty downvoters . i love both of those games , but i think you are absolutely entitled to your opinion . i just recently got tlos for like seven dollars and i played it from beginning to end in just a few days . it ' s got a really weird difficulty curve . it starts like basically a guided tour , and then gets ridiculously hard all of a sudden , and then you start figuring out the ropes  upgrading shit  finding better shit and it starts to become easy , and then you get hit with sporadic " artificial difficulty " spikes that make things harder again . really strange stuff . great game though .

8. yeah , and the whole living story bs . what ' s the point of that again ? keeping players grinding in different areas ? what pisses me off the most tho is just how fucking random loot drops are , i can kill a mr . nobody in the corner of the map and get legendary precursor while opening every single boss chest once a day for one month gave me fuck all , neverminding the fact that every single weapon but the goddamn legendaries is just so fucking generic it ' s not even funny . at least gw1 had the brilliant idea of having some weapons being unique drops to locations , gave farmers a niche market if they could do something  in gw2 it ' s rng to whether you get a precursor or not .

9. something has to change . digit games in one weekend is just too overwhelming and too frustrating . it makes me hate the game at times .
   (ID: 9284af9896fed617d56596c55fb3ff4e8a4c8dde)

10. i agree , too many bugs . the banning ' s and other issues have destroyed my league . the ah stuff they are doing , is going to drive away most of the rest . there has been lots of good this year , the league stuff they just did , would be great if most of the best guys from my league weren ' t gone already . and the digit promos they ' ve done so far have been quality .

11. maybe when it goes on sale . it will be like every other new game i buy , play for a month and then come crawling back to gta like a lost puppy . are you going to jump on rdr2 ?

12. i understand what you are saying , and maybe they just needed money for something else like watch dogs legion or far cry new dawn . but if next ac game is another rpg i am really going to give up on it .

13. ok so let me answer all of your questions and give a retort . yea i stayed up all night to watch it drop . yea i played all the missions with my friends . yea i did get burned out quick because i played the game . those missions where a fucking cake walk and the work that you call her for is just errand boy shit that doesn ' t pay well . we have absolutely no verity in this update . look at it , it ' s the exact same as after hours but you get a not free casino . you have digit easy as hell missions that can be completed in less than digit hours given you have people that aren ' t retarded doing it with you . and a penthouse that is just another way to spend your money that isn ' t practical . the casino is probably rigged . we don ' t have texas hold ' em , witch is in any casino within my area midwest digit more fucking bullshit cars that are no better than the last updates batch . and a plethora of other ways to milk you out of your money . this update is bullshit and everybody knows it . oh and for the " passive mode fix " that shit should ' ve been in the game since day one . rockstar had every chance to fix that shit when they did gunrunning , smugglers run , and after hours . yes i do like all the fixes that they have done , those are nice . the only thing i want is an enjoyable experience that is filled with fun for all players alike that won ' t burn out after digit fucking hours .

14. yep . tbh i don ' t mind gameplay that doesn ' t exactly mirror the game . i don ' t care how " realistic " it is . but i do care about how fair it is . the one thing that hasn ' t been changed is the mechanic that helps the losing team , prevents too long of a winning streak or too long of a losing streak . that ea bs that tries to keep us wanting to improve and being reassured that we can be good at the game . it is soooo morally wrong , and i containing my rage is an act of heroic zen buddhism i ' m aware this is an oxymoron .

15. they may feel like that but many of them are ignoring the immense amount of time that went into the other requirements and at the same time vastly overestimating the value of castle wars . i ' ve found it pretty funny the reaction many people have had  when people who set up castle wars boosting fc ' s specifically to cheat games with alts , not the totally legitimate afk fc ' s are complaining about devaluation , and people who called themselves trimmers but hadn ' t finished the breeding log or salty etc are complaining about devaluation , i find it all pretty memeworthy . ontop of that , why weren ' t all these true trimmers pissed when 5k games as diminished ? surely you ' re not really a trimmer if you don ' t have 5k then ? or when people boosted games ? or when people account shared ? i ' ve seen so many twitter posts of people who blatantly cheated their cwar games acting outraged that i just can ' t take it seriously . i ' m someone who trimmed immediately after the rework , and to see people behave like my trim is worthless or that i didn ' t earn it is so gross . i ' ve been trim sans cwars for coming up on digit years . i put in as much effort as anyone else  i refused to cwars on principle for a variety of reasons , primarily because i believed it was a flawed decision from the start , and because of the rampant cheating that went on in the early years of comp that still goes on to this day , not because i couldn ' t be bothered but because it wasn ' t content , and it wasn ' t fair .

16. making sure the game works is pretty damn important . you don ' t get to ignore the current content for months , hype the ansion to get everyone out of their minds with excitement , and then fudge the launch that badly . we crucified ea when they pulled this bunk with sim city digit because they , like blizzard , had been in business long enough to know better . they completely deserve the every ounce of criticism they received . that being said , i ' m sure the metacritic score will gradually increase , as more and more problems get fixed . personally , i love the ansion in terms of its content . however , i ' m not going to give blizzard a free pass for their failure to provide the most basic of services .

17. i agree that the loot boxes need to go , but it  s not that bad . let  s jeep in mind it  s still in beta and will probably get better .
   (ID: d22e7a709b0319a6027d9c97a39611aed656a624)

18. remember this isn ' t the actual list . it sucks for now , but theres always hope that something gets hit which makes the price less ridiculous . maybe after shvi the deck goes the way of qlips and turns into dark planet turbo .

19. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .
