SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 46

1. it shouldn ' t be an issue . i honestly don ' t care if someone is gay or not , if they give me a compliment their cool factor just went up by digit points and it makes me wanna be there friend .
   (ID: c11592c54f6061d979d11af92c6289790a5bec93)

2. simply ask ,  hey , do you wanna go out ?  guys don  t wanna make assumptions about your intentions and look bad , especially in a society where a guy can be criminalized for being interested in a woman . a shy guy will absolutely not take that risk , so if you  re interested , you should let him know .

3. not to be rude but the  shy , introvert with a foot fetish  label isn  t that uncommon . i know a lot of wo  men like that . and the anxiety of losing them sounds more like an insecurity manifesting itself before your very eyes . honestly , i wouldn  t worry and think too hard on much . being yourself is about the best anyone can do . yes , try and actively open up more when you have a so but if they can  t handle your introverted tendencies then you probably aren  t the greatest match anyway .

4. definitely say something . call her , though . tone can be kind of difficult to determine through text and you don ' t need want to give her any more reasons to push you away even more . " hey , insert sister name . how you doing , casual chatting , blah blah blah . i need to talk to you about something . i feel insert everything you just told us . i know it ' s your wedding and you can do whatever you want , but i ' m starting to think that you don ' t even want me there . if not , that ' s fine bc you ' re kind of being a bitch and i could do without all the cross country trips . if you genuinely want me to be a part of the wedding , then act like it and maybe ease up a little bit " . feel free to modify to your liking .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

5. just be straight forward with her . i can  t tell you how to bring it up , you need to figure that out on your own , not on reddit . if it comes from you heart and voice , it will feel sincere and she will know . be yourself and just tell how you feel . that is it . hope everything goes alright .
   (ID: 7f37f47fcf6439c13308caa3da8118ac14f861f6)

6. on your third date , hump him awkwardly at a phish show . it ' s the only way .   x200b  raves are a special thing . i wouldn ' t bring someone around who made me feel awkward a third time . and there ' s nothing wrong with keeping looking for someone who has long term potential or at the very least is more compatible now !
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

7. i had a date once and the girl had no social skills . like she couldn ' t hold a conversation . i don ' t ever struggle to make conversation but this was a real shitter . in the end it was just me talking at her . the worst part is i would talk about things and she would never add to the conversation . just " yes " or " no " answers . eve now i wonder if it was me that was too talky ?
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

8. it really depends , tbh . the kinda environment it is and whether dating is actively encouraged or happens very discreetly . i find that there  s no personal shame  you like a dude ? go for it ! what  s the worse that could happen ? he will decline . there could be collective shaming though  your friends telling you to let the man chase you and you  re way out there . again , it  s the ridiculous enforcing of gender roles .
   (ID: 006c00e83a6ef65225d8e98c338e5706c044b368)

9. i think im going to try to introduce myself like " what ' s up im addison , my friends call me aj " because addison itself is a pretty feminine name but it ' s the only one i could get by with bc of my unsupportive parents
   (ID: 7e58269155b84bc057025d5066e661ba2eb934ba)

10. my opinion , go out more . not to a bar or club more like a social event at the park find someone whose doing something similar to something you feel passionate about . ex girl jogging in the park go join her keep her company ask like how long have you been jogging here ? then improvise from there obviously ask her for her name just dont make it the first question so you seem interested at her hobby aswell as herself . next try to get into the friend area yes i know you don ' t want to be here but this stage is where youll learn the most truthful information about her . next start sharing life moments you wouldnt tell most people just think before you say it so it doesn ' t sound like extra baggage for the person . eventually youll know when to ask her on a date
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

11. most guys just go for it . if your super uneasy you can ask her first . i ' ve been asked before , it ' s not a total killer either . don ' t worry if it ' s not perfect !
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

12. i have a few friends like you , and i want to shake them all . it  s easier said than done but you have to understand if people didn  t want you around , they wouldn  t invite you anywhere . research some small ways to help yourself with confidence .
   (ID: f14ea91df683dc236b3ffe5956871b69581e71d3)

13. i used to date a guy that would do this to me all the time , as petty as it sounds i would purposely not make plans to hang out and when he  d ask to hangout i  d say that i already made plans with a guy bff . only took a little while for him to start paying attention again . also a push up bra helps

14. depends on your comfort level with them . if you two can casually have conversations about anything just bring up the fact you have feelings
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

15. just be spontaneous and say something that comes up in you about the environment . one sentence i wouldn ' t recommend using in a library though , is something along the lines of  " i came here to read books but i ' d much rather read your mind " cause that probably makes her think you ' re a creep but if it doesn ' t , marry her . she ' s smart .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

16. ask her more questions , slowly making them more intimate , and she will open up to you and it won ' t seem as awkward to her to say anything about the relationship
   (ID: 6c6c2bcafc7e364c44168441f048cb2b34ec92a6)

17. all these straight men answering this question have no idea how much and how often women fear for their safety when trying to turn down a guy . you may not snap , but she can ' t know that for sure . there ' s literally a term for this , " rejection killing . that ' s one reason why she gives you fake info instead of just saying no , and why being " polite " is more a matter of survival than your feelings .
   (ID: 2f62aeebd18bd873078151ee21a92be33ffd3e29)

18. i ' m exactly like this . it ' s terribly awkward when somebody that gets ' open me ' blabs everything to somebody that gets ' quiet me ' .
   (ID: b863480affffa35b0ead5c7bc5daa4c4099c0cee)

19. nothing . they do nothing . and if they  re like me , they  ll finally have the courage to say something when it  s too late . he  ll eventually get married and regret never taking that leap and just saying  hi  . there  s days i wish i could go back to my younger self with everything i know now . if you like him , say something . you both can  t be afraid . great couples are able to feed off of each other  s courage . you won  t regret trying . would you rather say something and realize he doesn  t like you , or live the rest of your life never knowing what could have been ?
   (ID: 5924185c6bc48db6dcdd28618174f57dec4da643)

20. why are you assuming you are being friendzoned ? i mean you seem to be just friends at this stage . she hasn ' t rejected you , so you are not really " friendzoned . it ' s a bit hard to know if she likes you or not from what you have described . just be yourself and don ' t go in with the expectation of wanting her to like you because you are nice to her . dont assume anything , ever ! good luck !
