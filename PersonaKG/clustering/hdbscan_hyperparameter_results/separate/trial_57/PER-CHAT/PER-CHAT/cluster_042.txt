1. if you ' re in your 40s or younger , there ' s still hope . i ' m working on a theory right now .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

2. this is more for askreddit but i ' ll answer anyways . no unless you believe in a world where it is like that with the whole multiple universe reality things which since there are infinite different universes it is a possibility
   (ID: d65f8a6de2b4a1b52f7d721549231e1246105e78)

3. you ' re alive right now . so what if your youth was wasted ? does that automatically mean that you ' re unable to anything ever again ?
   (ID: fddeeaa11799939dfe96bc7fae74a22b474aaf20)

4. i don ' t believe so . lemme explain , everytime you remember something you are remembering the last time you remembered it . slowly but surely degrading that memory . our brain would only be able to hold onto the good and bad , the exciting stuff . also when you die you do experience a dream like sequence where your almost relive your life , but it ' s not the same , it would be weird like a dream , inaccurate and inconsistent . it wouldn ' t make sense and with the combination of lost memories it would probably confuse you and ruin you but nobody will ever know for sure .

5. it ' s the same as life . once you accept that you ' ll die someday it ' s much more please t not having to worry all the time .
   (ID: 2ce8587266f0888bb10672ccf8a7be1bc6c3f0d2)

6. possibility that this is best time humanity is living in and after this we are all going down .
   (ID: a168763c82b90dc18ccbbd57533eec2e49d17dc7)

7. yes , but definitely not in our lifetime .
   (ID: a443e7c80bc6205bdbbea69b30bc8d3187e2852f)

8. the beginning is life , the end is death . it doesn  t matter how you spend the in  between , as long as you chose what you do
   (ID: 507a68eb71bd6ad59b6eb966ab94fb9c2e599bc8)

9. you get to be a ghost for a while , then its lights out . but i only believe this because i find it comforting to believe there ' s something non  permanent after death .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

10. life would be a lot shorter , therefore you would have less time to do things . you mayaswell make the most of the time you have and do the things you ' ve always wanted to do , no matter how risky they can be . e . g bungee jumping
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

11. i think death is a state which alters our consciousness to the same form of life in an other parallel universe . so that we can live better and evolve . inspired from time is a flat circle !
   (ID: 498ec9e13eaa203d64a9b79260e2285867993564)

12. what happens if you die of old age ? does this only work for accidents , or do you become young again ?
   (ID: 1476398f6c778fb461539e3f78b07720d4ceee83)

13. after personally experiencing dmt , i am very convinced that there is an afterlife . when you are at this place , you have memories of before you were a human . try to take back those memories with you is like forgetting a dream .
   (ID: 4a5a9ac8eab027b38804427b3c8c5e19c8991de3)

14. i didn ' t necessarily ' disappear ' but i moved several times until i was unknown by anyone in my ' new ' life . on the occasions i ' ve been passing through places my old life existed it was strange to see that actually very little had changed . if cloning could be done , i ' d probably replace myself in this life with a clone and go again . but hey ho .
   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

15. remember how it was before you were born ? me neither . and that ' s the way it will be when we are gone . same exact state . there are many questions we will never know the answer to but it ' s best to concentrate on what we know and what we have  enjoy your life and be good to your fellow humans .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

16. remember what it felt like before you were born ? yeah that  s sounds like the most reasonable answer to me
