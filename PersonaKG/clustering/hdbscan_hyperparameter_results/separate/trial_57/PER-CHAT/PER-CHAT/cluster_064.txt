1. i ' ve been on reddit for a awhile and that ' s gotta be close to the dumbest fucking comment i ' ve seen thus far .
   (ID: afc977e14ab83cd73dbc192e4c5b710baff09564)

2. why do you keep brining this back to race , how does saying that most people who have been alive on this planet had no real impact lead back to " you are ok with more black people dying than any other race " . you are obviously making some connections that i am missing . all individual lives are an acceptable loss so long as the human race survives . i don ' t care about other people losing their jobs , i don ' t care about other people dying and having family members die . i only care about the people i love and the survival of us as a species . i see you added a um , ' gotcha ! ' at the end there so please enlighten me as to how i specifically said i would support blm .

3. except no , you do have responsibility . you know that word is offensive which , i would hazard to guess , is why you like it , and further you know what it means to call someone that . it ' s a legitimately offensive thing to call someone , and just because people have called you a faggot and you didn ' t care doesn ' t mean that other people can ' t be legitimately pissed off by being called that , or by that word being used . the idea that you can use a word like that and have no responsibility for how people react is like saying you can swing a baseball bat at someone ' s head and have no responsibility for them being pissed . it just doesn ' t make any damn sense . if you were as emotionally mature as you say you are , you ' d take some responsibility for your own actions instead of projecting that onto someone else . own your shit instead of forcing other people to pick it up .

4. because calling a debate with an intelligent person " cat calling " is the only way to justify running away to your fans   there , i elaborated your reasoning . you seem to lack the ability to expand your thoughts .
   (ID: a338329f614b2c3eb4dd145b3eea7f677369e428)

5. and everyone is listening to the factually objective graphs and charts ? you can get the book " how to lie with statistics " on amazon . everybody should read it .  people are checking all the citations in a digit page scientific journal on climate change ? out of the digit  whatever million people in the us how many are actively aware that there exist digit page journals on climate change ? or know what a citation is ? or have ever looked up a citation ? or have read any of those journals ?  your argument is to fight fair ? if my opponent kicks me in the nuts and then tells me i need to fight fair ? i didn ' t make that argument  i said that anybody who doesn ' t fight fair doesn ' t deserve respect .  i guarantee that there is no single group on earth good or bad that does not use propaganda in some form . plausibly true . doesn ' t make it right .  above , a poster stating no facts , just an emotional statement . so we should still have child labor because they didn ' t state facts ? if you base your legal system on a single panel inked editorial cartoon your legal system sucks .  or candians with the participaction campaign . i don ' t know anything about it so i have no opinion or comment .
   (ID: 96a81d50435279b84caf2938c60f98cccd8e986a)

6. overreact much ? your response highlights what is wrong with what passes for " debate " these days . no matter what point you make , no matter how unbiased you try to be as a person , there ' s always somebody there getting off on making their favorite point by framing your words to mean something completely unrelated to what you meant .
   (ID: f15c79447707a6e701285e8c59cc3aa25d54daa6)

7. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

8. watch your language . that you can ' t answer my basic questions without filth and hate coming from your mouth speaks a lot about you .
   (ID: 25b8235c988cb167d94968ee893707e9c358cde8)

9. there ' s so much wrong in what you wrote . you obviously don ' t know anything about jesus . you probably never even opened a bible before . you just say what you decided , on your own terms , everything you wrote . you just hate trump so much that you got your head up your bum . you just did a paradox on yourself there bub . you successfully wrote a hate speech against people who you assume are hating on others . you hating on people who hate , so you hate yourself !
   (ID: d1d5944096e9e987dc1401f1602683f4aeb9096a)

10. one of the dumbest , unfunniest posts i ' ve seen .
   (ID: 521b989779e5e44f8854ed1438b914dfb8f19eb6)

11. what do you mean , " exactly ? " are you agreeing with the fact that sarcasm is hard to decipher in a blurb of text ? and if so , why would someone be a dumbass because of that ? or do i need an iq level as high as yours to understand your joke ? man , you need to read the atmosphere of the thread and be more cautious about what you ' re gonna post since you ' re complaining about being downvoted so much .
   (ID: 0da557492b0bbc1cb8e2e7cf174868871996cb61)

12. next time you want to talk shit on me , remember my position in life and remember yours . i ' m not some druggy piece of shit mf , i ' m a fucking united states marine . a title you will never claim . i ' ve worked harder in the past digit weeks then you ever will in your life . i have matured , learned , and taught myself how to be independent while you ' re still living on your parents paychecks . i make my own money , i pay my own bills , i work on a fucking osprey while you can ' t even get a job at mcdonalds . don ' t ever try to talk down to me again because you were once above me because i will do nothing but strive to be on top and be better then the person i was yesterday . i ' ve worked to hard and felt too much pain in my life for you to try and say you ' re better than me . gtgo .

13. it ' s not wrong , but it ' s sad . you should strive to have more self control and let people have less power over you . is it wrong to call someone a racial slur ? of course . do people do it anyway ? of course . should a car hit you when you ' re crossing the street ? no . do you look both ways before your cross anyway ? hopefully . you know there are going to be people who will say things to intentionally upset you . the best weapon you have against that is not letting it bother you .

14. it  s the internet my dude , you aren  t going to change the minds of people who think they  re right . all you can do is flawlessly which is an unfortunate aspect of talking to people on the internet present your counter argument and hope some people are willing to look at things objectively . maybe you  ll convince one person . just present your sources and hope for the best . the biggest thing is to never take the arrows too seriously , it  ll just make you angry because reddit has a mob mentality against anything contrary to the accepted opinion of the day .
   (ID: 8b20a772d1697ecc1b19f9f6451e7346e8b98987)

15. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .
   (ID: a22b82fe301caa42c89cbd71b2e3733753f695d9)

16. hey i am just going by the reports of the " journalist " . i wasn ' t the one who just called them out for being racist without cause . i am saying they are racist because that ' s the report . just like this article . if someone can be a racist just because a journalist writes a story then i can call them a racist because another journalist wrote a different story . you ' re mad because i believe another article , that you don ' t . yet you are the one trying to prove me wrong for some reason and when that doesn ' t work you start saying i have mental disorders and call me names . do you see me calling you names or saying you have a mental disorder ? the things you say , say more about you , than me .

17. so tell me child . how much joy do you get out of this ? and it seems as though you ' ve forgotten there is a world outside of america . where left and right wings protest peacefully , intellectually an through many generations . you seem , perspectively through your comments on this thread alone . like nothing more than an imbecile , a child , an idiot . i hope you come to learn one day that there are benefits to all sides of the political compass . and if your narrow . you ' ll only lead to a narrow mid which in all cases . is simply , useless . good day
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

18. hahahaha ! oh , young one , you have so much to learn .
   (ID: 64c95b6abb6f6b9f974f662d325a5e079c7b2352)

19. lmao how pretentious are you ? you write like a child found a thesaurus and thought it would make him cool . i understand the historical context . slavery wasn  t ok , slavery doesn  t justify genocide . white people were awful  brutalized slaves , doesn  t mean you should go and murder everyone with a drop of european blood . but sure , go ahead pretending you  re smarter than everyone else  justifying genocide , bud .
   (ID: 280643182527d573e119c7952a08fea10d62edd8)

20. i ' ll be sitting here waiting for my props when you become unbloated enough to realize that i ' m not here to only say mean words . i ' ve been here since day one of the subreddit and i ' ve done more to contribute to the community here than most know . your opinion matters to me . i ' m digit  open to the fact that i may be wrong about everything . are you ? clearly not .
