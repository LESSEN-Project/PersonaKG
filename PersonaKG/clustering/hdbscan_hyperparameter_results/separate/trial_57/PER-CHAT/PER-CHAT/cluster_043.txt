1. i know this sounds like a standard answer giving to everyone , but i know that its the best way . i know that because i also was in that position when you have lost so many of your friends , that there is no place to start , to regain them . put yourself out there , and with out there i mean really into the world of the people you want to befriend . when i needed a friend to go to parties with , i needed to go out alone , to find those with similar interest . and is definitely not so hard when you start building up confidence to go up ro people . most people don ' t have a reason to approach you when already having their social circle , so there is no was around for you to just start randomly talking with people that think may be symphatic . nearly all of the people i started talking to reacted super positve on that behavior . some may find it strange at first , same stick to that attitude and evem some of them will become your friensy

2. i ' m really sorry you ' re going through this . that sounds like a huge burden to have to deal with . you left her though , and you have yourself to thank for that . how are you feeling in the shelter ? do you feel safe ? if you ' re having trouble talking to your boyfriend about this i would urge you to try , or reach out to someone . living at home and going to a shelter is a huge shock and can be very overwhelming . please reach out to anyone you trust in your life for a couch to crash on . are you close with any of your siblings ? try to reach out to them as well , at least they might be able to understand where you ' re coming from . please don ' t stay at the shelter though . it ' ll be hard to cope with everything .

3. you aren ' t alone . at least in here . and i thought i was alone in my thoughts . you almost were talking about me . i ' ve never found anyone either . i wish i had a better answer . i ' ve been looking for years and i find no one really . i had one therapist who kept telling me my problems were mine and it ' s because i don ' t love enough . how do you love when you don ' t know what that is . other ' s have said to put others first . how do you do that when others don ' t even see you . so i feel for you in i ' ve never felt i could let go of everything except online and that ' s still behind a mask . if you need to vent , i ' ll listen . good luck my friend .

4. nobody should ever feel this way . it hurts me that your  friends  would tell you things like that . i would take some time to find a new friend group . if there is a counselor or someone on campus , i would utilize that resource too . you don  t need to feel alone . you have a bright future . i  m sorry this is happening to you .

5. it ' s a big mix of stuff but time is just one component . youtube is full of really socially intelligent folks that know how to help you navigate heartbreak . finding the right advice along with finding healthy distractions is key . you have to acknowledge your feelings , while at the same time giving yourself liberty to feel different emotions through other activities and diversion . you have to delve into healing while at other times work on suppressing certain emotions since they are not all constructive and sometimes even accurate . stay social . don ' t be afraid to hook with folks . i personally recommend tripping on molly , mushrooms or lsd to create an experience that could heighten your sense of how beautiful consciousness is . it sucks to say , but pain is a very helpful tool for progress . some people use it masochistically to self sabotage and wallow in a cycle of victimhood , self pity and depression . you could instead use pain to turn around and help other people , perhaps hold yourself to higher standards in important ways and above all use this opportunity to learn more about yourself and how to become the best friend to yourself you could possibly be .

6. i don ' t knnow what ' s like , but here ' s my advice . you are better than your ex . he was a immature a  hole . you are never gonnna relive that day again . courage isn ' t the lack of fear , its knowing your fear and facing it anyway . also be strong . hoped that was helpful

7. do you have to fight it back ? being sad can be a beautiful thing too ! you can ' t always bother your friends and family but it ' s definitely an option . does it feel like you care a whole lot about those people , so much that it actually hurts , like , in your lower chest ? sort of like something is squeezing ? cause i ' ve had that before .
