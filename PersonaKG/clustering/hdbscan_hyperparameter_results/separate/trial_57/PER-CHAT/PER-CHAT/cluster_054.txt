1. i could see this working like the katyusha event

2. that movie is such a children ' s cash grab movie . it would be great to see how far they could take it .

3. it  s not too important to watch the original . it helps put things in perspective and in context sure , but you can enjoy the show as it  s own thing with the bare minimum of lore .

4. i think someone said that was the goal . movie intro then a series ? something this epic , i feel like there ' s no way the movies wouldn ' t let a bunch of fans down .

5. i think we can all admit we have no idea what is going to happen , but all the theorizing makes it fun to watch . i like the idea of gabriel , though .

6. lol something like this might happen in the show , but there is no way in hell things will fall in place this neatly . george has made it clear that the ending will be a bittersweet one and this would feel like total fan service . this is like saying at the halfway point of got that starks will overtake the lannisters and go back to north to live a happy life . this series is not kind enough to do things like that .

7. i ' d be curious to see what a remake of spiderman is like . why has that not been done yet ?
   (ID: 1ebb4643f7e1e4d41ee2503d9b5d94ed0224c96b)

8. i feel like it wouldn  t be so good honestly . i know i shouldn  t judge a book by its cover but the movie  s plot seems too bizarre to me .
   (ID: 7a36b5607ec030b33a99723097f6d67b04c38d99)

9. i think everybody should see it one time . one of those movies you wouldn ' t be able to guess the ending in a million years .
   (ID: 7bbefe3c73b49467552610b8dad9354ce8c09cde)

10. yeah it would essentially be like that show finding bigfoot where every episode they don ' t find anything but are still like , " we know he ' s out there ! "
   (ID: e16a0d174adc309bd63cefcfaac2428d7ebba9e9)

11. video games in general have no place for live action movies . that ' s the point of detective pikachu  to change the balance and opinion about live action video game adaptation movies with a good example . i feel if dp does well , so will this .
