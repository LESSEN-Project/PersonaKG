1. first off , figure out if it  s possible to work and go to these practices since you shouldn  t sacrifice your job and there  s no use starting to go if you can  t finish . i  m sorry about your relationship with your dad but it sounds like you really enjoy dancing for your own self so that  s good . if you  re not looking at dance as a career , and you want to continue dancing , you  re going to have to learn how to juggle performing and work anyway . lastly , unfortunately , remember there  s a time limit on dance , every year it will become harder to do so if you want to do it , the time is now .

2. go for a trade . just about all them are union . they take care of you pretty well . they teach you everything you need to know and the start pay is pretty good . you get a raise every digit months starting your second year .

3. i just don ' t know if this is the guy for you honestly . he just sounds really selfish . i mean , for starters you have every right to wait on saying " i love you " until you really mean it . it ' s not just a phrase you want to throw around if you don ' t really mean it . if he wants to and feels it more power to him but he shouldn ' t pressure you into it if you ' re not ready . he should be respectful and understand that you ' ll say it when you ' re ready . you seem really independent which is a good thing while he seems really need not always a bad thing . i ' m not saying it can ' t work but he seems like he needs a lot of attention and is whiny if you ' re not giving him enough attention . and if you ' re mentally drained and stressed right now , he should really be more respectful and caring about that . especially if you collapsed and have been super stressed he should care more . he seems like he ' s more concerned about himself then your health and well being which isn ' t fair . he should also be respectful of the fact that your family seems to be super important to you as they should be so if you have plans with them he should be respectful of that . also the fact that he asked you to go see him just because he wanted to have sex ? sounds like he can get his ass up and visit you . it ' s just sad that he won ' t despite the fact that you can think of a good time for him to and that you ' ve been really stressed lately . i think a good boyfriend would come to you when you ' re having a stressful or hard time . not expect you to come to him and meet his needs . the more i think about this dude , the more i think " this girl could probably do better . obviously i don ' t know the whole situation but he doesn ' t sound super respectful of the things that are important to you and he doesn ' t sound that supportive . you might need to end things and find someone that will respect and support you . who is a little less needy .

4. okay he is being a little unfair by saying that it won ' t work , if you haven ' t tried it , neither of you will know . and also , if it doesn ' t work , just go back i know there are financial complications with that , but mental health is always first . you can always make more money , you can be un  sad if you know what i mean . sometimes it ' s jot about physically being away , but mentally being away . one great thing i have with my current partner we ' ve lived together and apart several times  very unreliable with money haha we can sit with each other in silence and it ' s okay , or just say " i ' m not feeling talking or doing anything " i know it ' s hard because when you love someone you want to be with them , and it feels like you ' re being mean if you don ' t want to be there all the time . but it ' s normal . try and give yourself some more attention , when you look after yourself , many things in life fall into place . your whole brain restructures , certain things become unimportant etc etc

5. like i said , you gotta trust your gf no matter how evil the other guy is ! even if tries to manipulate her by saying that dutch people are very rude and so on , your gf should know you better and that you are nothing like that . good to hear that the relationship is still going strong and i will say that it ' s normal for you to be worried about the future but i think it ' s safe to say that your girl is a keeper because even though she might sound naive , she ' s dealing with the situation really well imo , she ' s already set some boundaries about not being in private with him but hasn ' t really lost his friendship which he ' s good for her because she ' s in a foreign country and you two are still fine from what you ' ve said , so i think with time your worries will just fade away

6. you seem to have your head on straight , you want to create something of your own , really embrace your parents ' legacy . if you really feel like its the right move and you ' re excited about it than no one can stop you . however , be prepared for long nights of your own , be prepared that if you do meet a woman and you do have kids that you might put them in the same situation you are in . now thats also an exaggeration , you could completely re invent the company to where you dont even have to lift a finger and youre home with your family all the time . but that will take a very long time . its all your personal preference man , dont completely rule out a college experience and a chance to take on a different path because you might hate working digit  digit in a factory with loud machines all day . whatever you choose to do , just make sure you ' re happy and keep your options open

7. expectant father is good for some reading . it ' s not unusual to feel pretty disconnected from the whole thing until partway through the second trimester really showing and regular detectable kicks are big . everyone around you especially her makes this big deal out of something you can ' t really connect to anything you can see , hear or feel . it adds a lot of pressure to connect to something that doesn ' t seem to exist . grab yourself a couple of good father to be books to help put things in perspective and find something to do that you can actually lay hands on , going to the appointments , planning out the nursery , planning out babyproofing , checking out dad gear you ' ll need like a diaper bag that ' s not a flowery tote . there ' s a lot of ways to make this a little more real and engaging for yourself to get connected to the pregnancy and the baby . also be aware of other factors , trouble at home , fear of the upcoming changes and all sorts of things can cause reluctance or a flight response even if it ' s only subconscious . try to identify if you ' re just not connected yet or if there ' s something else working against you . that introspection will arm you to talk to your wife , friends and family about what ' s wrong . talk to your dad and other dads you may know as well for some insight .

8. the hagwon  public school thing is really up to you . i ' ve only done hagwons , so i don ' t have experience with any experience with public schools other than hearing from friends . seems you get a lot more time off with public school , but get paid a lot more with a hagwon if you find the right ones . public will definitely have more job security , as its back by the government , but if you find a reputable hagwon company , that should be just as good . that being said , i ' ve been relatively happy with what i ' ve been doing . i ' m currently working two jobs and pulling in quite a good bit of dough , so if you can work it out that way , you should do it . as for incheon , i love it here . depending on your work schedule , you could definitely make it in to seoul on a weekday . it takes about an hour and twenty minutes to get to any of the hot spots for me , so if you were to go public and get off at digit , you ' d be fine . if you did a hagwon , you would work later so you could stay out and sleep at a jimjilbang and get back in time for work . cab fair is generally gonna run you around digit , 000w back . dunno about anyang , although my gf lives near there currently . she also says there is nothing happening there . i dunno though .
