1. totally agree . i get so pissed off at people you are always like  oh my god , this country sucks so much , it  s shit , i hate it , it  s worthless bla  bla  bla  . mate , you  re lucky enough to have been born in a western european country where you have free access to education , good hospitals , good standards of living , stop shitting on it , not everyone has that luck .

2. dude ' s an idiot . " i ' m out to prove that i can eat shit for cheap , so i ' m going to buy the most expensive vegetables to prove my point . it ' s like saying you can ' t afford a bmw so you might as well take the bus .

3. we are literally destroying this world with consumerism . choosing quantity over quality . releasing carbon emissions into the air . and i wasn ' t talking about the u . s . i was refer to us human beings as a race . not everything is political .

4. no free healthcare ? that is crazy ! why would anyone oppose free healthcare ? healthcare that nobody has to pay for ? who could possibly be opposed to free healthcare ?

5. you ' re an idiot who clearly hasn ' t lived in very many countries . welfare is not what builds the nice parts of town or the transport channels to get a coke into the hand of any person in earth . rich people do , for their own benefit and the benefit of those who work for them . just because a few assholes kill the farm and pocket a tax break instead of giving you personally a job on a micro level doesn ' t mean trickle down economics doesn ' t elevate everyone on a macro level . i repeat , go live somewhere not built by the rich if you disagree .

6. as i understand it , i am not eligible for ebt . are you certain ? when i was single working full  time in a warehouse , i was eligible for some food and healthcare assistance in my state .  it seems like a reward system for being irresponsible . if " continued survival " qualifies as a reward , then it is . if you don ' t have a problem with offering " continued survival , " but don ' t want to see women buying steaks with government money , propose a reasonable solution .  it made me feel ill and really angry . because you assume that a comfortable lifestyle comes from hard work . it doesn ' t . if it did , my grandmother could buy microsoft . the fact is , a semi comfortable lifestyle should be considered a human right . there is no way to pursue happiness while not knowing where your next meal is coming from , and the most productive people are happy people .

7. your argument is therefore  " there is one candy in the shop . i have a penny . some guy comes along , and tells the shopkeeper he ' ll pay a dollar for that candy . shopkeeper sells it for a dollar . " so , i can complain about why should i not get candy just because some rich people decided it ' s worth a dollar ? that ' s called socialism . the real question then is , if the city is getting richer and more propserous , why are these poor people still poor ? something wrong with wealth distribution here .

8. then they lied to you , mate . it is literally illegal to fire someone for an injury . in fact the employer is legally obligated to pay sick leave .   the only way they would be sent home would be if they were illegal immigrants and have no contract . lots of them are brought in as independent contractor and they are cut loose pretty much whenever .   and it does reward the hard working , but you also need to be smart and work with the proper papers . just look around you and see the massive number of people improving their living conditions . as i said again . if it rewards the hard  working then migrant farm workers should be rich as fuck . but it doesn ' t . it works the people who are working in the right industry with absolutely no correlation to how hard they work . especially relative to those outside of that industry who work hard .  can you name another structure with this rate of growth ? go ahead . what is growth have anything to do with it ? i have not said anything about growth . i am simply pointing out that it is a myth that capitalism rewards the hard  working .

9. i dont know about the economy , but they certainly are ruining health care and insurance . way more people taking than giving causes prices to rise . you cant really blame them for being born all at once though .
