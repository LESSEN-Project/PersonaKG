4. granted . a rich guy starts building a city that grows and grows until it covers every square inch on the planet . our resources become depleted and plants are almost non existent . the only way to fix things is to tear down the growth and make room for nature . unfortunately all the buildings are indestructible so we are unable to take them down . within a couple years all life on earth perishes . congrats .

   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

7. yes , i would do it in an instant . sorry to be depressing , but i ' ve already tried committing suicide for this reason . i was and am tired of waiting for whatever is beyond this life . as a person who lives kindly , i feel i have already learned what i was supposed to . i see that " reality " is intentionally vague  every answer poses even more questions . to search unendingly for answers in this life would drive someone to insanity as they roller coaster between enlightenment and confusion . tl  dr i already want to learn what is next by dying .
