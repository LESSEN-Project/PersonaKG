1. that is funny because i thought this is professional hockey ? i think i would be worrying if i was newell brown . you have plenty of right handed shots in each game , why not give other players a try with the main pp unit ? baertschi shouldn ' t be entitled to anything just because he has some chemistry with horvat and boeser .

2. i mean , he  s really good at management but he  s so busy with other people  s stuff that he doesn  t have time for our network . as for temperatures , it  s actually pretty good because most of it is audio stuff but on hot days it can be like digit degrees celsius hotter

3. as long as we can agree that it ' s probably counterproductive for the media to breathlessly speculate about his odds of winning every week and twitter blast ' omg he made a birdie !  hestotallyback ! ' every round , the guy should play as much as he wants . he earned it . see , the problem with tiger was never tiger past a certain point  it was the fact that an entire generation of so  called experts covering the game only learned to cover that guy .

4. was just looking at shaw ' s performance in the under digit if that ' s any indicator . of course they are wholly different levels but still i feel he deserves a chance

5. an injury  free and professional neymar is priceless , but this isn ' t the version that barca are getting at the moment , and barto should realize this . what guarantee is there that ney won ' t start sulking if he gets benched by griezmann or dembele and start publically courting real madrid or city ?   x200b  plus , barca , like psg , need neymar to be fit for the cl , and if he gets injured  suspended once again around the time of this sister ' s birthday , he would probably be worthless for barca . he sucker punched barca digit years back , prolonged his stay to collect a bonus , and hardly left barca any time to get a replacement . barca have already bought griezzmann and de jong . so how much can they spend in subsequent windows if they splurge money on neymar next season ? players like busquets , rakitic , pique and vidal may need to be replaced soon .

6. i mean if he thinks he deserves higher wages and can get it elsewhere he just might . plus we don  t know how well mahrez will play in our system . it  s in the realm of possibility . maybe unlikely at the moment , but i hope to have this set of attackers for years to come . barring when aguero goes back to independiente

7. i see where you are coming from . like i said earlier i just don  t think this year is the year to do it . we really need an ace or two . other then mike do you really trust any other starter ?

8. i mean i am not a coach by any means and i am not necessarily advocating for him to be fired because , let ' s be honest , good coaches are extremely rare . i am just saying that he needs to seriously evaluate his play calling and his decision making because clearly what they are doing at the moment is not working . i also think that his job is made a great deal easier by having such an excellent quarterback .

9. it ' s a bit late in the market . i imagine maldini and boban are working on things that the media don ' t know , but if they aren ' t .   x200b  i imagine we ' d start the season with silva , which isn ' t end of the world by any means . prob wait until winter mercato to solve the issue if it still exists .

10. the game has a lot of counters nobushi counters a lot of heroes cus of her hidden stance ! highlander is one of them
   (ID: afdf67bb8f008481f179013844deeffa5b1b9a03)

11. they are similar but imo fiora is much better and stronger . how ever i do agree that they kinda counter each other . i suppose it is a skill match up
