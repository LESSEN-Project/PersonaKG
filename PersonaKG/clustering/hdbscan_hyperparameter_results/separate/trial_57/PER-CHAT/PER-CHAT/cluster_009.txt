3. i believe that for british people complaining and grumbling about life is an important part of social bonding . it ' s a common thing that when two british people meet they will grumble about something before having any kind of in  depth social interaction . almost anything will do , the bad weather , their house , the high fuel tax , the weather etc . all british people will understand this and understand that it isn ' t really a proper complaint about society . it ' s a shared comradeship in a bitter life that favours nobody in the end . it ' s a social lubrication . a shared misery that finds common ground and a place from which to build a friendship . australians just don ' t seem to get this . brit  ' fuck me , it ' s hot here today ' australian  ' what are you complaining about ? it ' s fucking beautiful . what ' s the weather like in the uk right now ? ' brit  ' uh , yeah . i guess you are right ' australian  ' whinging pom , eh ? ' brit  ' yeah , the weather is great here . you are right ' british people use shared misery and grumbling , whether real or perceived , in order to form social bonds . this doesn ' t really exist in the same way in australia . british people are rather socially retarded on the whole so shutting off their one shared mechanism for social interaction is a great hindrance .

4. sometimes the us title will contain a word offensive in other english speaking countries . example  an old jimmy stewart movie " hallelujah , i ' m a bum " was retitled " hallelujah , i ' m a tramp " in the uk in the us " bum " is a derogatory word for a homeless person , in the uk it ' s a coarse word for your backside

5. it ' s an american past  time to remove things . it started with the letter " u " from certain words . i can kind of understand this one because it ' s not really needed . sometimes they ' ll just treat letters as silent if they don ' t like them . like the word " solder " in relation to electronics . most americans think it has a silent " l " and pronounce it " sodder " . then they started to remove the word " of " from common use . so you ' ll often hear people say things like " couple friends " , " couple things " , and " couple people " , when it should have been " a couple of " or " a few " . then they started removing the word " to " . so instead of saying " write to your friends " they say " write your friends " . pretty soon the average american ' s grasp of language is going to look like a teenager texting  tweeting .

6. ya bruh , just look around you . ever see the great plains ? they ' re flat as hell
   (ID: b259bdd61b72030ba442287b956d7cd424434875)

7. how was i supposed to know that  ? if you don  t realise that there are digit counties in this world besides america you are going to have a hard time . i am british . i do not follow baseball . why is it that the vast majority of americans are so fucking arrogant  ? as for the rest , don  t lower the rest of the world to your standards . i speak english . you do not .

8. as an australia , we ' re not laid back , just racist .
   (ID: a98df1d16d4e1204ace7856449444a3afbb80743)

9. when people talk they mesh words we don  t write it like that and i don  t say don  t choo each state in america pretty much has their own accent . why do people from europe all think we are cowboys and eat hot dogs lol ?
   (ID: 05cbf3ecf2e6aed01f3f564fb918a436b69e48f6)

10. i haven ' t personally noticed it where i live but the london accent is very strong . you occasionally hear the odd word creeping in but normally when people are being ironic . there are , however , other " traditions " creeping in from other cultures . halloween , for instance used to be virtually unnoticed . now it ' s big business and youngsters really enjoy trick or treat . whatever happened to penny for the guy ?

11. cuh  pree sun , like the commercials . if it  s one mispronunciation i ignore it . if it  s a repeat offender i say ,  i think it  s pronounced     in a way they don  t feel dumb hopefully .

12. because when you ' re in rome you do as the romans do . unless you ' re obviously a tourist or you don ' t speak english at all , i think it ' s really rude to go out of your way to speak in a manner people around you can ' t understand . my wife does this to me in spanish when she wants to talk about someone we see while we ' re out or whatever and it annoys me to no end .
