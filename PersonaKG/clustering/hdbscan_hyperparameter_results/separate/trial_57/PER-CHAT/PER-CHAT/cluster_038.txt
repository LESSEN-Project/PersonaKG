1. so what actually happened ? what sorts of rumors  slander can be so bad that they cause him to step down ? i want to support him but i feel like i ' m only hearing part of the whole story .

2. isn ' t this type of controversy and reaction to a manager ' s decision exactly the type of this that shows how the team is valued ? klinsmann seems to understand that he will be fired if they don ' t advance , to the point that i think he will be upset if he isn ' t fired for not advancing . of course , i could be clouded because ld being left off makes sense to me .

3. he didn ' t almost collapse a grooming gang trial and it utterly transparent that you only all of a sudden give a shit about the victims because you think it bolsters your point of ' football man bad ' . you didn ' t care about those girls before and you don ' t care about them now and that is precisely why someone like tommy robinson came to prominence .

4. watch it again . its after he turns and runs . listen to them talk about it , as well . not even close . and if he had called it and thats what caused kozma to break off , why do him and holiday look at each other like a couple of bumbling idiots immediately after ? regardless of how you think of that particular call , instant replay would be of huge benefit to all teams in the mlb .

5. remember when he came out and said he never liked the " drain the swamp " policy but he decided he would keep parroting the phrase because of how much the crowds cheered ? there wasn ' t any backlash for that .

6. i ' d say the title to this is misleading . i listened to the interview and he wasn ' t upset . i wasn ' t either because even with those penalties we had ample opportunity to win the game . it had an effect but that can happen any game and go either way . if pete wants to have an effect on the way a game is officiated he ' ll need to take a page out of harbaugh ' s book and vocalize it all week prior to the game , not after . but then he ' d be . like harbaugh .

7. i don ' t think the complainers get it . the guy could ' ve retired and then there would no more new shows ever . the fact is , when he was terrestrial , he was a machine because he needed to keep high ratings to justify the costs . now that ratings don ' t mean as much and he ' s an older guy he ' s entitled to more time off . he warned everyone over and over and sometimes i think you won ' t appreciate the digit  day weeks until it ' s all re  runs all the time .

8. yeah i get that aspect and he was going by the thread . just damn though , like hardcore entitlement action going on and it sounded like he was the virgin killer of california .

9. look at two people being able to civilly discuss a bit of a hot button issue on reddit ! while i agree about espn probably not wanting to put down too strong of a stance on an african  american for ranting about racism , she went beyond that with character attacks of someone specific just so happened to be our president in this case and seemingly contributing to an already boiling pot of emotions in the country . her hosting a sports show is debatable , i doubt many viewers are tuning into the digit for anything sports  related . that being said , espn has fired , demoted , or seriously disciplined sports analysts previously for less than what hill tweeted because they previously tried to portray an environment of " we are here for the sports , we don ' t have room for political discourse " ultimately , there is a much different atmosphere being portrayed coming out of bristol over the last few years . i don ' t think there was any place for what schilling said , like him or not . making statements like that about an entire group of the population the transgender comments is irresponsible and detestable , but just a few short years ago , statements like hill ' s would have been met with a very similar fate also .
