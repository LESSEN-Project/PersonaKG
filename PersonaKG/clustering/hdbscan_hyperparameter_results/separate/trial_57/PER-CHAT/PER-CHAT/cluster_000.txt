1. i wouldn  t call him an asshole in the situation if i knew the guy and could talk to him personally . this is the sub amitheasshole ? not amithepersonwhodidntthinkitthrough . i don  t think proposing is an asshole thing to do . but it was insensitive , poorly thought out , irresponsible , and a laundry list of other things that point towards  yta  which is what people request on this thread .

2. " the woman looked as if i slapped her across the face " did you even read what op said ? the woman was shocked just because a man refused to hug her son . that reaction is was makes her an entitled parent , you can ' t let your children to everything they want . and no , not everyone on reddit hates moms and has mommy issues . calm down and analyze shit before you start jumping go conclusions , dude .

5. downvoted . freaking touchy feely blah blah blah . it ' s ok to not fix every relationship or make good with every person that you simply have no time for in life or you feel has wronged you or just generally been shitty . op came to reddit to have their position reinforced which it largely is not to get your brand of love  the  world advice . bro  sis was an asshole and doesn ' t get a free pass . if the real sisters in this family can ' t be bothered , why should they be made to appease other people ' s needs ?

6. esh  your wife is an asshole for opening your mail , especially when you ' ve told her not to and continues to do so . you are an asshole for losing your shit over such a petty thing . getting outraged over little shit like that isn ' t healthy man , trust me when i say that it can lead to stress related blood pressure problems .

7. scanning through the profile and just saw this golden moment   what are some things that very few mens do in bed that womens like ?   your post has been removed for specifying majority demographics . please be more inclusive in the future .  how the hell else can this be worded ! the op doesn  t just want to know what rare things vegetarian men do in bed

9. non of us know ops mum , but if she is proud of what she has done that says a lot . simply saying how upset op is to their mum isn ' t enough .
   (ID: d2a1dc4371e8662a7c59b93e9c83ebabd252654f)

10. yta you know if your wife pulled this shit on father ' s day you would throw a fucking fit right ? you have some major issues to work though , maybe do couples and separate therapy , you very obviously need help working through your issues .

11. yta . i say this rather than everyone is an ass or he is because you clearly acknowledge this is a sore spot and you used it maliciously . also , a few questions  what did he need your car for ? are you rough on cars , and is he worried you ' ll do the same to his the only functioning car of the two now ? does he make up for not working by doing chores or cooking or anything ? also , your comments to others on the thread are what truly put me over the line of you being an ass . it sounds like you just want validation , not honesty .
