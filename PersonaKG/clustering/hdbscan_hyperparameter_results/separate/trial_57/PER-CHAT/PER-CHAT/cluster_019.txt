1. steven was too distracted by his current dilemma of self identity , pretty sure we are going to get a tour of the place like we did with the armory .

2. i mean , spider man was also alive soooo , it ' s obviously not during infinity war . unless it ' s after the snap and  or they reset time which would kind of make iw for nothing .

3. the closer to the finale we get , the closer i get to thinking that we are and have been in both seasons seeing a lot of cr4  dl simulation relating to bernard and william  mib . i haven ' t fully fleshed out what that could mean , but i am not sure that we are seeing much in the way of " reality " when touching on some of the storylines we are following weekly . with that said , it puts me in a spot where i don ' t really know where they go from here besides some contingent of woke hosts infiltrating the real world , but with a less obvious twist of some kind .

4. i ' ve always found this idea of them all going into the soul stone kinda weird . we don ' t even explicitly know that gamorra went in there , unless the writers have revealed something i haven ' t read about . we know thanos was able to communicate with her after death , but why the assumption that that was inside the stone ? also , her death was much more closely associated with the soul stone than the snap . even if gamorra went inside the soul stone , why would we assume everyone snapped also went inside ? the other stones are all perfectly capable of killing someone , so why should the combined power hoover the souls into one stone ? genuinely asking if there ' s concrete evidence behind this ' in the soul stone ' thing , not trying to be a dick .

5. no , it had them stay in the neverzone during running with scissors , marco dies in the neverzone but star brings him back to earth , which somehow brings them back to earth . i think it was on fanfiction . net or ao3

6. woooozzzaaaaaa i need a drink . so distance and travel time and logic went out the window ? also you couldn ' t even give us one fucking scene between jon and ghost ? you sending your loyal wolf to valhala and don ' t even pet it ! the fuck but to think d  d fuckers fought for digit seasons for a fucking white polar bear because they have such a hard on for meaningless bullshit .

7. yeah it came full circle with the actual edwin jarvis raising tony at least we can imagine that then lending his name to the ai .
   (ID: 569832646eef001c1724d2ecdb8abedbbfd927ab)

8. i think the other episodes are finished as well , at least that seems to make the most sense to me .
