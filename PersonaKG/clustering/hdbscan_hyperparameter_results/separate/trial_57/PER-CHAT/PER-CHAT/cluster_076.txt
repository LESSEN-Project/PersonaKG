1. abq even aqb would be great if you ' re someone like jalter or scathach with high hits on b . course if you ' re gonna crit with the arts it ' d be best to go qba . can see all the values

2. remember , there ' s nothing wrong with playing both . drawing more cards is almost  bloody nekusar always good . if you ' re playing mono  blue bounce i ' d probably recommend going with both , since you can abuse both sets of triggers as much as you like .

3. i agree , though bumblebee is a bit more frustrating due to how tough it can be to properly transform him .

4. like i said , i very rarely see arc grenades beingusedmore can ' t even remeber the last time i saw one , so i see no point in nerfing them further . as for ronin and monarch , i could agree on monarch but ronin needs the arc wave because it ' s literally his only somewhat ranged ability . i get he ' s supposed a cqc titan but that ' s why his ablilites help him close the gap . good point . the weapon balance would be very differnet without as much aim assist . ironically , you ' re forgetting about aim assist in this scenario . the increased difficulty for console players to track is moslty negeted with that , so " high speed " grapple slingsohts even though i don ' t think i ' ve ever seen one pulled off myself are weaker overall compared to pc imo .

5. i actually prefer the madsen trench to the bar storm or trench . it has more ammo and a higher max damage than the bar iirc which makes it more versatile for me at least . i remember i once single  handedly cleared out an entire enemy bunker on argonne forest with digit mag from the madsen trench , all while hip  firing . i couldn ' t have done that with the bar . i think i get into a different mind  frames when playing assault vs support , which means i don ' t mind small  mag weapons because assault is designed for close  quarters . with support , i ' m looking for something more versatile and for me the burton just isn ' t that , though you have a good point . it is a great shame about symthic , and even the wiki doesn ' t know the burton ' s damage . playing weapons on a low zoom is heavily dependant on one ' s eyesight , you ' re knowledge of faction uniforms , and how well you can spot movement at long distances . though failing that you can just spam the spot button ! another tip i ' ll give with the img is to fire off all the rounds in the drum if you ' re low on ammo before reloading . this way your soldier just pulls the chain out the gun , otherwise he has to crank it all the way back through the gun which takes ages . good luck !

6. true . eitherway , they need to change it considering how other op other legend ' s passive are . i hate having to not play it just because of the passive alone .

7. chi brew is better for single target  with serenity , and eventually when you get digit  set and a higher ilvl and class trinket let ' s say average digit  you ' ll want to run chi explosion  ascension for multi and single , as it just gets easier to manage with very little difference in dps . i might be wrong about the last bit as its been a while since i ' ve gone and played ww , mostly brm at the moment . the most important thing to remember is that this is a game , and   you have to play it my way or not at all   personal preference takes precedence over min  maxing unless you prefer to min  max and like doing as well as you possibly can .

8. i like it for this , ' cause you need a bit of skill to use it in pvp

9. One of my favorite things is yokai shift better.
