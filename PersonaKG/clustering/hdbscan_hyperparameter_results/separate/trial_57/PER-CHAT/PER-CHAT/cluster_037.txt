1. obligatory " not a janitor " but i have one . people in the girls washroom started watting up wet paper towels and throughing them on the ceiling . nobody wanted to go in there in fear of having one drop on their heads

2. thanks for explaining . i can understand employees wanting to get paid for the work they ' re doing , but that seems like a really harsh punishment for just a minute or two of time .

3. i left a full basket of groceries on the floor of a shop because it was too crowded and i could feel a panic attack coming on , i had to get out of there .

4. oh , we ' re talking about cops ? once in high school , this convenience store owner called the police because my friend and i were smoking weed behind his store out of the way , out by a tree , not even on his pavement . cops show up , we toss the joint , and they want to get us in trouble but can ' t really do much without evidence of actual weed . so they start looking for the joint and my stoned friend bends over to help and one of the cops literally pushes him away . never forgot that for some reason . it was such a hard shove and the friend was really just trying to find the joint to help these cops get him in trouble , lol .

5. the company i work for pays us to go volunteer a few times a year with a food bank we work closely with and donate to and what not . the fuckin nerve of some people that come in there is unreal . you have the super nice and just down on their luck people that are super appreciative for anything you give them , and for helping load it into their cars and what not , then you get the giant pricks who make you put digit bags into their brand new car , then when you get there they open up the bags and start taking out vegetables and whatever else they dont want and demand you bring them back inside and give them extra cake or sweets , or whatever they choose then flip out when you tell them that ' s not really how it works .

6. i don ' t think stores should be so pushy when it comes to ihas , rather employees should only sign people up if they truly need it . the iha least in my area got sent out to someone ' s house just to answer someones questions about a roku stick f

7. people got shit to do . you can  t expect someone to stay home just because they have a baby .
   (ID: 5924185c6bc48db6dcdd28618174f57dec4da643)

8. for big companies it ' s easier for them if they rent it . they don ' t have to mess with servicing or maintenance . if it brakes they call the rental company and it either gets fixed quickly or they bring another to replace it . still seems pretty stupid but it ' s just less hassle for them
   (ID: 5d850afd337787a97ade9b037c2a04f0cf830e83)

9. while i obviously don ' t condone it , you can be a really shitty person and just smile it off and nobody really holds you accountable . if you have enough tact you can reap more benefits by asking nicely than actually working for them .
   (ID: b04afe611bf0117a6113d32d3193135cf3a578e6)

10. well you gotta remember they have a job to do , and something as simple as that seems pretty minuscule to you but is a big deal for the employee , boss , and establishment .
   (ID: 3857340322f3015e4a24e7f6aa252884060f24ce)

11. customers that pick up an item from the shelf and then put it back in the wrong place . like , you can see that everything is in its place , is it really that hard to put things back where they are ?
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

12. former supervisor of a corporate movie theatre . i used to not care , but it did bother me when customers would leave bags of wing bones , open containers of ranch all over the floor , etc . if you sneak something in , you sneak it out because it  s so disrespectful to the ushers mostly teenagers who get paid slightly over min wage . we weren  t legally allowed to check bags , so if i suspected someone bring something in , we aren  t allowed to check . so all we can tell them is  please throw it away or put it in your vehicle .

13. people trying to bum out booze and  or cigarettes from random people are sooo annoying . i sometimes get approached outside of a train station and asked if i don ' t have some on me , usually really bad looking smelly people
   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)

14. we want to hear it so we can fix it or oh god not this again ! there ' s two types of managers and owners . sorry i don ' t have a better answer but that ' s just how it is ! i will say though that hilton holds a very high standard and that stuff will not fly for long . the next inspection they get will likely get those types of issues fixed . just always be kind when reporting issues like that . most times we would certainly want those things to not be issues but our hands are tied budget , staffing , time etc . trust me . our job is easiest and most fun when our guests are happy !

15. we had the gummy bear incident when some kids brought gummy bears laced with thc and started handing them out to a bunch of unaware kids who had never used it before and they started thinking they were having heart attacks and they ended up going to the hospital .
   (ID: d3663d2ce7c4ae00f99a93d63a1059e85b14dcb5)

16. just because they are packed doesn ' t mean they are providing the best quality service to their guests and i ' m sure that is reflected in the staffs tips and overall company morale .
   (ID: 06d36f7d62805a0b21c94f31f41e8eccef2b014d)

17. that ' s ridiculous . if someone leaves a shopping cart in the middle of the parking lot , they most likely left it in a parking spot that another paying customer could use . it is so much easier and so much more considerate to just put the cart where it belongs in the stall that clearly says , " place carts here " i highly doubt me putting my shopping cart away is costing someone their job .
   (ID: e16a0d174adc309bd63cefcfaac2428d7ebba9e9)

18. i love brake  checking tailgating a  holes . the look of horror when they think they ' re about to rear  end you is priceless .
   (ID: 282b53f35e0830bec01100307335a8d515d96091)

19. or maybe they were just grabbing a handful of change to tip , and that happened to be there ?
   (ID: 4a5a9ac8eab027b38804427b3c8c5e19c8991de3)

20. or it ' s a bullshit made up story , hoping that they will be one of the first to receive it . reminds me if some guy who demanded to receive his kickstarter shit faster than other people because of some condition . think it was shiftware .
