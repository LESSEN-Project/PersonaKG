1. no , only sticking to " the evidence " at the exclusion of personal experience is where things go awry , you limit yourself and others , and science becomes your master god instead of science being your tool . look , the reason we keep demanding evidence is based on one simple premise .   x200b  people can be wrong .   x200b  do you disagree with that ? you can be wrong . i can be wrong . preachers can be wrong , science teachers can be wrong . anyone can be wrong at any time about anything . everyone  is  wrong about  something  at any given time . i ' m probably wrong about lots of things .   x200b  which is why   verifiable evidence   is the superior method of figuring out what is true , instead of personal anecdote . evidence that can be verified by anyone , and everyone can draw the same conclusion from . that is part of the scientific process known as peer review , where your work is scrutinized and quested by your peers to find out where you are wrong .   x200b  no one single persons anecdotal experience determines truth . nobodys . not mine , not yours , not anyones . only what can be verified to be true via demonstrable evidence can be considered " true . i don ' t claim to have the whole truth . i don ' t claim anyone has the whole truth because nobody does . but we can figure out what is true by doubt , scrutiny , and skepticism . that ' s why we are able to plug our electronics in to our walls and power our devices . it ' s why we have gps , and medicine and vaccines . our entire modern world was built on doubt , skepticism , and science .   x200b  science gave us literally every aspect of our modern world . it is demonstrably true . and i would accept that as a " god " though i would never call it a god , because thats stupid , rather than some ancient fables , or someone ' s lsd trip .

2. i agree we need tax reform , but this is the same shit that will harm the middle class . you can twist logic and facts all you want , but history proves otherwise . no objective economists agree with you

3. there ' s so much wrong in what you wrote . you obviously don ' t know anything about jesus . you probably never even opened a bible before . you just say what you decided , on your own terms , everything you wrote . you just hate trump so much that you got your head up your bum . you just did a paradox on yourself there bub . you successfully wrote a hate speech against people who you assume are hating on others . you hating on people who hate , so you hate yourself !

4. i guess i did make some assumptions . i apologise . thanks for explaining . like i said , everyone is entitled to an opinion . thanks for sharing yours

5. this is probably the worst argument i ' ve ever seen then . i could literally go  hey conservatives eck phlack shmack and it would make about as much sense .

   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

7. it ' s just that you refused to address my points or say anything but lol you are stupid , since you are so far beneath me and you lack the intellectual capacity for rational discussion i have moved on to doing something better with my time . you know it as well as i do that socialism will when you ' re watching it happen on tv every day and you ' re burned up with impotent rage . i don ' t give a shit what you say about me because i have people in my life who actually love me and care about me unlike trump supporters who are disowned by their own children do to how awful they are .

8. super delegates you realise that  s the problem right ? i can read fine thanks , it  s my comprehension of you as a person that i  m struggling with . you actually defend this nonsense . your country is about as democratic as north korea

9. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .

10. wow , you have your panties in a twist . funniest thing you said there is " is anyone else seeing this . are you are looking for people to agree with you ? you need people to come swoop in and pretend to be your mommy like you pretend to do ? get a life ! correcting people ' s use of your and you ' re for a living , in a reply to a comment that wasn ' t even made by you , makes you a loser and the dick , so who is the hypocrite now ? btw , i added something funny to the comment made by someone else , what have you done besides jump up on a high horse and play internet police . like i said before , jump off that cliff .

11. not playing into your hand or giving you the answers you want is not avoiding questions . i have answered each question you asked , if you don ' t like the answers stop asking the questions . once again you think you will paint me into in a corner . you cannot . you will find yourself wanting if you continue to play your social justice warrior , validation game with me .

12. when did i ever say that ? you ' re just trying to find a reason to attack me .
   (ID: aead2f27e61eac000435c3cbfa0803003b966612)

13. i ' m glad you refinined your point . this however does not eliminate your obvious bias . i ' m sorry that you think presenting a concise argument equates to shitting on people . seems to me you are angry and i have no idea why you would be , unless you really don ' t like your ideas challenged .
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

14. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

15. that literally makes no sense . i ' m not sure you know what hypocrisy is . nor do you have any grasp of the abortion or gun control issue .
   (ID: 0847b0a0c2f6c5c595a8cbe2207c0959b37df0c4)

16. that  s your opinion . and as far as i  m concerned my opinion you can believe whatever you want . we aren  t talking about beliefs we are talking about classifying science vs pseudoscience !
   (ID: 70fd28af0eb2c67ebb7ce51abc94c13f1a4f652b)

17. you have a perceived notion on the us government ' should ' run . which you literally just proved my point . you don ' t understand how they actually work .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

18. cool , dude . you seem stable . yeah , so far you ' ve called me stupid , an idiot , a piece of shit , and a dick  man , all i did was post a comment , that in no way attacked you . but thanks to your anger problem , which i ' m guessing you got from your dad , you ' ve made this into a much bigger thing than it needed to be . but yes , how dare i be concerned about the seeming trend of cop  related civilian deaths in the country that i live in . so , you ' re right , i ' ll start packing for brazil right away . i was wrong to question police authority for the job they literally signed up for . so , we ' re done , right ? can we please be done ? ok ? thanks for wasting my time
   (ID: cca2db8a0bcb7aff323abdba1f381d7388c9f713)

19. quite an angry individual really . did you want us to just agree with you and not have an opinion ? you post the comment as a discussion when you should have posted it as a whinge !
   (ID: f5763a92443387c5141c5b5c8482139d272a2034)

20. you seem to be unaware of the irony in what you ' re doing here . is it because you ' re actually that stupid ? or are youjust being paid to pretend to be that stupid ?
