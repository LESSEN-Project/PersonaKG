1. i ' ll tell you what saved me . sure meds help but they aren ' t a fix all end all problems . i was still in a very negative thinking pattern but mindfulness saved my life . mindfulness look up eckhart tolle in the power of now . my ocd therapist uses this technique on those both medicated and unmedicated individuals . having great success with numerous clients i just have to let you know . its about being in the present moment . acknowledging feelings and thoughts but no trying to make them go away or suppress them . i haven ' t had a panic attack in digit  weeks ! it works , trust me . it may take a while but i promise you its very much worth it . it saved my life .

2. this would be better served at . but . people grow and change , and honestly ? having an absentee father in her early years , and the rockiness between you and her mother early on probably has a great deal to do with her acting out now . you deprived that child of safety , security , and stability and that is a huge , horrible thing to do to a kid . i ' d suggest family therapy . the grandmother isn ' t the problem , your daughter just latched on to the most stable thing she could find in the absence of actual stability .

3. how do i tell a guy who thinks things are going well that i just want to be friends without hurting their feelings or making them hate me ? " hey , x , i ' m only interested in being friends " that ' s all you have to do . if a dude doesn ' t respect that and back off , or if they start resenting you , they were never your friend to begin with and you ' re better off without them . " leading them on " implies you ' re doing that intentionally to get something out of it . obviously that ' s not the case , so you really aren ' t doing anything wrong here . you ' re not obligated to give people a chance romantically , and if you aren ' t into them , it ' s arguably worse to tell them you ' re interested in them romantically when you aren ' t . if you aren ' t compatible and you know you ' re not interested , don ' t go down that path . however they react is on them , and if they get shitty with you for saying that you ' d rather be friends , they were a shit friend because they never actually intended to be your friend .   x200b

4. i understand not wanting kids in your family , one of my sisters and my brother are in the same boat . they both planned a vasectomy to avoid any accidental pregnancies because no birth control is digit  i myself was pregnant and was planning an abortion , but when the time came i  couldn  t do it  it  s ok to change your mind granted she should have talked to you about the change of mind , but the minute she started talking about keeping the baby you absolutely should have let her know your feelings , it sounds like you  ve waiting a while after she decided to keep the baby which , depending how far along , you  ve trapped her with a pregnancy without her even knowing the cost of having the baby was losing you . yeah yta but can remedy the situation by talking with her , if she  s too far along for an abortion talk about adoption . regardless find a professional to talk this out with . something must be going on for you to even consider ruining your marriage for an assumed accidental pregnancy , it took digit to make a baby .

5. honestly man , i ' d let it pass . my reasons  she might have different ones and a different answer college is like a completely different world than high school . the social dynamics are different , the education is different , teachers , environment , it ' s all different . if your significant other is in high school still , it would almost seem like too big of a gap to span or for you to be able to relate to . you ' re instantly jumping into long distance relationship territory , you said ? that shit ' s hard . you and the other person really have to be prepared for that one . even then , a lot of times , it ' s not worth it . even when you graduate , are you going to go to the same college as her ? my advice to you  donny choose your future around a girl . especially while you ' re young , developing yourself should come first . if you don ' t go to the same one , then chances are it ' s going to be long distance for the next several years . i don ' t recommend that . when high school ends , you ' re going to grow apart form most of your peers . it ' s just the way it goes . your and her future may be going separate ways . i ' d still talk to her anyways . who knows ? maybe you ' ll find that it is worth pursuing .

6. i know exactly what this is like . i went through this a few months ago . it continued , i spent the whole summer alone at home . and when i came back i didn ' t care anymore , i stopped pretending and just looked how i felt . funny thing is it ' s the same . great post , i hope someone has some good advice we could all use .

7. once i fully realized i was an alcoholic and couldn  t control myself like i had been desperately trying to do , i was like  fuck it , what can i do to make this downward spiral faster !  . eventually , i had a moment of being willing to try something different , even though i didn  t know how or what to do . six years ago , i went to a crappy rehab , where we couldn  t even have coffee and i didn  t always want to be there , but , i  ve stayed sober every day since . i  m totally not extraordinary in any way , i just decided to give doing something different a chance and be open to not  knowing  what was gonna happen . i hope you find some comfort , regardless of your next move or circumstances .

8. what you ' re telling me sounds like he doesn ' t care and it makes you feel bad , so leave him . you deserve to be cared about . don ' t let anyone tell you what you care about isn ' t enough .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

9. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

10. it sounds like a very stressful situation i  m sorry . have you talked to him about how you  re feeling ?

11. that ' s fair , one year is a pretty common tipping point in a relationship in my experience anyway . if you feel you have truely put in the effort to address this and seen no improvement , than i think you know what to do . let him know you ' re unhappy and that you want to be with him , but his lack of attention is hurting you . if he still does not put forth the effort than it ' s time to move on .

12. the unfortunate thing with being human is that despite our radical free will , we can only choose for ourselves  not others . i ' ve been through young love and know its inexplicable potency . however , first love won ' t necessarily be your best love . in situations like this , the more you try to force things , the worse they will become . a few words of encouragement about your sexuality  gay and lesbian relationships occur among many species of animals in the wild . there ' s nothing wrong with what you ' re feeling or who you ' re attracted to . i think what makes people uncomfortable about it is that it inherently presents a challenge to the privilege heterosexuals have and are generally unwilling to reflect critically about . although you don ' t want to break up , try to stay strong . the best thing you can do is let her know that you love her and are there for her if she needs you . i wish you both the best .

13. being single does suck . i ' ve been single my entire life m16 . i usually cope by hanging out with friends . i know i ain ' t the best looking , nor am i fit . but yeah . i get how you feel . life does suck that way . whenever i feel down about being alone , i usually think " i ' ll find that person eventually " some day you will . just continue doing what you like , and hang out with your friends

14. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .

15. nta nta nta . those first few weeks between mom and baby are so important and it  s all about you and baby . if your moms feelings are hurt , fine . if she doesn  t have a relationship with you or the baby because you didn  t let her stay in your apartment that shows the type of person she is . just explain to her you want to use the time to bond with the baby . personally , even if you had a great relationship with your mom i think it  d be better if you experience this with just you and your fiance .

16. umm well , my lies are what led to this tbh . i promised her change and i didn ' t . i was busy with ending college and trying to get into grad school and just didn ' t want to deal with everything . i will always regret that mistake , i can ' t tell you how much regret i feel for letting her down after all this time . i have apologized many times , but she just doesn ' t care , she ' s fed up and i completely understand her . i know we ' d still be together if i didn ' t make my mistakes , i take full responsibility . but she was my first love and i wasn ' t ready from something as intense as her . always knew she was the right girl at the wrong time . but she doesn ' t have feelings for me anymore , so i have to move on and find someone else . if our paths cross again or if i meet someone else i will never make my past mistakes ever again . i have learned my lesson . the hard way .

17. you ' re not a bum ! the fact that you came here to post this means you still have hope ! honestly , i was feeling down like you too , but then i stumbled upon guide to purposeful success and it really helped me find a purpose in life , which i am pursuing every single day now , and it ' s been great ! hopefully it can help you too .

18. my only question is why did he have to hide it ? is it from him being ashamed or you shaming him ? before you blame him , figure out why he didnt trust you enough to tell you flat out from the jump ? didnt you guys have sex talks , fantasy talks , etc ? if you seemed uncomfortable with sexual things maybe he was like , " oh i guess i ' ll leave this one out " im just of the mindset that you have to figure out if it ' s you before you blame him . a lot of people can not be that objective because it requires putting away your emotions and just looking at things for what they are and not as some act to hurt you .

19. hey brother . you are not the only one who has experienced shitty women . i  m prior service army , medically retired . i used to be a cavalry scout . when i came home from my third deployment , i thought everything was great . for a few months even . until a mutual friend suggested that i check my wife . i wasn  t convinced , but i checked her email one time and was horrified by what i found . she had been with at least two people , had unprotected sex i know this because several of the emails was her asking both of them for money so she could pay for an abortion , and was continuing to cheat even when i was back home . we don  t always like to admit it man law or something , but when you are betrayed by someone with whom you have bonded with , it really freaking hurts . and there is nothing wrong with that , it just means you are a decent person . you  re doing the right thing by getting it off your chest . don  t feel ashamed , that is not your cross to bear . follow the advice of some previous commenters and make your place your own . have a few good buddies over or go out and get to know yourself again . you have been given an opportunity to free yourself from a toxic relationship and to learn from the past . hold your head high , and know , that just like in the military , there are countless men and women to the left and right of you , who are going through the same thing , and will happily help you too your feet again when the burden brings down .

20. you ' re not being dramatic . he ' s telling you that he wouldn ' t be there for you . i ' d listen .
