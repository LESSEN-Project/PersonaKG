1. anytime . there ' s also the amount of alcohol he drank to consider . honestly i ' ve thought about getting a squad for my roommates over that alone . a bottle of jameson is a lot of liquor , i don ' t care how much you weigh . whatever you decide to do , keep yourself safe . i hope it goes well . do not let him back into your life after this . you ' re through with this fuckin scrub , and you have better things awaiting you .

3. nta but you might regret missing out on that special time with your loved ones later on in the future when it may not be possible anymore  and avoiding a chewing noise might not feel worth it .

7. because why would you need it , if it ' s for self defence and knife just as easily does the trick . if you like to shoot it go to a gun range . for what reasons would you need one in a home

8. i honestly really dislike the trope where women or men pretend their child said something . it  s like me making my sibling ask my mum a question when i was a child because i was embarrassed to ask myself .

14. been there and it wasn  t worth the time . the impact it has on you when you like and are not  liked  back is really negative . save your own time and feeling and withdraw .

15. why does anyone defend anything ? it all comes down to perspective . some people can  t see beyond the mistakes he has made and some can  t see beyond all of the good he has done . its beliefs and values . some defend him because they are more alike than they are different and same goes for the other way around . it  s really fascinating to see how much effort people put into making sure everyone knows how they feel about someone else .
