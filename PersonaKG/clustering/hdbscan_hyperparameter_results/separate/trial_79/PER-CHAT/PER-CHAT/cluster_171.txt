   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

2. try reading factfulness by hans rosling . he goes through all sorts of stats to show that we ' re actually improving in all sorts of ways , including those that people generally think are in decline . the gist is that bad news gets reported heavily , so people get a bad impression of humanity , but actually we ' re doing pretty well .

3. i think it ' s more of a celebration than a " get people back into the game " sort of deal .

6. romney allowed some folks to take his money and turn it into more money for him , and that qualifies as work ? yes , as a matter of fact i think our country would be doing a lot better if we elected people with janitorial experience to national office .

7. his tweet starts with " can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign " does he think he ran a presidential election against the fbi ? against the whole us government ? he is implying that whichever political party has control of the whitehouse has complete and utter control of everything the fbi does . then why is he running such a huge campaign against the fbi now when he ' s in power ? and why is the fbi investigating him and his people ? it ' s almost as if he doesn ' t have unlimited power over his fbi .

8. i think most people miss the problem with her name . the problem is stupid parents naming kids stupid names . that is the real problem .
   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

9. it honestly not that . i think it  s smugness coming from people who think they are more important than they are .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

10. some people think the moon isnt real , and is a hologram , and that we never went there . i swear my brain hurt today when a friend who i game with said this . his reasoning everything you learned in school is a lie . and what stupid people always go to is " in school you were taught that columbus discovered america , but there was already people here so how do you discover what is already got people .

11. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .

   (ID: 5218a6fd3b7d990775fbaa39249c20beea16f741)

15. in my culture , if your ears are warm it means someone either mentioned you or someone ' s talking about you . when my ears suddenly inexplicably get warm , i think people are talking about me that exact moment .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

16. it breaks my heart so bad . the torture it had to go through , the amount of stress , the horrid human to do this . reminds me of how my cat got run over and we think someone sped up to run it over , people are horrible to cats but they  re lovely creatures of treated right and with respect .

17. works best if you ignore people so they think you ' re in deep thought and focused
   (ID: f17c5192b8fcf82d4857fe8b8d226705db4093e3)

18. being happy and being usefull for other people . for me if you think you shouldn ' t be happy you are living wrong and if you think it ' s fine being a useless piece of shit you are living wrong as well .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

19. or it ' s a bullshit made up story , hoping that they will be one of the first to receive it . reminds me if some guy who demanded to receive his kickstarter shit faster than other people because of some condition . think it was shiftware .
   (ID: b25bdf3935142c93d642393810cba283ec3b801f)

20. if you hold people to impossible standards , you ' re going to be disappointed . what if the perfect man for you isn ' t exactly " hollywood handsome ? " you ' re excluding a lot of people because you ' re too picky . also , you might not be as great as you think . if you ' re so great and you ' re still single , there might be a reason . maybe your personality .
