1. every time you think you need to fart it ' s a poop and everytime you need to poop it ' s just a fart . the sensation will adapt with them so that they never get used to it . this way they will waste a lot of their time going to the bathroom to sit down and fart because i ' m guessing they will never take a risk after a while in heck .

2. yeah mine ask me every time it starts up , i think they do that so you can just restart it if you fuck up . instead of looking up all kinds of words

3. the musics great , the crowds great and the clapping is in sync . i begin to clap as the next song plays , looks of horror as i  m out of sync . i can  t control it , i try to clap in time but i can  t it  s not possible . i stop to compose myself , those looks made me embarrassed . i try again i start well but the beat just must be too fast , everyone around me swing to look at me . i dash out of the area . i think there is something wrong with me , there must be , i probably just ate too many cheesy wiggles .

5. you seem to have normalized his shitty behavior at this point . there is no reason why you should be working full time  still taking on the domestic role . if you weren ' t working , sure . but that ' s just so fucking ridiculous and selfish , " tradition " be damned . it sucks you have kids with this guy imo . i think you should leave him .

6. amlo is just another stooge that protects and propagates the interests of transnational capital . he provides cover and a nice veneer while the capitalists go in and loot the natural resources , markets and labor of the country . much in the style of an obama or trudeau . i have no idea why you think anyone would care what time the asshole wakes up at and why you find this at all admirable . it ' s funny you would leave out the chavistas and maduro . why do you have such little political imagination ? why do you think your liberal tendencies are at all permissible in this sub ? are you another one of these white latin american men that has no problem stomping on the rights of indigenous peoples so long as capital accumulation processes can go on unabated ?

7. i think it ' s normal that he should be the last one to leave the ship because the other are under his responsable si obviously he has a big big risk to go down with the ship . but the tradition of going down with it just for the principle just by honor or symbolism or whatever is really weird and stupid to my opinion but yes the valors in our time are very different than the ones at the time of the tradition so .

8. i mean , that ' s possible . if you ' d regret not asking her out then just ask . worst that happens is that she ' s not interested and you ' re at no different a spot than you already are . try not to think too much about how things could go in the future , because you ' re not there yet . one step at a time .

9. how can you be committed after just a month . most guys date more than one girl at a time . personally after a month i start cutting off ties from other flings , but you ' re a fool if you think you ' re the only one in the first month
