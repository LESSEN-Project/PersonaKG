2. my dog literally screams whenever she gets a bath which thankfully is only necessary maybe twice a year . she ' s a husky so usually just a brushing is enough and she usually likes that , she doesn ' t mind me trimming the fur between her toes either but if it ' s her nails she throws a fit . i usually do all the grooming she needs myself because shes difficult to work with and i ' ve tried everything to get her to calm down . i ' d rather not have a groomer get frustrated and intentionally do something harmful for her .

3. i got one for you , too  what about a god who created everything which includes sin , if he created everything , who had his own son killed to get forgiveness . he could  ve just forgiven us , because it  s him that is the forgiver . if you argued he didn  t create sin , he could actually do an innumerable list of things that would help more than killing your own kid .
