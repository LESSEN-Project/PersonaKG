3. ok . i ' m genuinely curious . what possible course of action could you have done differently , to " save me " from the " burning world " as you put it . that required me beliveing in you ? what possible new resource do you gain from my belief in your " prediction " that will stop the world from burning ? or at least save me from this fiery premonition of doom ? p . s . i don ' t think listened and end is a good rhyme , and it maybe would have helped your case more if you rhymed all your " song ' s " verse .

4. denard going to be a solid pick up , however not a must start right away . he had a good game but i really don ' t think i would trust him until i see him produce more consistently . if you are super desperate maybe flex play potential but starting anyone on the jags is a risk

5. ianal from what i read in the article , no he can ' t do anything . i would apply for college , send the bill to your grandparents , and proceed from there . try not to let your uncle scare you . i don ' t think anything has to get legal . if it gives you peace of mind , talk to a lawyer . p . s . i would cut ties with the uncle . good luck with everything
