4. may seem simple but if you don ' t buy it then it won ' t be in the house for you to eat . oh also if you get a craving for junk food ask yourself if you can eat a piece of fruit instead . if the answer is no then you ' re not hungry and you don ' t need it . good luck

5. i don ' t play halo , i do play rdr2 both are probably good , but i doubt that pc gamers get shit on because of it . pic games , overall , have a larger player base .

6. yep . tbh i don ' t mind gameplay that doesn ' t exactly mirror the game . i don ' t care how " realistic " it is . but i do care about how fair it is . the one thing that hasn ' t been changed is the mechanic that helps the losing team , prevents too long of a winning streak or too long of a losing streak . that ea bs that tries to keep us wanting to improve and being reassured that we can be good at the game . it is soooo morally wrong , and i containing my rage is an act of heroic zen buddhism i ' m aware this is an oxymoron .

7. it depends on the charity  some pocket the money for themselves which is why the founders of a lot of them are millionaires . but if it ' s actually going towards a good cause , i don ' t see why not . i ' d probably choose to feed and  or vaccinate children .

8. you had no interest in non  consensual pvp yet went to a competitive cg in open . i don  t get this way of thinking . good on you for not combat logging though , at least you were willing to take the consequences of your decisions . maybe try the next one when your chieftain is engineered and you have some more rebuys , you might really enjoy it . o7 commander .

9. i don ' t miss my teenage years at all , maybe the lack of financial responsibility is good . but that ' s it .

10. agreed the recommendations are key but no matter how many good ways to work around a dismal result you may offer , the bigger picture stays that " you suck this quartemonth  week  day " . on the other hand , even if you don ' t provide reasons for a good performance , you suddenly become the champ and it sucks !

11. eh , if you don ' t lose too much . there ' s a good deal of interesting dialogue plus some fun decisions if you have that jar with you when you speak with her . honestly if you don ' t smash any of those jars , there ' s dialogue later in the act tied to all of ' em . they all belong to some poor bastard .

12. imagine thinking you need to tell me the definitions of the words you clearly don ' t understand ! but i guess if you are xtian , logic isn ' t your strong suit ! good luck to you , hope you learn to listen before it ' s too late !
