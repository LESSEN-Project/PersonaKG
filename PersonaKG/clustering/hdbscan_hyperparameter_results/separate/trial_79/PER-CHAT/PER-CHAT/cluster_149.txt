1. it ' s certainly possible , but you have to have the correct style flare tool to make it match up to the fitting properly . i forget the distinction of what ' s different about the factory ford flare double bubble vs ? but there ' s something weird about them and it ' s not the typical flare style . wrong flare style means the line wouldn ' t seat and seal so it would leak . i stand by the junkyard recommendation , lkq owns a lot in my area socal , i think i paid  digit  ft for that line , so like  digit ?

2. spoiler this makes me think of jason segel at the end of episode digit , season digit , of how i met your mother . what was he going through to produce a scene like that .

3. not so much as i met someone so hot they made me think i was gay , but i dated a guy i had digit interest in and thought i might be gay because i had no reason not to like him back rip

4. never ever pay first for challenge services . if they refuse , find another person . i think this is the only way i got scammedwasn  t much , like digit chaos , but the act of being scammed leaves a bad taste in my mouth . item trades are much easier to avoid

5. i think it was like digit days when i was around the age of digit or digit in the summer . i really didn  t care lol

6. then you really are as stupid as i suggested at the outset . they are completely accurate and they are about digit times more useful than your nonsense because they ' re the meat and potatoes and nobody gives a shit if you could add digit tomes of ands , ifs , or buts to them . " meat " is not a complete description of steak and " vegetables " is not a complete description of salad but those are the main points you think of when you see steak or salad on a menu and an adequate description of the difference between them for you to decide you feel like having one a lot more than the other . and all i asked you , was the difference between autism steak and retard salad .

7. my mother was an only child , she said it was very lonely growing up as an only child and she always wanted a big family . i have digit siblings , after seeing how expensive it is raising a child and all the other drama that goes with having digit kids , i think it is insane ! i personally would like to have two kids . maybe three .
