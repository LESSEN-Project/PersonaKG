18. undoubtedly more time . mentally . something is off , maybe underlying issues that arise this action . one must ask , what could she possibly of done to set him off ? how does she even stay with him , even if she did love him ? he sounds more dangerous , possibly more harm to be caused in the future . further testing should be considered with cases as severe like this .
