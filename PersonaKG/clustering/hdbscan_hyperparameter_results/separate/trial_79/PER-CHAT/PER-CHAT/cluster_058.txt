1. i hate to ask , but have you updated your video drivers ? you probably have , but i had to say it . did you " remove local content " in steam before you did a new install ? have you ever installed any mods ?

3. absolutely correct , she did seem genuinely in a kayfabe way intimidated and upset . then he comes to her aid . perhaps it seems more chivalrous because she is a woman vs say how brock lesnar will do the exact same thing for paul heyman , or undertaker did for paul bearer . but perhaps that is the issue , you as a wrestler are physically intimidating a non  wrestler , when you should be taking your aggression on the person that non  wrestler is managing . in the case of sarge , he would get atomized by rusev so he targets lana . which is a pretty shitty move on his part , i say . but i digress , i could probably talk for hours about how weighing his actions , rusev comes out looking more face than a lot of his opponents . not only because of the infrequency of his heelish acts , but also the severity of them or lack thereof .

   (ID: 4cc753880acafe19a59cd87ecc09d1637e797277)

9. roby  " have you ever done anything to hurt the national security of this country " what a pointless question ! regardless of whether he did or not , the only way he would say yes is if he believes he has taken actions to purposefully hurt the country . he ' s not a cartoon villain . he ' s a misguided idiot .

10. that  s what the bible says   and the t  rex did make his arms short and cried  look , noah , for now i may fit in your vessel ! and noah did say unto him  no , for your ass is still quite large . and thus did the mighty t  rex , arms now too short to tread water , drown .

13. i agree ! to pretty much anyone in a western  hemisphere or of european lineage context it  d be a fist fight . but , in their context though they see it as innocent not to say it  s not ignorant of medical conditions and genetics , etc , caring and a less awkward way of telling a person they  re getting pudgy . if someone was really offended they would be profusely apologetic , but also completely not understand what they did wrong and still chalk it up to a foreigner not understanding the culture .
