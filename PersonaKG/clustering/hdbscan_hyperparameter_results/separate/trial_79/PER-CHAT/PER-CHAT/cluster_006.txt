5. " the woman looked as if i slapped her across the face " did you even read what op said ? the woman was shocked just because a man refused to hug her son . that reaction is was makes her an entitled parent , you can ' t let your children to everything they want . and no , not everyone on reddit hates moms and has mommy issues . calm down and analyze shit before you start jumping go conclusions , dude .

6. first of all , i meant no disrespect . i just find easier to understand your points if you put some commas . it ' s not " perfect grammar "  it ' s basic grammar . i do have a source for russia ' s massive participation in the balkan campaign , you can find more details , numbers and suggested reading here   ww1 was mostly trench warfare i ' m saying yes because the major powers who were fighting in ww1 who had any chance of winning fought on the western front i am not sure about the " any change of winning " . where did you read that ? i would appreciate some sources as well . if you want a game about the western front , you have a point . but if you want a game set in all of europe and maybe with extra continents then you really should consider that trench warfare mechanics could only be applied to a minority portion of the map .
