   (ID: 4654e3a9a75835f9ff28170ddf31d5d3cf296ea2)

2. why not ? i always wear shirts with the company logo on it on days where i ' m doing " work stuff " but still want to dress casually . a lot of people travel for work , so chances are they might be meeting a client or colleague at the airport and didn ' t want to worry about what to wear . its usually a safe option and won ' t be seen as inappropriate

   (ID: e74de4b8aa6f46c2dd5cb848b2770028e7469b55)

4. 1930s in the reich was the dystopian future that everyone talks about forced euthanasia . if you spoke up you ' d be sent away to a concentration camp or if you ' re different you ' d be sent there too this is why i want to be a history teacher to teach people how the past actually was

5. what if someone  else wanted you dead ? is it okay if they put money aside ? what if we get it government funded by taxes ? what if all the killing makes a profitable business and we establish and industry based on it ? what if it then becomes the thing to do , the norm ? this is a great idea . thank you . i will find more people that want to kill meat eaters so we can set this up . would anyone be interested in investing in my business before the shares skyrocket ?

6. dude , if you have an attractive so , let her show that shit off . you should take it as a compliment when other people want to fuck your girlfriend . if you really can ' t handle her style , then maybe she ' s not for you .
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

7. i see . i feel people want others to exercise to conform to their standards using health and physique as a dumb excuse rather then caring about someone being happy . ofcourse it is different when someone is obese but you get the message . also , many sports are boring and gyms are full of toxic shits anyway .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

8. i want all the sex with all the people and im cool with however they want ti do it . i use to get a lot of it , its one of the worst parts about leaving the world and starting my own society of one where nobody judges you or takes all your stuff and makes you homeless .
   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

9. unfortunately some people do want that .
   (ID: df5782bf400d51bffc6c2c684d4cf7440c0759f6)

10. some people are raised in a fashion that they never developed the want to have kids . instead they see it as any other decision in life and look upon its downsides . usually they end up turning away from it
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

11. veteran here  us army infantry it ' s uncomfortable and the straps get mushy and gross from sweat and dirt . after several hours in the field you ' ll take any relief you can get . it seems counterintuitive to people who have never experienced combat  but most guys who actually see combat want to wear as little armoprotection as possible because of how uncomfortable , heavy , and hot it is .
   (ID: 9e87e41610d2b37afebec0735d29e1c1e05a18e0)

12. makes me wonder why those people never injure themselves on purpose . it ' s a doctor ' s job to fix them . why would they want to take that opportunity from them ?
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

13. no shit . blacks are basically a protected species it seems . they do fuck all as a people besides crime , of course , yet you can  t even stare wrongly at them unless you want some problems .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

14. and by taking these other people into consideration you make a problem where no problem was . let them be what they want , not victims .
   (ID: 9425493e0ea7469367495f8e5947330e536cafa9)

15. people who are only your friends when they want something
   (ID: 7779353ef52866e4a25d663a52411bbd5af0e0a6)

16. when people ask me to do this , i explain the coupons are based on what you purchase , so there is no store card . they can sign up for their own if they want . end of story .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

17. because being with someone shows that you ' re desirable . people see that somebody else wants you , so they want you .
   (ID: f39e591889b6331bd255039773030c1b50c7e201)

18. open facebook since it has a much higher character limit and list off things that are facts and the left and right hate being told . eg  black people can be racist , women should do what they want with their bodies
   (ID: aaa48b20e0db13bcef79f2bb41dfe8e30b503939)

19. i love how this assumes there ' s a significantly large amount of people who want to dress up as prince . what happens if i want to go as michael jackson ? how does that work ?
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)
