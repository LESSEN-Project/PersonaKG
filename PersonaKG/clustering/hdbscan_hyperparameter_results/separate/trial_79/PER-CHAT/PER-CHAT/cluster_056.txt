2. technically , i answered with " natural beauty " . many people find natural beauty to just be too plain . they want extraordinary beauty . in this day  age , i feel that the standards for beauty  attractiveness are far too high . you can say some bullshit like " i want someone with a kind heart " or " i want someone who is charitable  caring " but you asked for what people find attractive . for me , it ' s natural beauty . if you don ' t like that answer , maybe you shouldn ' t be asking questions on  askreddit . maybe you should be asking questions on  askredditandgetonlyanswersiagreewith .

3. no i commented on something . i was not disrespectful just questioned another commenter because i didn ' t see logic in the post and apparently questioning thedonald or the subject matter on the page is frowned upon . it ' s almost like they don ' t want people to ask educated questions or form opinions on their own .

5. they ' re just doodles i felt like sharing with the sub . there ' s plenty of great fan art out there , so go look at that if you want something more professional . don ' t gatekeep what other people can post .

6. this question always surprises me . women want what men want according to personal preference . in other words  just don ' t be a dick . both genders , duh . no one cares about your stupidly expensive tricked out car , or if you ' re willing to wear a party dress in january . its dumb . just be people ! holy shit , i ' m frustrated now !

7. i can ' t stand instagram however i don ' t like the people who use the site , you do you , if you want to use that cesspool of garbage , that ' s fine . the reasons i strongly dislike instagram , is particularly because it is made by the owners of facebook . i ' m not saying reddit is superior , or anything like that it is just because of the history of facebook , history of anti vax users . i

8. well that just sounds lazy to me . is that the only reason people want illegals is so we don  t have to do the jobs nobody wants to do ? what job could be so terrible that somebody wouldn  t take it ?

10. why are so many people telling this guy to get a lawyer ? no lawyer needed . just don ' t do it ! it ' s illegal as hell . also , stop paying for your brothers car . tell him it ' s transferred into your name or you stop making payments . also , also  move out ! i have to be brutally honest , your mom sounds shady as fuck . you don ' t want to be around when it all comes crashing down on her . stay at a friends place or rent a cheap room . just get out of there !
