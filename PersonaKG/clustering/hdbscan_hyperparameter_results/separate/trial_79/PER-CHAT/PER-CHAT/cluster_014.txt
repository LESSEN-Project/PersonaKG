4. virginity is a made  up concept . it doesn ' t affect your worth in any way , shape , or form . you should choose to have sex when you feel it ' s right for you . if you want to have sex just so you can say you ' ve done it , that ' s also fine . you should just do what you want , basically so long as it does ' t harm anyone else obviously .

5. when bots ask you to prove you ' re not a bot by solving a captcha , you should technically be able to just do whatever you want , and how are they gonna verify it if they can ' t solve it ? if they say it ' s incorrect , just tell them no . they obviously failed to recognize the correct answer because they are the bot .

6. those statements are just examples . there are many other . the point is that if you want to say something but if a word was replaced with white or if a white person said it and it would bother you , you need to rethink what you ' re saying .

7. maybe ? i mean most of say you want to feel loved , you want a relationship that includes sex , this would just make it meaningless .

8. one of my pet peeves is that here in oregon the signs say " motorcycles use extreme caution " that they can craft a sign with four words that has two mistakes  okay , one definite mistake and one iffy word choice  just makes me want to bang my head against a wall .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

9. due to this sub ' s rules i can ' t say what i want buy you should just leave her .
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

10. i dont want to say this happened because its pretty unlikely , however for some reason to me it seems like coins would move around until they were stacked in a certain way that would prevent them from moving around , and these stacks do appear to be doing just that .

11. wait so your gay or you ' re not interested but want to talk to her . harem ? either way you should say no since it will only end in disappointment for her . just be kind .
