14. i mean there ' s no way to know for sure , but the fact shane went out and sold an f5 instead of sandbagging or trying to escape makes me think it ' s likely a work .

20. i mean i ' m the only one who will , not because i ' m interested in you but because i know that i ' m driving you up the wall and if your efforts to get the last word and provide yourself with some small win in life , and because i think that you ' re bad and that you should be punished . and because i think you ' re impotent rage and lies are hilarious . you could easily prove to me your age and your body type yet you refuse because i ' m correct .
