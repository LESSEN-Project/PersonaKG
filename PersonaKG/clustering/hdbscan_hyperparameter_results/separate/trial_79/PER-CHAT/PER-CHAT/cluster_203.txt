5. maybe because in history and also still now african have suffered from a big discrimination i mean it was much worse than discrimination but i don ' t have the word , so it ' s still in the people ' minds so even if it ' s a joke it reminds people of horrible events in the past

   (ID: 5dc1e0203cb86a245c4ede5cb73923b295b1fdc8)

9. why do you keep brining this back to race , how does saying that most people who have been alive on this planet had no real impact lead back to " you are ok with more black people dying than any other race " . you are obviously making some connections that i am missing . all individual lives are an acceptable loss so long as the human race survives . i don ' t care about other people losing their jobs , i don ' t care about other people dying and having family members die . i only care about the people i love and the survival of us as a species . i see you added a um , ' gotcha ! ' at the end there so please enlighten me as to how i specifically said i would support blm .

   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

   (ID: 230ce64c825c9de0874b588b6d715819e39e5610)

   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

16. people trying to bum out booze and  or cigarettes from random people are sooo annoying . i sometimes get approached outside of a train station and asked if i don ' t have some on me , usually really bad looking smelly people
   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)

17. very few gifted people accept that they are gifted . don ' t expect many responses .
   (ID: 9d1b3fafafa63d6ec9712c98a0c16b4cc697d112)

18. yes , yes i fucking do . i don ' t have to die of horrible infection because of a papercut . i can go seek treatment for any ailment i might have . and i don ' t have to get my head cut off because i refuse to accept that a sky wizard will burn me for all eternity if i don ' t beg him for forgiveness for something he made me do . your numbers are dwindling , finally . people are starting to reject the yolk . people are starting to see that nothing happens when you put your hands together and beg the sky to make your life better . your book ' s lies don ' t work so well on educated people , as it turns out . go thump your bible somewhere else , dude . i ' m really not interested .
   (ID: 74058c90ada3aae7a59703064acbf3ced38f3681)

19. i definitely agree with you , and this book isn  t all  no one goes to hell if you believe in mercy  type stuff , it  s the direct word of jesus and there is stuff in there saying if you don  t do what  s right you will go to hell . but i understand your point , and agree that we also need people to realise that if we don  t act on the graces god gives us ourselves , we will go to hell .

20. insurance should be and used to be based on risk . legislation has taken that out of the equation in many ways . younger people rightfully don ' t recognize it as their responsibility to pay into a system when their risk is lower
