16. oj for sure . yarn provides good , quality strategy in a nutshell and yet still manages to make it entertaining . nickatnyte and chief pat are good too , but their videos get repetitive after a while and their much longer than yarn ' s . clash with ash also provides good content , but his videos are a little too long for my taste  excellent for strategy but not that entertaining . the other ash is awesome but rarely uploads . as for the rest of the ones i ' ve seen . they ' re meh . molt and eclihpse are entertaining but they clickbait too much , and galadon is starting to go down that road too recently . those are the only ones i ' ve ever watched so don ' t hate me for forgetting any . grinning  squinting  face
