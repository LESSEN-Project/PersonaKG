2. do you draw your tags or buy them over the counter ? we have tag draws and only you can use your tag . but i have heard of sharing tags in states where you can buy a handful of tags or a punch card . the differences in hunting laws state by state are pretty neat . i was just talking to a guy the other day i forget where he lives but it is illegal to hunt with radios there , and where i live i can ' t imagine going into the woods without one .

4. my mom once told me she didn ' t understand why god allowed me to live . little backstory . i was born nearly digit months premature . i technically died twice . the doctors told my parents not to get attached cause i wasn ' t going to make it . fast forward to the incident . my mom accused me of stealing her digital camera . she had just returned from a stay in maryland and couldn ' t find it . for hours she berated me and topped it off with the " god shouldn ' t have let you live " comment . the next day she found the camera in a box she had yet to unpack . she never told me she found it or apologized for her comment . she just pretended the entire situation never occurred . my dad apologized on her behalf .

6. just curious , is there some sort of " vesting " in the canadian system , to prevent folks from moving to canada and getting benefits from others paying into the system ? for instance do you have to live there for a period before receiving benefits ? it may be something you need to consider .

7. nta judging by the fact you could pay off all her debt , plus buy her a new car it was obviously a decently large sum , that i agree with you i would not just randomly hand out to a girlfriend of digit months that you do not live with or are engaged to . maybe you could of helped her a little if you really wanted to , but you have no obligation to give her that money , or justify how you spend your hard earned money .

8. just do what i do , keep telling yourself you can  t live forever .

9. congrats ! my uncle ' s got a cat too and she gave birth to digit kittens . though one was born dead and the other didn ' t survive the first week . they ' re now 3weeks old and they are still so tiny they just fit into your hand . i love them . i hope whatever you decide to do with them that they ' ll live a happy life . red  heart

10. thanks for this post , it ' s very informative . i can ' t imagine having the fbi on my tail for just doing what i would consider normal . what a terrible life to live .

11. maybe his friends are just used to mockicking him and they do it rather jokingly . that ' s kind of insult  based friendship  relationship , commonly occur in real life . hiccup allows that because he is fine with it . if it comes to the villain , why wouldn ' t he try to insult him ? his aim was tomake hiccup lose his nerves , start acting impulsively and be easier to defeat . of course the more accurate and touchy the insult is , the better are the results but maybe grimmel couldn ' t come out with anything better as he never met hiccup in his live so he just reffered to his appearance . after all he ' s tights aren ' t very thicc .

12. i went to bed about midway through the live election , i couldn ' t watch anymore . then when i woke up and heard " celebrations at trump tower " coming from the tv when i got up for school , i just said " welp , apparently we wanted him to run our country " .

14. unfortunately that ' s just the way things are in the country i live in . i would not be surprised if that manager had to suck someone else off to get to where he is today

15. so you ' re immortal but you can still feel pain in all ways not just physical . on top of that , what if you lose an arm or a leg ? or all of your limbs ? you ' ll just live forever with missing body parts . sounds horrible .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

16. digit  . hardly any difference , then just live off the interest and fuck off the rest of my life
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

17. i live in a city , so i ' m a goner if the outbreak happens near me . guess i ' ll just bend over and kiss my sweet ass goodbye .

   (ID: a50471e2e88a582d7b78a3eee4aaf882ed0652cb)
