3. thank you for being helpful . i just get so worried because i have the tendency to lose my train of thought when i get nervous . i ' m worried i won ' t be able to make my point or that i will say something that will get him angry at me . i can handle it . it just wouldn ' t be productive y ' know ?

4. twas a joke my man seriously speaking , that ' s just the way the world is right now . i ' d say every human being that is breathing right know is depressed , but on different levels and degrees . teenagers are a fucking mess . it ' s not weird for thing like these to happen

5. as a teacher can i just say , we know you will never look at it .

6. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

7. you know , they say that when your world looks kinda blue and you wish that you weren ' t there , just close your eyes and make believe and you can be anywhere .

8. stephen miller . i just know he ' s plotting the downfall of the world , which is pretty drastic if i do say so my self .
   (ID: e3aadeaf18df437e62f5c1614d251bf343fd2de2)

9. i get what you mean . i  d say it  s the general misconception that if you  re jewish you support israel and that if your anti  israel you  re an anti  semite . it just that the two are paired together unsurprising very often . i know plenty of jews who are anti  israel at least in its current state , it  s just the misconception that makes it seem the way you describe .

10. lol only total alt  right scumbags claimed that the nazis were left wing , now you have no credibility it ' s not for you because i know you ' ll never change your fuctupmind it ' s just to get you to say something stupid so the kids will know that your philosophy is a meaningless nothing just like those who espouse it .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

11. i know guys who are in a much worse situation that still manage to chat up girls . you look fine , just start socializing more , you got this shit . you say you hit rock bottom , then you have absolutely nothing to lose . you can do anything .
   (ID: a94f9d1b4f214a201954fad436f54011c9c235f8)

12. i just say " it ' s your god given right not to believe me . just know that you ' re wrong and i hate you "
   (ID: ce0130e0736ec79181ef08a51b107514a8021d5c)

13. if someone  s tailgating you , just get out of the way if you can . stopping hard and flipping them off is only gonna make them angrier . if you can  t get out of the way , learn to properly brake check . you  re supposed to lightly tap on your brake , so that you don  t decelerate but your brake lights come on , letting them know they  re too close . if all else fails and they persist in riding your ass and possibly following you , then i  d say it  s okay to stop short . just brace yourself for a possible hit and a lot of yelling afterwards .

14. you know , i came to the comments to say this as a joke , but now i just feel kind of sad for you .
   (ID: a08c2f92d84d04f55a5ceec0c95c818851f0ccf0)

15. so you keep telling me , i must have really made you angry with my opinion . didn ' t know it would shake you so badly . at the point you just parrot what i say while putting crying emojis in it i would really call it a conversation .
