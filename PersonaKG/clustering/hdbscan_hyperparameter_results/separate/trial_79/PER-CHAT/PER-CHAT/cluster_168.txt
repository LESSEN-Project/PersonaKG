1. also , i think those groups are just louder than the rest of us and maybe that ' s why it feels like everyone is going crazy when in fact it ' s just a few people .

2. that most people seem to think the mandela effect is just misremembering the spelling of a word . not the bearstain bears thing i have no clue how to spell it as i never heard of it in the uk but like , people think dilemma " used to be " spelled dilemna and it ' s like . no , no it didn ' t

3. i think what he does takes a lot of work , but it seems that he ' s very happy to take something he read and just run with it because it sounds disturbing or creepy or weird , regardless of whether it ' s true or not . he ' s sacrificing integrity for shock value , which kind of sucks , but i guess it demonstrates the priority is getting views , rather than being informative on less mainstream topics and encouraging people to think critically about the world around them , as i had optimistically hoped the series ? might be . it seemed like he was going to do something groundbreaking but once you realise he ' s just reciting pseudo  facts he found online it just gets kind of flat .

4. i would actually like to play this scenario . but , the thing is , everyone would just camp their wool the whole game and there wouldn ' t be too much pvp . also , i think popular people ' s wool would get target too much . but overall , great scenario !

5. people who bring about suffering like that are just sick . i eat meat , but think it should be put down as quickly as possible . that ' s just damn depressing .

6. well a ton of socially anxious people think of similar shit like this that happened years and ages ago so just add it to the end of the queue .

7. damn they should rename mma to bonesfans . can ' t believe so many people are defending this . you think a hacker would go through all the effort to just slur one random fan instead of a higher profile target like dana or gusfafsson ?

8. sounds like he has that " talking constantly " disorder . these people are insufferable but i dont think they can help themselves . their families put up w the constant talk but these people usually grate on their friends who almost always distance themselves . or ue could just be extremely selfish  wad probably catered to as a child .

9. you can start learning the language and if you  re moving i would recommend at least knowing the basics for practicality duolingo is pretty helpful . you could also see if you can get taught  there are usually people teaching languages that you could go to . in most countries tbh there is a variety of languages spoken and you should be able to find some people who speak the same language as you . maybe do some research as well ? i think there are also apps that are like tinder but for making friends  just be careful when using them .

10. i think that you shouldn ' t just accept a medium life and keep dreaming just like you were doing when all people where younger without jobs , duties and partners

11. i wish there was more people like you in my school . everyone there just treats me like a circus freak who can  t think at all .

12. other family members watched all of it , so i ' d be in the room through most of it . i think early on i just decided it wasn ' t for me . i get why people like it but it was marmite to me .

13. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .

14. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .

15. i just think that people who get mad at trees and reindeer on government buildings are just getting mad at a part of christmas that pretty much the entire country celebrates , and isn ' t even remotely christian . gotcha . as a us citizen i pretty sure you ' re aware of our world champion status at getting butthurt . nothing official or otherwise will keep grumblers from grumbling . officially removing its religious status whatever that looks like would just provoke an even bigger response as i see it .  yeah , i ' m not trying to . i ' m starting to think i should have made my frame a little more concise as to what i meant by christmas being ' not christian ' . ya , this is the reason i think people are kind of lighting this idea up . it ' s what made me think the reasoning had an emotional basis   as stated it ' s a bit off  balanced .
