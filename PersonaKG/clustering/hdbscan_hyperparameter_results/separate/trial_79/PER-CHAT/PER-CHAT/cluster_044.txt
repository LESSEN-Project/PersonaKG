1. first of all , how would time travel " write out " those characters ? i ' m not sure i understand  just need some elaboration . second , " easy " writing usually isn ' t good writing  it ' s lazy and uncreative . the russos are better than that .

3. judging by your response , youre probably a terrible parent who doesn ' t take the time to enforce standards of good behavior in children , and instead says ' thats just the way kids are ' and lets them run around batshit crazy being a fucking menace .

4. i went and saw bohemian rhapsody by myself when it came out . it was a first for me going by myself , and i actually ended up liking it more by myself because no one was distracting me by talking to me . no one gives a fuck if you  re by yourself anyway , you  re just going to see a movie , no one  s paying attention to anything but the movie . have a good time !

5. lager tastes different to me every time , if it  s after a very long hard day at work especially in good weather then it  s the best taste ever , other times it  s just so , straight after food it tastes pretty bad to me so i guess it is whatever to mood strikes me

6. 26m here . you basically just described me . so not alone ? though i also dont feel good about this ravenous pessimism toward dating either but can ' t shake the feeling that it ' s all a waste of time

7. you ' re saying that in order to come up with the simplest possible code of morals , throw out everyone ' s and just look at santa ' s views of right and wrong , from his time frame in his own eyes , only what he sees . alright . unfortunately , good and bad still don ' t exist . you can ' t pin down that concept . you ' re still looking at a code where the boundaries have been drawn essentially arbitrarily . if he has some book of law that dictates what is good and places everyone somewhere on a given spectrum , wherever the middle falls would still be up to him . this is partially why our legal system has the court system , to deal with those grey areas , someone a judge sits down and just makes a decision , coloring in the grey area and more precisely defining the middle . at the end of the day , it comes down to santa making a decision based on whatever is going through his head at the time .

10. do all the volunteering  internships you can , i suggest thesca . org in the us totally worth their one  time application fee , it ' s super easy to apply for things once you have your profile . be willing to travel wherever you get offered a position . alaska doesn ' t get too many applicants , so it ' s a good starting point  just be willing to go without internet or cell service for a long time . it can get lonely .
