6. whatever camera you have right now , even if it ' s just on your phone ! see if you enjoy doing it , and if you do decide to upgrade , just ask yourself " what don ' t i like about my photos " and research what gear will allow you to counter those flaws in your work .

7. at my family gatherings , the second you walk through the door all you can hear is " howzit " because we don ' t actually answer , we just respond " ja , howzit . like if you had to translate that , you sound like a crazy person . " how are you " " yes , how are you " " yes " repeat for every single family member that you didn ' t arrive with .

8. same here . this is reason i sometimes don ' t use mic . get abuses like go back to your call center . go get me a brownie fudge . what hurts is not the insults but the fact they sometimes don ' t listen to me just . because i am an indian ?

   (ID: 1f5fb3afbdbbd97679f3cfc15e38e6aeb5ab4eb4)

13. lol her coming to take him away from the horror and casually asking him if he wants to talk about it even their first sex is unnatural , although at this point it is just becoming boring . i agree the development of their relationship is necessary for the show , but don ' t like the way it is done
   (ID: a7aa6341e1b57ce267a054932c0fecc933562532)

14. just looked at a bunch of current pics and i don ' t see it . the only body line remotely similar is the rear window has a upwards swoop at the end . the fender , gate , lights , and shaping of the back end are all unique . this is like saying the new civic ripped off a wrx . it ' s not that they look the same , they just have the same styling that is becoming more popular in the whole industry . but please post pictures to convince me otherwise

   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

17. ditto . i tried to totally give it up this year for one year , but decided that wasn ' t for me after four or five months because i just wanted to taste different things . i like trying different drinks at sampling events , or having a free glass of wine at a company function , but i won ' t pay for it . it ' s like junk food at a party , it ' s there , it ' s free , and it ' s tasty , but not something i seek out . i don ' t really like drinking it enough to purchase it myself , and one or two drinks put me to sleep , so i don ' t see the point for me .
   (ID: 32963b268f862205bfe0776470d7730e54b581ec)

18. i absolutely cannot believe you . you disgust me as a human being , i cannot believe someone on this planet would do something like this . you vile creature , i don  t have the words to describe what is wrong with what you do . i just still can  t believe you only eat seafood .
   (ID: 06fa10b621f97c2a4cf8f0194b3238e179bcbc8f)

19. no , it ' s a small private college . i ' m not going to give any more details though just because i don ' t like posting my location on the internet .

20. just go to a pub together . if you like him you can take him home after and blame it on the alcohol the next day . if you don  t like him , alcohol will either make him more attractive or you dumber to meet his level .
