6. the hard work one is debatable . but i do have a clue about the bible and jesus , i just used logic to determine that neither are correct and worth believing in . as for the locker room stuff , i don ' t know about you but i just wanted to change and go with my day since i am straight . kinda goes against the bible thing though if you did what you are talking about in the locker room .

8. it ' s a possibility , but we won ' t know for sure for a while . i honestly wonder why she ' s so scared in those scenes . did she incur salem ' s wrath somehow ? or , based on the fact we don ' t see him in the trailer , maybe salem killed mercury as an example of what will happen if she fails her again ?

11. not necessarily . i get that same screen on my phone when i check cod  ww2 . i know for a fact i don ' t own that game . if you didn ' t buy it and you don ' t game share with someone who did it ' s probably a bug .
   (ID: c519a98c7c9a6ada7f5b8a2ea7a086ff306fdf9a)

12. did this even happen or was it just a setup for that pun ? i don ' t know who to trust anymore .

13. well , i grew up not being able to have a computer powerful enough to play a fps . i always had a consol to do it . so i prefer it . i to this day hate aiming with a mouse . and i don  t have a computer powerful enough still . i know i can plug a controller in to some games but it  s not for me . i  m glad you enjoy it though , and wish i did more .

16. did you know i instantly down  vote any misuse of the term ' literally unplayable ' ? it ' s one of a long line of memes that don ' t even come close to being funny . also , the contents of ' interface settings ' changes depending on which interface you ' re in , and it made sense to group it with the legacy combat mode , which is not interface  related .

17. i don ' t know if i trust the validity of this being the " best answer " as it has two votes and is at digit  . did they borrow reddit ' s voting algorithm ?
