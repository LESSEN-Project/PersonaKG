1. choose your poison that ' s a nice test to give to people that are literally incapable of telling good from evil , because you made them in such a way . doesn ' t sound very flattering about god ' s character , is it ?  christianity at least imho is a soothing white lie i prefer calling it opiate of the masses . it helps one notice both great utility as a painkiller and horrible side effects .   x200b

8. why does anyone defend anything ? it all comes down to perspective . some people can  t see beyond the mistakes he has made and some can  t see beyond all of the good he has done . its beliefs and values . some defend him because they are more alike than they are different and same goes for the other way around . it  s really fascinating to see how much effort people put into making sure everyone knows how they feel about someone else .

10. i hate when people doesn ' t understand that an elementi has not the same properties in every molecule he ' s in . shouldn ' t otherwise your mouth explode when you put salt on food because of the sodium ? or oxygenated water be good to drink ? this is simply pure ignorance , even middle school teaches you this

11. the entire point of memes is to repost them . this is the definition  an image , video , piece of text , etc . , typically humorous in nature , that is copied and spread rapidly by internet users , often with slight variations .  i i find it annoying when people repost on the same subreddit tho . it would be good if u could see mutual subscribers to other subs

12. and who is doing the ' calamatizing ' ? not the good people of syria . no , it is the not  so  good people who spring from the same authoritarian bent that insist everyone conform to the grid as mentioned in the article . setting that aside . i never said calamities are a good thing in and of themselves . i merely said it induces change .
