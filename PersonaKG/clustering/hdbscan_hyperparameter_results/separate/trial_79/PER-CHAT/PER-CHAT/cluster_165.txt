1. i think i do am missing the point if the whole point of the game is actually just to survive rather than having fun !
   (ID: 7abdd1ff4025ac98f2d8a33f37f453aced51d2a3)

2. how well someone speaks in a beauty pageant is irrelevant to my point , i wasn ' t trying to point out everything about each topic . plus it is just an idea , i think you are taking it a little too serious .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

3. that is funny because i thought this is professional hockey ? i think i would be worrying if i was newell brown . you have plenty of right handed shots in each game , why not give other players a try with the main pp unit ? baertschi shouldn ' t be entitled to anything just because he has some chemistry with horvat and boeser .

4. you come across as such an entitled douche , just because your opinions are different from others . doesn ' t make them wrong . get over yourself , ever think you ' re part of the problem with society today ? such a hypocrite
   (ID: 059c976738098229106db9c4736116cbb2f47eb8)

5. if it makes you or them uncomfortable there ' s nothing wrong with it , but if it ' s more of a " i think it bugs them " you should just ask if it does then go from there .
   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

6. for me . i just think  how can i benefit from this or how can it benefit me
   (ID: 4e784da799782c45d8883de53e87a533129a3b8e)

7. you thought really hard about this , but what about touch screens on phones ? do you think those keyboards should poof or just the physical ones ?
   (ID: b4819e8f05b9cd125c7dddf5a89da65e5326e69d)

8. no . not at all . being attracted to men makes you gay . whatever you do in the bedroom with your gf does not . yes they do . why wouldn  t they . that just means you guys have intimacy . most guys are scared of trying new things because they think it makes them gay , which is retarded .

9. mostly just think it was kinda funny
   (ID: c6cc92fb6dee5f65446e9383372864b9e25f1d60)

10. no i think it fits in the category of " just a blowjob " however everyone ' s different . there ' s not wrong answer
   (ID: 4ffb044c26007ae2bade7d602b40fcd747aae147)

11. it ' s both if you ask me . he clearly can ' t just forget it , but i think he also makes a choice not to .
   (ID: 9c2d2fde31927b8cc3bc419049de8844ca720cb9)

12. think of every horror movie out there or you watched now remember someone had to think it up first . just cause they think it doesn ' t mean they are evil well except me muah ha ha ha .
   (ID: 2623e4996f6df0e5814dbede4fbc9c1f13de4382)

13. i do love mine , and i do recommend it but think carefully first . it ' s aperture priority only , which means you can ' t choose your shutter speed manually apart from flash sync and bulb mode . it ' s more compact than an slr , but only just . you can ' t change the lens , so you ' re stuck on 45mm focal length with it forever . there ' s no exposure lock or exposure compensation apart from altering the iso dial . the battery needs an adapter or a work  around . the insides are delicate , and i ' m sure that some of them will need the rangefinder mechanism adjusting although that ' s easy to do . however , that being said , i love how simple and restrictive it is . it gives you more of a chance to think about your shot , rather than your settings , which is a huge thing for me . the light meters are super reliable too . here ' s some images from mine captioned with the film type  i hope this helps !

14. just gonna throw this out there but i think the older brother is gonna be ippos first pro opponent , cant remember his name but its the one who quit and got fat  they just look similar imo , have similarly aggressive personalities and overconfidence in their under trained fighting strength , its just a feeling .
   (ID: 64ee30820164d5febf4618f35085fd26a3387cc9)

15. i think this is so amusing just because it doesn  t require physical exertion . actually having to do it isn  t entertaining whatsoever .
   (ID: 5b59b30ecdf3a93e4634d1600b3020fd8e9dc7e2)

16. ok , because you think it ' s irritating i ' ll delete the other hundred instances of this copypasta that i put on new posts just for u
   (ID: 19b4ed6f1de0ad72f91a05af773ead6efafec41a)

17. this question just made me think of the movie sleepwalkers .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

18. i have one friend who knows but anytime i tell them they just go  oof  and if he comes round he buys loads of food and eats it and it ' s really triggering . also my other friend who i hang out with is going to latvia so i ' m kind of screwed . i think my plan of action is to get out of the house as much as possible so i can try and ignore my urges .
   (ID: 168d1161144e63a83a23f04ae4e64bd4b25684c0)

19. and i think to myself , what a wonderful world . it ' s just so perfect .
   (ID: 28f883d57b9f1fffcad681de2efdbceb1a7aeecf)

20. i didn ' t think this question would be interesting , just a doubt i had , i ' m glad someone finds it interesting .
