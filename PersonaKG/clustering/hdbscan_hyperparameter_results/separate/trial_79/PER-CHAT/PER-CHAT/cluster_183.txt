2. lol you masturbate digit  digit times a day and came to reddit ask for some sort of solution to your attraction towards women ? nah bro you need help  even though you don  t wanna hear it . there  s no magic solution  you  re gonna have to put in the work to learn why you feel this way with a therapist and that  s the only way to solve your problems .

4. i woken be fitter , smarter , have more sleep and probably more money too . i  m digit currently . i would also have left that group that i thought were my friends and go find ones who don  t exclude and ignore me . as a result i probably would be a better person all round  with no anxiety issues or depressive stuff . oh , and my study habits would be wayyyyy better . in short , i would be what i consider a digit from where i am now even though i  m in uni and doing okay .

6. karl  heinz rummenigge , the ceo of bayern munich , has criticised the wages being paid by clubs in europe ' s top leagues . pointing to laliga santander , the premier league and serie a , as well as referring to the specific example of antoine griezmann , the club chief expressed concern . " i ' m not only worried about the transfer fees , as digit or digit million euros is now nothing spectacular , " he said in an interview with bild . " i ' m much more worried about the salaries being paid , especially in spain , england and italy . " the trend is going towards paying net salaries . " we need to be careful not to destabilise out salary structure . " they ' re huge . " look , for example , at griezmann and his salary worth millions per year and paid net . " all of these salaries have to be multiplied by two because the clubs are paying the taxes . " bayern munich won ' t participate in such craziness . " rummenigge went on to explain that filling the squad up with youth players is one potential solution . " we need to keep doing what we ' ve always done at bayern , " he said . " in the future , the 17th , 18th , 19th and 20th positions in our squad should be filled by young players who don ' t cost as much and who earn a normal salary . " we ' ll need to be able to bring through one or two of these four players each year and have them in the first team consistently . " i ' ll be an interesting challenge . "

7. what we should do is prepare kids for taxes and other life skills that aren ' t taught . however , i feel more teachers and smaller class sizes could help children who are sliding under the radar get the education and attention they need . i barely finished algebra digit because the teacher couldn ' t teach digit students efficiently . granted , i don ' t need much extreme math to do what i do in my daily life , but it would be nice to have learned trigonometry instead of it being on the final and having never touched the subject once at all in the class .
