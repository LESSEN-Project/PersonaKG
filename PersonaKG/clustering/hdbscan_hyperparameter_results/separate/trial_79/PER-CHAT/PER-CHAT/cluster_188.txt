1. my first shot , they took a moderate amount of work with having to slice up the huge piece of skin i bought and having to cook them in the oven , then fry them . they are more like cracklins than puffy pork rinds , but i sprinkled some cajun seasoning over them and they taste pretty good

3. sounds like you should quit your job and find somewhere else to work if you hate it this much . it ' s not healthy to keep working there if you can ' t stand going there every day . and happy birthday , for what it ' s worth . have a good day , you deserve it .

9. thank you gunther  w for chiming in . i like the design concept of the coils but i kinda figured they might be " too good to be true " i ' m not sorry i tried them , but i really like the starre with their stock coils more .

   (ID: dd50b301fbfd713e92cffecd0a18fa135e6d75d3)

11. i used my generic gem on void and he is a god , so good for longer fights like mini bosses or bosses in aw .
   (ID: 11e562551d8ce916c649db9948355e07c68fed96)

12. absolutely ! it ' s such a good show . watching the characters come to their own conclusions whether they be true or false is really interesting . if you like broadchurch , i recommend fortitude .

13. it was shockingly easy . like , they matched us and we were like  that  s it ?  it  s been wonderful , though . we love our au pair and she loves our kids , and it  s been so cool getting to learn about her culture and show her ours . the only cons would be that they can  t care for really young babies by themselves at all so you can  t even run to the grocery store and leave them with your new baby , and the hours they work are really limited which is good and necessary but is annoying to calculate

14. as if stephen a does a good job at covering anything he  s one of the reasons why i hate espn . i love sports , but commentators like him ruin sports for me .
   (ID: 7a396588993d687f5528f10b200dc9d6db769270)

15. with soccefootball there are so many players around the world , plus the transfeloan system , it makes it easy for the wealthy clubs to acquire good players . in the nba it ' s a lot more difficult , sometimes there is nothing they can do . teams like the lakers and knicks would have been relegated a few years ago , despite how big of fan bases and wealth they have .

16. looks like you ' re enjoying yourself . have a good day too . sorry you got downvoted but i guess you have to be a green haired chick in yoga pants to get some appreciation on selfies .
   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

17. is this a new best friend , your post history makes it seem like it posting you have no friends . you should have started with asking if they have a spare phone you could borrow as you look for work . hopefully if you get the job , you keep it , until something better comes along . good luck .

18. quite a few " shark tank " products are good like the comfy , scrub daddy , ring doorbell .
   (ID: fe6b1b66071dc00d37ec62082f207f9acbbd0642)

19. i find that pre thinking does me a lot of good in that type of situation . having a course of action plotted , like " go for a walk " for when my brain reverts to purely reptillian type responses is invaluable .

20. was king kong any good ? my parents would like to see it next year on my birthday because of that universal studios ride , but i  m kind of skeptical of watching a musical starring a giant puppet
