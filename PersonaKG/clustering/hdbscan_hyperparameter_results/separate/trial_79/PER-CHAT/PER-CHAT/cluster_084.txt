1. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .

2. those kind of games have that " feature " but it ' s not what i meant . i think i just made some term up in my dreams or something like that . thanks for the answer though

3. look up " romantic bpd relationships . not saying this is what she has , and not trying to shame anyone with this diagnosis . i just think this may give you some insight and useful strategies you seem like a lovely , thoughtful person

4. i  m a ftm , and the first bit of your comment sounded just like me lol . i have everything planned to a t . i read somewhere about ftms being more likely to get induced so for some reason in my head , me giving labor always starts with me being induced . i think i do this because if it  s induced it  ll be planned and i have a weird obsession with planning everything lol . reading this really made me stop and think it might not go how i plan for it to go , which is scary .

5. that  s crazy . what so you think the reason is ? something attached to zak  came through  the text ? there was an episode where jay was doing a conjuring and zak actually said that out of caution , they won  t air the full segment  words spoken by jay , right as i saw jay sitting in the circle and speaking i muted my tv until the conjuring was over . i feel like that could stir some stuff up in tv viewer  s homes just by listening to the whole thing .

6. i feel like the total opposite , swap almost everything you said the other way and thats me . im not edgy , i think my iphone is okay , idk what music i listen to but its not rock musichttps    billwurtz . com  , i like my parents , dont really care about anyone else . i dont use spotify , but instead just using a 3gb folder called " music " . i do use netlflix sometimes . i find that interesting

8. like these dudes really blame any small thing just because they can ' t get pussy or anything , and they think relatively high of themselves , it disgusts me . maybe all these women didn ' t give him a chance because he has such a big ego .

9. this guy is like herpes . just when you think it ' s gone it shows up again with a vengance to irritate the holy shit out of you .
   (ID: f76420437c1e4fb2e8ba8a9e9b0e116c7fc513ab)

10. may i ask how old you are ? if you think about something like this , it seems like you ' re just about to graduate .

11. i mean , i am a lesbian , so i wouldn ' t think that . yeah , she ' s just really fucking rude . i promise that not all of us are like that !

12. it could do although it isn ' t very likely i just can ' t really think of anything else that would click like that and freeze a pc

13. timing when to buy a home is difficult since it will obviously be a long term investment . i think you should gauge where you are living to determine if you have confidence in your city and county first . if you do then go out and buy a home that you like and can afford at the best possible price for you . trying to timing the market for a home is just not worth it .

14. you think that , and its not easy ofc , but its really just a case of finding someone like you . my husband and i can do ' nothing ' all day . even a week if he ' s off work .
   (ID: bfbfd4c4caa6b137f79275a24c99808ba3d2305b)

15. i agree with you for the most part , but some of the halloween items , like the templar ' s spirit for the medic and the squid ' s lid for the demo actually look pretty cool . i think they should just do away with the restriction .
   (ID: e53542ff680164cdf45964372fb47cf6a7d48484)

16. i think the guy just look like him , not much more to it .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

17. off topic about this picture but on topic about the bikes do these bikes have better baskets ? like are the holes on the side of the basket huge because the baskets are useless if you wanna keep your phone or anything in there because they will just slide out . like today i used one in miramar and i had a can of iron bru import from scotland i think and it slid out the side of the basket and pierced a hole in the side causing it to squirt out this is one of the older bikes

18. i  m not mad , i just feel like most questions on this subreddit are subjective . we got a number of comments that were different , so clearly reddit can think for themselves . not sure what your deal is buddy .
   (ID: 8e526eeef1df2fdf1b086c88d0eaaade44307b6c)

19. oh boy , i do have a lot of ridiculous stories according to reddit . i didn ' t think i had really interesting or unbelievable stories but it seems like redditors just do nothing all day every day .
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

20. i watch porn videos where they act like they love you gf roleplays . it ' s just an act but it warms my heart when they talk to me . i always think " that ' s how it feels when someone loves you .   x200b  it ' s pretty hot too
