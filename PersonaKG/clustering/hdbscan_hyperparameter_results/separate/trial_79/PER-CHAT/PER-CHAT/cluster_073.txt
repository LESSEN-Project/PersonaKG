1. don  t go into a relationship with the mindset that you will change the other person , aka don  t fall in love with the person you think they can be . if someone says that they rather be friends with you than date you and you say yes to being friends , you can  t think that they will eventually fall in love with you or that you will be able to win them over . this one might seem obvious to you but i think we have all seen this happen .

2. i have lived in canada my whole life . never had to say a pledge of allegiance . as someone who has never done it , i don ' t think it ' s weird . the usa is a great country and typically they ' re very patriotic . you ' re swearing to the ideals of the country , not the leader itself  that would be messed .

3. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .

4. huh . i never romanced tali but i figured he would say it at some point , maybe you missed it ? i don ' t think shepard ever says it first though , i remember him answering " i love you too " to most of them , but not the other way around . i guess it ' s usually the love interests who confess their undying love and stuff , shep tends to show more with actions than words .

6. i don  t really understand what you  re saying  and it  s really not helped by the fact that you can  t spell  align    to leave is to louse our say   do you mean  lose our say   ? please note the spelling of  lose    loose  , which is what i think you were going for , is the antonym of  tight  . sorry , who  s will  ? the twunt who got us into this mess was dave .

7. i ' d say someone with aids but i ' d prep myself for the ol " one pump and done . soooo probably my parents . don ' t think i could bang them .

8. i wouldn ' t say i have a big ass . it ' s not flat either , i think it ' s nice and i always check myself out in the mirror , but i would only say it ' s a little above average . i don ' t think ass size has anything to do with it though .

9. instead of tucking me in to bed as a kid with the whole " don ' t let the bed bugs bite " deal , my mom would kiss me goodnight and say " you can do or be anything you put your mind to " and i think hearing that every night developed my confidence and strength for the rest of my life so far
