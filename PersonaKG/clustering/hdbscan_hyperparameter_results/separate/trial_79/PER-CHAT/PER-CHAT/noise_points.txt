2. i don ' t believe the earth is flat . let ' s just establish this . but what is the explanation for people who do ? a is it some deep digit dimensional digit dimensional , digit dimensional , other dimensional , warped energy kind of view that would imply that everything is kind of on one flat spectrum of reality and matter sort of deal ? extending to the universe and consciousness etc ? not just talking about the actual physical earth but more like some kind of perception of it ? like some deep kind of belief system behind it ? or b do they actually believe that if you were to walk long enough there would be an end to the physical earth that we live on and that the " sides " aren ' t connected ? like you could get to australia and say thats where the edge was , but then to get to nz you would have to travel across the world again to the other side ? because if it is a i could possibly excuse them and probe more about some kind of dimensional and consciousness explanation and possibly keep an open mind but if it is b iv got not a clue what they are thinking . let ' s remind us all again  i don ' t think the world is flat . at least not the one we live in on a daily reality basis ! lol !

8. i don ' t know you , so i can ' t say what you feel or don ' t feel , but i will suggest that you question again why you had those feelings . was it really because you are ashamed of being gay or was it that they were attempting to use the fact that you are gay to insult you that hurt ?

10. hey , digit year old entrepreneur here  made over digit figures this year from my business . i understand what you mean completely , i basically traded my high school life to become and entrepreneur and learn to make money online . i left high school with only digit good friend like yourself it sounds like and that  s the only person i have stayed in contact with . it  s funny even the beginning of this year i had to stop communication with him just so i could focus before my parents made me sign up for college . so i made my first 20k and they agreed to not let me go , it  s been nothing but uphill from there , making more and more money . honestly i get kinda depressed sometimes about stuff but i  m just glad i  m not being molded into just another gear for the corporate machine . i have the ability to support my self and i can be independent in life . so this was my first year technically of being an entrepreneur and self employed and it  s definitely worth it , i wouldn  t even consider myself antisocial but more goal oriented than most people . hope this helps for anyone reading luv ya lol

15. this comment has given my an absolutely sickening pit in my stomach . please please please do not do anything remotely close to trying to sway her sexuality . you seem like a fantastic parent for supporting your daughter already . she needs love , acceptance and reassurance that nothing is wrong with her  if that means siding with her over your wife then that  s what you have to do . you brought her into this world it is your life long duty to protect and cherish your children . i hope your wife can come around , perhaps take a few couples therapy sessions so you can talk through the underlying issue . i  m really sorry but you have two women that need your support on two opposing sides of a very messy coin . at the very end of the day , your wife is a grown woman and your daughter is a very vulnerable child you needs your trust and protection .

18. i didn ' t know what you wanted by sources but you seem like you use your own head and think for yourself even if you don ' t like a trump and have different opinions or ideas i respect that
