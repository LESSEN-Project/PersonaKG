2. i literally was talking about the meter but that  s fine we all read differently apparently . my point is it would make more problems than fix problems there are no problems with it if they took away the shot meter . you say it would add a skills gap but you could literally make the game skill  time played where i only see mycareer grinders getting mad , but removing a shot meter and as op said , removing fucking greens will make everyone mad and 2k isn  t that stupid

10. it doesn ' t matter if you said " yes " at the time . you were a child and children can say yes to a lot of bullshit bc they are little morons . doesn ' t make them right . society knows that nothing a child says can be valid and of any importance , hence they can ' t have jobs , buy houses , lease cars etc . she was exercising power over you and exploiting your vulnerability . that ' s statutory rape . you can get her arrested for it .

11. i used to date a guy that would do this to me all the time , as petty as it sounds i would purposely not make plans to hang out and when he  d ask to hangout i  d say that i already made plans with a guy bff . only took a little while for him to start paying attention again . also a push up bra helps

12. when they tickle me constaly or when one say something about that she would date me if it wasn ' t for my bad mood at that time i have others too .
   (ID: be4c274bc118fc65202a843b71f43c10798b6eb9)

13. i was an idiotic teenager who would chase after guys that didn  t give two shits about me . the whole time i was oblivious to my best friends massive crush on me . that boy was there for me through all of my problems and it  s safe to say that he  d give me the world if he could .

14. breaks the rule that a question can not be allowed to be answered by a yes or no . saying " have you ever " can be answered by yes or no . edit and make it say " dear askreddit , if you have ever said the sentence " it ' s time " in a serious manner , what was is for "

15. no . i said this is some usage with which i was previously unfamiliar . you had clearly mistaken mild amusement at you for some sort of overreaction . also , negative points for missing a douglas adams reference . of course you ' re a concern troll . you have nothing substantive to say about my original point , but express concern over the way i choose to express myself . you continue to say nothing about my original point , and only express your concern about the way i express myself . am i expressing concern over the way you express yourself ? of course i am . i ' m returning your touching magnanimity of taking time out of your no doubt busy day to take issue with me insulting someone who is neither admirable nor you . for some bizarre reason , you take this as being insulting . i can ' t imagine why .

16. spi  der lots of emphasis on the der . see it ' s more of a verbal joke , because of how you say it but i love it every time .
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

17. go and be supportive . say nothing that would be upsetting to them . that ' s what friends do . a funeral is not the time or place for you to express your views . it ' s not about you in the least .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

18. " yeah not to bad " such a normal thing to say and me and my friend die every time it is said
   (ID: 4dbd3fd527caa93836f895d72dfef9276ea4809f)

19. maybe a typo . meant to say ' more intelligent ' but got distracted and said ' smarter ' but forgot to erase the more . i do that all the time .
   (ID: 20b71c431f98b1f88ec1b3e7ada79d31df65a8c2)

20. exactly , you ' re not here to entertain me , but this post was meant to entertain whether or not it ' s for easy karma is a different matter . this is the first time i saw this , and judging from all the up doots , i ' d say i ' m not the only one . nothing is original because someone is always going to say it first , all that matters is how and when you do it .
