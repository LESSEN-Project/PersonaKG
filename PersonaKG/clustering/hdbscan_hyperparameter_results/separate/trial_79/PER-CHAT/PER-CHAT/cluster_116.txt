1. no problem . i think if you ' re doing a long term planning and you ' re not good with investments and finance , yeah they totally worth it . but in my own opinion i ' m no expert . if you just wanna deal with your saving , then nah just invest your money in a moderately safe portfolio and take it out when you ' re done .

2. i mean i am not a coach by any means and i am not necessarily advocating for him to be fired because , let ' s be honest , good coaches are extremely rare . i am just saying that he needs to seriously evaluate his play calling and his decision making because clearly what they are doing at the moment is not working . i also think that his job is made a great deal easier by having such an excellent quarterback .

3. wl is hard to get good if u play solo and get bad teammates , kd also doesn ' t tell how good someone is because u can just camp for it so i think spm is the best measurement

7. i think its fun to find a corner of the map and gun down as many as i can until the storm comes . especially when theres challenges and cool rewards involved . i never play the base game normally so i never faced any of the problems everyone else was having . i just think its fun shooting guys which im not good enough to do normally

8. yeah , that ' s a good point . i didn ' t think about the implications of that , which is why i ' m glad i have you here ! would that trait be balanced if i just removed that last sentence ?
