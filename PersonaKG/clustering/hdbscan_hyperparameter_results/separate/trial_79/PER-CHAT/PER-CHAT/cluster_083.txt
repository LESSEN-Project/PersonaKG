1. i have ruptured eardrums because they just felt like it . i was sitting on a couch minding my own business , watching soccer . that ' s the gist of it , some big bad wolves felt like doing something fucked up and did it . now i got to carry that while they tell me the virtues of being kind and forgiving .

2. nothing ' s wrong with having a preference . i prefer neat myself . that ' s fine . but did you notice how i used the term ' really matters '  like  not just ' kind of matters '  more like ' important ' . sometimes you can misread the thrust of a post if you just skim  read it .

4. what do you mean by  backward  do you mean developing country because of so than this comparison wouldn  t make sense . also if you mean hostile country then your comparison also wouldn  t work because the british and french before the outbreak of ww2 were like  hey germany let  s just settle down now okay like you can take that but no more  and how did that work out ?

5. monkey see monkey do ! how did your child start potty training ? just watch you do it ! eating cheerios ? watched you do it ! obviously cleaning is a bit more complicated . i had the child hold a wipe then i hold the child  s hand and demonstrate how it  s done . and make it seem like magic that the colors disappeared . ooooo  s and aaaah  s . naturally , they did a poor job cleaning , so i still ended up having to do it . but it gets old real quick for them and stop .

6. i did this an awful lot in high school , and in my experience it ' s like applying for jobs . after the first couple of dozen you just come to expect it , and the rejection isn ' t so crushing .

7. i was just talking to my therapist about this . when you have the ability to do this and still get a ' s , it makes it hard to even be proud of the work you did . because it was so " easy " , and you receive high marks , it feels like false praise . it ' s a totally weird feeling . best of luck to you .

8. i always thought it would be crazy if we are just like aliens taking a hit of some crazy drug and when we die we wake up next another alien and we ' re like " shit did you see that "
