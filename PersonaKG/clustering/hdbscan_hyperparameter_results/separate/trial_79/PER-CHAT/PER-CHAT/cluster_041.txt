   (ID: a69486a9dd78d1ba9533599ba57eac9079ca3c8d)

7. if the intent behind the action is to annoy another player and deny him from having a fun time . yes . yes i do think that should be bannable . and it appears that the devs agree .
   (ID: f00497cab5e262ea00a022394dce818ebb6c623b)

10. it is pretty funny when i think about it now , but it was pretty hurtful at the time .
   (ID: 78a7be65b9d2e7cebf18280c07d4f44e6f2b3417)

11. i think maybe he ' s referring to the fact that in the rpg rules , sponsored magic is something you choose whether or not to use , and you take debt every time you do . in the novels , pretty much all of harry ' s spells were enhanced with hellfire involuntarily the whole time lash was in his head .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

14. i didn ' t get the hype as well . i simply think because we both expected to be hyped , we expected something extraordinary . whereas if we had no expectations going into the episode for the first time , it might have been profound .   x200b  i hope this made sense
   (ID: a77eb45bf2cf0979852baa624e4a728cd8c1b85b)

15. i think the story of spontaneoush is amazing . watching everything unfold over time because of one mistake is unbelievable .

   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

18. i wouldn ' t worry . even if something came back on you , it would come down to the prosecutor . does he think he could prosecute you in a charge , and would it be worth it ? it would be pretty easy to convince him that a jury would let you off all day long . guilt or innocence means very little at times . you wouldn ' t be worth their time . no offense .

20. hero labs has all of the encounters pre built for 25ish dollars i think . it really save a lot of time in prep . roll20 has all the maps , lightning , characters ect . i didn ' t use the product , but if i were to do it again i would use this .
