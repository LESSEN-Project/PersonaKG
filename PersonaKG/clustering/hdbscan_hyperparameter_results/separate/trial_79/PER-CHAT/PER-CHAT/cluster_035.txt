1. i ' m not well  versed in trek , as i was always more of a wars fan . but spock was my main interest whenever i heard or read about the franchise . it ' s my understanding that he ' s only half  vulcan , but that he still has the option to flip his emotions like a switch , right ? it would seem feelings are internal and emotions are a physical counterpart to that , so either they have feelings all the time , or they can activate both whenever they wish . i think the whole concept is interesting . everyone should opt to be more like spock , because emotions are important for healthy living , but sometimes get in the way when making important decisions .

2. i can understand grabbing raiga , it saved time to create the seven ninja swordsmen of the mist for the 3rd generation i think . even though hes like a clone of zabuza . answer to your question to my knowledge no . raiga is the only originally anime  exclusive character to be integrated into the naruto manga , along with his weapon , kiba .

4. hmm . think about the partial shutdown trump proudly owned . he called the federal workers affected non  essential . this included national security programs like boarder patrol . how can the boarder be both a national emergency and non  essential at the same time ?

8. my first kiss was with a goth girl as gorgeous as you . i messed it up because at the time i had low self esteem and couldnt think she was in to me even though she was clearly into me hanging on me . also , couldnt drive and she lived far away . what i would give to have an alt  goth girl . it ' s like finding a unicorn and a leprechaun at the same time .
