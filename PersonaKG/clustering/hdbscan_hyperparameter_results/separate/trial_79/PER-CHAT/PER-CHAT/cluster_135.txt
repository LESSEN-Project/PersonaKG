10. god , a joke is a fucking joke . more recently i got my comment deleted because of downvotes asking what item should never be a rental . i said tampons . once again i  m a sexist monster apparently . i  m honestly a hardcore feminist is the irony . i just happen to see tampons on par with toilet paper . both are used for regular bodily functions and excuse me if i don  t find either even remotely beautiful . just because one sex has it , and i do sympathize with how much it sucks , i can  t see it as anything more than a shitty bodily malfunction .

20. why don ' t we just dump amphetamines in the water supply ? isn ' t this pretty clearly a slippery  slope fallacy ? is there a real counter  argument to the ' better living through chemistry ' idea when we ' re talking about decisions individuals and their doctors make ?
