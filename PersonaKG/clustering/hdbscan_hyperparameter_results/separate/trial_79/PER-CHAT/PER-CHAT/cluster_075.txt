2. also , how are you going to know if you like a game before buying it ? reviews , user reviews , forums , and lets play videos .  also , i shouldn ' t have to thoroughly research everything i buy . you could just spend watching two minutes of someone trying to play air control to realise it ' s shit .

12. dude i am super glad to hear your little dude is ok . i bet he ' s happy and healthy . sorry if this question bothered you , it just kinda hit me all the sudden that like in those movies where it ' s pulled off well , it would be devastating to a parent . then again i only have dogs , but i know i wouldn ' t even be able to stand seeing that in a movie
   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

13. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

14. not everyone is created equally , that includes the mind . it  s just very sad , above everything else . you never really know what it  s like to have another person  s experience of life .

16. but wouldn ' t the fbi sending you a letter telling you to knock it off technically make that whole enterprise illegal ? i ' m not an expert here , of course . i just like doing everything legit y ' know ? to me , that would still be illegal .
   (ID: f3c4ada6e1f0e3aecc57046ac6c587792642566d)

17. sorry but i know nothing about modding . do rtdl emulations exist already ? and if so are they laggy like you said ? or is it just laggy when trying to mod ? anyway , keep up the cool work !
   (ID: 1cd062f77c729b2cea6d91996a2f94b1f5226415)

18. yeah i know , i dated a girl just like him . talk to him though okay ? your love for him is too pure and he should see that instead of accusing
   (ID: f34889ee6ccad6be11e8f70e7ba5522379003431)

19. jfk , i would really like to know everything . there ' s a lot of conspiracy theories , i just wish to know the truth .
   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

20. that feeling where everything is fine , but it doesn ' t feel fine . like you know that everything is okay , nothing bad  stressful is going on but you just feel like something is wrong , but " uneasy " isn ' t quite right to describe it .
