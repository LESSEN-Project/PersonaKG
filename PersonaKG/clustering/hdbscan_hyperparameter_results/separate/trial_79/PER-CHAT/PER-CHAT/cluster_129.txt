1. balancedsuperpowers i like it more than godteirsuperpowers or shittysuperpowers because it provides a bit more of a dilemma i would like to go through there and kinda debate with my friends if you would want that superpower downside combo

5. what is with all the boob questions tonight , if a woman liked you enough to be having sex with you then i couldn ' t care what she looks like . she must be pretty awesome to want to be anywhere near me

6. you mean you want to use a simple splitter cable , like the type you ' d use to plug two sets of headphones into a single headphone jack ? i personally wouldn ' t do that . i ' d get a proper mixer although for what you paid for the scarlett and the cost of a cheap mixer , you ' re probably into the cost of a better interface that has multiple inputs and would allow you to use it as the mixer kind of like what i do .

8. is that your only response ? what if she does want to be secretly fucked like a cheap whore , with a dick hitting her throat ? who are we to judge ? shes only human . she can be both an intellectual and a sex object , i suggest you stop holding women back from their incredible potential .

9. one question  where was i cocky ? and not everybody is oh so nice like you . how much you want to help some , they will ignore you and go on their own to die 1v3 . yes i wish everybody was like you , but unfortunately that ' s not the case .

15. okay great , but you ' re missing the whole point . obviously i dont want that either , but in the scenario where we had to give up pokemon which it seems like we are living in , which ones could you part with ? i doubt that you personally love every single pokemon equally .
   (ID: ae9e10cc82b9b20c52f819c70c83f657724f9f44)

16. not trying to console or anything . but when you started your sentence with , " i have a theory " , i was like okay , " this is the type of girl i want to talk to " your personal description of your physical appearance pretty much flew out the window .
