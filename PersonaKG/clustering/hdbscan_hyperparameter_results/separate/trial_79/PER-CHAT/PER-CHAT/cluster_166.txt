1. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

2. i think that there is a trade off being a public persona and private persona off of camera . one ' s disguise has to be really good or the pressure to be constantly ' on ' can get to even the most seasoned celebrities . i think it would suck to be constantly hounded by people  but if done right then people would think you were cool no matter what for no reason . really it ' s a double  edged sword with trust and complicated social dynamics based  out of trust and exposure .

4. the button may be sticking it could be something underneath that ' s causing it . if you think it could be this , check out some youtube videos on how to take it a part . i had a trigger that kept sticking and once i took it a part and cleaned it , it was as good as new .

   (ID: 9f681f3dedb4dcecbe41b42dada5f72caae05ebe)

6. thank you . i really appreciate it . at times i really think i ' m alone feeling this way . the books though , that ' s a really good idea .

7. talk to your uncle first , and then all of you can talk to your mom and convince her this is a good idea . i think she would take it more seriously if everyone talked together . good luck !

8. going inside a home will be fine , i can  t picture japanese people saying no to that . however the sock idea mentioned on another comment is really good and would show your hosts a lot of respect . as of the tatamis . i  m sorry but i think it  s a no go , the crutches would surely pierce holes in them
   (ID: 272bbd1e0746915faf3405ae9c33485b5967ca9f)

9. i do , if i think it is a good question others should see .

10. . i mean , i ' m a decent artist i think but that ' s really good for using a phone , especially right off the bat .
   (ID: 215e84ecea95592e4d8f3f8e0619a61b503078c3)

11. um . uh . hm . i ' m sure something good happened that decade , but i can ' t think of anything .
   (ID: 643bdac00e6edb1bd088b5f35543044d24861e44)

12. i was told that i had a good imagination , but i think it was more of a  what do we tell him ? we can  t lie and says he  s smart or good looking or well adjusted . good imagination ? i mean , he doesn  t seem to realize he  s a socially awkward idiot with a face even a mother can  t love , so it  s kinda true , right ?
   (ID: e0f54d4b6c1ffd9d9c77682093d534d6de05cc9a)

13. very good point , didn ' t think about that aspect . but the fact that op started with " being in la " makes me think it ' s for social media purposes .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

14. so good you ' ll suck dick for it .   x200b  good rule of thumb when you think about trying something new , think about if people have sucked dick for it when they ran out . if the answer is yes then it ' s probably not a good idea .   x200b

15. i think goner is really good but isle of flightless birds is a close second , followed by truce , but i haven  t heard the last one in a while so i can  t really judge that one
   (ID: 6c6e37d9db3c4660e56c50b99635b54540029327)

16. i felt the same way in the past . but maybe the fact there is no objective point is a good think ! you can choose to do something or absolutely nothing .
   (ID: cae6d1fb1a818280e66de4a71148560d2d217d70)

17. well thats good to hear , i think i have made up my mind to try it .
   (ID: a628583ff555e7d9de55ab5077667a07a90a201e)

   (ID: 097e67363b3da34792dd06d065d142a084c40859)

19. how exactly would you go about assigning abilities to a card so that it both a demonstrated romantic passion exclusively and b was good enough that people would play it ? i can ' t think of a good way to represent that kind of emotion while retaining playability .

20. you look great . tbh , either way looks good , neither of the lengths are bad . i think the shorter looks better in these pics because it ' s easier to style .
