3. dude yta she ' s digging for coupons it would be different if she was getting tash food or like clothes . it ' s fucking paper coupons . you guys are having issues affording food so you gotta do what you gotta do . sell clothes , some people sell sex , some parents forgo food to feed their kids , some people commit crimes . and you have the audacity to be mad at your wife for digging for coupons . like are you shitposting ? if it feeds your family and it doesn ' t cause any harm it ' s doesn ' t matter . put your " pride " aside . and if it really bothers you sell your clothes get an extra job start giving up food you know ? things that all suck more than digging through trash .

5. you are holding on to the actions themselves instead of the intentions behind them ! like i literally said  if the intent of teabagging was not to piss someone off noone would give a shit ! you can buy a knife and noone will care , but if you use that knife to stab someone people will ! i know this is a really stupid comparision but i hope that that gets into your head ! the issue is not the action , but the intent behind it !

6. shit that doesn ' t apply to me . like i know that there are other people in the world that the question applies to , but why the fuck are you asking a question to tow truckers only !

7. and the only reason we do is because of our absentee mods . you know that the fact that i can post here makes people froth at the mouth and i would be banned almost immediately like i am from most other canadian subs .
