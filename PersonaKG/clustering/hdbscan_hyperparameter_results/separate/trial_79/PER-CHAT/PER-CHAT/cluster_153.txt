1. no , but next time check if you power off your phone . obviously you won ' t hear the alarm if you power off it but check before you go to sleep , i recommend if you send multiple alarms every 5mins just in case something like this happens again

7. it ' s not about time . you just have to immerse yourself by moving to a place where the language is spoken and it will flow like a period .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

9. pretentious ? no , more like it ' s just a waste of time to explain the situation , and it wouldn ' t benefit in knowing .
   (ID: c3299baadf649c84fcd78990aa1e1edfccbe92ce)

10. thanks for explaining . i can understand employees wanting to get paid for the work they ' re doing , but that seems like a really harsh punishment for just a minute or two of time .

11. with your husband ' s permission , you could start a blog and write about your experiences or just post here every monday and tell us about it . you could spend time researching ideas for next weekend . maybe learn to deep throat or other creative skills he might appreciate . shop for some sex toys . i like the blog idea , though .

12. haha i can ' t take credit for this theory , somebody explained it to me a long time ago with a lot more detail and they somehow tied it all in with the prince that was promised , dany possibly being the reincarnation of azor ahaii , jon becoming the night ' s king and somehow bringing peace to all of this . they also said some shit about white walkers not actually being evil just completely misunderstood , and there ' s a legend that the wall is just the icy remains of a massive ice dragon much larger than balerion the black . by the time they were done explaining i was just like woah keanu reeves voice

13. there  s a sub called  entitled parents  that  s full of things like this . it is difficult to have a child with special needs . you deserve to have a nice time , just like everyone else . but , you can  t ruin everyone else  s time in the process . if your child is screaming and yelling , you have to leave . you  re not being discriminated against , no one is picking on you , you are disturbing a place with a set of rules and you have to follow those rules .
