2. maybe some entry level buyer ' s guides ? i ' m not super reddit savvy , and i ' m at work right now shhh , but i would be willing to write up some things about straps  well known entry brands and watches when i have some free time this week if that ' s something people would be interested in . i like the idea of this sub though , interested to see where it goes !

4. yeah what everybody else said pretty much . not mine i also am not deploying with that rifle so if it looks like shit because people before me abused it then that ' s why . also we were pulling on the charging handle every other minute so it would have been pointless to close the dust cover every time in the class room .

5. some people have shit to do and cant wait for an unknown amount of time to scold someone for not knowing how to park . park like you have a brain and you wont get a note .

9. yeah , i ' d watch it . with real people it maybe gets interesting . not only for the first time , i mean in general if it becomes a tv show or something like that .
   (ID: cf8f8a2557f2bf6694dda14a6d2664e1ea6e36b7)

10. but what if you do have a great time hanging around with people you like and chilling with them , but when that  s done it is a blank space and no amount of career ambition or fitness goals seem to fill that void of a genuine interaction with another human .

11. its all about about perceived status . people like believe if the pay someone for a service then it somehow places them in a position of authority over them . i work in the service industry and deal with this all the time . mostly from the housewife crowd .

12. that would be cool are there features like you can move things easier when the tome is stopped ? i had thought about time controlling too and i was at the point that you have to move people like they are dolls .
