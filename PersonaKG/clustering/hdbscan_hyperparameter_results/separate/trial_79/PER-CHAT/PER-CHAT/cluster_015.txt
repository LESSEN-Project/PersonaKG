1. maybe you should stick to just one marijuana . you don ' t want to od your first time .
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

2. that  s the thing though . we don  t have to be in the mood . we may just want to get on with whatever we are doing but the little voice inside our head is just saying the weirdest of shit that half the time we would never even dream of doing . it  s really god damn annoying . imagine having a tiny sex offender stuck in your head

3. sending a message is definitely a possibility , i just doubt it will be through time . hopefully we ' ll get some more info on this soon . i don ' t want to discuss fan theories  i just wanted to talk about time travel in general .

4. well , i too do not want any spoiler . but that ' s just life in the internet man . there will be spoilers . just finding a way to combat this rather than staying inside a cave until your screening time .

5. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .

6. she gave both of them the exact same treatment and even tried to get him to hang out at a different time . how is that playing favourites ? he doesn  t get to kick someone out of the friend group just because he  s not comfy around them anymore . everyone else is still friends with her . it doesn  t matter that he was around first , she  s here now and has just as much right to have friends as he does . it sucks that he missed out on game night because he didn  t want to see her , but that  s his problem , not op  s .

7. ya i want to have sex . not hurt anyone just use their mortal vessal to accept my genetic material and have hehim make a decent chunk of change for a few moments of his  her time . and that way theyd be regularly tested and deemed fit for service . untill they have to " get service " so to speak , then they take some time off till they ' re ready again if they so chose .

   (ID: bb70c8a6d45cb154f3b33ce5b3fb81e5c1439433)

9. actually if they want a grandchild they can just adopt and make the child call them grandpa and grandma , i can come up with that the next time i have this conversation
   (ID: a7d896fb59c4f2b7ec3c459495a1127d1cfa0bc6)

10. just keep in mind that ghosts are totally weak and our spirits can totally overwhelm them . my approach to ghosts now is i ' m sad that they failed to reincarnate , so i want to help them move on that ' s kinda what i was told all the time too while growing up . sometimes i wish one of them would just come talk to me without appearing scary .

11. i just want to go back in time and stop everything from fucking up so badly or maybe just stay there when everything was fine and i was happy
   (ID: 2c1d97aa622f6ad7ec3a9aad9285dd4ec1e1f28d)

12. just like any other job interview , the right answer to ' why do you want to work in this new position ' is always what does this particular position offer you ? what do you have to gain from it ? what can you do to help the company when working at this new position ? the only time that you talk about your boss and your challenges with him is if your interviewers bring the topic up since this is an internal interview and the reports you have on file may be up fair game for discussion . even then , you still have to be professional about it and don ' t just spend time trashing the guy .

13. because they are angry and frustrated that things aren ' t going the way the want them to go with op . they express their frustration by slamming doors since , a constructive dialog hasn ' t happened for a long time . there have been only shouting , blaming and anger . op you should just bake some cookies and invited your roommate for some tee and talk about bettering your living situation . when you both work hard on yourself you can improve the life of yours and those around you . or just put a bucket of wood glue on top his door , heat up his door handle while he sleeps or just lock his door from outside , when he slams it again , until he has starved so much he will be sorry for his behavior and won ' t do it again .

14. i was just answering op  s question . sorry if my response offended you . if you don  t want to have in depth discussions about the show and waste your time , why even browse this subreddit ? that  s kind of the point . i love the show how it is i was just giving my opinion of what i would do if i could change it . no need to get upset .

15. it happens to me all the time i ' ll have something i want to write down or search and it just leaves me it ' s very frustrating .
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

16. depends on the company . if it ' s something you had to go to school many years for , gloat about your accomplishments . if it ' s a less serious job , tell them something unique about yourself . as in , they could hire anyone to do your job , what makes you stand out ? how about that time you won a hot  dog eating contest ? be their friend , someone they ' d want to hang out with while working . don ' t just be a co  worker .
