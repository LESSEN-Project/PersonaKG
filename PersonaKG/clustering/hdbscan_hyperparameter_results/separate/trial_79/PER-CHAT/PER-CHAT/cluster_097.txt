12. in some mainland european countries it is legal and its a very protected and regulated buisness . for example certain sexual acts have a fixed rate of charge . so i would see it as a mostly good thing but however yes it could encourage more trafficing you know bringing a complete stranger to your house with the sole intention of sex in exchange for money could definatly lead to some issues .

16. hmm those are really good ideas , thanks also , i have one last question . do you know any writing apps for mobile that i can use to write on ? my laptop broke and i won ' t be able to use it for a month till it gets fixed . i mean , i could use a notebook , but i ' m more comfortable with using an electronic device rather than my hands

17. our desire for things in this world cannot exceed our desire for god . it is a christian belief that who we are and the good we do stay with us in to the next life . you are still you and thus the good things that you liked in life are still part of you . if the creating of beauty through music , art , etc . is a good thing it will exist still in heaven . how we will enjoy it then , i do not know . the book of job is problematic on many levels . first of all it is a marriage of a folktale the prose beginning and ending with the work of a first rate hebrew poet who inspired by the folktale creates the bulk of the middle . the essence of the folktale is that god tests our faith . the essence of the poetry that suffering that we endure has a purpose even if we cannot understand or know what that purpose is . very small children may believe the rules and restrictions placed up them by their parents cause unnecessary pain and suffering , but parents often know it is for their good .

19. my art . i know that i am a good artist but i cannot physically boast about my art . i feel awkward doing it and it feels even worse when my parents used to boast for me . they would always add in " you can do better than    "

20. interesting . i didn ' t know there was a remake of that show  i watched the original when i was a kid . i ' ll have to check it out  have been looking for a new series to watch . limitless is pretty good , but it ' s only one season .
