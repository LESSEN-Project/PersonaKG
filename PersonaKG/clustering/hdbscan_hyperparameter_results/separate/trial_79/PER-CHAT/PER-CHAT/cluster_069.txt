1. " fuck off " thank you for your input . when you ' re on the clock you ' re expected to at least meet corporate and customer expectations . if you can do neither then any job that relates to working with people is not for you . when you ' re off the clock and on your time you can do whatever pleases you .

2. hey , i ' d be more than happy to let you empower yourself unclogging my toilet any time . its not one of the jobs i enjoy doing . one of those things i ' d gladly let someone else do , i mean i love my family , but nasty . youtube saves people thousands on needless repair calls .

7. i get so damn annoyed when people criticize me for looking up everything . " you are taking all of the mystery and wonder out of life " gods dammit , no ! if you are wondering about mysteries that humanity has already solved , you ' re doing it wrong . when you look up information and can ' t an answer to your question , that is what you should spend your time wondering about .
