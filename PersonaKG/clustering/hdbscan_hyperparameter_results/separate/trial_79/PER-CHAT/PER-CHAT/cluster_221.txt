   (ID: d4de1efcbd1fc19f38c5d3785c765b581a2415fd)

2. true . one of the consequences of success in just getting more people to watch something . what ' s that saying go  if you have digit people in a room you will have digit opinions ?

4. walk for digit hrs straight . there are a couple of hppenings where people do it , but i am not fit enough for now . used to be able to do eight hours , so still a lot of work to do . also , be active by more than just paying money in a humanitarian organization .

5. these people should be taking some goddamn responsibility instead of trying to get outraged at the broadcaster for their lazy parenting . this right here is probably the one quote to rule them all . parents seem to shirk their responsibilities endlessly nowadays . it is not the job of the mass media or school teachers to bring up children . if a person is so uncultured that they have no damn idea what watership down contains , perhaps they should get morally outraged at the fact that they are clearly a fucking moron first . i do hope that channel digit just responds with " lol , no " and is done with it .

6. how do i add friends on ? there  s no way to add from multi ? or do i just have to find people on here or twitter etc ? id  khaleesi digit

7. people complain about how capcom makes this game too casual friendly and that it ' s just too easy . here they are making it so you can dp after the opponents cock is down your throat and it doesn ' t even trade but digit  just hits them even though you were slow as balls . now that you can ' t be punished for being slow but are actually rewarded for it , making this game that much easier and now everyone is happy about it . what ' s gonna be next ? digit button supers ? an option to pause online because you have to finish painting your nails ? pathetic .

8. you ' re not wrong . the hike to get there isn ' t all that easy though takes just under digit hours and covers about 600m in altitude . it was pretty dangerous at times due to the rain , yet you see people walking up there in flipflops . are they the real  life equivalent of someone driving around in winter without snow tyres on their car and putting themselves and others in danger ?
