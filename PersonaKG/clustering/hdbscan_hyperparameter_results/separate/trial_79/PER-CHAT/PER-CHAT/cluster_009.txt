1. can use the suction cup mounting plate or maybe the clamp ? we don  t have the clamp for ours so i  m not too sure how useful that one is but i  ve found the suction cup adaptor to be more frustrating than anything . i  m pretty much just buying vac u lock toys now as it  s more stable

6. you have it now , it  s just hard to see in the moment . it  s one of those things that you don  t realize you have until you look back on all of the stuff that you  ve already been through . the fact that you  re still here and you  re talking about it proves how strong you are .

7. not that i ' ve ever heard , this is just bizarre . it could just be an excuse to leave faster , if they don ' t get along  he doesn ' t get along with your brother . sounds super weird .
