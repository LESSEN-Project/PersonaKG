1. my complaint is that for a match made activity , there ' s not a huge amount of prompting . most of it was pretty straightforward but it would have been nice for calus to kinda say things that clue everyone in to what they need to do . other than that , it ' s good fun .

2. so around the first week of 9th grade , i meet two girls . one who is basically me genderswapped and is basically my soul mate , to say . the other one is a girl who has a darker sense of humor , the only one who gets my jokes , and has humongous bonkhonagahoos . what do i do ? its the 3rd week now i am really good freinds with the latter , but can conversate better with the swap . what do i do ?

3. you can be on your way of hitting rock bottom and nobody will warn you . people will view you as human filth , but nobody will say anything . in their eyes you are past redemption . ask yourself if your life is on a good course .

6. wonder woman has been kind of an oddity in the recent dc film universe . as good as it was it was still far from perfect . the third act is one of the worst in any superhero films . aquaman made a shit ton of money , you ' re right ! but as for quality of film ? it ' s still not as good as even the lesser succesful marvel films . and still none of them have been nominated for best picture . say what you will , but the level of quality in the dc films is almost undeniable lower than the marvel films . it pains me to say that too , because when it comes to the comics i actually lean more towards dc . but they have next to no idea what they ' re doing when it comes to films these days .

7. ha ! nice work . i ' d say that they ' re necessary , not good . for me there are just more pressing issues . i appreciate the arguments for gun violence as a social epidemic , but violence is only a symptom of something deeper . primarily the unfair distribution of resources , classism , and other institutions of disenfranchisement .

8. sorry spellcheck on phone really sucks and i have had multiple people say that there is s good chance that this well happen . i could not find any articles on it so i decided to ask the good people of reddit what they new . this was a mistake . learn to answer questions not bitch about them

9. the so bad part . how can you sit through the " so bad " part and then say " it ' s good " ? i can ' t do it . i just find something better to do or watch .

14. my most recent one ? we had huge religious differences and his family would never have accepted me . it was mutual and we remain very close friends . we had a good run , lots of nice memories , and i have nothing bad to say about him .

15. i believe that hacking is fine if you are say in a 1v1 trolling someone , basically if it  s not being used to pretend that your really good or something along those lines i  m fine with it . unless i  m the one getting cheated lol .

16. why is this not cool ? i get that it  s something they do just to do it so they look good but i wouldn  t say there  s anything inherently wrong with that .

17. this is a pretty good answer . its hard to say when the changes occured . i guess it has a lot to do with intetaction of people in geographic proximity . the alps is a pretty good boundary that would have restricted cultural ideas . ill be thinkin about this for weeks grinning  face
   (ID: 37f1dd54cc7fbf9961db909e5dce33ca94dc5b82)

18. i also didn  t say that , but yes he  s not a good person . dude you have assumed so much of me without ever explicitly saying anything about those subjects lol
   (ID: c0f309bee7152ab458da8ec03fbb1e17fa2876cd)

19. the flip side of this is that if i , as a woman , compliment a man on his fragrance , he may misunderstand my intentions . i could couch the compliment in any number of ways , but it may still be interpreted as an unintended invitation to something more when what i really wanted to say is ,  dude , you smell good .  that happened recently in the building where i work . i helped a good  smelling man find where he needed to go , and it was so hard not to say something about his fragrance . it just didn  t seem appropriate .

20. out of control spending habit is not to be taken lightly , perhaps you should se a specialist  therapist who can help you come to terms with the fact that consumtion does not help you deal with rough childhood . you will face many messages from marketers convincing you to buy this and that . but only you can in the end develop the discipline to say no in order to say yes to your long term saving goals . ive seen many ppl around me spending their income over decades on shit they dont need just to wake up to mountains of debts . you are young and you realize your challange thats a good start . overconsumtion is just like any other drug , be on alert for you buying desire . good lucksun
