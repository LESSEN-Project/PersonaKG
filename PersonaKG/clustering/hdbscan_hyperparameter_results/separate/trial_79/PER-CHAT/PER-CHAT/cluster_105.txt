9. i mean , i get it . we grow up and suddenly we ' re responsible for our own survival , when we only exist because someone else wanted us to . why do i have to get a job and pay bills and all that shitty stuff , when my parents are the ones that put me here ? don ' t know that you can really win in a court of law , and maybe you should suck it up and just deal . but i get it .

11. hey so i don ' t know if everyone has moved passed the rabbit part , but i just wanted to mention that with the talk of the lunar rabbits and one of the youtube videos depicting the moon and a rabbit from the children ' s book " goodnight moon " that east asian cultures , specifically chinese and japanese have folklore about the shape of a rabbit on the moon . there are two versions of the chinese folklore , one being that the rabbit is the companion to a goddess and is pounding the elixir of life for her and the other is that the rabbit is pounding medicine for mortals . i don ' t know if this important , but it may be something .

15. surely there ' s comfort in knowing there ' s absolutely nothing you can do about the eventual heat death of the universe . it ' s out of your control so just let it be . you don ' t know that this universe doesn ' t collapse down to a single point and birth anew with another big bang . either way i ' ll be long dead so it matters not
