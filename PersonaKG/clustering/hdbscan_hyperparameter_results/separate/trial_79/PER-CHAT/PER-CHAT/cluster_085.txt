1. not really . just common sense . also i say probably because it just looks like it
   (ID: f84f00f5008425ec4928909d75ca4bb2e65f91ee)

2. i just recently saw what someone looked like after talking to them for a day or two on here , and i was disgusted to say the least .
   (ID: 8d6bc8981226c7a1c54ccf670515fbc0523257e2)

3. i would like to say loyalty but in all honesty it ' s probably just as simple as my capacity to relate to them overall . maybe you could call that open mindedness .

7. your neighbor cannot " press charges . he can sue you , though i highly doubt he will . he screwed up and he knows it . were it me ? i would have a couple of cameras with low  light capability and some motion detecting lights installed right now , today , and my dog would not be let out without a pre  release walkaround by me . i would also not leave my hound unattended . as well , just like you couldn ' t restrict the airspace over your yard ? he has no say about how many cameras you put up or where they are directed . here ' s an article about drone " no  fly " zones .

8. i can answer this despite being an english speaker . it ' s because you haven ' t been taught that cuss words in other languages are just as bad . we never snuck around our parents to say " mierda " , unless of course you ' re spanish , so yeah . it ' s just that it wasn ' t drilled into your head like it is with your own version of the word . like americans using bollocks

9. yeah just about to say it looks like the bird thing from botw

10. just use your teammates as distractions for the other teams . if they are as bad as you say they are , then let them become targets so that you can ambush them . i personally haven ' t had bad squads , but i feel like that ' s my alternative .

11. the action scenes were painfully average but it had something to say about race relations in our world today and it does it with a little , not a lot of nuance . while it wasn ' t the best picture of the year i myself am completely fine with its nominations especially considering the two biggest winners of the night were green book and bohemian rhapsody . it ' s totally ok if you didn ' t like it just acknowledge that it was trying to do more than your average blockbuster .

12. there is a kid in my school who is like this , except he singles me out for food and if i say no he tries to just take it from me .

13. well , he is your boyfriend and if you haven ' t heard from him for a few days , i ' d just say why not just do it . it ' s rude of him to be ignoring you like that . totally unfair to you . you deserve an explanation . i always thought the worst though and worried that when mine would ignore my texts or whatever , i ' d show up and find some other girl . but usually he was just hanging out or sleeping and " forgot to text back . boys just be just plain idiots sometimes . it ' s ridiculous .

14. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol

15. typical nerdy white english man they can  t grow balls and actually conversate in an argument instead just say something silly over and over again until they feel like they have  won  the argument , your winning an argument by repeatedly saying the same shit over and over again , your a women
   (ID: 7dfa169bdfe2df7e214baa35fc2f2b73cbb10c46)

16. i mean i like say you will despite the same factors at play , runaway just doesn  t do it for me . why is it so popular ?
