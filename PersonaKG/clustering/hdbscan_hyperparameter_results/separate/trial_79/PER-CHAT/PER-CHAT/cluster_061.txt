1. hmm , this is fairly strange i must say , however there is one more possibility . are you sure you haven  t already entered the dlc ? maybe you already got in . i suggest you go check the tombstone in the hunters dream that takes you to the dlc area and see if you may use it its across from the final chalice dungeon tombstone . if you dont know which one im talking about , the doll sometimes prays there as well .

2. this is the context before the quote  after a couple of times i tried greeting someone i knew but to no reply or even any looks , they tell me on messenger some days later that they thought it was rude to not greet someone they know . however in this context it ' s to some " dreamy " guy . " i saw insertname but he didn ' t see me . i feel bad because i didn ' t say hi to him but what if he saw me ? " fucking bitch .

3. and when i say plans . i mean these plans would have been made way back when they were fuck buddies . as in . " hey man i really enjoy you and the sex is great . i know we will go our separate ways . but no matter what , or no matter who we ' re with . we will always fuck . deal " then some years later . boom here she is . " hey buddy , been thinking about you and how much i enjoy you . come visit me in amsterdam " are you ok with that ?

4. you know what , i  m gonna play devils advocate here and say if you really truly genuinely mean it and are willing to face the repercussions , say  in love with  . saying  i love      is thrown around far too much and has started to lose meaning

6. what is reality ? what is real ? what can i know , and know to be real ? if the world is real what is impossible ? can the impossible be possible ? or does that make it not impossible but now possible ? so what can and can not be ? if the possible is real then what is impossible ? ooooooooor . whats another way to say geyser ?

9. i didn ' t smoke , so i didn ' t know . you could always make a fake email address , and shoot an email to ask if they disqualify applicants for medical marijuana . that way if they say yes , its not your email and you can " detox " . depending on how regularly you use it can take longer than a month though .

10. i would say make it so that the readers know why he ' s doing it . what ' s driving him ? for relatable . but personally , i would love to read about a character on their way to their first victory . so yeah i ' d say that ' s brilliant .

15. hmm and would you say that when you choose to talk it ' s because you feel you have the authority on whatever it is you ' re talking about . that ' s there ' s no debate , you are right and if you didn ' t know for sure that you were you ' d be quiet instead ? outside is alright , but i have to every morning to take care of the chickens and the horse . do you do anything specific outside , gardening , hiking ?
   (ID: c916f127f4f3e275b37bb32e4a156325cab84540)
