1. i guess the question should be are they saying " nice work " on objectively average work as a compulsion to be nice , or are they saying " nice work " to everyone any time their work is objectively above average ? that ' s the difference . i give a lot of compliments , but i never give one i don ' t sincerely mean . you ' re welcome to your opinion , but i think you ' re wrong .

3. a clear  cut answer to that would be great . i don ' t think one exists . the correct information has been out a long time .

4. really don  t think about that aspect much . you have a job to do , so that  mission focus  stays . i remember freaking out the first time mortals fell near our fob , i panicked and ran for a bunker . a few months later i wouldn  t even bother grabbing my helmet and kept walking to lunch chow .

6. i don ' t do stand up lol , but i ' d bring friends that way you have real incentive not to fuck up to avoid embarrassment . but at the same time that could make you more nervous so it ' s up to you and how confident you think you can be up there

7. i think it ' s the sort of thing that the court might order in the event that the kids weren ' t being treated well . otherwise , i think it should be left up to the mother how the money gets spent . kids cost a lot of time and money . i don ' t begrudge the ex for the child support money when the kids are being taken care of . i ' m more likely to begrudge the unfair distribution of time with the kids than the dollars spent on them . love my kids . my ex sucks but i seriously doubt she ' d short them on dinner or new shoes . she might screw the pizza delivery driver , but the kids would be fed well .

8. if transmitting the data in real time is too expensive , why not have a redundant system that jettisons a black box when impact is imminent . i don  t think it would that difficult to implement in this day and age . might be easier to find than when it  s possibly under two miles of water .

9. i don  t think she saw it the same . we would feed safe leftover food to our dogs all the time , it wasn  t an insult to the food . it  s because we view our dogs as family , they could eat the same food as us again , as long as it is safe for dogs . lots of food isn  t .
