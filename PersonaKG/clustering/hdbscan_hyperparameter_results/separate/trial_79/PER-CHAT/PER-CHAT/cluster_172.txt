1. banning liberals to reproduce , or atheists , or star trek fans ? i think op wouldn ' t agree with banning people from reproduction based on their beliefse . g . liberals , atheists . rather , stuff like passing on genetic defects or illnesses , not being able to provide for the kid , or having a violent criminal history all affect how the kid is raised . the things she  he mentioned in the post have to do with safety and health for the child being prioritized .   x200b

2. i agree to an extent , but there are a lot of people who think like this
   (ID: 2de25fc78894b500638825a688a85084af2b72d1)

3. i ' d like to think that . and i do tell myself ' well , at least you ' re not boring ' , but sometimes it ' s hard to deny that people find you weird , and not in an endearing way . such as when they wait until you ' re out of hearing range and tell someone else , who then tells you later on .

4. i agree that the same argument can be used , and i think it should be  i think people should work together because they choose to , not because the government makes them . i like the idea of a universal health care system , but i see no reason for it to be either mandatory or government  regulated  i like to imagine that people prefer to work together by choice . i realize that history does not always bear that idea out , but i think true change should happen in the hearts and minds of the people , not through force of law .

6. i agree . do you think it ' s white people ' s fault that the number of black people in these fields is so small , like a lot of people think ?

7. true . i think you were right on both counts in the original question . people get trapped feeling like it ' s what they deserve and there is no better alternative

8. i do find it girly  " gay " to not be weirded out by a stranger covering you in lotion and rubbing up on you . how is that exclusive to those who are girly or gay ? that ' s fucking ridiculous . what do you think women and gay people are like ?

9. you ' re exactly the reason trump got in . people like you will never learn . think you ' re always in the right . i think both sides are to blame . accountability  look it up

12. you think the only people who are people , are the people who look and think like you . but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger , you ' ll learn things you never knew , you never knew .

13. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .

16. the staring . of all the things i found difficult over there , staring was one of the worst . you might think that being taught not to stare at funny  looking people is common for children around the world . nope . and what do you do when it ' s a parent and their child , staring and pointing together , like they ' re watching an orangutan at a zoo ?
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

17. yeah the whole politically correct culture is pissing me off . and i think it ' s really a small group of people claiming to be offended . seems like outrage is like a currency these days .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

18. no . okay , think about it like this  people are made up of atoms , and when you die your atoms go off and become other things . this means that every girl would most likely be made up of atoms that were once in a dude , so if you bang her you are technically banging a dude , and that ' s fucking gay .

19. i think that is like communism . it sounds great but after a few years of watching the people you love die around you it ' s not so nice .
   (ID: ee74129b7f6740c8074711c31d72f30618d1ecf8)

20. i wish my answer was no but probably yes . there ' s still a large population of people in the u . s . that still believes places like fox news and breitbart are legitimate news sources and think trump is doing a great job .
