   (ID: f35c2dc27b340e4014924ed397162e223f1dcc93)

2. most of the crazy ones are pretty easy to spot . just watch what they say and how they treat people .

3. sorry , i am gonna fly over to my grandparents across the globe just to say  hi !  i agree , face to face interaction is great , but some people cannot do that type of stuff which is totally okay .

4. people saying i love you sincerely . i can ' t even say it to my parents because i find it so cringey . not even during movies that are super romantic and does it in a smart way . just no .

5. id use google translate to speak mandarin so that a larger amount of people could hear me first and say " hey insert random name here stop doing that " and walk away with a smug look of success knowing that someone with that name just got pranked .

6. people who get really serious and say some hurtful shit and then switch and say  i  m just messing with ya lol  this is a trait more commonly found in males than it is with females , and usually stems from lack of peer involvement than it does with family life , although family life could be accounted for in this scenario .

7. just because i have to say it  if they are repairing it themselves , it shouldn ' t matter how close or far a service center is . this whole john deere thing is such bullshit for real though and right to repair laws would be such a huge win for people of the world , not just farmers with tractors .

8. god just listen to you people . now you ' re saying even your speech laws are better . right ! so let ' s prosecute anyone who insults a head of state or says mean things on the internet . bunch of pussies . and i have my right to say that

9. just watch it with the mindset that nothing is ever truely as bad as people say .
   (ID: b13c661d25562198666588e5e66ab35a26f1c5f2)

10. who the fuck would even do this . i am so disappointed in the lack of ingenuity in this forum group thing . this is not funny . it ' s really not and if you say " oh but it ' s just a joke " you are an awful person excuse my language . these are innocent creatures and do not deserve to be lied to and be forced to eat their own kind , shame on the people who took this pic , shame on the people who upvoted and shame on you

11. no , reddit can be productive . people using it productively is a rarity . just look at the subscriber numbers for funny or aww compared to those of let ' s say , i dunno , studytips .
   (ID: 4721143ecfe877298792b1d44e635051f5f2c84e)

12. however a lot of the champions people use to climb are in some fashion ban worthy . say i had someone wanting to play yi jungle but he ' s next to last to get him . why risk him being picked by the enemy team increasing their chances of winning ? it ' s mostly situational but far more people ban things out of worry than trolling . my advice is own next to all champs to set up trading teammates picking before you and communicate early and often to them about your needs . trust me if someone is gonna troll you after that , chances are they ' d find another reason  situation to troll you or your team anyway . either way you just gotta get over it or dodge .

13. probably , sometimes people hate for absolutely no reason . in all honesty , those people just put people down for fun or they just had a bad day but doesn  t matter what they say cause no matter how many people hate me , i  m still gonna be positive and happy so those can kiss my irish ass and go hate on someone else .

14. people might say , he couldve saved that money . but who actually does that ? save for 17years ? only rich people . for average people , its almost impossible to save for years and not touch that money over those years . just take that guy above as a person who smoke cigarettes for years . at least his chance with his money is to become a millionaire and not cancer .

15. each one is different , how can you compare them ? if i had to choose one in the past to compare it with i would say reagan ' s administration . but that ' s just in how he came out of nowhere as an outsider and surprised the hell out of a lot of people . i admire his courage to take shit from all sides and keep trying for us , the american people , but that ' s just my opinion .
