4. that our universe is limitless . it never ends . we ' re floating in a small piece of rock floating in a never ending space where time means little . but one day , all of this will be lost . our species will die off , and the universe won ' t care because we are nothing but a small glitch in a vast world full of cosmic wonders that makes our small piece land we call earth seem small . the universe will die off someday , and it ' ll come when we least expect it . maybe tomorrow , maybe next week , or maybe a few years from now , who knows . the universe and everything you know will disappear and you can ' t do anything to stop it .

9. from what i understood is that you ' re wife is basically boycotting you in bed for weeks at a time . you should know that according to the hadith , the angels curse her until dawn for that and she is constantly sinning . your ' fantasy ' about getting a second wife is not haram . allah has made it halal for a reason , and if you can fulfill the requirements , go for it ! otherwise , this can be reasonable grounds for divorce . allahu ' alam .

13. nick needs closure and i can ' t give it to him ! that makes you a terrible person . i understand . i ' m not sure your mother would , though . i ' m sure she loves nick , or would if she knew him . i suggest you go to where you know the next tape ought to be , and see if it is there . the tapes are generated at the beginning of the game , so they can be picked up at any time .
