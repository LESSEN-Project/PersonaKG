1. it will be ok and just imagine the relief when it ' s all over and in the past ! your doctor will not scold you for holding off on appointments , she will be happy you came in ! even if you have the worst case scenario , you will be in the right place , plus most cervical cancers are treatable when caught in time .

2. i hear you everyone  s different , to an extent , but yh probably was psychosis but you was young at the time so it was probably just that

3. just time my friend . time heals all wounds .
   (ID: faebbe18abd4d1c69e3bb9106178f797255444c5)

4. well no . not all the time . in fact that ' s important that it isn ' t all the time . it makes those brain  gasms so much more special . it ' s important to never take your brain  cum for granted . this was supposed to be inspirational but it just got weird .

5. same here . if i could just take the courses i need for my major and minor , everything would be fine . unfortunately , i have to take a bunch of courses that aren ' t worth my time and money .
   (ID: 8dc7a300c762f2c528a6f2993d152d50f9fcc702)

6. this happened to me the first time i took the test . the only thing that helped me was to find something else to occupy your mind . whether it ' s a tv show you binge i rewatched the office , a new workout i started walking  stretching  and spinning more , or something else , just find something where you can kind of let your brain turn off for a bit . do that at least once a day . once i started that , i mostly stopped perseverating on something i couldn ' t change .

7. also , just a suggestion , tell your nurse  doc before the baby is born but while you are in the hospital getting ready to deliver that this might become an issue so they are prepared to deny them any possibility that it might sneak by should they find out somehow when and where you are delivering . another suggestion might be to hire a doula . they are there to comfort you and relieve stress and to advocate for your wishes when it comes to delivery and your time in the hospital . just a for instance , if you should be sleeping and your hubs isn ' t there and the paperwork comes by to put the baby ' s name and other info on the birth cert and your nparents somehow end up being there having a doula and informing your nurses and docs that they may be there and trying to " help " you with the paperwork so you can rest , they will be blocked in a variety of different ways . just a couple thoughts . ps your parents are awful . i ' m sorry that you have to stress about therm when this should be an exciting and joyful time . go nc sooner rather than later if you see fit . the less stress on you the better .

8. that isn  t just a football thing , it means greatest of all time so it can be applied to anything
   (ID: bef3bdf131cc9dbe9d33343a3b9988680236cf9d)

9. thanks . this actually makes sense to me . we actually leave ours out all the time and it just confused me why if we never wrap the chord up it gets messy
   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

10. if it was more than one , every moment with my dad when i was little . if it was just one , it would be meeting my s . o for the first time .
   (ID: 8e04d9ff8cb4775dcd9beaa83d8499ec17c7bc83)

11. i ' m not sure how much it has to do with the time and how much it has to do with who your parents are . kids around me were doing plenty , i just had an overly controlling parental situation .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

12. mist raven also works if you time it right just when the snake attacks you .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

13. thanks for the offer but after everything i just downloaded an old driver the tablet and that seemed to resolve the problem . sorry for wasting your hard earned time . have a lovely day !
   (ID: e706d8e3e66a8d84fc15d33a176d542752613604)

14. trust me , next time , just go for the kill . i learned the hard way that messing around can often get you killed . at lease , that how it is for me .
   (ID: d28197335e7305577b59f952af257f553cab06d9)

15. every time i get used it ' s just another masturbatory story to me . who ' s next ?
   (ID: 917dfa16e92ce1db67ec3f88bc07b87b70a36c95)

16. harassment is bad , but i admire your harassers commitment . he must have so much time on his hands . encryptions aren ' t impossible to crack , however it just takes so much time that it ' s more ideal to bypass them using other means .   x200b  also are you sure your friend isn ' t just harassing you for kicks ? i mean . a single conversation of you and your friend and no one else just that app seems weird .
   (ID: 4a254f5f43ff6e27b5f63d030bfcdd91b43a87c3)

17. that doesn ' t mean we should . there are a myriad of other extra things you could do to look better , why not do all of those too . it ' s not about if it looks better or not , it ' s about whether it is worth the time  effort , and if it should be socially unacceptable to decline from doing it . i just chuck the clothes i ' m gonna wear into the drier with a damp washcloth and a drier sheet during my morning shower . super low effort and my clothes smell better .

18. look kid , i have no interest in debating this with a teenager . i just now realized i was debating back and forth with a teenager after looking into your profile . i have had a lot of issues with the device which a lot of other individuals faced as well . you can enjoy your v20 for what it ' s worth , and i hope it doesn ' t happen to you . this is a known defect that happens in a matter of time . this will be the last i debate with a teenager who probably has zero realization with how any law firm or any legal area is typically disputed .

19. they are not quite playmates since they are pretty much ignoring each other . i am just happy i can have them in the same room and can spend more time with each of them . condescending karens are everywhere lol
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

20. i love all your cosplay . hoping that zelda cosplay is in the works but every time you post and your are just yourself , you have this amazing glow that is beyond attractive . it touches my soul and is just a huge turn on .
