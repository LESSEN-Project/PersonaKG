2. yta , sorry to burst your bubble , but you can ' t make someone do anything to you . if she doesn ' t want to have sex , she doesn ' t . and making her give you a bj just fucked it up even more .

4. i guess you ' re right . the only issue is that when i get along with a guy have a lot in common , instant click , share similar goals  values  etc there comes a point where he tells me just doesn ' t want a relationship . after a month or so he ' s dating someone this has happened three times now , hence why i believe i ' m the reason

5. forget about how you ' re supposed to act to be a man . just be you . for example , you ' re about to be of legal drinking age . you want a sherly temple at the bar while everyone else is doing shots and chugging beer ? fuck them . get your sherly temple and drink it with pride . trust me , it ' ll work out .

10. that just seems so goddamn weird , honestly . why does she want this mommy title so bad ? does grandma , or some other equivalent , truly not meet her criteria or something ? does your wife have any opinions on the matter ?
   (ID: 129ef8c0c15772442f28ff253ba4d16a19caef46)

11. i actually want to hear from guys who have been married . since commitment in both marriage and with owning a vehicle go hand in hand . if your car doesn ' t work anymore , do you just get rid of it and find a newer one that works ? or do you stick with it and try to repair it ?
   (ID: 2e30252ab6ce4c1807bb315c6103be324b841909)

12. so you pointing out that it ' s about race and gender implying that you want it to be true just because she is a woman and an african please provide a valid counter argument or fuck off with your faminazi sentimentality .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

13. some woman supposedly .  i  m not saying this didn  t happen but fuck me . you won  t listen to the fucking fbi but this is a credible source for you ? at what point will you realize that you just hear what you want to hear .
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

17. what you really want to do is find out what exactly is the source of your back pain . it could be a rib out of place , a rotated hip , twisted tailbone , bulging disc , etc . then you can start exercises to target those . if it ' s just generic sore muscles , then you would benefit from strength training to keep those muscles in shape .
