3. a colleague recently told me something similar in business . focus on the immediate work , not on the result of every part . focus to get the immediate task done , and the next thing will be more grand and you ' ll do it better   leading to the outcome you want .

4. we would grow indoors , and one of the main reasons i want to go is i ' m an addict and need to make a change . leaving family sucks but they act and look at me differently since they found out about the drug use . i love them but i need to get away from them as much as my dealers .

5. lantern is hard to balance . if they make the life steal too high , laners might be tempted to get it and riot doesn ' t want that . on the other hand , lantern is rather useless to upgrade to in the jungle . it costs too much for what you get . the money is , usually , best used elsewhere .

7. this hits too close to home . i hope you ' ll find your peace with it . we all deserve the best we can get . more times than not what we want is the best we can get . why life takes exactly that , is a question that will remain unanswerd .
