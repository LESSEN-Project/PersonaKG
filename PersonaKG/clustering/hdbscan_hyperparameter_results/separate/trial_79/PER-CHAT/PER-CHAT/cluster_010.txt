5. until adolescents a child would not live without interaction and warmth of others . after that they would probably just go crazy . but i think there was a study using chimps where they took away all interaction with living species from the baby chimps and even though they had all the necessities to sustain their health they simply refused to eat and died .

9. what world do you live in ? doesn ' t matter what the facts are . reality will become whatever narrative the media wants . if he is a lone wolf muslim terrorist who swore loyalty to isis before he died , that ' s what he is . period . it ' s a conspiracy theory to think differently than what the media tells you the facts are .

10. it may be a stretch but i think the only eating bread is a nod to him being an entity and not human . in the book of mathew jesus says , " man can not live off bread alone " the kid as far as i have seen , does just that .

12. meh . you ' re taking a moral stance . i ' m not making a moral argument so i can dig what you ' re saying . i ' m not arguing the moral aspects of any of those issues and i hope you ' re not either . you can ' t morally deny the process of evolution though you can be against the use of vaccines in which case go live on a goddamn island you stain . as for hitting kids  no . always . many of us we ' re hit as children and tend to think ,  well i ' m not that fucked up so it can ' t be that bad so we ignore the science . that ' s a horrible approach . but if i ' m wrong and you ' re arguing the science because it ' s incompatible with your magic book , society doesn ' t need you .
