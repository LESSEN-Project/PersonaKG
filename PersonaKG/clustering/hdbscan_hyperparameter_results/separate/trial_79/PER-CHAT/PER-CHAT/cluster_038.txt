2. take this time to learn about you . what are your hobbies and interests ? trying learning something , anything and become knowledgeable in it . that will give you some topics of conversation and help you find friends maybe girls too as you enjoy those hobbies . those guys you ' re jealous of . they probably think they are losers too  they just hide it better . don ' t be so hard on yourself !

3. yepp , i thought i just didn  t have the time or motivation to finish them but after the 5th drama i started seeing a trend . i think it also has to do with the fact that there wouldn  t be any more twists or plot development because the drama is essentially wrapping up . so subconsciously i don  t think i  m missing out on anything .

4. thank you for your words and your reply . it means a lot . i don ' t have any pain , but i think as of recently two weeks or so i probably lost some sensitivity . my ring finger lays against my middle finger just a tiny bit . at the same time , i also haven ' t been using my right hand  wrist to it ' s full ability so perhaps i haven ' t aggravated it as much as possible with what it ' s physically capable of . being scared isn ' t helping it though and i think is what caused the finger  touching . idk . it ' s kind of " tucked in there " , both my doctor and my surgeon told me i lucked out with it . i won ' t get it out myself and i ' ll follow up with my surgeon . i had a ct scan yesterday , i think i will call right now and inform them that whatever they see in the images is bothering me more and more and i don ' t think i can wait until march . sldkjsldkcx
