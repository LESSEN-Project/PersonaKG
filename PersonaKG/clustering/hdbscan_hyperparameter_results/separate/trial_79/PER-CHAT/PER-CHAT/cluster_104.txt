14. bullshit . no wonder men out there chicken out when they have to approach any real life woman out there . do you see why that happens ? they grow up watching these anime where girls are shown as more manly  boys blush to talk to girls . suddenly these anime  nerds develop affinity for the women who kicks them into the nuts . and these anime girls are shown as physically hit the protagonist . everyone brush it off saying " it is cute " . i do watch anime but i never liked these themes . consider dragonball . dude is one of the strongest warrior in the universe but he is terrified of his wife . and she hits him when he does any mistake . people watching these things laugh at it  say it is cute . man if physical violence doesn ' t look cute when a man does on a woman then you can not have double standards when a woman does it on a man . and this is how you program those boys to chicken out in approaching any real woman . sorry to say mate . but this opinion is you is actually the product of the buffer you ' re making in your own brain to avoid meeting real life girls . real life girls are way better than your waifus .

15. i suggest it yes . i use malwarebytes premium too along with avast av free . despite what some people say , they both detect different things the other does not .

16. i ' m not sure that abortion is the reason . most of our parents were in the " silent generation "  that group of people who grew up in the great depression but were too young for wwii . the greatest generation crammed all their child rearing into the post war period and the result was the baby boom . the baby boomers are the moms and dads of gen y . i agree we are the best generation , though . i ' m proud to say that while the baby boomers partied in the mud at the original woodstock our generation rioted at the one they tried to put on for us .

   (ID: 4d1c53b18fd4290c31e857fc9f9572542fef4fd5)

19. binge eating and only moving if you really have to . your body will go to shit . edit  joke but not a joke since i saw a lot of people say positive things .
   (ID: 7632dd7ebcb664bfada5fff420a436f42e3721d5)

20. all i  m trying to say is , if their goal is to include everyone , why exclude white people ? yes we have done horrible things in the past , but we changed
