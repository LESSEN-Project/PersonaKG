3. i think it was more that his character evolved the most . he started out as a date rapist and eventually ended up a monogamist who openly loves blair . he still makes mistakes of course , but he is actually remorseful and doesn ' t continue to repeat bad habits like all the other characters . also , his character has a lot of dimension , which makes him more interesting than someone like nate .

4. i constantly try and constantly fail to explain the meaning of " arrombado " to non  brazilians . the closest meaning i can think of is " what you would call someone who drives one of those trucks with testicles hanging , changes lanes without signaling , almost hits you and acts like you are the wrong one .

5. isn ' t that a power move ? for someone to pick a much younger partner ? they can do whatever they like and have full emotional and sexual control . that ' s what i think is happening .

6. do girls think of boys the way we think of them ? like if a girl hears someone on reddit is boy checks for photo posts or tried to imagine  what they look like .

8. right on ! back in the days of dial  up , napster , and winamp , i made a playlist with iffy ' s dablink a rough demo version and lenny kravitz ' s are you gonna go my way crossfaded into each other . they ' re in the same key and almost identical root note progression . you ' d think they were always meant to be together . discoveries like that are so much fun .

9. there ' s a film i think it ' s called cannibal family or something like that . it ' s a pretty ok film for its budget . but if i ' m not mistaken someone who was involved in someway with the original . and i think they called it and " unofficial " remake . i could be totally wrong and please call me out if i am . but it might be worth a watch

   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

13. i think i found it ! something called " captain blasto . this article says that one of his lines is " honey i ' m home "  here ' s a gameplay video , though it looks ps1 instead of n64 . but this is definitely your guy , in space with a blaster with the wisecracks very much like the gex game i remembered
