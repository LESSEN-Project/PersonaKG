4. not to be rude but the  shy , introvert with a foot fetish  label isn  t that uncommon . i know a lot of wo  men like that . and the anxiety of losing them sounds more like an insecurity manifesting itself before your very eyes . honestly , i wouldn  t worry and think too hard on much . being yourself is about the best anyone can do . yes , try and actively open up more when you have a so but if they can  t handle your introverted tendencies then you probably aren  t the greatest match anyway .

7. i know what you mean , but what about our subconscious . id like to think im in control of what i actually think n feel about . which in case of a simulation is simply inputs given to me that make me feel or think them . im not in control of my subconscious mind then .

8. interesting . but i think the ' exposing to everyone ' sounds like kind of a mean threat that would cause more drama . but i wouldn ' t know .
