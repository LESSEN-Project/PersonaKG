4. i hate when people half share info  even if the news is boring , don ' t not name names or share your " exciting " news . you gotta love it when people talk about how upset they are on a public post , someone asks if they are okay , and they reply with any of the following . " yes fine babes " " don ' t want to talk about it " " it ' s private " fucking sandra .

5. my fiancee and i had the realization earlier that rudolph is a song  story all about how people don  t want anything to do with you because you  re different , unless you had something to offer .

6. yeah , there is no stigma , and your response speaks far more to your issues than to anyone elses . please don ' t try to tell people what they should and shouldn ' t decide they want when all parties have all the facts .

7. for starters the umpiring is a joke and is turning people away and also all of the adds about betting is also why people don ' t want to watch . don ' t even get me started on the commentary .

8. welp we shall see i guess . i mean i hope that he isn ' t but there are a lot of people that don ' t want him as president .
   (ID: 8538bec5802a894aced56ae86cbcf8201fe458c3)

9. i don ' t want people to look at my belly . and in case theirs a bathing suit maul function , no one sees my titties
   (ID: bfd9d02ab9520306707926faac25480a675a2ae9)

10. i see what your getting at . gauntlets are kind of out of place from the rest of jumpchain . it ' s alot harder to write about them because they ' re usually less of an open sandbox and most people don ' t actually want to write a story where you lose out on a gauntlet so tgere isn ' t much tension there . at least the benefits of body mod carry over to all of your forms .
   (ID: 1476398f6c778fb461539e3f78b07720d4ceee83)

11. this is what i do . the only down side is that some people than try to push those interests on me . i ' ll listen and learn about your interest in magic . but i don ' t want to go play at a tournament . edit  auto  correct

12. our city is trying to figure out what to do about this right now . they don  t want people to drive drunk and don  t want to punish them for making the right choice , but they often need the street in the morning for a market .
   (ID: e1d1404c2d4f1c884debe976d40ee13df3959fcf)

13. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

14. in the event that you don ' t want people to be able to read the words you ' re writing , your hand is conveniently smudging everything effortlessly .
