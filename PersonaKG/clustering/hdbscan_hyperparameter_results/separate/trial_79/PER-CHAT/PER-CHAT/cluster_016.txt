1. you gotta get out , this is the tip of the iceburg . if you want a red flag this is a huge one . as a matter of self preservation you get the hell out . been there it does not get better with time . don ' t be a schmuck

2. things change over time . if a person changes their last name after marriage , do you insist on still using their original last name ? if the person in your photo says their pronoun is they , it ' s they . you are free to do whatever you want , but you would be incorrect to do anything else . the correct information is the information you are given by the person in question . you don ' t have anything else to go on but preconceptions and stereotypes .

3. you obviously don ' t really want to do it . stop worrying about everyone else and take the time to get yourself together
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

4. take every oppurtunity you ' re given . even if its something you don ' t want to do , the experience  funny story is usually worth it . this also results in me having almost no spare time .

5. you ' re basically a hunter with a radar thingy in your ear . is better to scan an area first to see how many enemies and what kind of creatures there are . trust me , you don ' t want to go into an area without preparing for it first . it would be a battle royal and everything coming for you at the same time . but you can roll and get more powerful weapons . also when you level up you get stronger with your staff . there ' s nothing more satisfying that overriding a ravager and watch it destroy everything in sight .

6. at the very least , similar interests . i don ' t want to find someone that is my clone , mind you  but it would be nice to enjoy as least a few things together at the same time .
   (ID: 42817db6a2880fe4df5d65636e25385c67c89bb1)

7. that would bug me too . but at the same time , if you don  t want to have sex , you don  t have too
