1. well if you really do think so and you ' re sure it ' s not right for you , i ' d say call them and be honest . i ' m sure they ' d be understanding .
   (ID: 339d06087e421a1cf86d695af2a2088546f9dc91)

2. i ' d say no . but i think a lot of it is personal bias or what one would prefer to watch .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

3. that ' s funny you say that , i was say the same thing . i think it ' s because of the genetics . nyc has more straight up caribbean and west african folks .
   (ID: a2675f82b975abffb78846564049076f436d7dfc)

4. apparently it ' s a right to carry a gun in church , but gathering to say you think this is wrong is a privelage .
   (ID: f76420437c1e4fb2e8ba8a9e9b0e116c7fc513ab)

5. anti  intellectualism is great to see on what is meant to be a university community . big words , small words , what ' s the difference ? i ' m not posturing . i use the terms that i think best express my ideas . i didn ' t present a counter  argument because isanybodylisten didn ' t present any points that could be refuted in a meaningful way . it was very much , " i see you as being    " . i could say that i ' m not those things , but those are equally weak statements . in what class could you get away with making an assertion without justification ? none . if you ' re comfortable with drawing all of your conclusions about someone from the way they conduct themselves on reddit , maybe you ' re pretentious .

6. how do you say you ' re pretty well sized and in the next sentence say how it has been problematic for you but my lizard brain still manages to ignore that and think  " damn , having a huge dong sounds great . " it ' s so ingrained .
   (ID: d7b75c00237dc445cdc3ebc380fbcb79a40b1a5f)

7. to say that nationalist is more dangerous than muslims that bomb , rape and pillage regular civilians then yes i would say you are far left and you obviously is not very smart if you think that it ' s dumb
   (ID: 957c35ca46ff982635ab97d95c02e9219287f916)

8. i didn ' t say everyone is doing it . but if you think it ' s a nonissue , that ' s on you .
   (ID: 6513b981e1534ff5f0e9f18e4fbf04904704b27c)

9. as a girl , i ' d say all my " firsts " , i think i should have waited for the right guy
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

10. i ' m pretty sure it ' s before , because in lore it says that doomfist was defeated by winston and put in prison . saying that the fight scene ends with doomfist and winston about to clash i think it ' s pretty safe to say it ' s before prison . i might be wrong though , because the doomfist mentioned in the original cinematic could be a different one .
   (ID: 137d64f4a858b21d0854639ebc037d0bd1dc557f)

11. why is so hard for me to think of original things to say or do ?
   (ID: c5b665e8ba18adb2125a557bd8ecbb0654907c67)

12. bars are places to pick up , to make friends i would say go to another forum . perhaps church or some association . as a man i would think you either is looking to be hitted on or waiting for your friends if i see lonely womman browsing around .
   (ID: 3c4a38138d39bd51556bd7f8a05ba48bf283c7e6)

13. sure , it wouldn ' t really matter if they were adopted or not . i ' m trying to say that in terms of decision making , somebody with children adopted or otherwise might be more inclined to look at long  term effects  consequences , as they have an investment  asset in the future . though yes , you ' re absolutely right about a politician being able to be extorted more easily if he has a family . i think maybe you misunderstood what i meant by " investment . "
   (ID: d03d1ad154435125e19860973a5b0df5434be0e5)

14. i can ' t say for sure , but i ' m conjuring up scenes in my head of jedi force  pushing multiple droids over at once ? i think that happened . no idea why there would be an issue focusing on multiple things , although as many as the number of grains of sand in a tornado might be too difficult .
   (ID: 1b160a23109a802786ef06d0b2abff0841f4eb37)

15. you might think we ' re done . but no matter what you say , we will complete this dungeon . if rocks fall and yolnaak dies , so be it .
   (ID: 2e464b2732570f16afced14ab79d30fa92622627)

16. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

17. what i ' m trying to get across is that if you are a poc and a white person saying white pride bothers you unless we are talking in a way meant to harass someone but you , as a poc , can say it some adjustment is needed . it should not matter what your skin color is . it should not give you free passes or exceptions . do i think there are inequalities ? yes . and they are on both sides though one side is more so
   (ID: 29946670851ecd2e37e207eff8da8574e63e86df)

18. i ' m not sure honestly . i have to say the chances of getting hired with no license and no driving experience is frankly , pretty slim . can you get a license ? do you think you can drive safely ?
   (ID: 73c07154e0b2d94bd1f75aecb40a248f845ad21a)

19. which capital do you think he wants ? i say let him have washington . he can ' t do any worse . he is god after all , so do you think one capital is enough ? maybe we should offer him two .
   (ID: b70c0c020fa60fd16329a7c04f4d71a7514815c1)

20. i think given the fact that she sat with him all day on the weekend , no . i would say there were circumstances beyond her control making it necessary for her to continue working .
