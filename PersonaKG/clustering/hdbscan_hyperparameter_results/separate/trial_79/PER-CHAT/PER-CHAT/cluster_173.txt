11. i think what he ' s getting at is the idea that if someone is mentally unhinged example , a psychopath they don ' t really have control over what they do . the brain is the control center of everything we do . if its fucked up , then the person is basically screwed .
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)

   (ID: 2e34fbd58bc49726f7e8c74b8ea82513ca226ab4)

17. flying , it is really fucking hot in texas i don ' t think i would use it too often .
   (ID: 2f6ce17311f39bd1decb97b0a565f08a3ff5f375)

19. i think london would be too urbanised if that makes sense ? american cities , at least the massive ones work on a grid structure , making them a bit easier . london is , comparatively , a fucking mess , not to mention huge . so unless they dropped a nuke incredibly close , it would be a nightmare to build a game world . maybe with the power of future consoles but i don ' t think it would be that feasible

20. i think bethesda will react quicker as soon as they realize is atomic shop items being duped , and they losing revenue . as of now i don  t think they give a damn . never said anything bad about game or studio before . until today . i  ll upvote this  cause i agree to the degree .
