5. for me , the settlement system was an awesome idea but it wasn ' t handled very well . i feel like if it does exist in fallout five , then it should be restricted to a couple of larger areas about the size of sanctuary and it doesn ' t have anything to do with the main plot or hold any story importance . just a mechanism for base building or potentially tie it in with a quest where you compete  trade with the main city in the region and give it something that would be interesting to do or have an actual tangible benefit ? but if it were just a system for building a sick as fuck house , i ' d be all for it

6. look up " which cherry mx switch should i get " and also i recommend getting a keypad  macropad with interchangeable switches if your budget is low and just in case you dont like the switches you choose , i bought the amusingkeypad pro and it works fine for me but i switched to gateron clears .

11. just an idea but maybe write him a letter in the form of an invitation to hog warts and list the series as his school books ? you could expand it and add other " supplies " and take him to hogsmeade in the wizarding world to get the stuff like a stuffed owl or something although that part sounds like a much pricier ordeal

13. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets

   (ID: 7c0a90108389e898ab80f1c7af44e170b85c6d76)

15. i wish i were joking too women dont tend to talk about how a loss feels or how it ' s not just a loss but more like the death of a dream . " be lucky for the kids you do have " is not a consolation in any way .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

17. lsd made me realize that i was overthinking most everything , and that most problems like that are just made up in your head . it really changes your mindset . would highly recommend taking lsd  mushrooms at least once .

18. i wasn ' t suggesting she get an elder scroll to do it . i was simply saying that there could be means of doing so that we aren ' t aware of , just like how the dragonborn is able to find a way to take down alduin and the other dragons .
   (ID: 9789fadf3a050c71c64ca7e31c4857fc9094d643)
