Total from this dataset: 9

1. the question was " what is the first thing you think of " . i didn ' t say that i was stating facts , it is just the first thing that comes to mind . i have never actually been there so i can ' t say anything for sure . that is just what i think of .

2. i think it may just be because those who agree with you have nothing to say because they agree with you . that and what i said above .

3. just be spontaneous and say something that comes up in you about the environment . one sentence i wouldn ' t recommend using in a library though , is something along the lines of  " i came here to read books but i ' d much rather read your mind " cause that probably makes her think you ' re a creep but if it doesn ' t , marry her . she ' s smart .

4. thank you ! that beautiful bastard had so much energy  enthusiasm . i think i speak for all of husker nation when i say we watched the game just him

5. i just jiggle my belly and say " what do you think "

6. without any legal knowledge , i would say that concealed carry permits are obviously made to protect you , and that cops cant assume that a gun shaped bulge is a gun . so i assume , to avoid shooting and killing law abiding suspects , they would yell out " i think he has a gun " allowing the suspect to say " i have a permit " then lay on the ground or something along those lines . and even if they dont have it , i wouldn ' t mention it or touch it and just let them find it , then ask you why you had a gun or just figure it out after inspecting your file , because if you have a conceal carry permit , your name and other identifying data would be in some sort of private government  police database on the event you are arrested .

7. well guys do tell me i ' m hot , but they say that about so many guys that i think it ' s just something they habitually say and it really doesn ' t mean much . it ' s also such a 1980s saying that i ' m surprised anyone still uses it lol ! i suspect they ' re just settling since they couldn ' t get any of the hot guys .

8. let ' s just say that it isn ' t their voices i think of when i ' m in the shower .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

9. i ' m sure this is true , even though i think a lot . my gf will sometimes ask what i ' m thinking about and i honestly say " nothing " or " just abstract shit without any meaning " but she always has words to describe her thoughts .
