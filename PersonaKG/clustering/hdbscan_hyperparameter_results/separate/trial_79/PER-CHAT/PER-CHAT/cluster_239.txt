12. are we gonna get sane or not ? the wait is killing me . having said that , we need digit  digit more signings to be competitive and for squad depth . our squad as a whole is very poor in depth . we lost robbery , james , hummels , rafinha over the summer and have added just lucas and pavard so far . plus our backline is still not very convincing if you ask me , and roca would be ideal to shield the defence . i wish we had gotten idrissa gueye who is pl proven but it is too late now .
