1. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .

3. i would hate to be a dog . very limited communication , scary things you don ' t understand happen all the time , not much control over your own life . well , i guess that ' s me already . so why not .

4. yo . recent diagnosis . emotionally all over the place at all times . been incredibly suicidal at times . on all the meds and about to embark on all the therapy . wear my heart on my sleeve . destroyed and burned every bridge possible . lost the love of my life due to an episode , but that  s a tale for another time . i don  t believe in machismo and don  t understand the whole real men don  t show emotions schtick .

5. i agree . i don ' t see why kids should compete with anyone but themselves . sporting events , talentshows , spelling bees . i never really got that . there ' s still time for that later . as a teacher i tend to focus on process and not so much on product . children are individuals .

6. i don  t mind telling the lazy ones to go out but those that don  t give me time out of their life when i do are the ones that kinda piss me off , like just tell me you  re not interested so i don  t waste my time thinking about you .

7. my mom says ,  it  s because you  re on that game all the time .  while that  s partially a factor , i  m on the game so i don  t go into mental breakdowns every night

8. just take time talking with him . as a male , performance anxiety can certainly be tough . however , with the right support , it can be a great dynamic . tell him and show him that finishing early one of the main fears is perfectly normal and will take practice to control . nobody is born to be a pornstar in terms of performance right away ! for example , if he finishes early , i found the greatest confidence booster wasn  t necessarily my partner saying  it  s perfectly fine  rather showing me and reassuring me that she viewed it as me being so attracted to her that i couldn  t hold back . after we both took time to learn each other  s sexual preferences and finding the balance , the sex is great and i don  t have to worry about performance anymore the nervousness was simply caused by me thinking about societal  norms  and their implied notion of me having to perform perfectly or my woman would get bored and be unimpressed .

9. teach them that there is no end to your problems  it is a race with no finish line so take your time and don ' t rush through life only to regret it . i wish i learned that sooner

10. from what i see in your copy and comment , it is still the same argument . you ' re arguing over the semantics of permanent incapacity to perform your job , over the direct thought that if you ' re not useful for any length of time you don ' t deserve to keep your job . that ' s what i got out of the comment you copied .
   (ID: 0198e6673943ada6e9fb321073bbf268c79d2ea3)

11. what you don ' t see most of the time he ' s shouting at jon snow in all those clips .

   (ID: bcffb449d24a1b884f60069dd68c2fae6a2bed81)

15. let him sit and watch tv all day . ask him what he likes . tell him stories about the two of you and your favorite show  time together . listen to any of his stories , even if they are ridiculous . don ' t expect anything from him , so when he does remember it will be a gift . rotate caregivers frequently to avoid burnout . check out local care facilities , cost , and requirements . join a support group .

17. . so ? i don ' t recycle . why should i conserve the planet for a bunch of assholes making billions exploiting it ? just give them more time to do what they please ? what ' s my " contribution " gonna do , compared to an oil spill ? what ' s my carbon footprint compared to a multinational ' s empire ? fiat iustitia , et pereat mundus .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

18. probably check my medical records to see what drug they gave me last time i had surgery , i ' d just like a heap of that , keep loading it on until i drift off and die . i don ' t react well to morphine so it wasn ' t that . when i was injected she ' s like " ohhh you ' re lucky , you ' re getting a martini " whatever the fuck that means lol

19. that may be the case i don ' t really notice a difference in ttk but i ' ll look for it next time i play but having at least one teammate means much less fire coming out you compared to playing solounless you are purposely playing a high  threat tank role which is why it is easier .
   (ID: a9e8779a80280c00c5063e221eaeba0431068276)

20. this is the only time i don ' t feel bad for guilt tripping somone
