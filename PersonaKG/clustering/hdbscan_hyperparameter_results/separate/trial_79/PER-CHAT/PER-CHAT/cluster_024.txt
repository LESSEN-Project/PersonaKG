Total from this dataset: 7

1. i do this a lot . i don ' t like wearing shoes that much but if you go full on barefoot people treat you a lot differently than someone with shoes on . as soon as they see you with no shoes on they automatically start pre  judging my character , i can see it in the way they stare . but if i wear socks people almost never notice , and you can get into any store most of the time , whereas barefoot people will try to kick you out .

2. exactly . people don ' t understand that you can perceive that through too many behaviours . even the most subtle ones . like you said , in time you can see when someone is genuinely attracted to you . this basically how i met my boyfriend

3. i was gonna be that arsehole , but you beat me to it . i love your tattoo , op , but every time i see a heartbeat tat on here i wonder why people don ' t get an actual ecg tracing done  not doing so will forever have medics driving you nuts by pointing out your dodgy rhythm

4. no , only sticking to " the evidence " at the exclusion of personal experience is where things go awry , you limit yourself and others , and science becomes your master god instead of science being your tool . look , the reason we keep demanding evidence is based on one simple premise .   x200b  people can be wrong .   x200b  do you disagree with that ? you can be wrong . i can be wrong . preachers can be wrong , science teachers can be wrong . anyone can be wrong at any time about anything . everyone  is  wrong about  something  at any given time . i ' m probably wrong about lots of things .   x200b  which is why   verifiable evidence   is the superior method of figuring out what is true , instead of personal anecdote . evidence that can be verified by anyone , and everyone can draw the same conclusion from . that is part of the scientific process known as peer review , where your work is scrutinized and quested by your peers to find out where you are wrong .   x200b  no one single persons anecdotal experience determines truth . nobodys . not mine , not yours , not anyones . only what can be verified to be true via demonstrable evidence can be considered " true . i don ' t claim to have the whole truth . i don ' t claim anyone has the whole truth because nobody does . but we can figure out what is true by doubt , scrutiny , and skepticism . that ' s why we are able to plug our electronics in to our walls and power our devices . it ' s why we have gps , and medicine and vaccines . our entire modern world was built on doubt , skepticism , and science .   x200b  science gave us literally every aspect of our modern world . it is demonstrably true . and i would accept that as a " god " though i would never call it a god , because thats stupid , rather than some ancient fables , or someone ' s lsd trip .

5. but that works the other way , too . that means that all people also have a little gayness in them , too , even if latent , so that when people try to act all homophobic , it ' s basically a self  hate whether they realize it or not , in fact studies have shown that at least a quarter of all homophobic men are closeted gay . i didn ' t mean to be offensive to people , but the kinsey report was widely researched and studied over years with thousands of interviews  patients  clients , it is the book on human sexuality . not everyone agrees with it , it absolutely was controversial in its day , and remains so today . btw , i flirt with self  proclaimed straight men all the time , it never works i keep trying , though , but every time i bring up the kinsey report it makes them take a step back . they too don ' t like the results , but it ' s the truth .

6. 11th highest selling musical act of all time and 2nd highest selling international act in the united states behind only the beatles . there are definitely people who don  t hate nickelback !

7. more people would do it if more people thought about buying and hanging mistletoe . but we don ' t have time for that because we would prefer to waste away , eat , and watch charlie brown .
