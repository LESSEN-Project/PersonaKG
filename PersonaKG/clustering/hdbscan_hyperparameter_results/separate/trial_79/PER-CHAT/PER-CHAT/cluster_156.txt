3. i ' m responding to this   if you told one lie in your life is it fair to describe you as a liar ? i ' m saying , not your whole life . but if you ' ve told a lie in the past week , i would describe you as a liar . there ' s a period of time somewhere between a week and a lifetime that it should be forgiven .

13. no , thanks . stands as a concept bore me not because they lack creativity , but because they ruin everything i ' ve come to love about action in pre  sc jojo  there ' s no direct contact in battles anymore , which results in much more dialogue to fill the time and much less hilariously over the top violence and even more hilariously over the top methods of dealing with your enemies .
   (ID: 207c9889c487546e249178c09ef097ab588d50cd)

14. it ' s come a long way from the first episode , hasn ' t it ? interested to see what they do with each of the characters including the villains . they ' ve introduced so much in such a short amount of time .
