15. fellow xbone player here . i played about digit hours of bf1 and after about digit hours in bfv i honestly prefer it ' s gameplay for the most part . it ' s lacks content and it ' s fairly buggy though not game  breaking for the most part , but we ' re finally getting a frequent flow of maps now , and the bugs aren ' t as bad as they used to be . now ' s probably the best time to get into it , before you get too behind on unlocking weapons etc .
