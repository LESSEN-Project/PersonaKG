1. yep . just thought i ' d like to discuss . i don ' t have a toddler , but i ' d probably let it outside supervised . wouldn ' t supervise my cat , because i wouldn ' t value the life of my cat as much as i do my toddler ' s . plus , i ' d honestly trust a cat ' s ability to escape and keep away from moving traffic over a toddler ' s . technically wasn ' t a study and nor was i trying to give it that level of power , but hey , if you want to do research , be my guest .

3. you just see and recognize what is happening in the same moment . if that person is passing you or you ' re passing them , you want to be aware of where they are and you catch details like that . you don ' t keep watching .

4. sometimes it ' s not a matter of preferring one person over another . you may love your so , but get no sex from them . you don ' t want to break up , but need sex , obviously . so you find someone else you like . not love , but just like . like enough to have sex with . you don ' t find that person preferable to your so on the whole  just for what you can ' t get from them .

7. so what ? it ' s a free country , they should be able to pay or not pay for whatever they want , and if you don ' t like it go work somewhere else . also , not that it ' s relevant in said free country , but they also continue to pay for all preventative birth control , just not abortificants .
