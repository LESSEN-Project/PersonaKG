2. there are lots of good in this world , my life has made therapists cry , but i still find good in people and places . bad news is what the media sells . good news can be twisted to fit an agenda to look like something it is not . follow the money figure out the angle then evaluate .

3. sell your " product " to people . network . customer service is key too because people will spread the word and be like " hey this guy is good . try him out "

6. good , i hope they do feel persecuted . they can keep on feeling persecuted until they leave normal people alone . and we can stop treating their crazy delusions like they are something to be respected .

7. probably nothing much , despite ted being a lazy fuck , people give ted cruz less credit for how good is he an actor during crucial times . man deserves an oscar . honestly i  d take ted over the orange all day . it  s like choosing between shit and diarrhoea , at least one is solid . the other sprays shit everywhere .

8. probably jordan peterson right now . because he ' s so good at articulating his ideas . it makes me feel like what i can articulate and how i feel about situations are more in line with each other . which it turns out is very important . not to mention his ideas themselves beyond that are incredibly helpful to so many people .

9. omg ! so everday when i go to school i have this teacher . hes my social studies teacher and lets call him mr hardy . everyday he always tells us these wierd and awful fake jokes and facts . he says things like ' the earth is flat and oh ! heres a good one . water is wet . its very annoying . hes one of those people who go on the internet and believe litterally anything .

12. i mean if the location is good , which it sounds alright it could make sense for some people . like i agree the rules sound insane but if you have a room to rent in sf if you are willing to lower the price you can make unreasonable demands .

13. never said that , said they are adding in things that cater to the nooby side of the game like quad launchers and mini gun even though it  s been in the game for a while , i also said planes because it  s easy for people to fly through your build battles and shoot you down , guaranteed the planes are good for getting to circle in if you are far but if you get spammed by it and rammed into it  s annoying
