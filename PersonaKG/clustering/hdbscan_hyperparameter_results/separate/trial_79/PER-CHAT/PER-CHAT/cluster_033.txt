1. i love how on almost every video now in the comments it ' s more about domestic abuse  gender reversal n becoming the number one topic . this girl here on my bf ' s old acct really appreciates it instead of the comedy gold i ' d once in a while come across . but i guess it is better stating what u think it ' s is on reddit since that ' s going to make the biggest change , especially under comedy subs . i ' m sorry , i just woke up popped open a can of spaghetti o ' s n just want to to giggle . so get to it n make me giggle !

2. well , at least until they write a game . then they love copyright laws . property laws are as strict as they are because we ' re primates and when we want something we ' ll try to take it if we think we can get away with it .

5. out of interest do you think you should be able to send anything you want to anyone else ? if not where do you draw the line ? i think almost everyone can agree that threats of violence should not be protected under freedom of speech . that said , thank you for offering your take on this , it was very informative .

7. i think you still keep it . it  s just in case you want to revisit it later , when your mind is too cluttered with too many thoughts . that way you make sure you won  t  forget  the details of important memories .

8. yeah . everyone thinks i wake up late but i dont . its just ill wake up and have no motivation to get up so ill just go back to sleep . repeat until around 3p to 4p where i wake up to waste my day doing absolutely nothing . id love to go outside but my parents would think im going to smoke weed and i dont want them to be all suspicious so i just stay inside and play video games and gain weight . i think my depression just comes from how absolutely mundane my life is . i also have literally no one to have deep relieving conversations with either .

9. that sounds rather tricky , because ultimatley i would think your not going to want lots of male muscle in the long run , you ' ll need a certain amount of fat to your shape . at the moment im 176lb ' s with a fairly feminine frame but im working out a lot . im trying very hard not to build too much muscle and just tone up . i dont want my biceps or calfs to get any bigger for example . i could be totally wrong but i would think you need to gain some fat , but keep working out while putting the weight on to keep it under control . if you suddenly put on 20ib worth of muscle you going to look far more masculine .

10. so you  re saying no one works because they want to ? so everyone that works is abused ? what  s important is that they have the choice to do so , even if they may lose a source of income . a slave can  t hand in a digit weeks notice think before you hit the send button

11. i think that you the way you and your partner disagree on this topic will end up badly . your partner should want to be with you anywhere , and shouldn ' t hold you back from an incredible experience . honestly , just my reaction here , i would take this matter very seriously and go on the trip , all the while consider leaving the person . it ' s your life , you must do whatever makes you happy , not others . take your trip , dump you partner for trying to control you .

12. i want sun because for some reason i think i ' d prefer day when it ' s day and night when it ' s night .

15. what is responsible for the existence of our universe . i  m not talking about the big bang , rather i want an answer beyond that . i also wouldn  t accept anything involving a god of some kind . sadly i think this question is deemed to never be answered .

16. this is a very difficult subject . has she ever been molested ? i was molested by my father , starting at the age of digit . because of this , i ' m fairly certain your attraction would be a deal breaker for me . however , you are clearly an honorable man , and i want to thank you . i can only imagine how difficult this must be for you . i think your best bet would be to start the therapy if that ' s the road you want to take , and have her join you . i think hearing a professional ' s opinion , and understanding what you are dealing with will help her and the inevitable confusion that i ' m sure will come .

17. true story  my friends dad built houses for a living . he had a black guy working for him . the black guy was scared of dogs . the friends dad says ' as long as you are working he won ' t bother you ' . so the black guy would carry ply wood back and forth on the job site . the friends dad asked him why he was doing that and the black guy said ' cause i want him to think i ' m working a comin an a goin '

18. i didn ' t want to make a full post about this but i see you a lot in comments . so i ' m doing my first dosage of 600mg i ' ll be doing 300mg and than waiting an hour and doing the next 300mg , i think ill be fine . my friend on the other hand is doing 800mg for the his first trip , should i try and get him away from that idea ?

19. i think i could realistically make a lot of money betting sports . i love it . mlb in particular . i do pretty well and i think that with 100k you could survive . i wouldn ' t want to bc i think making a living out of it would take the fun out of it .

20. i ' ll admit , some days are really rough and the world can make it difficult to want to keep moving forward . but when times get really rough , i find a nice quiet place to be alone and think about how , some where out there , some dumbass is getting hit by a car . brings a smile to my face everytime .
