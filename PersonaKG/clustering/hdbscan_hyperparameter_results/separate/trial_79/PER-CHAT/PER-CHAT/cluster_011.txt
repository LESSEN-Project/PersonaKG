   (ID: 160325a949e5dbc41bc99b9243f0df0953ef7bd4)

2. i worked with a guy who assembled a table inside out . how you may ask ? we still don  t understand how he did it .
   (ID: 7225229d29956e8838c19c739f632492e628b1a4)

3. i stand by my assessment . you gave the server money you otherwise wouldn ' t have , and your intent was to convince them to vote for a particular candidate . i understand your position that it was a symbolic gesture , but i don ' t believe you can separate that out from the fact that you did give them money . fortunately , it seems i ' m in the minority on this not unusual for me , so you should have nothing to worry about .

4. if it is a drum  in  hat parking brake . did you adjust the shoes in all the way ? if you don ' t do that , you ' re making everything else really hard on yourself .
   (ID: 73c07154e0b2d94bd1f75aecb40a248f845ad21a)

5. you don ' t . unless you ' re hella rich . you can also ask your mom how she did it and got you .
   (ID: ac950618ef9fcc0af823e35e0accff447cf73c5c)

   (ID: 7cece6bbdf487f99b6d494ab790bde8e66ce8966)

7. i don ' t mind take a chance on me tbh . they don ' t really play it much anymore but back when they did , i remember enjoying it .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

8. i ' m called freyja , which certainly isn ' t the most appropriate baby name . but then i did meet a girl named tyranny so i don ' t really have any right to complain .
   (ID: 638204ac5dc6fec4d4aa66698b0215b18da66a8b)

9. wait i don ' t understand . did they wait until he had killed everyone or had ran out of ammo ?
   (ID: 77d0324af3e030bb9fb9365a16e870bd522fd275)

10. hey , don ' t sweat it . i ' ll skate it for you edit  also , if you don ' t mind me asking , how much did this cost you ?
   (ID: b721d508c3e10f143c9836626787b26136faa266)

11. this is the hardest thing to deal with in this day and age . this kind of stuff has happened to me and what i did was tell twitch and stuff like that . they don  t listen to creators now . it  s super difficult .
   (ID: 29f3e9a3f8c02fc1b9aa346cffb8edec6caac89f)

12. i played an asoiaf campaign using gurps once unfortunately unfinished and one of the things that the gm did was making the combat very lethal . i don  t remember all the rules or homebrews used , but i remember we used the optional bleeding rules . in our game , set still in the targaryen ruling , we were all members of a minor northern house and were caught in the middle of the rising tensions between the bolton and the karstark . technically we were pledged to the karstark , but our lands were closer to dreadfort and the boltons decided to obligate us to serve them . as you can see our game was more political with very few adventuring , but maybe you could start with an episodic campaign , that behind the curtains is growing to became a conflict between houses and only too late the party will notice that they were dragged to the conflict too . like , they start doing random oddjobs for some house and later discover these tasks were actually pivotal to a coup or weakening another house  s economy or whatever .

13. hey , don ' t deserve sexist ! did you forget about the lgbt community !
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

14. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .
   (ID: 95c90f0b7430996843a42a4f365667a13e4c2eb5)

15. xd at the  omg  , not the story ! , really sorry to hear that . how did you realize you needed to get out ? i  ll pull back if you don  t wanna go into anymore details . i got my story
   (ID: 444659eb8690d0e651e1d4c99817e229ebb65a89)

16. nta . these places don ' t have a membership agreement like costco or sam ' s club where you do need to show your receipt . what the employee did was most likely outside of what they are authorized to do . if they are that concerned with theft , they should station loss prevention employees there .
   (ID: 75903ae93c7c90d031289c2dd3a2e26cbce6d112)

17. yeah i definitely have never heard it defined by that . and you  re right although i don  t care what anyone thinks they are i did see the community as rather whiny and entitled . my thought was always  i don  t go around screaming at everyone that i  m straight ?  unfortunately emotions get involved like everything else , thanks for the information kind redditor !

18. actually trying to practice drawing the form without using someone else ' s artwork to go off of . did that a lot when i was younger , but now i don ' t need to thank god .
   (ID: 8e04d9ff8cb4775dcd9beaa83d8499ec17c7bc83)

19. if you don ' t mind me asking op , how did you start young republicans at your high school ? mine doesn ' t have one and before i graduate this year i ' d like to start one ! i ' m in a very conservative section of va so i ' m sure i ' d have support
   (ID: 93e68d083628a6ef13822ab76b50282903a247f4)
