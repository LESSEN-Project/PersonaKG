1. do you smile back ? if so , the next time that happens say , " hi . how ' s it going ? " or something casual like that .
   (ID: 3de4b885645ecd39fdcb6a1daf410341eb118d2c)

2. again , this is something i say a lot of the time and probably shows you are unfamiliar with my dialect , like i probably am to your own one .

3. esh unpopular opinion but there ' s nothing brave or special about coming out as asexual . she sounds like an insufferable person but at the same time you say " you were only sitting there to get closer to your crush " and implied that her asexuality doesn ' t matter to you because you ' re not interested in banging her anyways .

4. as someone who stays outside the usa i can honestly say that i ' m not even surprised any time he says things like this any more . i should be shocked or embarrassed for him but i ' m way beyond that .

5. " allowing " for direct negotiations is a fallacy because it ' s far easier for a large employer to play hard ball than it is for an individual worker to find another job . " allowing " for direct negotiations is not a kindness . i ' m happy that you enjoyed your own employment situation , i have no personal problem with this kind of thing so long as it isn ' t coercive . like you say yourself , by offering more money for the time they should be able to find willing workers . but allowing them to compel this kind of thing is terrible .

6. idk , honestly thinking about my first thanksgiving  christmas without my dad is all a blur . almost like i wasn  t even there really , completely numb . you survive by thinking about what your parents wanted to see you do  accomplish . wish i could say time heals , but that  s a lie some do  gooder made up .

7. it came from me . here ' s what happened  my best friend ' s girlfriend was spraying water at another one of my friends , and i , as a joke , and i say " stop squirting on me , or i ' ll squirt on you " oh , and another one , this time a joke i made up  put the emphasis on bam in alabama , and you ' re like ala bam i ' m fucking my cousin because that ' s what happens there , i guess

8. well . what i ' m trying to say is , niantic could of done something really cool for everyone that showed up and surprised them with something special like a shiny nidoking . next time they have another event advertised for a sticker . no one may show up .
