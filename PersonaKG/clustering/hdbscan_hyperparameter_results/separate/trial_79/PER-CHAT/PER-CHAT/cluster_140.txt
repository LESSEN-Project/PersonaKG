4. yta dude ! if you were forgetful and needed to be reminded to take your heart medication , wouldn ' t you feel betrayed and horrified that your wife purposely did not remind you because she wanted something from you ? if you are forgetful and can forget to switch out the laundry , wouldn ' t you be betrayed and horrified if your wife let it sit there to mold because she wanted new clothes ? it ' s almost like marriage is is a partnership and involves you to trust and support your partner .

8. i grew up in baltimore , and our 6th grade curriculum made us read his biography and write papers on him because of our proximity to johns hopkins . they made him seem like a super genius . now , looking back , it ' s disgraceful . did you see his debate response when asked if he could order drone strikes knowing children would die ? he responded to an affect that as a doctor , sometimes you gotta put a child ' s lights out , but if you do , make it quick and painless .
