1. i paid digit and still think cdpr is the best . it has nothing to do with giving cp2077 randomly to people for free .

2. maybe when you stop killing people over digit dollars and a bucket of chicken , that shit would stop . think it happens to asian ? nope .

3. why do these types think long words  smart words ? it doesn  t take a genius to figure out that an actual sign of intelligence is being able to thoroughly communicate with people . so , yeah , pulling a digit  letter word out of your ass won  t do anything other than inflate your own ego .

4. it was a whole group . digit people and we were great . but we grew apart and i try not to think about it

5. no problem , and i hope this post is a troll since it  s crazy to think someone is out there with this big of an ego to think charging digit . 5k for something many people do for cheaper is a smart idea .

6. probably not . some people are digit  into a way of thinking and there is nothing you can do to change that especially the extremists . i think everyone that had some doubts or is agnostic , would jump the fence

7. of course . ideologues are all cancerous and not fun to be around . also , it ' s very socially acceptable to be a democrat . a lot of albeit radicalized people think you need to be some radical white supremacist to vote for trump  which is the reason he ' s gonna win in digit .

8. i ' m an extreme grower . that , plus perspective , plus porn , made me think , until i was digit yo i ' m digit now , that i had a small penis . turns out it ' s not only " not small " , it ' s big enough to discourage some people and practices .

9. i think what  s happening is now everyone knows about the show so the typical applicant might br madly in desire of their digit minutes rather than madly in love . collateral damage is what worries me . there are people who would do whatever necessary to get on tv etc , when the shows  s over , their spouse and new families might be over too .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

10. i actively think about stabbing people when they do stupid shit . i can relate to this comment . it  s also the reason i refuse to buy a gun despite my entire state owning one from age digit and up
