2. no , i did not . it ' s just that putting a guy with a hammer and another with a literal tracking device in the same game seems dumb to me .

3. i wonder why the video keeping flipping between an actual video and still images . why couldn ' t they just show the entire video ? did they fuck up in between and had to edit parts out ?

4. well here is where you went wrong . you jumped into water with sharks ! what else did you expect ? these arent dogs , cats , or any other animal human have domesticated . this shouldn ' t be news , just a reminder if you take a risk expect to get bit .

5. oh , clearly we are done . that much was obvious once you , in your arrogance , started your condescending name calling and telling me what my own opinions are and then saying they are wrong . as soon as you did that , i knew that i had no interest in discussing the topic with you further . so , i just left it the quite accurate , " opinions vary "

6. glad you did what you had to , i deactivated social media a year ago and it was the best decision ever made too ! all that nonsense is just full of negative crap !

7. did you happen to take the trump " media accountability survey " or whatever that gets reposted here a couple times a month ? i almost took that survey but quickly realized they just wanted to use my anger to get my email address and didnt submit my opinions .

8. hahaha . i did this at work , simply tried to force a fart that wasn ' t a fart . ended up running home and yelling to my roommates " omg i literally just shat myself " . then i walk into my room and see my landlord showing some of my friends the house .
