1. nah if it was paid , then would i say the word  ! nigger !  ?     x200b  i genuinely think its much better than bluestacks . bluestacks makes you fucking watch ads before you play games most of the time , and its become a piece of trash , not to mention how long it takes to start up .

2. i think what you meant to say is  what if it was possible to cum without pooping at the same time ?  . see , you inverted your meaning . and yes , that would be excellent . so many embarrassing moments erased from existence .

3. and then cry rape the next day . you said that . not me . women do go to bars , drink , meet men and have sex . i doubt their intention is to accuse someone of rape after such an event , but it does happen . if you say it doesn ' t then you ' re not being honest .  edit  you also said  i have never heard of a woman needing to get drunk to have sex with someone . again , i dont think this is an honest statement either . i would almost be willing to bet you that more than half first time sex between couples involve some alcohol . its going to be hard for me to find anything statistically on that because every time i try to google it all that comes up are alcohol related rapes .

4. whenever somebody say something reply with either  thats what the government wants you to think , or say  not since the accident . they work most of the time .

5. i think maybe you need to get a nice even tan all over next summer winking  face also i gotta say every time i see your hips i keep thinking about how well they could take a nice generous pounding . is that wrong ? heh .

6. if you say so . you should take the time to get on google though because it ' s pretty mucb unanimous that either infinity is a concept and therefore the arguement is nonsense , or inifinty is a number and subtracting one is still infinity . when nearly everyone agrees on what i ' ve been trying to tell you , and you ' re the only one who seems to think otherwise , that usually means you ' re wrong .

7. i would say that has some truth to it . shows and movies are getting more realistic and we realize that life doesn  t always have a happy ending but there  s still a story to be told . if look back to  50s   80s , almost every movie that depicts the future was very vibrant and colorful and everyone was happy . but in today  s cinema every time we see the future on screen it  s dark and dismal and destroyed . something to think about

8. 3x3http    westside gunn  conway  hall  nash  i say this all the time , but we need more gunn  conway . this tape is great nas  illmatic  what more needs to be said about illmatic ? madvillainy  i gave it a fair listen . i get why others think so highly of it , but i can ' t see myself going back to listen to it .

10. tell her " i ' m cancelling the trip  i need some time to myself " , and then go somewhere by yourself . there would be nothing untrue or dishonest about this  you do need to get away by yourself and think things through . if your friend asks why , say you will discuss it when you get back .
