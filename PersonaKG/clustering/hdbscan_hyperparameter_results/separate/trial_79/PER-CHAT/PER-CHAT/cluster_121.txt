3. it was a franchise about killing greek gods . then we kind of slid in the viking world which made little to no sense . i don ' t want a white greek going around killing chinese god ' s too . that just doesn ' t fit . you can make his kid do it for all i care . but not kratos

4. its your body . as long as you ' re old enough to be doing it , i don ' t care . i just don ' t want it around me outside of vaping . in my experience vaping doesn ' t have a horrid smell to it .

5. for my wifi to work on both christmas eve and christmas . they are the two days i don ' t do any work at all and just want to veg and play playstation and watch tv .

6. yes for the stats , companies need to show that they have women . but the way to treat a woman vs a man is not the same at all . a woman isn ' t taken as seriously as a man . i don ' t want to victimize women , it ' s just what i see . maybe that we aren ' t at the same step . and when i searched my job it was very hard and i had a lot of negative answers even with successfully tests .

   (ID: 1a2005f167479f3281c7ec201759432973de88ef)

9. when i realised when my religion sins you for believing in another religion . why should be faith be the one qualifies whether i go to hell or not . i can ' t rely just only faith . i want to believe and i need proof or facts because i don ' t want to go to hell for something all are unsure about

10. that is awesome ! i work at a hotel , everyone except for me  a few others , smokes . they just take these  meetings of the minds  what they actually call it whenever they want . we don  t get breaks at the front desk , it  s really annoying .
   (ID: 11122d097ac2bf92618c12d297296710dc6494ce)

11. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

12. if you want to survive on the internet , don ' t care about haters  trolls and just make fun of them in your head or not .
   (ID: a7bc2b703fc48560edb9834ac21a54e2a95b9e21)

13. that is just too random . i mean , the caves themselves seem huge , no matter how far , i still see areas of darkness . so i ' ll try and fully explore the area , i guess . i don ' t want to die and respawn , since i mined up lots of ore .
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

14. i just don ' t understand why anyone would want that instead of physical keys
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

15. i was thinking something closer to " hey that was immature maybe don ' t do that again but we want you back if you ' ll act a little more mature " that ' s obliviously just the bullet points i ' m going to put some care into it but i do understand where you ' re coming from thanks !
   (ID: 0501bf1e5cd313190bb4590a1c677057b15a6e47)

   (ID: bf3ecf9a17a2720b027f45e63d8ad609be4c0fcf)

17. why are you assuming that it ' s fear that keeps guys from popping the question ? some guys just don ' t want what you have .
