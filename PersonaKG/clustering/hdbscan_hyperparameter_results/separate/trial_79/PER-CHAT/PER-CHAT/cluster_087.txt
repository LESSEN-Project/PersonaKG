8. i ' d have some questions to ask my mother for sure . i would certainly be hurt by the fact that my uncles haven ' t really been in my life for the past few decades nothing dramatic , just drifted apart . what would get me the most is the fact that my dad died when i was five , which has scarred me very much . i wouldn ' t know how the process the fact that i felt all of that for someone who wasn ' t who i thought .

14. i wasn ' t familiar with the supermarket incident . i know there was a fat soldier or marine please excuse my memory of which , carrying his in a mall , but he had notified the police before hand . it is similar to westboro baptist church , just because you have a right to do something , doesn ' t mean it should be done .

16. the only problem is it can turn into murder , yes most likely accidental but still killing for another person . she admitted she doesn  t know much such as road rules and the lane change was just an example . that  s why i  m not sure

17. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

18. i agree but you can ' t really expect him to give us the whole story he wants encouragement and if we tell him not to and his parents do to then he ' s going to doubt it its def a biased post but in the end its probably going to be better for him than then keeping him from it entirely atleast he ' ll know why he should have now rather than just being told he shouldn ' t
