Total from this dataset: 7

1. i have several friends in that exact boat , and i ' m functionally in a similar one right now . i tell my mom that people my age understand the concept of orientation well enough that saying you ' re gay does not necessarily entail that you have gay sex . like they might at first assume otherwise , but it ' s pretty easy for the average non  christian my age to grasp the basic concept of a celibate gay christian . but she and others seem to just look at it as , " if you say you ' re gay , that definitely means you are actively seeking out butt sex "

2. what am i suppose to say ? what ' s done is done , no need to keep feeling guilty and letting it eat me up for months messing with my mind and shit . just letting go now and not letting it bother me sounds way better then letting stuff fuck me up like most people do .

3. it does , and its a pain in the ass , but after awhile you just learn to deal with it i guess . people tell me a lot that they could never deal with that , but you just have to , its not like you can say no thanks or something . those people seem kind of ridiculous . i dont get them

5. i mean sometimes if there ' s a car on fire on the road or there ' s been an accident then if someone uploads it to like their social media saying avoid the let ' s say m25 there ' s been an accident ? i mean going in and filming dead bodies and injured people isn ' t the greatest move but what if your just taking a video of something while passing by ?

6. like at times he ' s unnecessarily judgemental about people . about views he doesn ' t agree with and i call him out for that saying that he should be more inclusive and less judgemental . then he ' ll get all defensive about how i ' m disrespectful without even registering my views and what i actually meant to say . he just wants me to agree with everything he says and not have any views that oppose his .

7. to be honest some people that are antivaxxers are not looking at recorded data its like . they start looking at the cover of the book then basing their thoughts on the cover only without looking inside it , they base all their " knowlege " , " evidence " and " research " on the cover itself . you cant call research without searching and cant have evidence if you dont even understand most of it plus they do it on facebook , facebook mostly have no solid evidence that what they are saying is true , they just press a link and say " wow this is so true because it came from a random person i saw on the internet " . as in why do they do this , im not trying to be rude but why do they do this . if i facepalm myself equivalent to their stupidity i might aswell get sucked in the black hole . not trying to be rude just my pure thoughts and honesty
