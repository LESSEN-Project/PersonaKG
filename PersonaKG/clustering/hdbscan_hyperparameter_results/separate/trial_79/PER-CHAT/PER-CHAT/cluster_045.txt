1. you  re not wrong , but please drop the phrase  mentally handicapped  from your vocabulary . there is often this idea that people with cognitive disabilities are unable to learn , so there  s no point in trying . or that discipline is mean because they won  t understand . it  s very much false . ideally , one would begin by teaching them on the same level as anyone else , and then , if needed , lowering the bar a little at a time until they reach a point that the learner can succeed with some effort . setting the goalposts too low on learning i use learning in the broadest sense possible , not just academically does no one any favors .

2. just because it ' s contracted doesn ' t necessarily mean it ' s gonna air at a set time . look at how korra ended . they moved it around the schedule way too frequently , so people couldn ' t keep track , and therefore ratings dropped . then they just dumped the last few episodes on itunes and later aired them late at night on nicktoons when no one is watching . something similar could happen to at .

3. if it  s really bad you should try to find a tutor or a study group to keep you motivated to complete your assignments on time . it  s easier when other people expect something from you rather than just yourself

5. my take on it is that  how can we prove they really kicked us out of the group just before the final boss ? a screenshot doesn ' t really prove we got kicked out . for all anet knows we might just be out to give this people a bad time for whatever reason .

6. through gaming i have found a whole network of people , who i now consider friends , that have helped me stay interested in programming . i have a full time job right now and just do programming for fun , however , working with my friends on little stupid or fun projects , even if its game mods , keeps driving my passion for it . also , working with friends or a team of people even if it ' s for fun coding  programming something helped me learn because they were able to explain dumb down for me sometimes or reference resources how they learned some of the arduous tasks , concepts , etc . which made it a whole lot more enjoyable . just my recommendation .

7. some older games require you to keep the cd  dvd to ensure you have a valid copy to start the game " no game disc found " and " please insert data disc " etc . this is just to check if you have a valid copy , and to stop people causally sharing copies of their games with other people . nowadays , just about all new retail copies of pc games require you to redeem the game via an online platform like steam , origin or uplay . after that , you could just chuck that dvd away , it ' s useless to everyone else once the key ' s been redeemed . but , there are the few games that would allow you the choice to redeem the game on a platform that wasn ' t supported at the time of the game getting published . ea origin accepted my dvd key  code for dragon age origins , originally released three years before the origin client existed .

8. i ' m not talking about that sort of camping . that ' s the proper way to camp and it still involves looking for fights so i have absolutely no problems with that at all . i ' m just referring to the people who sit in one spot for a long time hoping to catch players by surprise .
