1. title  twentyfive past ten artist name  rensis about  last week i thought i would give making my own songs a try . asked some friends on facebook for input but because they ' re friends , im just getting " thats really good " or " love it " , which gets me nowhere in terms of progress , so im posting on reddit because i know you guys aren ' t scared of being . well . honest . questions  do any of you have tips for using garageband for mac what i ' m using to develop my songs ? would like to know any secrets you guys might have . do you have any song name ideas for my upcoming works ? if you have a look at the stuff on the rest of my channel you can see the songs have random names like " a side of pork " and " greg loves emma . would it matter if i put in lyrics ? would i get more ' interest ' if there was lyrics or is it not necessary ? i actually can ' t sing for shit so i ' d need to get others involved . is there much point doing that then or should i just stick with what i ' m doing atm ?

2. i feel that the tier list should go a bit more in  depth behind why a unit is considered better than another with nearly identical usage . also , a separate tier list listing stuff like best f2p characters no summons basically , and best pvp characters . i know the current tier list already somewhat does that , but they tend to mesh with the obviously good ultimate festival characters , i ' m just wanting a tier list only for characters that can be blazing awakened .

3. yea once someone goes to the us they maybe realize its just like home in many ways . some ppl succed some fail , hard work and attitude goes a long way . as do network and contacts . my imageand i could be wrong is that your results  efforts  input will determine your position in us to a larger degree than in europe . here in europe if yoyour parents know the right person they can hook you up with a fairly good job . having said that , i dont know any country that would be easy to transfer too where competition is not hard . im sure ppl are working their ass of in poor countries aswell .

4. there ' s a lot of good advice in the comments already . but , i ' d like to add one . just pray . talk to god . there ' s no need for formality by clasping your hands or saying thou and thy . just ask some questions , thank him for cool stuff like the grand canyon or gelato . talk about your concerns and your shortcomings . let him know you acknowledge him . if the act of prayer feels good to you , continue it . second , find a community of believers . i recommend looking for an alpha , because i learned a lot as a new believer . god bless .

5. oh , believe me , noah aint the worst shit you could have gotten . i have a name that only two other people have in my country , so . its pretty embarrassing . and well its just a one crush . i know it feels like shes the one , but let her make a decision , and accept it no matter what it is . you can try taking her out on date to show that you aren ' t some random retard . good luck man , waiting for the best news from you !

6. i ' m anxious too and that would bring me super down . are those guys average looking or extra attractive ? it seems like a lot of work to have someone come over for sex and do an oh hell no rather than just getting off . not that that ' s a good thing per se but at least you wouldn ' t know . i ' d try and give you my honest opinion but i might be too nice to do so .

7. i know exactly what this is like . i went through this a few months ago . it continued , i spent the whole summer alone at home . and when i came back i didn ' t care anymore , i stopped pretending and just looked how i felt . funny thing is it ' s the same . great post , i hope someone has some good advice we could all use .
