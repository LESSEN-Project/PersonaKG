1. probably similar to chyna with just the   opening   mlk day so maybe not opening the show graphic . i don ' t think there would be too much backlash with the whole innocent until proven guilty thing .

2. i guess lofi ? it ' s just a vocal sample , i don ' t think it changes the genre . and no , spoken word is more like poetry i think .
   (ID: e5993e8225553560e11e413ae45f9309c5e69b21)

3. not sure if you ' re being sarcastic or not , but it was just a question . i searched around and couldn ' t find much except what has already been mentioned . i figured i would ask the reddit community for their input . also i play on console , i don ' t think there are too many hacks out there to increase my magicka , but thank you for your suggestion .

4. i think patrick seitz said they ' re keeping the mudas don ' t quote me on this , i ' m just passing info .
   (ID: 0d065664c5c0ecf2ad8ff37ffeeb574c5822d075)

5. i think more characters should of died . as an example i don ' t think nagato should have been able to resurrect everyone after his attack maybe like kakashi but shizune , ebisu , ibiki , they could just stay dead to me .

6. i don  t think they are ugly , i just think it  s interesting to see something marked on someone and think what was the motive behind the tattoo and what  s the story .
   (ID: c5e877ff3be5d3571f5fe899f55887a6f608ee98)

7. i don ' t think so . i remember hating it as a kid , but i just watched the trailer and will definitely watch it as soon as i can . it seems interesting now ahah buuut . no , it ' s not what i ' m looking for . thanks tho

8. i don ' t think others are wrong , per se , mine just works for me . the whole " faith " thing .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

9. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

10. it ' s clear that azan is her priority . i don ' t think you ' re too uptight . nickle is a horrible excuse for a mother . i mean she has her daughter calling azan " daddy " , and that ' s just the start of all her issues . i ' m sure nickle loves may , but she neglects her and uses her as a bargaining chip , and i won ' t even start with the " daddy " thing . smh .

11. i think an article to secure freedom of speech should at least have a provision where you cannot lock somebody up for political reasons i . e . having the wrong political opinion or for offence  related reasons . that ' s just my view . i don ' t think governments should control our speech because then they inevitably control our thoughts . if a government cultivates what is politically correct , for instance , that tradition of speech becomes part of the very culture , and it restricts the scope of the consciousness .

12. i just hope we won ' t get any problems next summer with the ffp as i don ' t think conte would come if he doesn ' t get his signings
   (ID: 5743909dfc8d4789250ad63c644a076260aa5bf2)

13. yes it would be , he already feels lonely for not having a girlfriend . what do you think his friends leaving will do to him ? you might just push him to complete loneliness and sadness . i too have never had a girlfriend and my friends are my emotional support so i feel him . he needs you guys please don ' t leave

14. i think as a canadian this reflects how i feel accurately . it ' s not that i don ' t like america or americans , or that their ideals aren ' t the closest to ours . but if there is truly a superpower that is a threat to world peace , it is without a doubt america . i think just what transpired over the past year there , shows me that at some point an american civil war is a way greater threat to world peace than anything china or russia could do .
   (ID: ff39f069f8b23a1fe1a55ce497714a8d205eb0fa)

15. i think i am too , just less violent and more obsessive . i don ' t think it ' s any better for me . though despite that i like to think i ' m a fairly positive person despite what my clothes and music tastes would tell you , though unless you listen to metal you would be surprised to find how many normal  ish metalheads there are .

16. if you think about it the world does . you just have boogers in your nose so you ' re used to the smell and don ' t notice .
   (ID: b4d61ff0c23f7ce5512ee9f64d1bea0f938f262a)

17. maybe it ' s just because i have a bad sense of smell due to allergies and other stuff , but from experience i think the tournament smelle memes are a lot more joke than truth . any group of human beings being together for several hours will have a smell . but it isn ' t that bad or anything . i think how bad it is at tournaments is quite overblown . then again i don ' t think gyms smell that bad either . it ' s just not something that bothers me i guess .
   (ID: 7cf18036f93dc6fc68e7a501c52e0ff5501b36e5)

18. i don ' t feel special for it , i wish that everyone felt that way . and i ' m sorry that i responded in a way that you think didn ' t answer the question  if you think it ' s irrelevant , that ' s what the downvote button is for . it ' s just my take on the question ' s topic .
   (ID: 0dd32da9f7e822909c258818ed313736b958a15a)

19. huh , no one really judged me on that . if they do i just lecture them on linux , and why closed source is evil . they don ' t care whether i drink , they just think i ' m nuts .
   (ID: 863668ae41c2ed645f4a842f66ab3efcc92d4d76)

20. i understand . i  m just not much of a lebron fan , so it  s hard for me . also don  t think he  s even close to the goat . best of this era ? sure .
