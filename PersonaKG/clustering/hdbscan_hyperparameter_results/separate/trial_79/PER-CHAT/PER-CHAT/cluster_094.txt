1. i get why some people don ' t like the casting choices but why not give them a chance and at least watch some of their performances which by the way i can ' t find much for anya

2. i feel the exact same way about people of color that constantly shit on white people and make blanket statements about them . you don ' t like it when people do that to you , so why would you do that somebody else ?

3. um , no the odds of him having a child are the odds of anyone else having a child . you either do or you don  t . and he could use a surrogate like plenty of straight people do too .

4. how to make small talk with people you don ' t like
   (ID: 2b53241b2b7d7e4ce58f4e39589b18bda4d0d5d2)

5. well it looks like you took their advice the wrong way . talking to people doesn ' t necessarily mean you have to act like someone else . to be honest , everybody is really insecure in high school . chances are that if you don ' t have a horrible personality , you ' ll be able to find someone with the same interests as you .

6. there ' s nothing to agree about . i presented a concept for like minded people to discuss . you wouldn ' t walk into a vegan forum and start saying how the idea is stupid would you ? you stated you don ' t like that idea . that ' s perfectly acceptable . you didn ' t add anything to the discussion though other than how you dislike it . obviously you have made up your mind , so you have no purpose in this thread anymore . go talk on topics you enjoy .

7. oh yea . you continued to harass me by posting comments like this . don ' t act like a fool dedicatedsloth . old people are not always wise . example  dedicatedsloth . i said to end the drama . you continued it . so you are harassing me kid . stop it kid  i am older than you !

8. this is awesome . fuck those people that don  t like it . you do you . i like this . you  re doing something that gives you enjoyment . fuck the haters .

9. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .

10. i absolutely hate the threads that are deep  seated in woman hating . yet these people cry and moan about not having friends or a life outside of reddit . gee , i wonder why ? maybe if half the people on reddit stopped whining , stopped giving into the hivemind and show girls some respect . maybe , juuuuust maybe , she will like you . also , reddit is not a reliable source of dating advice ! when a single woman goes on a date with you , all your karma points don ' t mean shit . show her you ' re not an asshat and she ' ll like you .

11. it ' s your choice , and everyone has their reasons . i sometimes feel like people who don ' t drink can be a little judgmental of people who do , but i grew up around baptists so maybe thats why .
   (ID: 573effd77bc41b375b82f92f6f34840f2f4dbff4)

12. so are children and small animals . it sucks , but i don  t see any way to change that . people like to be bullies and the bigger you are , the easier it is . that  s not a form of systematic oppression though .
   (ID: cee163065387f306a65f75ff6f22f7e20fa1f46a)

13. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .

14. religious bigotry is why people like you don ' t get respect . you offer nothing but hate

15. a small book i read in the 5th grade that i still remember is loser  by jerry spineli it wasn  t really life changing , it gave me insight on how people reacted to certain people with aspects and traits they don  t like .
   (ID: 10c2d30b5581a23e2c7c1dc1be57a142a309b660)

16. yeah exactly . i personally don ' t really like the new design myself , but if people do , perhaps there ' s something there that i may have missed out on . perhaps some cool new feature i missed out on that makes it better than what ' s already here . i mean , if it ' s not broken , why fix it ?

17. well , as harsh as it might sound , there might be people in your life who have slept with everyone but you and they still don ' t owe it to you to sleep with you . that said , i guess it ' s one ' s own choice whether one wants to hang around with a person like that , not out of spite , but out of being annoyed by being regaled with all the fine details which might be tmi .

18. saw someone post something like this the other day . i don ' t understand how people don ' t get , it ' s not at all confusing . users submit any content they like , which gets voted on by the community , and those which get overwhelmingly positive feedback reach the front page of the internet
   (ID: 7d39153e3adadffd15e1638679c2e1cdc5c64fde)

19. don  t . you either get your ass whooped or a possible assault charge if you win . you will always look like an asshole too source  have gotten my ass whooped by groups of people more than once
   (ID: 4c78d717b8cb40324bcb964efd837dbf02ae03a8)

20. people actively search out your username and it ' s history to critique it if they don ' t like your comment .
