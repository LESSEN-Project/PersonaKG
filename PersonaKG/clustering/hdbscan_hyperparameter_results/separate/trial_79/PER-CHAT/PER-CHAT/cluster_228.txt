1. this is one of those people new to tf2 who thought they would like to share a video with u , so lower those pitchforks , or just a kid who wants karma , in that case , shower him in downvotes

2. bzzzzt . sorry , thanks for playing . your copy of the home game is in the mail . i find it fascinating that this keeps coming up again and again . it ' s almost like people are trying to convince themselves . that seems akin to a straight guy being uncomfortable around ' mos , because it ' s a reflection of , well , something . so  called  virtue  signaling  " lol gay conservatives amirite ? " the other day i wondered if this were a venue for actual discussion or just an echo chamber of the trite . turns out it ' s both , depending on quality of subject matter and participants . carry on .

3. yeah that  s true , not as many people are getting third party tests for sarms like they do for gear . i just wish we had some sort of better system

4. the guy is just bad at grammar and making coherent sentences , yet some people still believe that he will actually go and admit things like that to public .
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

5. he could be , and i can see where you are coming from . or he could just be a lonely old man who wants to be friendly and you ' re the only one who ' s actually engaged him in conversation when he ' s tried . maybe he sits alone in front of the tv by himself every night , hoping his kids will call and they never do . eats lunch alone because he doesn ' t get along with the other professors , etc . maybe you ' re like the one person who has been actually friendly and not just professional with him and he looks forward to it each day , which leads him to go a little overboard . like a stay at home parent who talks nonstop the minute another adult is around not being there to see his interactions with other people , it ' s hard to tell . i like to give people the benefit of the doubt .
   (ID: c673eb9fda8629b3a86935092a2668010b581ab1)

6. it ' s just a matter of what people find attractive . myself , i like all parts of the chicken !
   (ID: 128346fc1e56ccadd25a4b200ecae44637d48f5f)

7. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

8. okay , so you  re asking for yourself ? sorry , i assumed you , like most people , were just curious . the biggest thing i had was to use my intellect instead of how i felt . i felt like shit and wanted to die , but i knew in my head i wasn  t and people loved me , i was also just curious , and i can  t find out what happens next if i  m dead . as for life itself being meaningless , so what ? just because no one will remember you in a hundred years doesn  t mean you  re pointless right now , you can have a very real impact on a lot of people in a lot of ways . when i felt like i didn  t matter because humans are expendable , i just had to realise that we are , but not to each other .
   (ID: f8a8648f114c1dd8984a809bd49816978d9970c0)

9. guess my point is , there ' s always a lot of hate towards white people and slurs , but it ' s kinda just shrugged off like nothing . it ' s like most see it as okay .
   (ID: 65b64663fe8890c471866a25cf075ff50d852dbf)

10. all those illegal ballots that people sent in ! why are we allowing people to vote from home ! just walk out of your corner penthouse office and get chauffered to your precinct like i do ! i even pay myself to do it ! and just in case you thought that was serious   s
   (ID: 081bfde47e58fd02f795a0a9ecccc29cc746decb)

11. i like seeing other people progress , and its inspiring to some people . no hate towards you op , but please realise that not everyone thinks like you and just because you dont like it , doesnt mean everyone doesnt like it . thinking like this is how you get toxic people who shame anyone different not accusing you of this tho
   (ID: ba841e2486d1df5b5baefde5ead0636c7c03c79c)

12. someone called me some bad stuff and admitted that the intent was to harm me . took me almost a year to figure out that bad people just exist and can fit in with society like everyone else .
   (ID: c9b1e924c86788c982ec59df3d5704354a2a4ae1)

13. dolphins learned how to gently squeeze puffer fish to release a toxin that  s harmless in low amounts and get high . they then just float around in a  trance like state  . also people keep dumping drug residue into the ocean so a bunch of endangered electric eels are in danger because they  re all high on actual cocaine and stopped attempting to reproduce . sea animals are literally crackheads .
   (ID: 43eb93a2829d2d27f18e23e94602a8caf9832d4c)

14. i hate the ones that give you a last name and nothing else . but , even worse are the ones that just stand there , mute ! like they need a prompt or some sort in order to talk ! people lose all social skills or filters when they step through the doors .
   (ID: 11122d097ac2bf92618c12d297296710dc6494ce)

15. i grew up watching fat albert cartoons , with the values that bill cosby instilled in the cartoon ! how could this guy do such horrible things ? it ' s sad , just like so many famous people , they are people with problems , they just have a bigger spotlight ! o . j . simpson is another one that comes to mind !
   (ID: b22c18b3aace8fe589bc1582daccf85fa3224733)

16. well , that ' s not very nice . maybe you should do some research into what it means before you treat people like shit . for your information , it just means " lol . funny how someone who made a racist joke is telling other people to go fuck themselves .
   (ID: 7898b57d9475978228e0993fa3f9b6a2058d950e)

17. its negative because the people who feel like they are treated unequally would end up wanting to be treated better than equal . its just like the some of the lgbtq people who call themselves a million different genders . it makes no sense , and it ' s just unreasonable .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

18. you are ignoring the simplest fact that this show inspired many of us to question why and how . i major in sciences as i remembered how one of my questions became a featured myth on the show . yes essentially , you are indeed describing that show in a very layman terms , but myth busters serves more than just special effects . it helps us to answer any of our doubts on daily events and inspire our next generation of people to actually like sciences more . obama gave an interview to mythbusters , and essentially just said what i said . disagree if you like , but you just sound really deprived if you are going after a teen show .

19. god i hated bobobo  bo bo  bobo it really wasn  t for me but it was for some just like how a lot of people didn  t like . hack   sign i loved it though
   (ID: 9057da1059e9ffba54ce02d4a15e2aac2b3ceabb)

20. sounds like it might actually be something thats just trying to help certain people .
