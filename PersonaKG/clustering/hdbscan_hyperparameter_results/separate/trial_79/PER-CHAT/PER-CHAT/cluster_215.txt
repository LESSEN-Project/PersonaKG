4. depends on where your mind is at the time . how was your day ? are you happy ? sad ? angry ? how much acid ? what kind of trip are you looking to have ? have you ever dropped acid before ? are you an experienced cosmonaut ? there ' s nothing wrong with dropping acid alone at digit pm . as long as you are doing the drug and the drug isn ' t doing you

5. one of the biggest problems i ' m encountering is customers saying my prices are too high . every salesperson hears this all the time . you ' re not alone .  the reality , though , is that my service is priced below my competitors ah , but not every salesperson has a product that is priced lower than their competitors . so if you are hearing " it ' s too expensive " and yours isn ' t even priced higher compared to the industry , then you digit  have a value problem , not a price problem . question  when you make cold calls , are you trying to sell on the call , or are you trying to set up an appointment for the actual demo  sale on that first call ? hint  most of the time , you should only be doing  digit .

6. if you ' re only digit and you ' re asking this question marriage is not for you at this time in your life . marriage is a commitment best entered into when you have no reason to question doing it .

7. i always see how many babies one sim can give me . record was digit . another thing was to see how many offspring one sim can have , that are alive at a single time . woohoo until he has a ton of kids , have to kill the neighbors to fit them all in the hood . eventually the only ones left are family , so it gets weird .
