1. everyone is someone ' s kid . so everyone will be missed by a couple people . unless you ' re a total piece of shit and your parents are dead , in which case just do the world a favor , know what i mean ?

2. everyone  s there to improve , most people who know this aren  t paying attention to anyone else and most likely enjoy seeing other people there to better themselves . imo anyone who shames other people for trying to do that is just an asshole

3. ummm . wow ! it wasn ' t the nazis who built that wall . yikes ! i correct my previous statement , you should have just learned history ! that was not such a wall , that was to keep people in . much easier to do if the gov ' t kills anyone you know if you escape . kind of puts a damper on escapes and the ability to plan them with others .

4. why would someone just entering the business turn down a job opportunity for low pay ? i certainly know i wouldn ' t , and the prevalence of internships shows that people are willing to basically work for free as long as it gets them experience .

5. it happens . not many people know what dyspraxia is so i just explain it to them
   (ID: df1ced988175856d5a5b468166271e5d777e4a3e)

6. " secret " , just go through all people who can cursive and you know

7. i guess now we know , varys never had a hidden agenda . he truly was just a guy that wanted the best for the people of the realm . his passing is even more tragic if one considers this .

8. yeah , i personally found that by " shaming " myself , it becomes harder to manage . op you just experimented your sexuality in a different way than what you expected everyone ' s unique otherwise fetishes wouldn ' t exist . as long as you know the line between fantasy and reality , you should be ok . try not to associate shame with something that is a natural activity . its the same as celibacy  most people couldn ' t uphold it because it goes against natural instinct , yet they ' re shamed into keeping up the facade .

9. you know those people who lose a tonne of weight then gain it all back , getting to be at least as big as they were before they started ? that ' s you if you aren ' t careful . it is much harder to keep going once you attain a place you ' re happy with as you lose a major motivator at that point . just remember every bad day is literally undoing the hard work you went through to get to where you are now . past you says you ' re a dick and should keep on eating right !
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

10. i know it ' s someone else since you replied with decency . just find it comical how my own view and something that should affect no one still offends people . it ' s a pathetic culture we have going on .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

11. it might be normal for her . if something is really urgent you should just call her instead , or do both . some people do forget to text back , and some people are just inconsiderate . can ' t know which one your girlfriend is , but you should def discuss with her that this bothers you and see if she ' ll fix her texting habits at least for urgent messages
   (ID: 727005d2be64ad8719921d081ef3d5b06c835375)

12. i said i liked colossal squids and some people downvoted it . but i know its just because they haven ' t learned about them yet !
