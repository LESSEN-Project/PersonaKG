   (ID: d1782cb4517074846c9d38ab433d4029998e91b4)

7. never understood being friends with exes , like if you broke up , there ' s obviously something not good between you both . why would it change just because you ' re not intimate . maybe a year later i ' d be alright with it , but saying " let ' s stay friends " is an almost bullshit excuse to not feel bad .

8. compare his lifestyle to the previous one . the current pope is much more modest with his attire and seems to me like a genuinely good guy . it ' s a nice message and you are just hating so you can hate on religion . why do you care ?

11. i ' m the third , walking dead isn ' t a horrible show at all , it ' s just has " filler  like " episodes that can be boring but when the good ones do come on its worth it .
   (ID: a73b0dda35d389b4f74e47db6574e0f71738b683)

12. like with anything , just be as careful as you can afford to be . take pride in your gear and it ' ll serve you well . cases are a good idea but not essential  however , it ' s better to have one than not .
