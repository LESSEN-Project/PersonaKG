3. how long until uber just decides to give the police real  time data on us instead of fiddling with our phones ? then , if they can ' t solve a crime they can just pin it on the closest driver at that time , case solved . now that i think about it , nsa and cia probably already have this . unconstitutional you say ? nah , they say ! it ' s for your protection ! it ' s to get the terrorists ! astonished  face

4. i wouldn ' t say that amanda punches harder . cyborg is the bigger woman , and punches pretty hard . amanda ' s punches are just faster . so by the time cyborg is extending her punches , she ' s already getting rocked by amanda . either way , you ' re right that she didn ' t fight smart . it ' s what happens when you ' re the hunted for so long , you forget to keep doing what got you to the dance .

5. i have a hard time believing someone in the trek universe hasn ' t tried this . i am also trying to figure out if i should say this happened on titania or just go straight to saying it was the klingons on uranus .

7. i ' d have to say ori and the blind forest . it ' s such a beautiful game with such a beautiful soundtrack . the story is told with few words and more visual story telling . that game never fails to make me shed a few tears , even on the 5th playthrough . it ' s not playing a platformer , its living the trials of ori and it just submerges you so well that i ' d have to say it ' s my all time favorite game .
