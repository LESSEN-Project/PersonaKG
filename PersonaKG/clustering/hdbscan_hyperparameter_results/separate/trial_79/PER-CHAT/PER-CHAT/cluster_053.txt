1. i disagree . what makes something a " fact " is that it has been scientifically proven to be correct , and is backed with peer  reviewed evidence . facts change only when new information is presented that follows the same criteria . we should always stress to people the importance of basing their opinions on these principles , otherwise we are complacent in the dumbing down of society . but i agree that dogma is a huge pain the ass that i ' ve learned to ignore . sometimes the argument is not worth the effort , no matter how infuriating . i think i read somewhere that it ' s like playing a game of chess with a pidgeon  all the pidgeon is goin to do is knock down the pieces and shit on the board , then strut around like they ' ve won .

2. well trump hits the list , the last few leaders of iran . there were a few really old kings that would ' ve topped the charts but i can ' t recall them right now . i think many of the current leaders in the world lack morality and do idiotic things that harm their people .

3. ah , right , i see what you mean . that ' s pretty odd , i ' ve never heard of anyone doing something like that before , but it ' s pretty cool ! i think midnight might be some sort of aboriginal creature , since two other people have suggested it . thank you for your advice !

4. i ' ve seen this a lot recently . could it be the case that where this is happening the word " our " is poorly pronounced and people genuinely think that they should be writing " are " .

5. why would someone regret posting something online ? do people actually care what faceless strangers think about you ? it  s like you  ve never seen that person irl , and you are embarrassed or something . it  s insecurity to the maximum .

6. some people are stuck so far up their ass that they actually think it  s embarrassing to show emotions . like dude , it  s totally okay to be emotional even if you  re a guy . it  s normal ? humans have emotions . but seriously if some asshat thinks men can  t have emotions , they  ve got some serious problems .

7. yeah i  ve usually seen it from middle school , but looking back at what i saw i still think it  s f  up . but you can  t change people  s ways on this sadly
