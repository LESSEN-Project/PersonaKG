2. you know what ' s even worse ? their many , many readers will find that shit hilarious , and if you tell them why you think that shallow playground humour is insipid , they ' ll just dismiss you as being part of the " pc brigade .

3. i actually think leaving a note is a great idea because you ' re not putting him on the spot . he knows you know about it and hopefully he will just stop .

5. dude samesies , except i have this cat i can  t stand to leave . i can  t bear to leave her behind and i can  t stand the idea of anyone else cuddling her but me . i know it  s fucked up and selfish but when i  m at my lowest , i really think about just drowning her or letting her go and then taking a fuck ton of xanax and crawling into my bath tub . come to the sunshine state bro . all we do is drugs in florida .

6. hahaha no , i ' m sorry ! i think i know what ' s happening . i didn ' t object to you using the term pseudoscience , but to you defining as science with shaky bases . it ' s just flat out not science of any kind , only posing as such . that ' s the distinction i was trying to make you understand . i think i might have been a bit clearer , but i ' m on the phone , so i was perhaps too curt . sorry again .

8. think about all the ways this plane could go down . fires , structural problems . you know how cheap airlines are these days , what if they ignored some maintenance or ' forgot ' to fix something ? maybe you ' ll hit a flock of birds and disable the engines . is that turbulence or is something wrong ? you ' re just sitting here , helpless .

9. i think it just depends on what country you  re getting tattooed in . in the us we tip for pretty much everything  tattoos , restaurants , etc . i know the price of my tattoos from my artist cover the drawing of custom work , supplies , and then the actual tattoo itself . i tip on top of that as an extra thank you to my artist for his work . it  s probably different for every country .
