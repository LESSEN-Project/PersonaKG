1. well not really its the size of an ak bullet so its not like getting a . digit to the chest that would turn organs to soup . kinda all depends where it hits you and if you have armor and what kind its rated for . i have a friend in the corp and he was shot in the back with a ak and didn ' t know it till someone pointed out he had a hole in his sapi carrier body armor so its all relevant to the rifle and where you ' re shot .
