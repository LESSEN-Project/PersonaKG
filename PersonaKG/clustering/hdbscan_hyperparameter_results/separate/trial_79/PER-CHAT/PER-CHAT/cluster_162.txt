1. for me , when i  m having issues i try and distract myself . i like to listen to music a lot , so i  ll listen to music and sing along with it and that calms down most of the time . when i can  t listen to music , i start reciting songs in my head and that works too .

10. i wouldn ' t mind it , but the captaincy is such a poisoned chalice that expectations will be raised unrealistically high for him and it pretty much guarantees he ' ll be the scapegoat next time we exit a tournament . i quite like him so i ' d rather the media doesn ' t destroy him .

13. i wonder if it is that when we are waiting for something we measure time against itself . in other words , when one checks the time it is like a reset  like the time before doesn ' t matter . the increments get smaller , yet feel longer . on the other hand big one , little one , take your pick when we are engaged or entertained we are not paying attention to the passage of time .
