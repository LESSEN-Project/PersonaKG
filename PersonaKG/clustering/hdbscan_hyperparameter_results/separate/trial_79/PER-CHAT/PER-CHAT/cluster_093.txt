SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 14

1. some dogs don  t like people with hats on . might just be something they aren  t used to . or a bad experience .
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

2. don ' t complain to the people in the same situation as you , and don ' t complain to your subordinates . if you have an issue , take it higher and work towards resolving it . sitting around talking to your coworkers about how much your job sucks just makes you look like a whiney , entitled prick

3. when people tell me not to worry about my flatulence problem . it ' s like they honestly don ' t realise that it ' s not actually a problem , i ' m deliberately doing them so that if i manage to shit myself i can just got home from work and take a few days off for emotional reasons .

4. i have to ask you why you don ' t look this up yourself ? you have to be on the internet to type and submit your comment so why not just do a quick google search ? one of the biggest problems in this country is that a lot of people do not research anything themselves . they simply wait for someone to present information to them . when they don ' t like the information they hear , even if it is true , they dismiss it and when they hear information they do like they accept it even if it is false . it ' s absolutely ridiculous how easily manipulated people can be .

5. i don ' t like it . i just . this whole thing is confusing . why do some people hate jews ? i don ' t understand where that ' s even coming from . that just sounds insane to me . do they just not like jewish people because hitler didn ' t ? or is there some actual reason ?
   (ID: a3811395c0f6d89e991295b692a54743e657581e)

6. i just let other people tell me what to do . i don  t like it but it  s not like i  m gonna get far on my own .
   (ID: 821feb57a838ce1b3e5f4aeb9b8e118113a7b57c)

7. i don  t get the hate . i hang out on video gaming board . it  s just people wanting to have fun like me and you
   (ID: 726c36ce13fa631676ed5053f62b0f5f7b61eb5e)

8. i have the mentality of " well i don ' t like myself so why would other people like me . this just makes me push people away . the few people that i feel comfortable talking to always remain aquaintances .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

9. yeah , i don ' t disagree to that one bit . it ' s just that if a generalization for any other race is made , people go fucking nuts . imagine if i said , white men can ' t dance . nothing wrong with that , right ? but somehow black men like fried chicken and watermelon is a no  go . i don ' t mean to start an argument , as i actually agree with you that there are some fucked up things about old white men of that generation .
   (ID: 23a788cf7874353f54f4163f0e2c16e6043d04a1)

10. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

11. this is not entirely true . it is in my case . but for the majority of people , they decide to screw around for fun and suddenly become addicted . i don ' t even have an addictive personality , i just like how drugs feel .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

12. i get what both of you are saying . i never intend for this post to get up voted so much . i was just super excited . it was my first post on reddit . but post like this is what has kept me going . the overwhelming support is awesome . and other people have encouraged me to go after the dlc . i don ' t see anything wrong with that . we play and post cause we are having fun . what ' s wrong with that ?
   (ID: d5ff87b3b0a008d93a655ee4d43e9da3b5db7984)

13. why are you asking this ? like other people said there ' s nothing wrong with it , they don ' t hurt anyone for me as long as they don ' t convince others to be gay i ' m ok with it , they ' re humans just like you and me
   (ID: 2a3d0cc7409627207d71d58affd421983020efbe)

14. it  s actually an  acquired taste   some people like it , some people don  t . just as some add hot sauce to their fries and others don  t , it  s a matter of preference .
