1. i ' m a vegetarian if i don ' t tell that to everyone around me , they will feed me something which i don ' t eat . so the reason behind vegan brag about the veganism is this . especially in india . people here are both , non  vegsome days vegsome days in week so it ' s mandatory to know the people around vegs people to stop ordering non  veg for veg . my point is clear .

3. i read people incredibly well . i can tell when you ' re lying  i usually know why . but typically it ' s unimportant  i probably don ' t care , so i ' ll only call you out when you piss me off .

4. what i ' m learning is this disease is extremely mysterious and affects everyone in a different way . my doctor told me lots of people don ' t experience the symptoms and are worse off , they can be doing damage to their esophageal lining for years and not even know it .

5. yeah . it  s hard when i  m in an assembly or some other sort of large gathering and i make a weird nose and a load of people turn their head . i don  t mind when most people ask why i make weird noises because most of them don  t know any better .

6. default . i honestly have never understood the fov setting . i know what it ' s suppose to do in theory , but i can never get over the fish eye effect high fov causes . i don ' t get how people stand it . doesn ' t really matter though , i don ' t like first person games anyway .

7. how do you judge who has fully changed in normal every day life ? i don ' t know about you , but most interactions i have with people don ' t include my genitalia in any way .

8. at this month ' s office birthday party the muckety muck ' s were talking about recycling and reclaiming garbage . i almost shared the story of my town ' s garbage man red johnson . see , ol ' red had an eye for garbage . and if he liked something being thrown out he ' d take it to the cab  which is the reason he never packed a lunch . but i stopped myself . i don ' t know these people well enough if they have the kind of sense of humor necessary to put up with my smart assery .

9. wow i know what you mean . it ' s hard for me to tell people no so i usually end up in situations that i don ' t wanna be in .
   (ID: b5942acb07bb8a74e4924ef75fa70edb4f626161)

10. first off , any sane person would know that you don ' t use tinder for that kind of stuff . i mean , smart idea , but it ' s not gonna go well . second off , the guys on tinder might go and hurt your girl . because you don ' t know what kind of people lurk on the internet like reddit . so , yes , you should be concerned and you should talk her out of it .

11. it literally is sexist i don  t know how people can deny that

12. it was my birthday and i took some of my friends to dinner at a restaurant , we were having fun , being a little loud not gonna lie , i looked over my friends shoulder and saw an elderly couple being served a cupcake with a candle in it , which is what the restaurant gives you for your birthday . i went to the front where the manager is , and told him i  d like to pay for the couple . we left before they were done eating and i never told anyone about it . i don  t know what it is but elderly people strike differently in my heart

14. i don  t have evidence , there hasn  t been a study that i know of . but what  s happening now isn  t working so it  s gotta change . as someone else suggested in the comments making the people private to media and public would be a better way then my original suggestion
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

15. i don ' t disagree . i ' m inclined to believe there was some affair seeing how terry has never publicly acknowledged it , and bridge clearly has a grudge against him , but i don ' t know how much of the story is true , and neither really does anyone except from the people involved .
   (ID: c08743855177b68f06df5b7637db6f3e62f0baff)

16. yta . you don ' t know how people are going to react to this . you could end up causing them to swerve or crash .
   (ID: 8f8e540d2085ca2ae45ad16beb12b5ba58fb5ec9)

17. most people here do not understand what  s happening . yes , it is true the government does know everything about you in terms of how many hours you worked and how much money you made , so technically they have the information there . they don  t have one thing however  your write  offs . they don  t know how much money you spend in total for gas traveling to and from your work , medication or other stuff like that . and so when you file your taxes , you include everything the irs has and the one thing they don  t  write  offs . the government may compensate you for some of your expenses .

18. exactly that , i know i ' ll get some stick as reddit is mostly people from usa . but as a non nfl fan i don ' t understand the hype . i get it ' s a final but the hype around it is amazing .
   (ID: aadd17a8d6a69666950fca3b48e30391b837e3b7)

19. people that annoy me are the ones that use acronyms as though everyone else knows what they stand for and then act as though the people that don ' t know what they are . are stupid ! ttyfaapb !
   (ID: 0e56d8a3bf928d2e85ff5b7a5a98f913d2826b00)

20. enjoy the life i ' m living even though it ' s far from being perfect . the reason i ' m saying that is that a reddit has quite a reputation of of people not happy and quite depressed when you ask people about reddit . i know it ' s not the case and i don ' t generalize but that ' s the general thinking about reddit .
