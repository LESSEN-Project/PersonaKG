3. yea i think that  s what it all comes down to at the the end of the day . i  m always looking for a quick fix or an escape or the easy way out , i need to just confront my problems . i know exactly who i wanna be , i  m just too lazy or scared to get out my comfort zone and just do it . but nobody can make the decision but me . no therapy , distractions , drugs are gonna do it for me . sorry if this is all rambling and incoherent , i  m still pretty blazed . but i think i  m starting to understand . you don  t know how much this means to me man , thanks

5. you don ' t know any adults who nurse to sleep right yikes ? only me . no just kidding ! hahaha lol . it ' s my wife who nurses of course but i ' ll tell her about the shortening thing . i don ' t think she times it though . we have tried the ferber method and she screamed for a couple hours so we stopped that . never tried extinction because we don ' t like the idea of it . i ' m glad it worked for you though that ' s awesome .

6. i do know a person who broke off a needle in their arm and just left it . years later i guess some sort of a pimple or sore developed in that area and he squeezed on it and the needle came oozing out . i don  t think you should risk it though and should see a doc .

7. tbh , i don ' t know what happened to my ring or yearbook . i rarely even think about them and was just asking myself why i even bought them . i guess the reason goes into that category along with saving our children ' s baby teeth . i do have them and have no idea what to do with them , lol .

8. i ' m no expert on the murder details , but the thing that makes me think it ' s not patsy or burke is the use of the garrote . i just don ' t think that a mom in a posh living environment i . e . not a crazed serial killer would even know to grab the paint brush to use it as a garrote . same with burke , just that he was too young to know of such evil possibilities .

9. i find this to be a very simplistic view of what is going on . you really think there would be less terrorism if the us left the middle east , and just let the terrorist rule the countries ? really ?  when they bomb our msf hospitals , they don ' t fight terrorism , they do terrorist acts . of course that is horrible , but you really think that was a plan to bomb msf hospitals rather it than being an accident ? an accident that should ' t happen nonetheless . war isn ' t easy , mistakes happen and of course everything can ' t be perfect . but you really feel more threatened because the us is here rather than not i don ' t know what to tell you other than you are delusional

10. learn how to joke and also learn that you are not the uk fanbase universe . plenty of friends down the road from me right now and we had a few that were all out of sorts with how the game went last night . i obviously don ' t think the season is over , was just playing up the fact that some of the fans i know were flipping out unnecessarily .

11. you know you don  t have to follow a guide right ? one thing about majority of the players playing this game is that they don  t bother to adapt , they just mindlessly play and when something kills them , they think it  s bullshit or the build is trash .

12. i don ' t know man . it ' s either they do mistake considering namco like to do mistake for example release dark souls dlc before release date or its 2b assets . it could be a bug fix but i don ' t think bug can take up that much space . i think maybe the unreleased edge master stuff ? or new feature . we can just hope we discover something when the download finish .
