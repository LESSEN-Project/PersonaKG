1. you can make it romantic . plus everyone enjoys it , not just the man . as a girl , i think that ' s the best vday gift . sex can be so complex and fun for all people involved .
   (ID: 65a8293b02e2268d5ad72a7f9a1078b581c3fae4)

2. people think i ' m edgy , but i ' m just reserved and dont talk to people a lot
   (ID: 82149414dce769656ec1086831bea39b2f9eb822)

3. sure it would be creepy if the guys were random strangers . but op hasn ' t specified that . it could just be people she knows . in view that , i think it ' s alright . quick to jump to conclusions aren ' t we !
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

4. if you use treat as rewards , try not to let other people just give treats for no reason . i can ' t use small treats with training anymore becuase my roommate was an idiot and would give them to my dog regardless of outcome . had to switch to a new reward system , which isnt fun with corgis because they tend to think they are smarter then us owners .

5. no you weren  t raped and it  s sad that people think what happened to you is the same as getting attacked . forget gender , you were in your house with your girlfriend , and the only reason people think is because you were tired . get real kid . your not a victim , you just need a nap .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

6. it happened during my exchange program , i used to be insanely shy around people and just hated being put on the spot . i think since there was no other way of surviving without coming out of my shell i just naturally learned to be more socially active .
   (ID: d10c10d39129e1768465d09c5c492657be31ef47)

7. a sect ? or maybe just call it by the name of the group . i think namenerds is more about names for people or characters or pets , rather than words in general . you might have better luck on another subreddit .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

8. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

9. i never meant should have joined salem ' s side . saying " wrong side " was a poor choice of words on my part . i merely meant that cinder had to finish that fight , and had to succeed . it is a tragedy that the towns people were made into obstacles on this missing . it really is . but that isn ' t cinder ' s fault anymore then it is the townspeople ' s fault .  but , logically speaking , if given the options , which side do you think most people will choose ? safety . most people i think would be willing to give up almost anything in the name of safety . nothing wrong with that in fact . that doesn ' t mean those who aspire for something greater are evil just because they value some things above safety though .
   (ID: a22b82fe301caa42c89cbd71b2e3733753f695d9)

10. no i think you raise a valid point which contributes to the discussion . people get raped and murdered every day , it ' s horrific , but just because of her status in life , this woman got a lot of media attention .
   (ID: d4912bd11a6aaa98c91794eda03e9fafdfcf5c43)

11. here again people being so racist on the others , i ' m singaporean and those words really piss me off , do you think your nation is the best ? your people is better than indonesians ? who do u think you are ? that ' s not even a joke nor sarcasm , that kind of words are pure racist just in case you dont own the knowledge . better get off from this sub , your existence doesn ' t even matter here
   (ID: e4e6a770eda3d8a5505365978baee4568affe531)

12. do you have a problem with social justice , or just a problem with the idea that people think it ' s worth fighting for ?
   (ID: c6a8a00770dbca33e06a715fba3036781d7d4c5e)

13. i think it ' s more that it was adopted by some people as a symbol of white supremacy , so now anyone making that symbol could potentially be using it to mean that rather than just a generic hand gesture
   (ID: 0c9ff5f9405b3c55ee8cd256b4c912a160643255)

14. never gotten gold but i heard lounge is just a bunch of people insulting those who got gilded . they think they  re better because they buy reddit premium for themselves .
   (ID: 26831d6557d17492ae3b0b54585b32e08055f834)

15. there ' s a reason " corporate drone " is a saying . eyes forward , yes sir . just shut off everything but your brain ' s section that stops you from telling people what you really think of them .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

16. interesting to see how a lot of people think posess is op , yet you consider it underpowered . i guess you just have to read the comments saying it ' s op to see what potential it has
   (ID: 0092767d04168a05a983237480637793d5458cba)

17. this is a little un  related but they always blame the game for dieing and it is really obnoxious . they will run around with little disregard , killed a bunch of people , then get punished for playing very " unsafe " then will rant about how the game is broken or whatever . dr . disrespect does this so much . granted it is apart of his character that he is on stream , but all the same it sets examples for these kids to think it is ok to not control their anger and break shit . just come rant on a reddit thread instead .
   (ID: b5faabfabaf04e645cf54c0d84e18989944a6d4c)

18. i have many hobbies . if you are inferring arguing with you is a hobby of mine , i can assure you it is not . i just think you ' re wrong , and you clearly are unable to handle people disagreeing with you , as evidenced by you telling me to get a new hobby .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

19. for me to really enjoy sex i have to care about the person , so emotions are a big part of it for me . i think it ' s important for both people to enjoy themselves , and enjoy pleasing the other . unemotional sex just isn ' t fun to me .
   (ID: 28ecb35c880034ee5298d0c4abb71cabdafd1e4f)

20. some would argue if a company has interviewers who get off on asking overly technical questions you ' d be better off not working there . just something to think when you choose to grill people with random unrelated  to  work algorithm questions .
