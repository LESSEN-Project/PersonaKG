1. please note  i am sorry if i sound ridiculous or well off the mark . i ' m from nrth qld , and have no real sense of what the city of adelaide is like . i am happy to not live near the heart of the city , so long as my labouring  standard job type partner can work close enough to the home , there is a nice school in the area , and there would be a doctor or hospital close enough if one of us or my kids needed emergency care . also being from the north , our threat is cyclones so i would be clueless and terrified in a fire . so i would not be the best to live in the middle of a fire threat zone etc . thanks for being patient and i do google earth the area a lot . i like the look of the suburbs in the area i circled but i ' m not sure if they are actually suburbs or if they are small communities considered " way out .

2. hell yea ! i mean i do feel bad sometimes i made it harder but it ' s like finding money on the ground . you weren ' t suppose to have it but you do . you can cry about it if you ' re that crazy or live it up . plus i ' d argue being able to play from behind or out of your comfort level is a better growth exp then smashing faces every game .

3. thanks for the recommendation face  with  rolling  eyes and you ' re welcome for doing my part to protect this planet you live on while you go on thinking it ' s so badass and edgy to be indifferent . btw remember the og point of my comment ? climate change is a fact that a lot more liberals than conservatives care about . you kinda took it on a weird tangent . idk seems like you were kinda . offended ?

4. i don ' t believe they ' re cold  tolerant . i live in usda zone 8b , and i can ' t plant them outside . how cold does is get where you live ? and what in particular do you like about their appearance that you like so much ? maybe we could find something that would substitute ?

5. i live in bulgaria and the govenment here doesnt care about shit other than money . for example they keep raising the taxes and the bills for electricity . and if you come here you can see that becouse they dont even bother fixing a single road or anything like that outside the capital . this country used to be great until capitalism took over it and fucked it in the ass .

6. well , have you ever considered that your past experience and current lifestyle is what ' s shaping your outlook right now ? i won ' t claim to be an expert but perhaps the lack of " desperate " struggling has raised your level of contentment beyond what even you would consider " normal " perhaps ? my mother came from a 3rd world country we live in the west and my dad is british and i always felt like a piece of trash whenever i visited my relatives and the little nitpicks creep into my mind . but i noticed that despite their struggles , they seem infinitely happier and more comfortable with themselves than i can honestly admit .

7. sounds like a great deal ! also it  s kind of a weird coincidence that you  re in ottawa right now cuz that  s where i live .

12. it is identity theft . it will seriously mess with your living arrangements . be prepared for some fallout , it  s all your roommates fault assuming it is what it sounds like . i couldn  t live with a roommate after that , the trust would be gone for me .

13. i see no use in unions . why should i be forced to give up part of my pay to be in an organization i have no interest in . they promote themselves kind of like politicians . i live in a right to work state also and have never had issues which i couldn ' t handle myself . if you are valuable to your employer then you will be taken care of , if you are lazy then i could see a union being of use to you .

14. fair enough . " the one that , all things being equal , i would readily choose in a heartbeat " this is why i like that i got to live with her for a year . to sort of back up your point though , the grass on my side is so brown , anything is greener . if i was the type to generally ' jump to greener shores , ' i wouldn ' t have kept my mouth shut , during that year , or the year plus after . the one who is ' relying ' on me , is the one that treats me far worse  the one with no real need to , and in fact had much to gain by befriending my wife over me , treated me much better , with nothing to gain from doing so .
