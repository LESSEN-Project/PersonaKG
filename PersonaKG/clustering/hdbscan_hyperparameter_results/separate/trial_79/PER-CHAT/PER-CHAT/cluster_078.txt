1. fuck off with the white supremacist bs . just a lame ass excuse for lazy minorities who dont wanna work not saying there aren  t lazy white people , if you want to be successful in america , if doesn  t matter who you are , if you put in the work , you can literally do anything . but hey i guess its just easier to sit at home doing jack shit and blame white people .

2. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .

3. it can . or , even of or doesn ' t , some people just want to escape what they have going on , and in that form .

4. it ' s not mind blowing but the amount of confidence you gain just by sticking to a workout routine for a while is great . used to be i wouldn ' t want to talk to people cause i thought i ' d embarrass myself but now i can actually approach people .

5. i mean , i guess what i ' m saying is that you can rant all you want . i ' m not one for advice , but i can always listen to you . i get that for some people when you ' re angry about something it ' s just nice to throw all your words out rather than just having a conversation about it . but anyways , i hope for the best of you .

7. just a quick thought , but have you spoken to the other people in your meta about whether they want to be pushed over the cusp into true cedh ? it ' s possible some are only tuning their decks as much as they are in order to keep up with other players , not because they have any real desire to play competitively .

8. i relationship is a commitment . i guess it isnt just women but people today want the benefits of the relationship without the ups and downs . also women expect to shoot a man down who has been courting them and have the dude treat them the exact same . i wouldn ' t treat anyone as well as i treat my wife .

9. you may want to play around with this idea  these gems are obviously powerful . there are many creatures in the world that want that power for their own ends , or simply just to acquire it for themselves . a powerful gem will attract interest from some people and creatures . a group of them being collected and held in the same area will attract them like a magnet . so just because your pc ' s are looking for them , doesn ' t mean there isn ' t someones else too .

10. why not write a book saying that all christians are evil and deserve to be tortured to death ? then we can go around putting it in hotels for those filthy christians to read . hopefully they will realise the error of their retarded beliefs and join us . it doesn ' t matter if our books annoy people and they deface them , we can just make more . hey , if it saves just one christian from their backwards ideology then it would have been worth it ? right ? or . we could just leave all ideological books out of hotel rooms where most people just want to have a quiet nights fucking sleep . yeah , that sounds better .

12. why would you dupe your retarded sister into voting what you want , just wrong , these people should not vote , for the safety of everyone

13. why would you want to hide your personality ? i see it as expressing your true self to people , because i have been liying to people for too long . on the other hand there is the argument that , well accourse it ' s just a hobby and that people shouldn ' t care what hobbies you have , but lets be honest , who ' s personality hasn ' t changed because of the fandom ?
