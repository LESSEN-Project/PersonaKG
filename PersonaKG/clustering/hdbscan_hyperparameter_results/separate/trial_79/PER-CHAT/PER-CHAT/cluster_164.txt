1. what do you mean by incriminating ? like you would be in legal trouble if you said it ? i don ' t hate or enjoy facebook but it can be useful . i dislike some people , and human nature , and how facebook has made being dishonest and playing to the crowd more desirable . but i still think it ' s the individual ' s fault for giving in to that .

2. what the fuck ? i wonder if these kinds of people ever take a step back to question their insanity and then go ahead and do the crazy shit anyway . or if they do question themselves , what sort of stuff do they think is too crazy and don ' t follow through .

3. really ? read the politically bigoted attitude towards roseanne in the tone of the biased words she chooses . she writes about people she clearly does not like . she even admits it in the caption . that ' s where this definition comes from . leftist writers that don ' t like or respect president trump and his supporters share her same dislike in how their pieces are written . this word has a class in this case  white americans . it has religion  christian . ethnicity  white colonial ? that ' s what i am talking about . maybe i ' m wrong , but i don ' t think so .

4. i ' m glad you refinined your point . this however does not eliminate your obvious bias . i ' m sorry that you think presenting a concise argument equates to shitting on people . seems to me you are angry and i have no idea why you would be , unless you really don ' t like your ideas challenged .

5. i think it changes for each person , which is why i don ' t think it makes sense when people talk about not " crossing the line " .
   (ID: a98df1d16d4e1204ace7856449444a3afbb80743)

6. lol . not on the topic of coltee ' s shirt , but larissa is extra annoying this episode with these cosmetic procedures . coltee ' s annoying me too . and jay and ashley . i don ' t think any of these people don ' t annoy me any more . maybe pedro .

7. when you use contraception that is " terminating something living " , i . e . , millions of sperm . of course you don ' t think that those lives are important , and certainly not as important as your convenience . it ' s very easy to decide what sacrifices other people should make .
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

8. um , it  s carried by mosquitoes , and it  s mainly a problem in tropical places around the equator where people don  t have access to the correct antibiotics or preventative measures , places like third world countries . doesn  t matter what you think , i  m not gonna try to convince stupid of the truth .
   (ID: b544676f77b629fef343fb67689e28beb14aad3a)

9. i think i  m a nice person , but i don  t let people take advantage of me nor the people i love . i become a lion if anyone hurts or is disrespectful to my loved ones

10. nah . i don  t think it  s really that big of a deal for her to go back and grab a couple of things while you are ringing up groceries as long as you  re not already done scanning and other people including you aren  t having to wait several minutes on her . on the other hand , i don  t think you were necessarily in the wrong . i mean , i understand your reasoning . if it is something that bothers you , you have the right to voice that . it  s probably something to bring up in the car on the way home or at home and not at the store , however .

11. i  m very shy and quiet offline . basic kind of  shy , innocent girl  stereotype i guess . i can  t assume what other people think of me . when i actually talk to people i tell them i don  t use social media . my twitter shows another side of me . i share what i like . and what i like is anime tiddies .

12. not if your education sucks and youre on internet to try and make others think a big penis does the job . lmao don ' t worry , most people saying this are arrogant or uneducated .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

13. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .

14. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

15. i think a lot of people who are at that point don ' t think anybody cares to listen to them , and they have thought that for so long , that it is very hard to reach out to anybody
   (ID: 4d69affb6415148eda5d5103b282ce15476169d5)

16. i agree porn isn ' t the healthiest  most ethical of things . but i don ' t think anyone has ever used the pornhub app to kill a room full of people because his penis was feeling extra tiny that week . priorities .

17. i ' m not the guy begging for karma tho , besides , you don ' t have to be a jerk about it , also , i think not even half the people here give a fuck about your 10k karma
   (ID: 4b127841179d58078b4fbc1377158cb136f3156f)

18. i don ' t mean balance as in the character meta , but in the community sense . more people are on equal footing . and yeah i agree the prices are ridiculous but unfortunately i don ' t think it ' ll change to much . i wish they would do a system like injustice where you could buy most characters for the farmable currency , but some would be event based

19. i think people that use no true scotsman fallacy to distance themselves from " extremist muslims " will generally have no problem using it again with " stupid muslims " , so don ' t expect instant deconversions from people you intend to debate . still , it may help with people on the fence , go for it .

20. i disagree with this article . i think " thank you " and " i ' m sorry " are sometime necessary acknowledgements of the fact that someone else exists   a person who has their own thoughts and feelings and things to do . i don ' t expect my kid to feel some kind of heartfelt gratitude for me getting them a glass of milk but i do expect my actions to be acknowledged with a polite " thank you " . i ' m in favor of politeness as a social norm . by telling a kid that this is a situation requiring a polite action you help instill the fact that other people matter .
