1. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?

3. kim kardashian . i dont think she has said or done anything to hate her . i think that her family have a succesfull business and know how to manage it and i never saw them make a scandal appart from kim ' s sextape . the only annoying thing is how much attention they get but thats thanks to media and people bitching for why are they famous every single day .

4. with people i know it ' s behavior because i can see it . there ' s nothing that applies overall , it ' s been specific to each couple and the individuals involved . with celebrities it has to be intuition , maybe with a dash of " no duh " thrown for the more obvious ones . the one i felt awful about was chris pratt and anna faris . they were so cute as a couple to me and then one day i random thought they didn ' t seem right together any more . i felt so bad for thinking that . within a couple months they announced their separation . come to think of it i saw amy grant and her ex husband perform together once and knew immediately that they were doomed . that was before i knew to keep those thought to myself and got an earful from the one person i mentioned it to .

5. sometimes i think that no matter how hard our life is , no matter how much we suffer or put others in pain , the people who have passed on are laughing because they know it doesn ' t matter and nothing matters in life because there ' s something else that ' s better for everyone once we pass on . as far as i know , death only affects those that are living .

6. i hate when people call women hoes . what makes you think being a " hoe " is a bad thing ? what makes a hoe ? also how do they know you ' re a hoe ?

7. putting your text in the comments could easily make people hate you    put da words in da blurbs    i think you know who said what .

8. i hate strangers touching me to begin with and i know people think that when you ' re pregnant , it ' s automatically ok to touch you . this is something i do not look forward to when i do become pregnant . i will probably wind up decking someone in the face . rub my belly means you better run .

10. you are absolutely right . the question should not have been asked , but it was . it was asked to trump . you are not going to see questions like this one asked to hillary , bernie , or cruz . the media only targets trump with these questions because they know a lot of people after hearing the answer will get emotionally irrational and start hating trump even more . think about it for a second , if i hadn ' t commented to your post you might end up walking away from all this actually thinking that trump wants to throw into prison those who get abortions .

11. i hate how people think that it ' s a woman ' s job to be the one who does housework . in a perfect relationship yes , i know there ' s no such thing both the man and woman do equal parts of the housework .
