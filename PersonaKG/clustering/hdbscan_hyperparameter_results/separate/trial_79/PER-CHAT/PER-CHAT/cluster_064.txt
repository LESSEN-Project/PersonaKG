1. not necessarily . i was answering op ' s question truthfully . i can ' t really rely on anybody except myself to get what i want , you know ? if i bring another person into that equation , they ' re going to fuck it up because they ' ll have their own problems . if there ' s one thing i don ' t need , it ' s more problems .

2. idk if it  s because she didn  t want me to get a big head or something . you know how some women are . they don  t really want to massage your ego .
   (ID: bcffb449d24a1b884f60069dd68c2fae6a2bed81)

3. if you ' re sure this is something you want to do . make constant sexual innuendos around him . touch him just platonically enough so nobody bats an eye about it , but linger just long enough for him to know that it ' s something you want . you could just straight  up tell him . i don ' t know that many men who would turn sex with a willing 16yo especially if it ' s legal where you are .

5. you don  t need to know characters sexuality to play a game . and it  s better that way because hell , they could be gay , you wouldn  t know , so you can believe what you want about them .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

6. if you don  t want to read about it , don  t click on it . there are people here who seek advice from strangers because they don  t want their friends to know . the advice is often more objective because you don  t know the person .

7. one can argue that even world conquerors don ' t really need retinues , so i wouldn ' t put lor as necessary at all . nor tog or soi for that matter , unless you really want to play as the specific groups they unlock . my ideal ck2 starter pack is way of life , the reaper ' s due and monks  mystics for the extra peacetime content ck2 is famous for . on jade dragon  i love it . the new cbs are absolutely awesome , usable on all bookmarks on all tiers in all regions . and china itself is , in my opinion i know others don ' t concur , a welcomed addition to the game that really makes me constantly check up what the hell the emperor is doing and how i can profit  not get destroyed from that .

8. i don ' t know why people don ' t talk about  drys more often . it ' s literally the next apple because my friend told me so . i invested my life savings into it so if you want to become a billionaire this is the way to go

9. it ' s hard enough to get them to help with recovering an account that all the info is known for . if you don ' t know the email address , password , or birthdate , their hands are kind of tied . there ' s no way to prove that it ' s actually your account . i mean , of course you can always try . are your pets the same ? do you remember any items you may have had , or avatar count ? maybe someone changed your info . seems unlikely that it can be recovered , but if you really want it , it can ' t hurt to see what tnt says .

10. firstly because it was a long response , and it wasn  t angry , i thought u were offended . secondly was daily in capitals i now know it was a mistake and the fact that you told me to go and get the armour myself , which would be pointless as i don  t want it
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

11. haha , you  re not , don  t worry . i didn  t expect this thread to get so popular so i keep getting notifications for it . i don  t know how to stop it ! i used to not want to bring my own lunch , but since we never really finish our dinner i might as well take it with me to school the next day .

   (ID: 9a13b21f54717da1499379b5cb0e991e82d4c90f)

15. that ' s the way i ' d go . if you don ' t want to do any of the things you already know , knowing more means options you might not have considered will open up .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

   (ID: 5f75c9b696f1ea78d1a7d21e5a6d5dd1c9391b14)
