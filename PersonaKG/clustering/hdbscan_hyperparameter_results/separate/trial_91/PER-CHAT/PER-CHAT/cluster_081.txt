1. agreed . i ' d rather watch it and listen to it in my own language . i admit some of the dubbing can sound really bad the show golden boy is the first to come to mind but i ' m not picky about a lot of it .

   (ID: 98f9b074f3fba12c7403be7000f77b6a560c5a02)

3. yeah , they do those things intentionally . in ragnarok , there are scenes in the trailer where thor has two eyes , but in the movie he has one . the trailers for iw also show thanos with only two stones in every scene , even if he has more in many of them . i actually really appreciate the effort they go to not to spoil anything .

   (ID: 25a3a19690cf520ebb090d792f9aab864cc59254)

9. the amount of shit liberty gives about older fans . if you really were an " older fan " you would remember bridgestone used this exact same system with a " soft " and " hard " tyre and it worked perfectly fine , and before that you wouldn ' t have a clue what the competing tyre companies brought to a race .
