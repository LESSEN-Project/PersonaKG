17. god i loved that scene , oddly one of my favourites in the mcu . the camerawork was incredible you just felt so grounded in the moment
   (ID: 5fa74a7d6a70c6f2f8a149864f494ac72eefd3e4)

18. just do it . meanwhile my response to almost everything that requires effort is " nah "
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

19. no , but the stereotype is filled and this movie seems to be leaning very heavily in girl power bo peep not a soft woman any more . they didn  t do that with jesse , they just introduced a great character that was female . this is forceful feminism and it  s achieving the opposite affect . that  s what he  s saying . now stop being defensive .
