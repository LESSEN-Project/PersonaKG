4. the circle thing or the fact that my cats suck ? supposedly you put a circle or square of tape on the floor and your cats will sit in the middle . seen tons of pics of it lately , so i decided to try last night . sadly my cats didn ' t want to be in the " circle " . my oldest was like , fuck you she ' s the one on the mat

6. once transhumanism and robotics happen it will get better . human with the internet still might fart and stink , but you can find out when the gran chaco war took place . technology provides opportunities if used wisely

7. you seem to have your head on straight , you want to create something of your own , really embrace your parents ' legacy . if you really feel like its the right move and you ' re excited about it than no one can stop you . however , be prepared for long nights of your own , be prepared that if you do meet a woman and you do have kids that you might put them in the same situation you are in . now thats also an exaggeration , you could completely re invent the company to where you dont even have to lift a finger and youre home with your family all the time . but that will take a very long time . its all your personal preference man , dont completely rule out a college experience and a chance to take on a different path because you might hate working digit  digit in a factory with loud machines all day . whatever you choose to do , just make sure you ' re happy and keep your options open

8. i make this reference often and feel like nobody knows what i ' m talking about
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

9. you only live once . i say ignore these folks and do what makes you happy . time is precious . if you  re unhappy , try a  trial separation  after explaining to your wife why you need it . date the other girl then weight the pros and cons of each option . at least you  ve aired what your wife is doing that makes you unhappy and are giving her a chance as well .

11. i don ' t get why this offended him . i ' d cry tears of joy if my dog talked to me this way
   (ID: b721d508c3e10f143c9836626787b26136faa266)

12. the fact that you went through the trouble to figure out where i live even though i made it clear i didn ' t want that just proves my point really . gg .

13. they do this . honestly , nothing may be wrong at all . he may not need as much communication and affection as you do . my husband does a few of these things as well . however , he is on the spectrum , and i just know it is how he is comfortable . and i ' m ok with that . that being said , if it makes you uncomfortable or unhappy , you need to come to terms with that truth and decide what you need to do to make you happy .

14. i still dreamed but it ' s like going from a old school box tv to the newest apple tv . you never knew you were dreaming in dinosaur until you don ' t dream like that anymore .
   (ID: c50abefedeeb0c19f834b1ebb28634054bccee26)

15. is it bad i chose all of the usc scenarios and digit . digit ? i think not .
   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

16. is it really that big a deal to ask to do that in a custom match or with a full party of digit ? i dont normally have much fun when we decided to all go one hero then proceed to get stomped . i don ' t think losing is all that fun and when a good digit  of my matches are that and i get penalized for leaving ? yeah it gets old .

18. your perspective on sex at your age and while in college is wise and will get you places . the last thing you want is to get a girl pregnant . hang on to your current beliefs , let everyone else throw their lives away . wait for someone who you can see yourself in a relationship with and go from there .

19. lol , you can wander around with in the sanctioned playpen of ordinary consciousness , and we have some intoxicants over here if you wanna mess your self up we  ve got some scotch here and some tobacco and red meat and some sugar and a little t . v . and so forth and so on . but , these boundary dissolving hallucinogens that give you a sense of unity with your fellow man and nature are somehow forbidden . this is an outrage ! it  s a sign of cultural immaturity and the fact that we tolerate it is a sign that we are living in a society as oppressed as any society in the past .

20. hmm . i never thought about it like that . it seems as though i ' ve been out scienced again . i guess this is what they mean when they say " scientist will admit when they ' re wrong " .
