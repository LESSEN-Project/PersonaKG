5. look up ygopro  devpro online and download it . it is a virtual version of the game , and i believe the percy client has an ai mode that you can test decks against . then i would lurk around the sub a little to see what people are playing , pick something that piques your interest , and start from there . warning  cardboard crack is an expensive and addicting habit , and devpro has cost me a fair bit of sleep after discovering it

7. i ' m curious about this too . its a lose lose situation . say some guy comes and asks for it back since you didn ' t want it . he takes it . now another bigger guy comes up to your cell after that and says where ' s my candy bar ? and you tell him you gave it to somebody else who said they gave it to you . now he ' s like i don ' t beleive you , you ate it and you are my girlfriend now . or possibility number digit . dude comes asking how you liked his gift . you politely decline it and then he gets offended you didn ' t want it . or refuses to take it back . and still makes you his girlfriend . man i ' m to small of a dude to go to prison . i need to learn how to make shanks

9. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?

10. with soccefootball there are so many players around the world , plus the transfeloan system , it makes it easy for the wealthy clubs to acquire good players . in the nba it ' s a lot more difficult , sometimes there is nothing they can do . teams like the lakers and knicks would have been relegated a few years ago , despite how big of fan bases and wealth they have .

11. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .

13. i know i ' m a bit late on this but . if you want a good book to read to disprove the bible or give you a better understanding of why lots of us aren ' t fans of it , then you got to read this one the bible turns out the best way to go about it would to just read the whole thing word for word and then think about what it actually teaches . it ' s full of horrible things that if they where to be done today , we definitely wouldn ' t want to be making a belief system based on it .

14. because when you ' re in rome you do as the romans do . unless you ' re obviously a tourist or you don ' t speak english at all , i think it ' s really rude to go out of your way to speak in a manner people around you can ' t understand . my wife does this to me in spanish when she wants to talk about someone we see while we ' re out or whatever and it annoys me to no end .

17. i love bars ands skiing . i worked at and managed a fairly successful bar for seven years and have also lived in colorado . let me rant  coat hooks . everywhere , but especially under the bar top . the bar must have a bar for your feet . while being in touch with the local brewery is rad , if you are not trying to alienate anyone have one canned macrobrew option . i love beer but after a few craft brews i just want an ice cold bud . it ' s ok to have a small menu but make sure you do what you do well . make sure the menu does not alienates non  drinkers . which is to say if its boring , generic , or if there are good vegetarian options . what ' s the outside space look like ? could you park a food truck tacos ! outside to better maximize indoor space . on space  maybe run a standing level bar around the perimeter for people to congregate and have a place to rest drinks . jukebox . not all the time but if people want to guide the energy of the environment , let them feel comfortable . mountain bars mandate a good bloody mary as well as a good margarita . don ' t fuck those up . do not make it " no ski boots " on bathrooms  i always like the urinals that go all the way to the floor because i get to pee on the floor . however when i am layered up from the cold , doing the business in a union suit gets weird and my aim isn ' t the same . these are just some of my initial thoughts . i have a wealth of ideas and even more opinions . i have dined out for almost every meal for the last decade . i enjoy dining and drinking more than anything  it is my favorite hobby . i love both the dives and the fine dining . be one thing and do it well versus trying to juggle things and not really have an image or vibe or feeling or whatever the fuck you wanna call it when people think of your joint and are like yeah that ' s the spot . good luck i want to open my own place someday .
