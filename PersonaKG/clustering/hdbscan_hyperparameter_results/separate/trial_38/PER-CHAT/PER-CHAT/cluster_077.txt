5. why does what you do in your free time have any bearing on what you do at work ? in your mind , is it impossible for someone who likes to get high to refrain from doing so at work ? if you drink beer or alcohol , how is that any different ? should having a beer at home disqualify you from driving a forklift at work the next day ? these are genuine questions .

   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

17. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .
