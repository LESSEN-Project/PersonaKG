11. great show , excited to see where this goes in a month when we get by all the obvious games starcraft , cs , ext . do have one suggestion that might already be true but has to do with twitch . could you produce this show inside the " game " category and not the " gaming talk shows " category . since this talk show is digit  just about a the single game and not a of variety game talk show . if you do it inside the " game " i would guess you would get more people checking out the live stream . twitch might have rules against this but its my idea .

20. overwatch . the game currently has too many ways to stop a player from playing  stunlock and all that . took a while for me to realize what it was about the game that was making me so angry , but i haven ' t been back since . sometimes i kinda miss it and want to go back , but then i see a play of the game or highlight that involves so much stunlock it hurts , and i decide not to .
