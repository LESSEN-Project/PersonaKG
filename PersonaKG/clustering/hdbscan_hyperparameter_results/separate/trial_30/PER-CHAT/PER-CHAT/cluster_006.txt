19. there is a reason they have only made it to pilot programs . i am not saying a guaranteed income program can ' t work , just that it has plenty of risks . most of the guaranteed income pilot programs i have heard about were run in countries with a small and primarily wealthy population that already has quite high taxes and social safety nets .
