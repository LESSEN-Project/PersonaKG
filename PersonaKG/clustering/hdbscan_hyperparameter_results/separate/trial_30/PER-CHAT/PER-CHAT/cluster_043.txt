2. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .

7. the rest of the poem is what i would call poetic . i think the piece functions with a degree of uncertainty without the last line . i think it takes away from the awesome that is this poem . after a few more readings , i might suggest dropping the punctuation but that is sort of whatever .

14. i think it ' s interesting that when they reworked dehaka they intended him to be a tank , although they list him as a bruiser . he sort of fills all these roles , but he is more based around his ability to soak lanes  global presence . he can sort of do it , but lack of reliable peel i suppose is rather limiting . the other bruisers are more clear cut rexxar  misha technically would fit also , but they are quite distinct .

16. but you  re insane to think that hitting your hand with a hammer the first , tenth , or even a hundred times will not hurt . it  s mental illness making you think there has to be a secret number of how many times you can hit your hand until it doesn  t hurt anymore
