1. you need maxed temple but i think what you ' re doing wrong is that you got the other t5 super monkeys after you got the temple . i read somewhere that you need to get them before you get the temple .

2. itt everyone has parents that yell at them for trivial things , proving that we ' re all in a matrix and a part of the hive mind

3. i wouldn ' t say that amanda punches harder . cyborg is the bigger woman , and punches pretty hard . amanda ' s punches are just faster . so by the time cyborg is extending her punches , she ' s already getting rocked by amanda . either way , you ' re right that she didn ' t fight smart . it ' s what happens when you ' re the hunted for so long , you forget to keep doing what got you to the dance .

4. just curious , is there some sort of " vesting " in the canadian system , to prevent folks from moving to canada and getting benefits from others paying into the system ? for instance do you have to live there for a period before receiving benefits ? it may be something you need to consider .

5. depends on what your needs are . if you just want a hole to dump cum in , then yeah , a sex doll will work okay . if you want anything else , then probably not .

6. why don ' t we just dump amphetamines in the water supply ? isn ' t this pretty clearly a slippery  slope fallacy ? is there a real counter  argument to the ' better living through chemistry ' idea when we ' re talking about decisions individuals and their doctors make ?

7. the fear of spiders is not something humans are born with , it is something you learn . if your parents always start screaming and crying when they see spiders , you ' ll learn to think spiders are scary . dogs also don ' t have an instinctual fear of spiders , so they would have to be taught to fear them too . most dogs aren ' t afraid of spiders , so they don ' t have a born fear of them either . but i ' ve seen dogs that are afraid of spiders , and their owners are always afraid of them too , so it seems they can learn it too .

8. i see what you mean . i have been called stuck  up because i keep to myself and sometimes have a serious expression on my face that really doesn ' t reflect what ' s going on in my head . i ' ve heard of the marco guy  he really doesn ' t have much to be stuck  up about  simply being the drug  addled son of a rich man is hardly an accomplishment . did that sound snooty ? oops !

9. not a teacher but my friend wrote " who the fuck are they " in regards to some biologists during hsc

10. watching what is happening , while they reply to our comments on here and their forum . i can ' t help but think that the money activision is forcing their hand on a lot of this . its like getting mad at a f1 driver for letting his teammate pass him on the last lap . it seems ridiculous when you ' re watching , but we don ' t hear the owner of the race team in his ear saying " if you ever want to race again , let him pass " .

11. bro , i highly doubt you can keep an actual conversation with someone that actually has a science degree  take your pretentious ass outta here . as someone in the field , i can assure you there are many individuals with engineering  medical  science degrees from several different backgrounds that have faith in a religion  same way as atheists . you  re just as bad as the bible humping pedos trying to force your perspective on others . the irony in all of this i  ll explain it for you is you baiting the op along with others even though you  re the one that was triggered and felt the need to comment and express your discomfort  that of which , was never really  forced  on you  you can always keep scrolling and living your insignificant life . adios !

12. I own a dude.

13. i have no idea about what happened to you . i can only comment on my own experiences . the staff i worked with only medicated patients at a physician request . they are the only ones that could legally prescribe . all medication drawn and administered is documented , heavily . so no one in my organization could " knock you out " simply because they thought you were a burden . it doesn ' t work that way . as for restraints , if you become a danger to yourself , staff or any other patient then for safety reasons you will be restrained . depending on the state or province the form of restraint will vary . some units will use handcuffs , others just simple velcro straps . any properly regulated hospital will ensure that restraints or even isolation units for that matter are used for positive outcome . never as a punishment . i ' m not going to say it doesn ' t happen because i know it does but for the most part in my experience things were always by the book . i can only speculate about your experience . if you did try to leave the facility and you were a level one psych patient then meds would likely be given even after restraints were placed . the number one thing is to keep you safe . if that means sedation then that ' s what ' s going to happen . maybe to get your vitals back or to help you sleep .

14. that sounds really fantastic . i had the same thing with my so , we didn ' t kiss until our third date . we ' re still together a year later , and i know we will be for the rest of our lives . it sounds like you know that , or something similar , about your new love . good on you , and i really hope it works out . thanks for posting this , it ' s nice to see something so happy and positive , especially given i ' ve been having kind of a rough time of late so aside , she ' s wonderful in every way imaginable .

15. well that ' s just peachy , you killed my variant on this that was going to be for creating convenient holes for boarding parties , you fiend .  d i really do like the idea of making a weapon that causes the universe to just go nope , and make a gigantinourmous explosion to fix the problem we just made . atoms really don ' t like being inside each other .

16. that ' s good ! when i say as an avid moviegoer , i mean that the encroaching on space maneuver would annoy me even if it was an agreed upon date just because it can be distracting  if i go to the movies , i want to watch the movie . but i ' m glad he ' s found someone . he can ' t be faulted for explicitly being told it was a date . the virtue of it being valentine ' s day though isn ' t a defense i would hold up in court though . how did you end up liking deadpool ? did you see the second one ? do you have any thoughts about once upon a deadpool ?

17. why don ' t you agree with this one ? i feel like it ' s true becouse in the end you are the master of almost every outcome of your life .

19. not the middle and not the handicap . i dont want to be in between two dumps and i dont want to take the handicap stall from someone who might need it
