2. digit of digit things i ' m thinking . like many other people nba players are likely to follow fashion trends , probably more so than your average person because they have so many eyes on them all the time , they want to look good . . or they ' re having a behind the scene bet seeing who can wear the most ridiculous glasses at postgame

5. that sounds like you have some really tense fingers , no idea what would help with that . my best guess would be to pay attention to your hand while you play and see if it gets super tense , and if so relax a bit . otherwise visiting your doctor might help

6. my jnmil ' s sister who is a way bad jnmil , once talked to me for an hour the night before my wedding about eating special k only until i started to see the " worms come out " , so like a special k cleanse . because it starves the worms . worms need meat !   . i will add this to my arsenal because god knows i ' ll have to use it .

10. i have this habit that is a hold over of my childhood years . i spit in the toilet after i ' m done using it to keep the monsters from crawling out of it . why i thought they were scared of my spit and not other bodily fluids i don ' t know . but unless i force myself not to i do it instinctively .

12. somebody tell me if i ' m wrong . but hasn ' t everyone atleast thought about it ? even if they knew they wouldn ' t do it . is it really that unnatural to not play the scenario through their head one time ?

13. jesus christ , the combination of what to search and the sub puts a nasty and probably accurate picture in my mind . this is so disgusting that i have to read the story .

14. this looks amazing !

15. different people react in different ways , dude . not everyone goes right to fight mode , and that ' s probably a good thing for humanity . the only bad thing in the video is the people doing this to her .

16. unpopular opinion but i actually don  t disagree with atm fees , as they are providing a machine for you to access cash when you need it . if you plan ahead , you can get your cash for free assuming you have an account . if truly an emergency ,  digit . digit is worth it . i have not paid a fee in digit years simply due to planning . i wish people would get this upset about taxes .

17. so you use static ip on the . machine instead of doing a dhcp reservation that seems like a headache i use static and its a horrible idea

18. oh ok i understand , but like for now at least i want a small start like let  s say digit designs you know ? but my biggest problem is that i can  t find a site that does what i want and i  m not sure who to ask if they know a good site , like i really want to do the shipping and other things by myself but it  s literally physically impossible for me to do so that  s why i need something like redbubble you know ? someone would order and they print and ship without me needing to bother with anything else other than designing .

19. that  s kinda what i thought . but i don  t understand why it  s a big deal to get one  can  t anyone sign up for one ? or is it somehow exclusive ? only for elite titties ? if so , i can see how you made it , those some l33t tittays .

20. oh yeah , don ' t get me wrong . i ' d prefer to see this kind of behavior over just ruining someone ' s day .
