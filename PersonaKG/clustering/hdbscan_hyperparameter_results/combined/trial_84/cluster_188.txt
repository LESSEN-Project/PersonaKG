   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

2. probably current patch apart from very minor changes . they rightfully so don ' t want to change the meta a lot right before such a big tourny .

3. the post clearly says the point . 400ms lights , in response to consoles extra delay with frames and guard switch makes the lights unhealthy for the game , it promotes spamming and ' lucky ' interruptions of combos . i didn ' t go from " this to that " , it ' s all apart of the discussion , if you ' re not following it don ' t comment ? and as i said before the party for lights arent consitant enough to keep up with the dmg that lights do . i mentioned orochi because his lights are nasty , you can whiddle and opponent down in digit light combo strings , let alone if you mix anything in .
