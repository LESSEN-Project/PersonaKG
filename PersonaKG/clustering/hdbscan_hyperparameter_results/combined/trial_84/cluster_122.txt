1. i was just going to say , that design must have looked so futuristic at the time . americans saw the war ending , and then saw these leaps in technology and design . i ' m sure they thought that by the year digit we ' d all be living proper george jetson style .

2. i know a bit of german history and i always associated this song with the first world war and the footage was just random results for german army digit so it is probable that there is world war digit footage in it but i did not really think of that until now

3. maybe they didn  t get around to it yet ? you can also notice some states are mentioned twice or more so it  s pretty much incomplete and i assume will expand greatly prior to end of digit as stated in the keynote .
