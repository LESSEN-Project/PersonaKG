1. that is literally the most passive aggressive thing i have ever seen . real next level shit right there .
   (ID: 5481b7a3276de2b79473c4a65d5bb2506e36d79d)

2. in what way was it clear that he had assistants feeding him information ? i ' ve never seen his live show but i know he has been under intense media scrutiny for his entire career . if he was cheating in this way i can ' t help but feel he would have been publicly busted for it .

3. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .

4. i think it is folly to claim religion or faith are at issue here . you think that without religion this person would not have done this ? the issue is humans are animals and they do some nasty shit . i watched someone set digit people on fire the other day , watched the police shoot a guy in the back and watch him bleed out , watched kids killing insects with glee while their parents watch on , seen soldiers throw puppies off cliff along with many other acts with degrees of nastyness . i don ' t think in most cases these were performed acting as gods right arm or with any religious intent . people do shit because they want to and would probably find an excuse or reasoning to justify their actions . that guy kills because of god , others kill because they play too many video games , others kill because it makes them horny . we are all missing the point . humans are nasty , disgusting pieces of shit and are all capable of horiffic things . its just some people do it where the rest of us don ' t religion or not

5. totally disagree , and frankly idk how people can agree , i mean when is it too much ? is notifying digit million people too much ? what about digit million ? why not just notify the whole planet ! digit  digit  digit we should all just be neighborhood watching for missing kids !

6. i absolutely agree . i can ' t believe we as the people simply allow ourselves to be taken advantage of like this
   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

7. are these people and their one sided twitter beefs a joke or something ? this phd person has to be satire . then there  s the troll who keeps trying to stir up stuff with rackets for attention i guess ? maddox needs better foot soldiers on social media , the cringe is unreal .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

8. hahahahaha . no buddy . telling someone words is not a threat to them . actually committing acts is a threat to them . they have shown time and time again that they are willing to actually kill people . stop fucking defending these fucks . they ' re scum . and they deserve everything that is coming to them .
   (ID: fe56409176d2a6089f323227d5b07061f851d63b)

9. yes , i can see where you are coming from and in fact , i rationally completely understand the surgeons trying to save as many lives as possible . my fear is irrational , but it ' s still how i feel .

10. i think the proper analogy would be  a person who does not post  leave home won ' t get banned  mugged . the more often you ' re outside  you post , the more chances there are that you will be considered a mark  offend a mod . the more often you go to dark alleys  sb and sv , there more you risk , as the muggers  mods are more vicious there . one can give the mugger his valuables when confronted  be civil , follow the rules , and take his lumps when he and the mods don ' t agree , and then he probably wont be beaten up  banned .   x200b  see ? i too can make up loaded analogies .   x200b  i insist that " zoat asshole , zoat hissy fit " is a childishly simplistic view of the situation . to me it looks like  zoat is more active , so is at higher risk of ban all else being equal  zoat is a bit abrasive , so this also contributes to conflicts that may occur  sv and sb mods are power tripping , sb mods more than sv ones  you seem to think zoat is in the wrong and behaves childishly , completely disregarding that mods can also power trip and behave childishly .   x200b  also , at which odds are you ready to take a bet that zoat will receive next ban before eaglejarl does ? digit  digit ? digit  digit ?

11. i  m not saying . i agree . the question being the magnitude of the offense . i myself have family that actually work on the show via union chicago teamsters so it  s not in their benefit that it gets cancelled . however , it begs the question  isn  t it strange how this guy creates an entire scenario that  s fabricated from the start albeit he quickly lost control of it and the show is not being affected ? yet , rosanne for comparison affects all the actors and crew just from a remark ? a verbal statement that cost no one nothing aside from those that decided to give her to time of day . not sure why i  m being downvoted  i asked if there was more information and all i got was  ummmmm  and  uh  s  and answering questions with questions . there  s no useful information with that .

12. remember that other one where he got the volunteer to murder stephen fry ? he also used the " anchor " and " color " concepts in that one . it think it is bullshit to suggest anyone can be persuaded in this way  as you mention , there are extensive screening and editing processes that db doesn ' t share with the audience . he just really knows how to pick em .
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

13. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .

14. this is like a criminal pointing to another criminal and saying " well he did it too "

15. even though felix constantly gets targeted by vox , wsj , and other mainstream media , he doesn  t let that effect him , he just ignores it since the articles aren  t true . he doesn  t do what makes us happy , he does what makes him happy . he helped some smaller channels get popular . so felix is truly a kind and caring youtuber
