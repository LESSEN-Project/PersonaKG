1. plenty of the extra stuff is from tolkien ' s works , and is actually why i support the existence of at least a second movie . lord of the rings is actually digit novel , divided into digit books , often published in digit parts , and erroneously called a trilogy because the movie adaptations are . book digit  the shire   rivendell . book digit  rivendell   amon hen . book digit  aragorn , gimli , legolas , gandalf , merry , and pippin ' s parts of two towers . book digit  frodo and sam ' s parts . book digit  the first group ' s parts of return of the king . book digit  frodo and sam ' s parts and the denouement . i mention this , because i compared page counts . the copy of the hobbit i own is about digit pages , and the copy of lotr takes about digit pages for each book , but at a larger page size . back to the hobbit , it ' s comparable to any of book digit  digit of lotr , in that it follows the actions of one group . but , like two towers , there ' s a whole second side of the story you won ' t hear if you just read one of books digit and digit . so if you take gandalf ' s adventures with the white council into account , you already have material comparable to any of the lotr movies . except it ' s not quite that simple . sure , by a page count , the hobbit with gandalf and the white council is comparable to any volume of lotr . but they have different writing styles . if you ' ve read both works , you ' ve probably realized that the hobbit moves much more quickly . for instance , in the writing style of lotr , i could imagine their stay at rivendell taking multiple chapters . or especially with some of the events like anything happening in mirkwood or at erebor . so yes , a lot of the " extra " material is from tolkien ' s other works . it ' s just expounding on what was happening with gandalf while he kept disappearing , drawing from other sources where tolkien explained that . and , to me , it ' s enough to justify at least the second movie .

2. by the time time traveling was invented people might not care enough to change it , it would probably be ancient history to them and not worth rewriting history as they know it .

3. interesting question , actually have given this much thought . first off , this time will be known as the english speaking era . british empire , usa , all that rot  and well into india and china doing things on the world stage   but it ' ll be by the english speakers . depending on how things go right about now , our abuse of abundance will probably be our greatest shame .
