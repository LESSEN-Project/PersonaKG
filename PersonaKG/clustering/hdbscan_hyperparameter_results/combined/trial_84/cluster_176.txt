1. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .

2. being a nice guy means you are helpful without expectations while " nice guy " is being helpful only to those you want something from . ex . you hold the door for a girl and expect her to have sex with you right there and then

4. i ' m a bit confused on what your asking but i ' m going to assume your asking can you use your vive without your monitor plugged into your gpu ? if that is what your asking idk about vive but if your pc is on and you use a rift it puts you into a launch screen type thing so if the vive has that then yeah you can .
