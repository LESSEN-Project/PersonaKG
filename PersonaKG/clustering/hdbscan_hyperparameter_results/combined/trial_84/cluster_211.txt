2. a nicotine craving only lasts for min at the time , after that you feel normal again . always remember that you just have to resist for digit min as soon as the craving beginns . and also try to avoid areas where you typically smoked or your friends do .

3. yeah i ' m really sorry dude . this is often how it happens with something prescribed . it works really well to treat a symptom , but then it turns recreational . the only way i can put this is that you have to allow yourself to suffer . i ' m not sure if you have to be absolutely miserable during your break while your throat is healing but you have to give yourself permission to feel worse before you start feeling good again . as with lots of medicines that treat the symptom well , ironically they don ' t tackle the cause . without alcohol , do whatever you can to knock yourself out . use valerian , or make a pot cookie . do whatever you can to sedate yourself and don ' t use uppers . then , when you are all healed you can use recreationally without such a large concern for your health . you do need to stop though , strep is horrendous . you have to get out of your own way .

4. it worked for me after smoking for around digit years . i haven ' t had one since fall , and i don ' t want one either . some advice . be prepared for some very vivid dreams , but they seem to subside after a while . make sure you drink plenty of water with the pill and eat something with it if you can . it can give you horrible stomach cramps if you don ' t . keep taking it even after you quit , for at least a couple of months , although you can typically taper off to one pill a day after the initial digit months . if you still feel a slight craving after the initial digit months , ask your doctor for another prescription . it gets so much easier after a couple of months . i just had a digit hour drive with an open pack of cigs sitting next to me , and i didn ' t even think about lighting up . good luck ! it ' s sooooo much better after you quit .
