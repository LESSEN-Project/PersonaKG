1. exactly the same as i do now . i do what i do because it ' s right , not for reward .

2. oh wow someone told you something so you threw years of your life away ? let me guess you didn  t work in this time frame either ! and i  m also guessing you live in a poor area to be in this position , for example i live in a place where you can easily earn  digit  and likely earn  digit plus no degree , no experience with low cost of living . i don  t think this is  something  bad that happened to you  just a result of poor decision making . luck plays a role , but not a significant one in things like these , and i am in my position in life basically entirely based on luck .

3. i think you just clearly stated the concept of a ' starter home ' that you and your spouse are doing right now . as your family and income grows , you may find that house too small and if you are able to buy a larger home , you may do so .

4. every job will do , as long as you adjust your living standards . i don ' t want to argue that living coast are way to high in the last few years . and that mini jobbers don ' t get paid enough , is also true . but thats how things are at the moment , so you have to adjust . at most places your job you doing besides beeing in school won ' t pay you an own apartment . the higher the coasts of living are in a city , the more you have to find things to cut out . get a roommate , maybe even more . just buy cheap foods that are on discount and stock them . use a bike if possible instead of public transport quit your gym and start bodyweight training shorten your shower times buy everything possible used . sadly a lot of students have to work a lot , while also balancing school life , without a fair payment . so you will just need to be really lucky with your job or you have to really cut back in your living standarts for a few years . maybe even share a room and give up your privacy . i don ' t wanna get into finding somebody helping you out with money , you probably wouldn ' t have asked if this possibility exists . hopefully we students use this unfairness as motivation to make it possible for the next generation to have a healthy work school balance and getting a fair payment .

5. the ngo i work for made me fill out a will before i moved here . i don ' t have much but my parents will divide it amongst my family . if they aren ' t around it goes to my younger sisters
   (ID: 7c3eb339580d281fcb54cb04dbb55f6921fceec5)

6. legally , yes , you would have to be paid for the hours that you worked , regardless of when you step down . typically though i mean , i don ' t know what kind of job you have you give your employer two weeks ' notice before you plan on taking your last day .
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

7. you seem to have your head on straight , you want to create something of your own , really embrace your parents ' legacy . if you really feel like its the right move and you ' re excited about it than no one can stop you . however , be prepared for long nights of your own , be prepared that if you do meet a woman and you do have kids that you might put them in the same situation you are in . now thats also an exaggeration , you could completely re invent the company to where you dont even have to lift a finger and youre home with your family all the time . but that will take a very long time . its all your personal preference man , dont completely rule out a college experience and a chance to take on a different path because you might hate working digit  digit in a factory with loud machines all day . whatever you choose to do , just make sure you ' re happy and keep your options open

8. no problem . i think if you ' re doing a long term planning and you ' re not good with investments and finance , yeah they totally worth it . but in my own opinion i ' m no expert . if you just wanna deal with your saving , then nah just invest your money in a moderately safe portfolio and take it out when you ' re done .
   (ID: 9adb5fb6fb9aeeeb65afe41002460d73817044b0)

9. also , you have to a be good at what you do , like real good and  or b be very lucky and fall into the right opportunity . i ' m guessing there ' s probably many attorneys out there who are as good or better than your grandpa and yet somehow didn ' t make the big time .

10. i believe the benefit you  re speaking of is a state benefit for your father having a disability rating from veterans affairs . here  s the criteria . go to school . nothing wrong with doing what you  re talking about with the music store but realize that  s a hard path . take a variety of classes . see what  s out there for you . you may end up going after something totally different . i always encourage people to look into nursing . is it glamorous ? no . but you can make  60k per year for digit  digit hours per week . you can even do it with a two year degree . that also gives you an income where you can start giving music lessons or working part  time at music store so you can learn the business . best of luck to you

11. it really depends on where you live . some places require behind the wheel experience prior to getting a license , and the amount varies . do you live in a city with public transportation ? do you have friends or access to uber to get around ? what about a bicycle ? i would recommend trying to calmly talk to your parents about these things . maybe let them know that you do not want to move out the day you turn digit , but you will need certain freedoms to agree to stay . please don ' t speak angrily or sound like a threat . just explain what you want and listen to their side . maybe you can get a compromise .

12. there are many alternatives to driving , and to say you can ' t afford not to drive is ridiculous unless you live outside of the city or the commute is immensely far .   x200b  biking is a great alternative , you will have to leave home a bit earlier but you can avoid the traffic so in some casesdepending on where you live it can save you quite a bit of time . obviously you need to take conditions into account but there are many snow rated bikes and clothing that people take advantage of .   x200b  public transportation is in every city and whether it be a bus or train there is a way to get from one end of the city to the next . i know it ' s easier said than done but if you can wake up a bit earlier it can save you the headache of totaling your vehicle .   x200b  again , depending on where you live there are many transportation apps like uber that are fairly reasonable and even if you just need them to get you over a certain bridge or past a certain point and you can walk the rest of the way is great .   x200b

13. i am the first in my family to go to college . i did ok but should have done much better . my dad worked to pay off my school through a small business he started . he paid until junior year when he got cancer . at that point i got loans . i came out of school with about  19k in debt . not bad but not zero . that seems like a small amount of debt but i hustled for digit years throwing everything extra i had at it . then i got married . i hated that i brought that burden on my wife . you never know what may be coming . will your car break down ? will you get  keep a job ? will you have tremendous medical needs ? you can get hit by a bus like anyone else . my advice is this . go to community college and get an associates degree as cheaply as possible . then go to college for your bachelors degree in a field you like may not love and that has some demand . if you do that you  ll never worry about a job . good luck
