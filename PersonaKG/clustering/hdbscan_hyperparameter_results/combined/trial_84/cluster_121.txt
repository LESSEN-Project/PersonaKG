1. personally i don  t understand why an asian woman like me would want to marry another asian . all that misogyny . all that cultural chauvinism . that patriarchy . it  s like marrying your brother .

2. but isn ' t this the natural thing to do ? didn ' t evolution say the " hotter " girls are the ones to survive ? just as the more tough , brute force boys are to attract the girls ? denying this almost seems the same to me as trying to convince gay people they should be straight . i ' m all in favor of promoting intelligence , but then we end up with kids that sit behind computers or grow up and sit behind desks all day at work and slowly fatten and waste away . why can ' t we promote kids to be both good looking and smart ? self  esteem is important , both in your personal hygiene  grooming habits , and in your intelligence . i agree super  model only mentality is wrong , but we need a healthy balance , not a swing shift to the other extreme of how we talk to little girls . tell them they look good and they ' re smart .

3. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .

4. well , if we accept ourselves  just as we are  then nobody should ever work out because you  re changing your body , put on make up because you  re changing your physical appearance , wear clothes because you  re covering your natural body , or change yourself in any way because if you do , you  re not accepting yourself just as you are . everyone  s perspective of self acceptance is different . some people don  t believe in getting butt lifts or boob implants , some do . regardless , people still get them . people getting packers is trans guys accepting themselves as who they are a man . hypothetically , and assuming your a male , if you were in an accident and lost your dick it  s happened to many guys , you wouldn  t do anything to help yourself feel better about the loss ? i mean , since you should just accept how you are now . i do recognize that i sound very condescending in this comment and i  m not going to deny it , i  m just trying to counter argue and use your logic against you .

5. yta . it won ' t confuse your kids . they aren ' t stupid . you can ' t use religion to be homophobic because there are many other things that aren ' t in god ' s word that you still do cutting of hair , wearing different materials , etc . as well as that the bible states various things about your wife being your slave . so you being against homosexuality is on you , not on god . if you ' re worried it ' ll make your kids gay  it won ' t . if they turn out to be gay , it ' s because of their genes . yta bigtime .
