1. i ' m not talking about that sort of camping . that ' s the proper way to camp and it still involves looking for fights so i have absolutely no problems with that at all . i ' m just referring to the people who sit in one spot for a long time hoping to catch players by surprise .

2. watching what is happening , while they reply to our comments on here and their forum . i can ' t help but think that the money activision is forcing their hand on a lot of this . its like getting mad at a f1 driver for letting his teammate pass him on the last lap . it seems ridiculous when you ' re watching , but we don ' t hear the owner of the race team in his ear saying " if you ever want to race again , let him pass " .

3. i mean sometimes if there ' s a car on fire on the road or there ' s been an accident then if someone uploads it to like their social media saying avoid the let ' s say m25 there ' s been an accident ? i mean going in and filming dead bodies and injured people isn ' t the greatest move but what if your just taking a video of something while passing by ?

5. i havent experienced this myself purely , but i got lectured by my mom ' s colleague about it . apparently robbers just hand a sticky note to the bank teller sayain , " i have a gun . give me money " and if the teller tries to resist , they will be fired because if they get hurt , that hurts the bank ' s image . usually , the teller would just give the robber  digit or so and the police would find the criminal later . so no . it is absolutely nothing like how the media portrays it .

6. thanks for explaining . i can understand employees wanting to get paid for the work they ' re doing , but that seems like a really harsh punishment for just a minute or two of time .

7. i see your point in a sense . it ' s not that they ' re being confrontational , it ' s that people come up to the camera . there are plenty of   boring   videos where nothing happens . there are also videos where people learn their rights . there are auditors i disagree with and auditors who react well to the public better than others . suspicious activity is only suspicious to the person who doesn ' t understand what ' s going on . i suggest watching a bunch of different auditors and see which ones you like best , or none at all . i really like the boring ones where nothing happens because it shows that they ' re not out there to harass people .

8. because people can sit behind a screen and not get punched in the face which is an unethical thing to do to someone who doesn  t agree with you .

9. makes me wonder why those people never injure themselves on purpose . it ' s a doctor ' s job to fix them . why would they want to take that opportunity from them ?

10. exactly . unfortunately most drivers don ' t understand that concept and too many tailgate thinking everyone should give them the right of way .
