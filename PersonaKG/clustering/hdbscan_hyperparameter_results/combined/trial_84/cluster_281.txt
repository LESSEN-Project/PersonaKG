1. this looks amazing !
   (ID: fe374743dd856c29f2117723cef01c1fdc3b3b5b)

2. hey guys , great place you ' ve got here . something struck me , and i decided i need to go ahead and grow out what i can and see where it goes . most times i ' ve had some degree of facial hair , but anything of beard caliber seemed a far off dream . then i figured , " why not " any tips ? also , and this may be an odd question . based on what you guys see here , could you link me to a picture of a beard that looks similar to how you ' d anticipate mine coming in ? just figuring since you ' ve guys seen many beards start off here , you can kind of read where it may go to a degree . edit  my plan is to let it grow at least one month , sept . 1st .
