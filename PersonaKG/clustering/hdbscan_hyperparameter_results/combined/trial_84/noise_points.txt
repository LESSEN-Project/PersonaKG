14. quora is where i got this i ' m pretty sure scott would be incredibly disturbed by the proposed strategy of size  changing to burst out of someone ' s body . i mean  by odin i thought it being okay for heroes to engage in casual mutilation was questionable but this ? from scott lang ? and you imagine him being okay with climbing up someone ' s butt ? as for messing someone up from the inside , i recall hank pym in the comics has punched a guy ' s brain up when in tiny form but he assured the thug ' s hostage when he emerged that he ' s a doctor . although probably worth noting hank is ever  so  slightly bonkers . to sum up . theoretically it ' s possible , but if you imagine scott ever doing it then you don ' t know him very well .
