Total from this dataset: 5

1. we all screw up and make mistakes . you will make more in your years of driving . just kind of put your hands up and shake them and that kind of acknowledges that you know that you were wrong . it ' s sort of a visual " sorry . he can ' t do anything with your license plate . even in the worst possible case that he could , it ' s his word against yours . it ' s not even worth his time . he probably just let the dust settle . if you ' re on the road , you have to deal with people who make mistakes and assholes alike .

2. if you just kind of brushed him off at first or just nervously laughed you ' re kind of screwed . he thinks he ' s " wearing you down " at this point . just tell him no and do not explain why . just say no . if he doesn ' t get the message , it may be time to talk to your supervisor about it .

3. don ' t try to act it was intentional or that you were serious . just laugh in a way , that indicates that you know you just did something awkward . thats how you show confidence and the ability to laugh about yourself . but you still need to stand your ground , if your awkward moment becomes a permanent joke about you . but the absolute worst thing you can do ist to become the aggressor , if you try to bring the attention to somebody else , by beeing an asshole , you show everybody your low self esteem and bad character .

4. oh man what a prison scenerio , you got punked in front of everyone , now everyone will punk you . you gotta beat his ass down 5x harder than he hit you to get back with a little extra . even if you get beat up at least you dont look like a coward . or  its just highschool and no one will remember in a few days . he was obviously trying to impress someone so it has nothing to do with you personally so you can be the bigger man and walk away , dont give him the satisfaction of retaliating . if it occurs again i would ask him why he did that . if he has a reason , try to deescalate the situation and find common ground . if hes just a dick and doesnt stop , resort to the first plan .

5. every break has to be done where both parties can see each others faces , next time youre on skype or something where you see his face , show him he ment something to you and just rip the bandaid . never ever text im breaking up with you . that will destroy a person . also make sure hes fully aware of whats going on , and explain why youre breaking up with him
