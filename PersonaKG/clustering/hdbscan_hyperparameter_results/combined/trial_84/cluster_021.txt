2. i ' m actually amazed by this . isn ' t it totally bleeding obvious that this is how you use a fire extinguisher ? do people honestly need ' training ' with this ?

6. one of my pet peeves is that here in oregon the signs say " motorcycles use extreme caution " that they can craft a sign with four words that has two mistakes  okay , one definite mistake and one iffy word choice  just makes me want to bang my head against a wall .

7. i like how they put up an " out of order " sign , just in case someone actually tries to use it .

8. depends on if they have a lazy eye . you have to avoid looking at it at all cost .
