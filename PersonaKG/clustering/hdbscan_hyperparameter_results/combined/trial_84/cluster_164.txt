1. completely misread the question thanks to day drinking lol , but yeah . i gotta tell you , having to actually try to not get taken off your feet when wrestling an digit year old pretty feels pretty weird .

2. that ' s true . i ' ve been killed while ducking as well so , you ' re right , he should ' ve been able to kill the gunner at some point even if he had been ducking .

3. this is how players get hurt . having to think to much and letting up , not doing what you would naturally do . this is more of a problem than the refs . they should just play digit  hand touch and qbs should wear red jerseys the whole year if this is how it  s gonna be . i understand the league trying to protect the qb , but this is just absolutely ridiculous now .

4. don ' t think that ' s the case . this mentions nothing about an injury here , just the marine ' s takedown and then how he was restrained . the robber was put in handcuffs , with no mention of needing medical attention .

5. i ' m confused what you ' re upset about . a gunslinger who understands how to use his class to its full effectiveness ? much like a titan putting a bubbleshield directly over a control point and sitting there with a shotgun , or titansmashing everyone at a control point ? haha , as a fellow hunter , i have to say , i ' ve tripped my own tripmine grenade and killed myself more times than i ' d like to admit golden gun gives hunters zero shields , nor does bladedancer . all they had to do was go in one of the two other entrances , double team him and he would have been gone . instead , they filed in the same door over , and over , and over again . edit  just watched the second video . derp . yeah . this is why i always roll my eyes when titans complain that hunters are op .

6. i thought you meant spy as in a russian spy or something , besides that possibly they figured he was already dead , i mean i  m pretty surprised jager survived the crash in the first place
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

7. wait i don ' t understand . did they wait until he had killed everyone or had ran out of ammo ?
   (ID: 77d0324af3e030bb9fb9365a16e870bd522fd275)

8. is it possible for a god to do something so crazy even they son ' t understand what they did ?
