1. male im not really friends with any girls , but i do know that a ton of stuff i say is a joke , and even sometimes ill give actual advice in a half joking way , its weird . something like " how about you dont please " cant think of any off the top of my head and also , yes , i hear tons of fucked up things but dont really get offended at any of it , confirming your point . . waait so are girls really that boring ?

2. being a male i ' ve never had a period so i honestly feel it would be pretty disrespectful to voice that sort of opinion towards any female as i haven ' t experienced it myself . it ' s like someone painting a wall and somebody else comes up and says your taking a long time . how do they know what it ' s like or the problems that can arise if they haven ' t got any experience of what i ' m doing ? i choose just to be supportive .

3. i agree with you . it ' s disrespectful when people say friend zoned . all you want me for is to get in my pants ? if you don ' t value my friendship then just leave .

4. i find no distinction in gender here . if they were raised crap , they will be annoying little shits . if they were raised well , they will be fine people to know .
