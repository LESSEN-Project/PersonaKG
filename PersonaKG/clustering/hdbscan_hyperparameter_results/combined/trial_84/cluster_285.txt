1. and what if those kids families were killed in the wars they now serve and the only thing they can do to survive is to take up arms . not justifying just saying

2. aw i ' m really disappointed that you took my comment out of context  this is thehandmaidstale so context is the one thing that should be assumed here . adoptive parents are real parents . i thought that went without saying especially in the context of tht . stealing someone else ' s baby because you think you deserve it more than they do is not the same as adoption ! not even close ! since my original comment was so misunderstood let me be perfectly clear . adoption is agreed to by both biological mothers  parents and adoptive parents . everyone involved wants the child to have the best life possible . biological parents typically choose adoption because they believe that adoptive parents will love and care for the child . i believe that the wives aren ' t capable of loving and caring about these children more than their actual mothers , even though they have been deemed better and more worthy . now as far as parents biological or adoptive go , no one can love you more than they can . least of all a random couple who thinks they ' re better or more worthy than you .

4. in objective reality , herding children into groups of thirty and having them close their eyes while they pretend to psychically communicate with a deity , does not do anything at all to prevent gun violence . it doesn ' t really do anything at all , period . it ' s pure political posturing and religious exploitation of children . i completely agree with this .  also in objective reality , instituting reasonable , nuanced , and tested gun control policies is strongly associated with reduced firearm  based violence , homicide , and suicide . these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . this statement is technically true , but misleading . let me quote relevant part of scott alexander ' s essay   " gun violence " is the wrong category to use here .   suppose that you went to your doctor and said " i keep having headaches in my bed at night "   your doctor says " you should sleep on the couch .   you ask your doctor " and that will solve my problem of having headaches "   your doctor says " no , it will solve your problem of having headaches in your bed "   this is a bad solution , because although the problem was phrased as " i have headaches in my bed " , the real problem is just headaches . if we get rid of bed headaches at the cost of causing exactly the same number of couch headaches , that ' s completely useless .   " gun violence " is a category much like " bed headaches . some criminologists very reasonably propose a " substitution effect "  that is , if someone wants to commit murder , they ' ll use the most convenient weapon they can get your hands on . if that weapon gets banned , they will substitute the next most convenient weapon , and so on , rather than just deciding not to commit any more murders .   so suppose there were digit , digit gun deaths in the united states . the government bans guns , it is miraculously successful , and gun deaths go down to zero . sadly , by a total coincidence there are also digit , digit more knife deaths .   this would not be a good outcome , but if we ' re looking at " gun violence " , we could hail it as a victory  " gun control reduced gun violence levels to zero ! our plan has worked ! hooray "   so if we actually want to look at effectiveness of policies , we need to be measuring something else , like the total homicide rate . another wordy essay from scott alexander in which he spends a lot of time analyzing studies of gun control efficacy and comes to the conclusion that australia  style gun control , if implemented in the us , will probably , maybe , tentatively , reduce deaths somewhat . maybe .  these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . i am not a usa citizen and second amendment is not relevant to me , actually .  when you consider objective reality , there is no argument . there is no debate , except over the details of the gun control legislation that we ' re going to enact . if scott alexander didn ' t remember to consider objective reality , then his advice isn ' t worth consideration . frankly , scott alexander ' s analysis is much more nuanced than " there is no argument " claim . there clearly is an argument , and pretending otherwise is delusional . if you have specific rebuttals of points made in the essay , i want to read them . claiming someone does not consider objective reality does not constitute a proper argument , though .   x200b

5. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

6. fuck that . women who don  t let men have an opinion on abortions but expect child support are something else . it wasn  t the immaculate conception ladies , his sperm made the baby too . i don  t know how to make this situation work for both men and women . however , simply ignoring the fathers opinion is completely unfair .

7. at all , it just teaches them to accept violence as an answer
   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

8. i think that people shouldn  t have to lie about their beliefs . i think their religious beliefs shouldn  t be mentioned at all
