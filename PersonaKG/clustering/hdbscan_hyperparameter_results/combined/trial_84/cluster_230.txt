2. happy cake day op ! but what is a cake day ? hey vsauce ! michael here . if you browse reddit often then that means you need to get a life . also it means you might be familiar with the phrase " cake day . what is it ? to know what it is we must go back all the way to when reddit was created . back in digit , reddit didn ' t exist . but you know what did ? my space . that ' s right . now if we take apart its name , it comes off as " my " , meaning the user ' s , and " space " , implying the particular space belongs to the user . now if you ' ve ever had a myspace account , if you ' ve ever stooped so low to actually make one , you will realise that while making an account , it asks for you dob . now dob could mean a lot of things , dicks of brian , death of bjork , and so on . but that ' s not what it means here . here , you see , dob stands for " date of birth " , meaning the date you were born . side note , some countries like china and japan prefer the yyyy  mm  dd format and some or perhaps only america uses mm  dd  yyyy which i think is really retarded . anyway back to the topic , the website asks for your date of birth to confirm whether you are old enough to use the website or not . granted , you could easily lie about your dob , like i did sorry mom and have some grumpy old redneck ask for you nude pictures , but for the of this video , we are going to assume you enter it correctly . okay . so now the site knows how old you are by subtracting your birth year from the current year . cool . but what does that have to do with cake days ? see , on birthdays , we tend to eat cakes . everybody likes cakes . if you don ' t then i don ' t know what ' s wrong with you but yeah everybody likes cakes . except brian . also brian has multiple dicks . anyway , on birthdays we tend to eat cake . that ' s right . now see , fast forward to digit when reddit is created . if you are here means you probably have a reddit account . i ' m not judging though , to each their own . but remember , when you were making your account , do you remember enetering your dicks of brian ? yeah . you don ' t . reddit only requires you to enter your email and username with password . see , future ! also it ' s good they are not cpoying myspace . now when you enter all these , what reddit does is that it saves the date you enter all these on . in my case it was digit feburby digit . reddit notes this date and saves it . so , by the next year , digit in my case , when feburby digit comes , i would ' ve completed one year on reddit . what comes once each year ? that ' s right , the 4th of july . oh say can you see  we ' ll sing it together later . but what else comes once every year ? that ' s right . your birthday . your reddit birthday . your " cake day " even though there are no cakes involved and all you get are fake internet points and probably a few wishes . still better than getting none on your actual birthday haha . that is all there is to cake days . a way to spread love , just for completing another year on an internet website . how lonely we people are . maybe sometime in future humanity will cease to exist . until then , let ' s celebrate all cake days we have left . and as always , thanks for watching .
