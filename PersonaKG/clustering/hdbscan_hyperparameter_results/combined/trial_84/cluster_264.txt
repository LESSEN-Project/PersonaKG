1. i completely agree . it ' s always the first game i let new players try out . everyone loves it . it ' s also the game i that i first tried that convinced me to get the vive . such a great vr experience .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

2. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .

3. that was a brilliant game . i remember playing that when it came out  2000ish ?  and thinking that video game graphics couldn ' t possibly get any better . still think that gp4 is the best f1 game ever made apart from possibly grand prix legends .
   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

4. i have not played the first game . but i hear the second one is a massive improvement over the second one . it has gotten some pretty nice reviews .
   (ID: a70e276355baaea2f732281343d3f63ea5d96365)

5. i see what you mean . i ' ve never played reach ' s multiplayer so i can ' t say much about the problems you mentioned , though they do seem pretty bad . personally my main draws were more from the single player modes , especially campaign . i thought the alien invasion story was actually quite good , since it showed how massive and powerful the covenant was , and how ill  equipped the humans really were to fight them . it was definitely more grounded and military  based than the other games , but i personally liked that sense of desperation and scale the setting gave off .

6. the whole of that series is amazing . if anything it got even better as the series progressed .
   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

7. lol ! i liked it a lot , especially the sense of isolation and vulnerability you had playing as a regular soldier rather than a spartan . it also reminded me a bit of metroid prime , which is one of my all  time favorite games .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

8. darksouls was the most challenging game i ' ve played in past decade , and imo is one of the best games ever made , so hyped they might remaster it next year . as an emotional wreck of a human being and welding a heart so deep one could say it ' s . the dark , the game and stories of the npcs really hit me hard .
   (ID: 95c90f0b7430996843a42a4f365667a13e4c2eb5)

9. strong story and a solid world is all i want , took a chance to play battlefront digit recently and while it plays well and everyone is dressed up like they ' re in star wars , it doesn ' t feel like star wars
   (ID: 95c90f0b7430996843a42a4f365667a13e4c2eb5)

10. it has significantly more edm than the first two albums but i still like it better than infamous . i ' m not sure this band will ever get back to the levels of geeving , maybe if they get a better screamer because angelo sounds pretty bad , but i can hope right ?
   (ID: 50e37e2011f73f739f76098c3c746e27b8422fd7)

11. the recap that we all deserve . honestly didn ' t like them at first . but now . my oh my i can ' t get enough of them .
   (ID: a5976f282a96c036f5e4d14957305323c9a5776d)

12. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

13. it does a good job at being a shooter , the single player is just an after thought , i really hate when games don ' t have a worthwhile single player mode to them because some weird reason most develpers probably don ' t even know but just go along with it because everyone does it . i am not a fan of multiplayer especially not online i don ' t know i just don ' t like it . so splatoon went in my opinion from interesting to it is a good concept . it is just focused on multiplayer and the single player seems to have no replay value

14. nah the only challenging monster is behemoth and it ' s only because of the weird mechanics . great game don ' t get me wrong on of my top picks of the year , but compared to mhgu that came out on the switch it just doesn ' t hold a candle to the amount of content .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

15. awaken online  catharsis . it is the only book i will give digit  digit if you like ready player one this book blows it out of the water . the charecters are better , the story is better just everything is better . the other books in the series are super good to but the first one is just . wow !
   (ID: 9e778023eda5589ac577e3789edfd900d208edf7)

16. solid picks . erased is ridiculously good , time travel isn  t a done enough genre if you ask me . attack on titan , baccano , durarara , and cowboy bebop are some of my other favs .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

17. i think the movie is better than the series mostly because the movie used the lyrics
   (ID: 2e2a44cdfc726423ec202a2fe420543af441d1ad)

18. god of war ? if you know anything about norse mythology the story is captivating . and if you don  t , just read a little about it and you  ll appreciate the game way more .

19. learndota2 though this is very old , some of them are still relevant purgegamers youtube , he has digit playlists dedicated to teaching dota digit and a series where he teaches day9 everything about dota digit . just ignore all the idiots who go out of their way to shittalk lol , most people from dota days are still butthurt that pendragon took a few ideas . drow is similar to ashe and pudge is similar to blitzcrank , frost marksman and fat hooker respectively . teemo is apparently similar to techies ? at least in the sense that they plant mines and you get reported for playing them if i ' m remembering teemo correctly . there ' s loads of thematic similarities between heroes as well if your keen on some of those . e . g . shyvana reminds me strongly of dragon knight .

20. i know it already gets a lot of love but bitlife is fun as fuck .
