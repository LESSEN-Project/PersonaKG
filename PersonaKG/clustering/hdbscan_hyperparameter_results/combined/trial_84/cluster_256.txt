1. yeah , i don ' t care of tseries vs pewdiepie either . i enjoyed his content in digit  digit , but i was like digit in digit . i agree that rewind is trash , but i also hate the memes about it . also , i stopped using youtube for almost half an year , i do not like it . i only watch simple history , geography now , armchair historian , half as interesting , seeker , allan pan , crash course , it ' s okay to be smart and others , but all of them rarely . i use reddit but i am losing a bit interest . anyways , returning to the subject , i agree with you

2. no mans sky always were a good game . you suckers just say it is  was bad because the creator overhyped it and lied about some features . blame the creator . not . the . creation . thats not just about nms , its about every fucking thing  your wife died giving birth to your child ? blame yourself for making her pregnant or dont blame anyone thats just one example . and also the game became really good after those updates . fuck you . haters gonna hate .  digit

3. judging from that much downvote and how you said sf5 is better than tekken digit automatically made your opinion invalid and as such i recommend you not to shame yourself anymore .

4. first off bud , i  ve played since alpha . secondly i didn  t say anything was over powered , you do know how to read don  t you ? they asked what we thought was the best character offensively , it  s an opinionated post , the  competitive  aspect of the subreddit has nothing to do with options or thoughts . your assumptions and negative responses are the exact reason this game is dying .

5. why people doesnt complain about egypt arc opening ? its awful , have you seen it with subtitles ? it may sound good in japanese but its awful . and if you say that its better than chase because it matches the situation then u can get your opinion and keep to you because nothing wil chage my mind . oh boy i cant even say that the only good part is when it is ending , because that oraoraoraoraora thing on the openingand the time stop part are just awful .

6. that wasn  t me who said that lol . i played the shit out of the first destiny . every dlc , did every raid , all of it . the game is absolute shit . i understand that that  s my opinion , but i truly do not get how people like that game . didn  t even waste my time buying the second one . so disappointing that bungie abandoned halo for this garbage

7. that hs nothing to do with it . nice try though . the game had no real progression . it felt like a waste of time to me . hey look everybody ! someone who is a crybaby because someone has an opinion on reddit !
