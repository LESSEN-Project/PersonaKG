1. if god dosent like to see us suffer then why does he let us suffer ? i was raised in church but once i got older i realized it wasn  t for me . i know the whole it  s part of god  s plan story but what about starving children or kids being molested ? how could that ever be part of a god  s plan ? i mean no disrespect i  m just voicing my thoughts .

2. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

3. deserving something means they ' re worthy of it . i personally don ' t think anybody is worthy of leading an entirely bad life . sure , we make mistakes that can negatively impact our lives for a period of time . however , i believe people are trying to have a good life to the best of their ability . their best may not be seen as such  for example , people who intentionally inflict harm on others . there ' s some pain they feel that is relieved by doing so . of course there are other outlets yet they don ' t know that . i also should clarify that i don ' t agree with using harm to heal personal wounds  there ' s very few i downright despise . maybe i ' m just too nice though

4. but to act like by being born you ' re entitled to anything more than life is something i ' ll argue about all day . . unless you ' re rich .

5. she is violating the child ' s body by having it torn up and sucked out of her . she is using the child ' s life as a sacrifice to her convenience . yes , slavery is always wrong . in a perfect world this wouldn ' t be a problem in the first place . but in the real world i choose the lesser of two evils . taking an innocent life to prevent your own suffering is wrong . please be intellectually honest and stop using the fringe cases as an excuse to justify the common occurrence . they are definitely worth considering , but even if they were justifiable , it doesn ' t mean the others are . i am pretty sure i have heard every reason that pro  choice advocates have for abortion . and so far , they don ' t change what i see as a very simple truth . it is always morally wrong to take an innocent human life . and , though you are free to disagree with my view on morality , i can ' t think of anything worse that one person could do to another . saving innocent life  saving bodily autonomy .

6. jesus worries about other people and died horrifically to save them . what are we doing ? why should we be comfortable ?

7. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .

8. morality ? politics ? if a woman decides she wants an abortion then she should get an abortion . it ' s none of our business . who cares about the colors of fetuses ? let ' s say you ' re a busdriver and there are digit black people and digit white people on the bus . why would you feel the need to kick digit black people off or lure digit more white people in ? who cares except for maybe people with ocd ? things are what they are .

9. many people are like that , you are even being judgmental and know  ishould ve done something  that makes much better then the rest of us

10. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .

11. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .
