1. thank you for your comment , you  ve made a lot of sense to me . it  s like a switch gets flipped whenever i begin to think about doing something for me . study , art , meditation , even my last therapy session i struggled to keep myself present and awake . having been in therapy for a year now , my therapist has only recently begun talking about dealing with my cptsd so i  ve got a long way to go . hopefully i can begin unpacking my terrible coping mechanisms soon because they really are disabling in so many ways .

2. i always wonder if my cptsd triggered my pain in the beginning . my inability to cope with anything remotely stressful whilst not dealing with past traumas maybe made my brain resort to this to get my attention and make me slow down  stop so i can recover . but then i read about how long many of you have suffered and i  m not so sure how much of it is related to my original mental health issues . it  s all a bit of a mess really , isn  t it ?

3. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .

4. i completely understand . i just imagine my inner meaner as something ridiculous or someone i disrespect  don ' t like so i can tell it as sassily as possible to shut up . sometimes goals take time . its important to remember that no matter how smol the steps are , you are taking them one day at a time , and it should be celebrated . you will get there ! i know it ! just hug your stuffies and dream big lovely  digit

5. well you  ve made it this far ! it doesn  t matter the reason you  re still moving forward , as long as there  s a reason .
