1. it just is daunting to me to have such a large population for a city , and i would hate to move into the " bad parts " unknowingly . it would be like someone moving to townsville and accidentally going to live in vincent . they . would . die .

2. i will admit i worried about that a bit when we went to new zealand for our honeymoon . saw a lot on the internet about rampant tourism being out of control , etc . it turned out to be fine . we went in the end of a shoulder season us thanksgiving and built an itinerary of all the " second best " or " less popular but great " things  for example , hiking isthmus peak instead of roy ' s peak near wanaka  spending time in wanaka instead of queenstown . never underestimate the ability of crowds to all take the same photo and go to the exact same digit places .

3. i mean if the location is good , which it sounds alright it could make sense for some people . like i agree the rules sound insane but if you have a room to rent in sf if you are willing to lower the price you can make unreasonable demands .

4. if you ' ve got everything you need in town , why not ? and nowadays with the internet , you can get anything delivered that you can ' t get in person .

5. i dont know as far as saying that cops would just let clean cut white kids go . drive through the ghetto of anywhere in my case chicago you clearly plainly see black people walking down the sidewalk smoking blunts standing on the corner of the street asking random people if they want to buy weed hanging out at gas stations asking random people if they want weed driving around with skunky smelling smoke billowing out of the windows . i think black peoples problem isnt completely racial profiling tho i do think it has alot to do with it but the fact that they arent nearly as sneaky when they break the law
