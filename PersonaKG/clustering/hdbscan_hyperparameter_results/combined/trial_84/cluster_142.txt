1. look up ygopro  devpro online and download it . it is a virtual version of the game , and i believe the percy client has an ai mode that you can test decks against . then i would lurk around the sub a little to see what people are playing , pick something that piques your interest , and start from there . warning  cardboard crack is an expensive and addicting habit , and devpro has cost me a fair bit of sleep after discovering it

2. may i ask you a favor ? could you post or upload somewhere the pages refering to the meowlotov cocktail ? i have been using it a lot laterly with palico rally and seems very effective , but i have no idea of what kind of damage is dealing and what would buff it .
