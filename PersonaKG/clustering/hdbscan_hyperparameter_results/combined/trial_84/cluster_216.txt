1. only slightly sarcastic . it annoys me when people use obscure acronyms without explanation and expects everyone else to know what they mean . this is reddit . you have a digit , digit character limit on your comment , and it ' s basic common courtesy to make your comments legible . if you ' re going to use an acronym , at the very least you should explain what it means . i honestly have no idea what those acronyms above mean . i don ' t have regular interactions with the police , i don ' t work for the police , and google is pretty shit at figuring these things out because acronyms can mean whatever you want them to mean without context .

2. yeah i agree , i kinda expected more of a  hows the internets work  kinda stuff , not  let  s laugh at conservatives who were laughing at liberals .  i get it  in the us a lot of grandmas are proper , god fearing conservatives and their email forwards and facebook tags would reflect that . but my grandma still sends me  satan thinks you won  t forward this to three people you love , jesus has faith folded  hands in you  type shit .

3. interesting that it was the phrase itself that prompted the talking  to . they need to be careful they don ' t themselves get in trouble for an attack on expressing one ' s religious beliefs . it could turn out to be a bit of a minefield .
