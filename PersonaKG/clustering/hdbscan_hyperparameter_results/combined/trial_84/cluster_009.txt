1. it  s hard to say without knowing what kind of relationship you have with your boss and how the question was delivered . on the optimistic side , perhaps he or she is genuinely interested in understanding how you like your job so improvements can be made . if you  re paranoid and  or pessimistic , you could be left wondering if it  s a subtle , passive aggressive attempt to threaten you so you work harder .

2. then the best way i can think of would be to keep your paper as far away from as possible , or tell the teacher

4. don  t assume anything . ask for clarification . in my workplace , people sometimes assume they understand a vague assignment and we wind up doing unnecessary or unwanted work because someone was too shy to ask an executive some follow up questions . please , just politely and confidently ask .
