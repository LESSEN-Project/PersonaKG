3. it ' s just crazy rng . if it was a mode where it was bo2 round wise and you got all your health back after each game then it ' d be a lot more reasonable to beat . but asking players to fight digit  digit fighters that can pop off out of nowhere since they ' re a npc and can just decide when to tech every grab and aa any jump in is just ass . it doesn ' t help that you have to watch your character do his little dance every time you ko someone . you have to do digit fights and that ' s a solid digit minutes of just sitting there waiting for loading . hell , i ' d accept the game mode as is if they just made check points for hard and extreme . have it be a random drop like the current buffs and things but make it cost double the cost of a full restore or something like that and it can only be used once . i ' m thinking of this digit ways . one is where say you get to round digit  digit and you buy the check point . if you get to round digit and lose you just go back to round digit where you bought it , like you ' re setting down a marker . or when you buy one it just lets to do the fight again if you lose but you can ' t stack retries .

4. people complain about how capcom makes this game too casual friendly and that it ' s just too easy . here they are making it so you can dp after the opponents cock is down your throat and it doesn ' t even trade but digit  just hits them even though you were slow as balls . now that you can ' t be punished for being slow but are actually rewarded for it , making this game that much easier and now everyone is happy about it . what ' s gonna be next ? digit button supers ? an option to pause online because you have to finish painting your nails ? pathetic .

5. yeah , the first week of season digit the planes were just fine to everyone , i didn ' t see a single post about how op it is until the freaking sword was realest . now the sword is gone people want to attack the planes now ? excuse me , what the fuck . i just think people doesn ' t want anything added in season digit if this is the case . whats the point of playing fortnite if you can ' t have fun and keep bitching on how everything added is ' op ' . in conclusion , plz stop this , bring back the sword , and subscribe to pewdiepie .
