1. except for my very first post where i said lgbtqwhatever , because that  s what those napoleons like to be called , please , show another one of my post , where i was arguing ? i simply stated what i strongly and firmly believe . now back to people , who like to suck dicks , being fuk in the ass , licking each other  i don  t care what they like to be called and what they think they are . they are mentally ill people to me . i could make myself more clear .

2. i haven ' t told what you can and can ' t find funny , i ' ve told you what is innapropriate to say , there ' s a difference . when i said it was a joke , you said this  " no , it ' s not . jokes are meant to be funny to more people than just you . " sure you might not be saying that i didn ' t find it funny , but you were saying that no one else finds it funny . which is wrong . you are wrong .  my actions here were mostlt for the benefit of the op . you ' re words most likely bothered them in a big way , and as well as wanting to stand up to someone behaving like you did , i also wanted to show the op that someone would stand up for them and hopefully counter how you made them feel . a person on the internet who is mature enough will understand that most people will be sarcastic when given the chance . especially since he didn ' t put a " serious " tag on his post . my comment was very much clearly a joke , made obvious by the exclamation point . the fact that you got so triggered by it just highlights your immaturity and inability to recognise jokes on the internet . you might find that this flaw , this cluelessness to social cues , is one of the reasons you were bullied .  think what you want of my actions , i feel like i did the right thing . you didn ' t do anything wrong . you are just acting like a stuck up bitch . you ' re like that one person that always takes a joke seriously , gets offended because it isn ' t a " clean joke " and complains about it while other people just laugh .  and well done for admitting you made a dick move , most people don ' t have the balls to go back and admit a mistake . no need to congratulate me on something everyone like me will do , this is just showing how naive you are . there is no mistake , there never was a single mistake . i am a dick . people like me will always admit to acting like a dick . why do you think i do the things i do ? i ' m not oblivious like you .

3. so you keep telling me , i must have really made you angry with my opinion . didn ' t know it would shake you so badly . at the point you just parrot what i say while putting crying emojis in it i would really call it a conversation .

4. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .
