1. i mean , i get it . we grow up and suddenly we ' re responsible for our own survival , when we only exist because someone else wanted us to . why do i have to get a job and pay bills and all that shitty stuff , when my parents are the ones that put me here ? don ' t know that you can really win in a court of law , and maybe you should suck it up and just deal . but i get it .

2. i ' m generally against shaming suicide because they clearly feel bad enough to kill themselves already , but if you have kids and you kill yourself you ' re no better than a someone who abandons their kids for any other reason .

3. yea , schools also do a shit job of showing what respect is . if you have to say it , you don ' t have it . pretty sure anyone can get the gist of it after that

4. but what if the person wants to be mean about it ? like to intentionally call them out ? wouldn  t it seem like the person was pushing the blame away from themself and and onto the other person ?

5. what actually happens if they think the way they did ? i mean yeah in some cases like at work , you should care what people think . but most of the time it just causes unnecessary anxiety with no real effect

6. i mean if the government told me it was to help stop a world wide war and you weren  t going to get hurt and you believed them ? bull crap jumping on a bus hurts you and other things don  t and are debatable whether it  s a bad thing . that  s why i always hated that compassion that parents like to do . theres a difference between hitting someone because they told you to and jumping in front of a buss . for example in middle school once we were allowed to walk around by a teacher in the classroom this is important and a guy was pinching me and was chasing me so i kept walking away and he kept walking faster and so i ran and got in trouble . but would you really say did i deserve to take the blame for running ? look at it from the women  s point of view . if all of society and every authority figure told you your life and that of everyone you care about is in danger and the only thing you can do to help is hand out a feather . you would do it ! you gotta understand the whole context and the thing being done and the relative morality of it . individuals are not always responsible for there actions . there are always factors involved that take away the choice .

7. can you explain why this is so bad ? if i ' m paying 20k a year to go to school my classmates shouldn ' t make it my responsibility to make sure they don ' t kill themselves .
