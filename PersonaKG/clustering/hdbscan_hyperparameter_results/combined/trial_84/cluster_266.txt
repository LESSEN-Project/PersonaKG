SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 9

1. what medium ? their website , that they own ? or the internet as a whole ? if it ' s the latter , then you grossly overestimate the reach of facebook . if it ' s the former , then you grossly misunderstand the meaning of private property . as for banning bernie sanders posts , they would have every right to do so . and if they banned trump , the same . or if they banned discussions about nascar or bob ross or apollo digit or star wars or anything else . facebook is not yours . you do not own it , nor do your opinions much matter to them . why ? because you are not the customer . the advertisers and shareholders are the customers . you and i ? we are an item on a shelf . our value ? the information we freely provide them that they then sell . why did they ban gun sales ? liability . if a madman buys a gun over facebook and shoots up a building , then the government will crawl so far up facebook ' s collective anus that they will be poking mark zuckerberg ' s brain stem . that is the last thing they want , so they are covering their asses preemptively .

2. because we leave the freedoms to the individual . some people are retarded and make poor decisions ie not paying attention in school , have kids at digit years old , or joining gangs instead of filling their time with more productive means

3. people are raised in a certain way and if everyone around you thinks that way throughout your time living there it  s really hard to be critical of that way of thinking because you  d be going against everything everyone you know believes , in short , peer pressure on a larger scale

4. i ' ve personally faced violence for being a transman more than once , and i live in a really bigoted place filled with truly awful people . i totally get where you ' re coming from  the point of my comment was actually to point of that transmen face their share of issues with being trans . most commonly , in my experience , misogyny that reduces us down to genitals and the use that men can have for them .

5. rifle training was once taught in school . they even had competitive shooting teams . firearms in america have been part of ordinary life for a long time . it is only recently that mass shootings have become a problem . the number of shootings is increasing , while the number of gun owners is going down . this suggests that guns are not the problem . so , what is the problem ? what changed ? is it a breakdown of family values ? or that we no longer teach civic duty and citizenship ? is society encouraging a sense of hopelessness , futility , and cynicism to the point that we devalue human life ? i don ' t really know what the answer is , but it appears that there is too much fighting for enough people to think about what it might be , in order to make a change .

6. in what way ? wanting to know what specific thing you think makes it shitty .

7. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .

8. this is true . i live in a pretty conservative town . it ' s also a crappy town for young people and we have one of the highest suicide rates in the whole united states . i did research on and i think according to what i found it ' s all digit we were in i think it was the top digit and i think top digit for colorado . we voted down a bill that would increase sales tax slightly so we could build a recreation center in our town cause my town really needs one cause there really is like nothing for teens yo do in my town

9. i believe that for british people complaining and grumbling about life is an important part of social bonding . it ' s a common thing that when two british people meet they will grumble about something before having any kind of in  depth social interaction . almost anything will do , the bad weather , their house , the high fuel tax , the weather etc . all british people will understand this and understand that it isn ' t really a proper complaint about society . it ' s a shared comradeship in a bitter life that favours nobody in the end . it ' s a social lubrication . a shared misery that finds common ground and a place from which to build a friendship . australians just don ' t seem to get this . brit  ' fuck me , it ' s hot here today ' australian  ' what are you complaining about ? it ' s fucking beautiful . what ' s the weather like in the uk right now ? ' brit  ' uh , yeah . i guess you are right ' australian  ' whinging pom , eh ? ' brit  ' yeah , the weather is great here . you are right ' british people use shared misery and grumbling , whether real or perceived , in order to form social bonds . this doesn ' t really exist in the same way in australia . british people are rather socially retarded on the whole so shutting off their one shared mechanism for social interaction is a great hindrance .
