1. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .

3. convenient excuses for an idiot . if they were so smart , why aren  t we deported ? so much for being superior when the people you thought were lesser , are now your equal . wait a minute y  all fought among and killed yourselves to make us lesser people equal to you ? fucking moronic wouldn  t you say ?

4. imo when you say you believe in something , you stand up for it even when it doesn ' t benefit you . if you believe in freedom , then you have to protect people ' s freedom to do things you don ' t want to do . otherwise you were lying about valuing freedom .

5. a few years ago , i was sitting in class doing my homework . the kid in front me , who at the time was my friend , turnt around and said " i think we should just nuke iran . this pissed me off , because im persian and i would prefer if my aunt wasn ' t turned into nuclear fallout . he then went on to say that the second amendment shouldn ' t apply to muslims  middle eastern people . a quick google search showed him that most of the post digit  digit terrorists were native born white people with more in common with him than me
