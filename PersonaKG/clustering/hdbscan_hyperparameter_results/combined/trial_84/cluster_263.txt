1. tending to attract attention    doing it for attention . i  m saying you are wrong because you are unilaterally defining motives for a large group of individuals without actually providing evidence other than  well i can  t think of another reason  . you are the one who made the claim that all flamboyance is for attention , you need to defend it . also , your definition of flamboyance doesn  t even serve your point . nowhere there does it talk about loudly talking about their sexual encounters . my reason for pushing he idea that is that , because you seem to be ignoring the fact that straight people literally do just as much as  flamboyant  gay guys . if your issue with it isn  t that they are gay , you need to have an issue with anyone talking about their sex lives loudly which again , straight people do not just people who are flamboyant . my point is , if people  s private conversations bother you , no matter how loud they are , don  t listen to it . whether they  re gay or straight , or male or female . it  s not a personal problem for all straight people , it  s an issue you personally seem to have . it  s also not really a double standard because loudly yelling about your sex life , regardless of sexual orientation , in a workplace is frowned upon . like i  ve said , you don  t seem to have an issue with the fact that , whether you care to admit it or not , straight people do the same thing as well , so yea , right now it does sound like your issue is with gay people .

2. well i mean if you talk shit about your family a lot then what else are your friends supposed to think ? it ' s not their family . if someone only said bad things about someone to you then you ' d probably think they ' re bad .

5. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .
