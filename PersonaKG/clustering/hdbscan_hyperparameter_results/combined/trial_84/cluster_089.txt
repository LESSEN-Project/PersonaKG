3. when i was digit i cast a line and patiently waited . about digit minutes later i feel a bite and start reeling it in . about digit seconds later an old man just rushes towards me with a knife and literally chops the line off and i see a very pissed off swan looking at me . i was also pissed to realize i didn ' t catch the huge european chub i always saw at that location . it may not be look big but at some good 50cm that bastard was on the high end of size for that species .
