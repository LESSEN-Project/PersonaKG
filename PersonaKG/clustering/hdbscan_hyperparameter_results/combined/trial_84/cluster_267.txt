1. i gotchu bro . you may be asking yourself , oh no what do i talk about ? when approaching a girl . no worries ! as another user mentioned , get on board day is a great opportunity to meet a girl that has a similar interest as you . you dont have to tell a joke or have some jaw dropping awesome first line , you can literally just ask  how long have you been into topic ?   what is your favorite thing about topic  keep in mind that not everyone will click and if it doesnt , dont tell yourself that youre bad with girls . i promise you that there are guys you could try to be friends with and it wouldnt go so well either . why ? because not everyone is going to click , i promise you that i wouldnt click or be friends with almost digit  of the guys in my classes if we tried to be friends . it  s just because people are different . so don  t get down , go out there , be confident , be yourself , and if you fail , get back up , dust yourself off , and try again ! you got this ! p . s . none of the bad interactions will matter in digit years when you  re as happy as can be with your s  o good luck bro

2. i ' ve reasoned that because christianity was my coping mechanism for such a long time i never developed a way to handle life . that ' s a really aware and mature way of looking at it . but seriously , just enjoy life . don ' t worry about the big issues for a bit , find something that ' ll make you happy and do it . go out with your friends , play a video game , do something you ' ve always wanted to do but have never done before . reality isn ' t nice , but that doesn ' t mean we have to think about it all the time .

3. im sorry they are making you feel this way man i hear you . i can relate and it fucking sucks when your own family treats you like this . how old are you ? maybe save up and move out as quickly as you can . its not permanent , youll get through it !
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

4. agreed . learning how to manage relationship conflict in early relationships is one of the most important life skills to practice at that age . i usually start with asking questions to understand why exactly the teen is upset . i then rephrase that in a way that states what the teen wants to happen , " so , you wish he saved a seat for you next to him at football games " and then suggest they tell the person and ask for the thing they want , " i want to sit next to you at the next football game . will you save me a seat " teens relationship problems often stem from difficulty verbalizing what they want to happen and expressing that need . to be fair , most adults are not so good at this either .

5. move out . do you know how many people have problems like this because they live together first ? he has no incentive to marry you . you ' re probably sleeping together and living exactly like you ' re married . so either you need to take all those privileges and perks away to motivate him or let go of being sensitive . not trying to be harsh . but you got yourself in a pickle here . honestly ask yourself if you ' re in his shoes , why should you go through the risk and trouble of getting married when you can have what you want ? why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free ? old saying

6. being treated nicely isn ' t what everyones after , some people prefer someone who ' ll challange them . whether it be intellectually or spiritually or whatever . lots of people are also still searching for what they want . someone might think they want excitment rather than someone who ' s more chilled and later find out they were wrong . there is also the possibility they just don ' t want you and thats it . idk its not an exact science . last possibility assuming you haven ' t made a definitive move on her is they think you ' d make a move if you wanted to and have given up on their end . if you think this is it , just try having a chat with them and say your piece . it ' ll happen or it won ' t but its better to have a answer i hope you enjoyed my ted talk

7. because they are angry and frustrated that things aren ' t going the way the want them to go with op . they express their frustration by slamming doors since , a constructive dialog hasn ' t happened for a long time . there have been only shouting , blaming and anger . op you should just bake some cookies and invited your roommate for some tee and talk about bettering your living situation . when you both work hard on yourself you can improve the life of yours and those around you . or just put a bucket of wood glue on top his door , heat up his door handle while he sleeps or just lock his door from outside , when he slams it again , until he has starved so much he will be sorry for his behavior and won ' t do it again .
   (ID: e5a44ccd2ce03ba23fc6a9fd527ffc5440b8088c)

8. you need to be assertive about this . the template for an assertive statement is " i feel  when you do   , and i wish you would    " in this situation you could say " i feel sad or maybe uncherished , neglected , abandoned , or lonely ? when you don ' t get to know my family , and i would like you to come to thanksgiving dinner and talk to them " please learn this and use it . it must be said calmly and conversationally without expectation of changing his behavior . you are clearly stating your emotions and the behaviour of your ideal mate . if he still refuses to change his behavior , then you should decide if you can visit your family without him for the rest of your life .

9. do you value your marriage vows ? because if you don ' t then maybe it would be better to leave your husband sooner rather than dragging out a relationship where you fundamentally disagree on some major aspects .
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

10. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

11. i mean you could just ask if he wants to hang out just the two of you , and if je suggests more friends to bring take it as a hint he doesn ' t like you like that .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

12. im gonna tell you , mate , taking your life only hurts the people around you . not one single person is thinking life would be better without you . high school is no determination factor anyway , life changes after high school and you can make life what you want it . you can start and entirely new life for yourself , you ' re moving on to how you want to impact the world . i know talking to someone isnt at the top of everyones lists when it comes to mental health but from experience , it really helps . reddit is a really good place to get your emotions out mate . there are lots of people on here with the same problems you ' re going through and we ' re trying to overcome it together . we ' re here for you , mate .

13. it  s people like you who make me realize the world isn  t completely full of assholes lol thanks for the advice .
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

14. forget about how you ' re supposed to act to be a man . just be you . for example , you ' re about to be of legal drinking age . you want a sherly temple at the bar while everyone else is doing shots and chugging beer ? fuck them . get your sherly temple and drink it with pride . trust me , it ' ll work out .
   (ID: 7c5209c3b827e0de0cd436466f80ce09b615606b)

15. what you ' re telling me sounds like he doesn ' t care and it makes you feel bad , so leave him . you deserve to be cared about . don ' t let anyone tell you what you care about isn ' t enough .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

16. " sucking it up " is a bad phrase to use imo . idk your life , but " accept " is a word that works for me . i am me , the world is the world . if you ' ve been sheltered , use every experience as a lesson that helps guide you in your journey exploring the world . going back to your bad trip , personally i think it ' s your body trying to tell you something . we have amazing , intuitive instincts that are buried within us but we ' re afraid when they try to tell us something . even if it ' s scary , you have to embrace what you feel so that you can get to know yourself a little better . baby steps are absolutely ok for this process .

17. unless you have risk factors for hiv i ' d say you might be freaking out for no reason . as someone who was a hypochondriac for a long time   and i ' m not claiming that you are   i have experience with freaking out over symptoms . for now , accept the fact that you ' re having some symptoms of " something " but also accept the fact that you are a not a medical professional and b that the symptoms you ' ve described could be a million things , digit  of which are harmless , will go away on their own , or if not are easily treatable . wait until your checkup . no use worrying about something that may be nothing . as always if you have life threatening symptoms go see a doctor right away .
   (ID: eb338cca8f5e87e4b6e5d369997ab6dbebf241c5)

18. the other comments are kind of mean . you aren ' t obligated to be friends with anyone and it doesn ' t seem like you guys are being mean to him . as long as you continue to be polite you won ' t be an asshole . i also don ' t think its clique  y to have a group of friends you regularly hang out with . i would just continue to be polite , and maybe if he keeps signing up for your breaks say that " actually his name , we usually all eat lunch together . we aren ' t asking for you to switch the time you take your break at all ! but because only x amount of people are allowed break at once , could we coordinate a little better so that i can still eat with your friend ' s names ? "

19. i figured . then you definitely owe it to yourself to back away . you are being forced down a path you dont want for yourself . danger ! danger !
   (ID: 2904e4959568457dd43970d8388e42064d7c7d34)

20. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .
