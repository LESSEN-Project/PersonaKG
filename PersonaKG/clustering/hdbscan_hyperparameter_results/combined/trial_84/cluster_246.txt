2. yea , you didnt answer the question . a drunk guy is held responsible for his actions if he is drunk and has sex with a drunk female . a drunk female cant give consent because shes not in her right mind but a drunk male is supposed to be in his right mind enough to know that the woman is too drunk to give consent . its a double standard that is ridiculous and you can down vote me all you want for it . but just answer the question , thats all i ask .
