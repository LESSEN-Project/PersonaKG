2. amping up teh st00pid , eh ? fine . wtf are you talking about with " opposites " some sort of straw man , i must surmise .  looks who ' s racist now . oh please . " no , you ' re the real racist " glenn beck ? is that you ?  so , where ' s the asian history month ? where ' s the gay history month ? where ' s the deaf history month ? women ' s history month , hispanic heritage month , american indian heritage month , and asian pacific american heritage  these are all stupid ideas . there ' s only one history . there is only one history in fact but the whole point of of such things is not the actual history but the presentation of history . the only history that people ever heard about was nearly devoid of blacks save for demeaning stereotypes . bhm was intended to bring an awareness of the missing history . actually , gay pride exists for precisely the same reason . prior to very recently , the only public images and perceptions of gays were nothing but gross caricatures .  i ' m aware that the blacks have had a hard time of it . i don ' t think that ' s relevant to this discussion . what ' s relevant is your apparent ignorance of the meta  history . the very fact that you are decrying bhm clearly shows your ignorance of that very thing .  where does it end ? when people no longer feel the need to complain about black history month , gay pride , et cetera , there will be no need for black history month and gay pride celebrations , et cetera .
