1. it depends on the quality of us and international intelligence . it ' s clear that we aren ' t sure exactly where all their military sites are , making it more difficult . either way international powers could defeat the army i imagine relatively quickly , as despite large numbers of military personnel in the nk army they lack basic supplies  equipment . they could of course do a lot of damage to south korea with their artillery , and possibly conventional forces the latter is unclear .

2. we never see the other people of the game world  they don ' t actually exist and are just artificial memories and illusions to the characters that are actually modeled . the game has an incredibly limited amount of locations , people , and things . she would have no future there except to continue living through the same experiences over and over . even besides that , we know that natsuki ' s home is not a comfortable or safe place for her . as for the matter of jobs and such , any of the dokies even monika would have the same problems with qualifications and paperwork . monika would be the least initially shocked at the transition , but i think any of them would end up being grateful to have been given the chance to make more of their lives than was allowed them within the confines of the game .

3. there probably won ' t be a ww3 in the old world , but the us has been slowly going back to isolationism , stocking up on weapons and is basically preparing to go against the whole world in my opinion . on the other hand , russia and the eu have been improving relations and are more or less dependent on each other the eu  economy quite literally depends on gazprom . also , russia has also been getting quite friendly with a lot of middle eastern and central asian countries , so it is possible that a large war breaks out , seeing as how the lines are pretty much drawn .

4. it seems rather unlikely that a full  scale war will happen . no one knows for sure of course , but north korea ' s ultimate goal is state survival beyond anything else . the us will respond to any attack with the destruction of the regime , which is something they don ' t want to deal with . the concern is that if the us strikes thousands will die , and we will be left with a major refugee crisis .
