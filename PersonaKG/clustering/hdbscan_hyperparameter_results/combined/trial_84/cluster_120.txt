1. hold on hold on hold on you are telling me that while we are probably in one of the most crucial transfer windows in the past decade that ed went on a freaking vacation for digit days ? are you fucking kidding me ? you do realise our potential targets could have slipped through our fingers while you were burning your balls in the sun . get us a freaking dof that works his ass off during transfer window and enjoys some vacation when it ' s all done after all . no wonder ole looked a bit sad when asked about transfers . he ' s busting his ass off to get something going while the boss is slurping margaritas . we needed players to be part of preseason but guess since you have digit understand of football go enjoy your fucking vacation ed . sorry rent over . please continue to your usual muppet duties .
