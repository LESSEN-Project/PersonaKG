4. the crux of the authors ' argument is two  parted  digit physicians coerced women in high  risk pregnancies to receive long  term treatment and health monitoring in healthcare facilities so that the patients could be more closely monitored and digit physicians coerced women in high  risk pregnancies to obtain abortions . the implication is that cuban physicians purposefully conspired to commit acts described in  digit and  digit in order to artificially inflate infant mortality and maternal mortality figures . committing acts  digit and  digit are common practice in the u . s . and in most circumstances fall within the bounds of the standard of care . so what ' s the issue here ? cuban doctors provided safe , high  quality , and dignified healthcare to their countrywomen ? nowhere in the paper do the authors state who the primary actors were in this conspiracy nor do they attempt to establish intent , let alone attempt to establish causality . major red flags  medical literature is always behind a paywall ! this one just happens to be free to the public . why ? the primary author is vincent geloso who ' s an economist from lse . economists are the high  priestess of capitalism , doubly true for the ones from lse . the paper is co  authored by dr . gilbert g . berdine who is on faculty at the free market institute at texas tech . the second co  author is benjamin powell , a director at the free market institute who ' s written such books as ' socialism sucks ' . these guys are hardly unbiased , they ' re committed to the preservation and perpetuation of capitalism . it ' s safe to say this group of authors are anticommunist propagandists . including the references page , the paper is digit pages long ! that ' s quite the thesis to support in a mere digit pages . most of the institutions we tend to abhor in this sub like the world bank , un , who and others have lots of readily available data on this topic in case you need it . the data will demonstrate a near opposite view of the paper in question .

5. digit he didn  t make another post about all religions digit he can have whatever views he wants to have , just as i can call out a potential inconsistency in the view . why the fuck do you even care anyway ? do you disagree with my point ? or do you just have some ridiculous need to argue about absolutely nothing .
