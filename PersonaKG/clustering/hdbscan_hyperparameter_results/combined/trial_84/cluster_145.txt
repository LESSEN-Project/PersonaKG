   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

2. if you do shell mid air you can do an air blast . the jab also has a lot of mount damage , like digit . you can mount most monsters once with just one jab solo .

3. can ' t use price tho . what would you do when a card swings up over the threshold ? everyone has to check prices every time they want to play ? what if it goes over  digit between rounds ? you get my drift there .

4. yeah that  s true , not as many people are getting third party tests for sarms like they do for gear . i just wish we had some sort of better system

5. if you watch some higher level play like diamond  masters they do some crazy long combos . once you get your windows the other guy better watch out becasue you can digit to digit them in a digit second combo string .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)

6. i let my players choose how they do it . digit  of the time they roll
   (ID: 4220698c420fc0ae5858bf747f40efb2251b9ed8)

7. the human capability of it being reactable is irrelevant as this works for me like a good digit  of the time . not to mention the tons of mix  ups you can use to feed into thoes lights , mid  combo
   (ID: ef2135d90df57b27df5e96791848d8d9201afd29)

8. i was a little sad when i realized the " gunsmith " doesn ' t actually do any gunsmith  ing . i want to be able to change out sights , get trigger jobs , larger magazines and put a suppressor on my thorn for when my hunter is invisible .
