2. i dont get the relation of your question with your text . are you asking that practising to get digit headshots per day is too much ? well if you rly have the time to get 1000headshots sure why not . as states in other posts hs only isnt rly the best way to practise .

3. full half tab will make you microtrip and it  s not all that fun a full tab will get you there for sure but if you can take digit i  d suggest it
