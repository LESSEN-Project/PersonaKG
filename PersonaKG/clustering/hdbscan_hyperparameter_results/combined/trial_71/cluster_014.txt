1. not sure about these specific parts , but something i always bear in mind is that official accessories hold their resale value far better than any third party parts do . if you do end up selling on your kit , it ' ll be a lot easier to sell it with the official grip .

   (ID: b5f9b695867ef3b560a4fe7610f75e43b62809f6)

4. nice list though duplicating some of the requests earlier to the normal maps app . i  m sure if they bring them then they  ll bring it to both this one and the maps app . on another note , i recently submitted most of this feedback to not just the apple feedback site , but also to eddy cue as he  s the svp of maps among many other things . you might wanna do so too so it likely gets better prioritized as imho few from the teams read our postings here .
