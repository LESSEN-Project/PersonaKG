6. yeah i was reading his post and was unable to even answer what the third perk on a shotgun was . he first said it was two shot and then anti armour and then digit  strength which i don  t think is even possible . he should be reported to mods but in my experience they dont do shit anyway

8. well  known fact that devs pay attention to this sub  where did you learn that well known fact ? we get bugs posted here and fixed within hours when they weren ' t submitted to the official forums . also big hint valve employees commenting on reddit posts about the state of upcoming changes  bug fixes  explanations about seemingly random changes .  how would it be more convenient for the patch team to sift through endless shitposts to find bug reports instead of reading them in a dedicated forum . logic ? because they obviously don ' t " sift through " reddit posts looking for bugs . they check reddit , and if they see a bug post then they check it , or don ' t see a bug post then leave reddit . it is more convenient because reddit has a much higher userbase and so they get a higher sample of issues from looking at comments and can help figure out what causes the issue . all this took less than digit seconds for me to think of so . logic ?

9. i know that anything i post here generally stays at digit upvotes , if you do want upvotes and often more comments on your pics post in penis or cock , maybe even mangonewild .

10. fuck them . even the ones who post spoilers without context . even if you post that meme , i don ' t want to go in the cinema expecting those things .
