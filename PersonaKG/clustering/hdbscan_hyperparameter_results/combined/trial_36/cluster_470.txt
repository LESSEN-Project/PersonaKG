1. fuck you skinny bitches are fucking ugly if you don ' t have a little meat on your bones then you ' re probably a skank that thinks you can get anything in life just because of your slutty looks but you don ' t hear fat people talking shit about you why don ' t you just go slit your skinny fucking wrist motherfucker

2. these people are the definition of selfish . they don ' t think anything about their grandchildren , because they don ' t give a shit about them . they care purely for themselves .

5. i just don ' t see how you are allowing yourself to go through the torture of bible camp . maybe you don ' t think it so bad , but i cringe of the even thinking about being forced to go to a place where i ' m surrounded by people who have completely different ideologies as i .

6. while you are correct that i lack empathy , i am not a  nice guy  at all . just courteous . i don  t understand people who aren  t . and aren  t you a dude ? didn  t you just ask me if i smile at dudes in public too ? i give basically anyone who makes eye contact with me a quick smile . if they don  t return it , fine . if they actively attempt to be nasty back , i think they have some kind of problem . regardless of gender .

7. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?

8. what the fuck ? i wonder if these kinds of people ever take a step back to question their insanity and then go ahead and do the crazy shit anyway . or if they do question themselves , what sort of stuff do they think is too crazy and don ' t follow through .
