2. hey man you do you , but your story makes me feel a lot better about taking a quick sniff and then putting them back . haha . i felt really guilty about it and never let myself do stuff like that again .

3. something that relates to a talent or a goal of theirs , especially if it ' s a little bit beyond them . for example , if they like drawing , get them some really nice pens or paper , so they feel both validated in their craft but also inspired to do more .

4. how are you ? well , now that you ask my hemorrhoids are acting up again and i feel really constipated today . so when i leave the room it is probably to take a shit .
