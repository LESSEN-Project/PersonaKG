1. the end of star wars a new hope . they all get their medals and stand there looking at other for a few minutes and then han says , " hey kid , let ' s get out of these fancy duds and go get a beer or something . " they head to the locker room and then wander around the base looking for a place that sells tacos and coronas .

2. had pretty much the same experience on switch with the new update and it ' s especially infuriating that i can ' t unlock the gunslinger due to crashing and bugs almost unlocked him twice as well . game crashes each floor when trying to unlock the gunslinger and carrot blasphemy ' s hitbox seems to be massive when i ' m facing left . hope they fix this stuff soon although i don ' t mind having a massive hitbox for blasphemy even if it is a bug .
