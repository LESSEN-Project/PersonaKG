2. so this h happened like a year or two ago but it still bothers me  so i was laying in my bed with my phone and headphones in . i quickly turn my head to the side and through the corner of my eye i see a really skinny shoulder and kind of a face . i turn back and it was gone . it couldn ' t have been a family member because no one in the house at the time had that kind of body . still creeps me out
