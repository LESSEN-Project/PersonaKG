1. cam you just tame a wild animal and claim it , or is there some sort of process to have ownership of it ?
   (ID: 7d84a169d4ddae2aee36640f218ff2b5b534792d)

2. rip but that  s okay , my advice is have a look into some business . not school business but just start making something and selling it . i am now digit and when i was digit i managed to make myself  digit within a year making and selling protein balls . i  ve only stopped since cause i paralysed myself and been busy and exhausted to do it .

   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

6. people are seldom rational about their sexuality . the flip side is that being in a relationship is so socialized into people from an early age that they fail to recognize that it  s an active decision that you need to make with another person and then participate in , the latter involving a continuous renewal of  wanting it  . you can look at others and feel sexually charged ! that  s human , but failing to recognize the decision you  ve made to be in a relationship is an active process is something that a lot of people end up screwing up . it  s not to make it sound like a chore ! certainly too there are other configurations of and agreements to relationships , but the primary recognition , as far as i  m concerned , is that you have to be an adult and responsible for making a choice to be in it . otherwise , why bother ?
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)

   (ID: 4a03851d25b2526583af78261bff2af13796094e)

8. out of interest do you think you should be able to send anything you want to anyone else ? if not where do you draw the line ? i think almost everyone can agree that threats of violence should not be protected under freedom of speech . that said , thank you for offering your take on this , it was very informative .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

9. i ' ve recently decided to tackle my hoarding tendencies and purge my house of the stuff i ' ve kept most of my life that i thought i would use  look back on fondly . i ' m digit , so it ' s about digit years worth of stuff . reading old journals , notes to people , " poems " so bad i can ' t even consider it poetry , and looking at things i thought were cool , i want to die of embarrassment just from reading  seeing them . all i can think is " people let me be like this , i showed these to people , i sent these to boys i had crushes on , why ? " i want to burn it so there ' s never the chance of anyone finding it in a landfill , that ' s how bad it is . on the other hand , i have found some things  pictures i kept from other people and i want to send them to them so they can feel the cringe , too , and maybe we can have a good laugh about it .
   (ID: 28ecb35c880034ee5298d0c4abb71cabdafd1e4f)

10. do people who smell bad really get pulled out of places ? i  ve never heard that before . how would you propose keeping it out of social settings without legislating it then , if you don  t want to make those actions illegal .
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

11. truthfully i  ve had a bullet on my dresser tucked away in the corner of the mirror for years . . i see it every day . and then i think no fuck that . i can do this . maybe someone out in this fucked up world will smile bc of me today . maybe i can change the world for the better even if it  s just holding the door open for someone or making them laugh . don  t give in . decide to make this cruel world a little less cruel instead .

   (ID: 337350fc54133b327ce0d6d9f385f82a2a6738cf)

15. i  m sober too and sometimes say politely  i  m sober  when someone offers me a drink and i  m trying to head off or end a conversation about why i don  t want a drink  prevent a future offer . sometimes people don  t take  no thank you , i don  t drink .  as a full answer without follow up questions which i may not be opening to answering . i  ve had many first dates where i  ve had to say i  m a recovering alcoholic to get people to stop questioning me about why i don  t drink . for the record i  m not saying op was going to question her thusly or that the coworker was polite , but , just that  i  m sober  can have a more valid , less self righteous context versus a simple  no , thank you .  .

19. you ' re making this hard for me aren ' t you . i fear going to a therapist . my dad thinks that i am just an ungrateful teenager that thinks i can have anything . i had cuts on the wrong side of my wrist because i feared death for some reason and wanted to get used to the pain so i could end it finally but unfortunately my dad found out and that was the most terrible experience in my life . i just feared to do something . he was mad at me but also calm . still asking me questions . i won ' t seek help . i ' ll be alive but . " just an empty shell walking around " and i ' m fine with it kinda . i . guess . yeah listen . it ' s kinda simply to say to listen to advices . i tried to do the same . force her to listen to me so she would feel better and won ' t end it . i ' ve got no proof that i saved her but i believe her .
