7. romney allowed some folks to take his money and turn it into more money for him , and that qualifies as work ? yes , as a matter of fact i think our country would be doing a lot better if we elected people with janitorial experience to national office .

9. i used to work as a gas agent , until medical meant i couldn ' t do it any more . one of the major aspects of my job was delivering 45kg bottles . this is less dangerous than most people think it is . i can even surmise , that the reason they are doing this , is that there is not enough pressure in the gas bottle for it to run . there are two ways to add pressure . direct heat . or compressed air . direct heat is the less likely to kill you option of those two . the real question is whether they have the taps open or not . if they dont , the pressure release valve will pop and then that gas will ignite and basically create a flamethrower .
