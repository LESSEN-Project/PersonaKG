1. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .

2. try to waste their time as much as possible by pretending you don ' t understand what they are talking  asking about

5. depends on their costs . at first , probably  but it ' s only a matter of time for a dentist to start advertising how much cheaper this new method is . one man could drive a dozen dentists out of a job easily , if this meets sensationalized expectations .

6. my mom says ,  it  s because you  re on that game all the time .  while that  s partially a factor , i  m on the game so i don  t go into mental breakdowns every night

7. yeah it ' s annoying but over time it does get better . it will always be there but you get used to it . i don ' t worry about it much nowadays . if i ever get a flare up or more pain than usual i do the exercises over a week or two and it settles down again .

8. a clear  cut answer to that would be great . i don ' t think one exists . the correct information has been out a long time .

9. if i have to go someplace new for some sort of obligation , i don ' t mind a long  ish drive . it gives me time to get mentally ready .

10. i know that they typically stay on the ballot for their old job , but do they actually campaign for the old job and the new job at the same time ? this is normal ?
