10. everyone  s there to improve , most people who know this aren  t paying attention to anyone else and most likely enjoy seeing other people there to better themselves . imo anyone who shames other people for trying to do that is just an asshole

11. when people touch your stuff . it happens too often that people just pick up my backpack and throw it on my lab instead of asking to free the seat next to me . and for some reason its always women who do that , guys always ask
