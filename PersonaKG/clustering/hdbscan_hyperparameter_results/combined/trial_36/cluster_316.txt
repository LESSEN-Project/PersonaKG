2. well , if you stand under the wrong tree a pissed off drop bear might get you , but a snake will only strike at you if you startle it when close enough that it doesn ' t feel like it can get away  like if you ' re crashing through the bush chasing one or two terrified people . i ' d be at least a little concerned , but then , i ' m not a murderer . if i was a victim , i ' d take the chance of a snake bite and leg it at the first opportunity . i save my ' everything in australia will murder you ! ' stories for my kiwi husband and friends  it makes me look like a badass when i tell them about how i killed an eastern brown with a shovel or found a redback in my bed .

3. that sounds nice . no i haven  t but i may . i tend to get into my head a lot , and lemme tell ya . my brain fucken hates me . my head is an asshole to me and convinced me that everything i do is pointless and meaningless . no one gives a shit . etc . idk i feel like if i do volunteer the same will come of it . the main reason i like seeing movies with friends so much is because i can kinda forget myself ? if that makes sense . idk . i will probably look into it but i  m not expecting a ton
