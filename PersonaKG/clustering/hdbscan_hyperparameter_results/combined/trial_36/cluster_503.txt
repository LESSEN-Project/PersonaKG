4. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .

5. at least you can play it . every time i join an ongoing match , my screen just stays black , i can hear everything , i can move , can shoot but i can ' t see anything . but yeah , the introduction is kind of " lagged " .

6. it  s true that it is kinda a waste of time anyway , the problem is that instead of having fun wasting my time i just get depressed

8. thanks . this actually makes sense to me . we actually leave ours out all the time and it just confused me why if we never wrap the chord up it gets messy
   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

9. sometimes when i type " just a sec " i mistyped and write " just a sex " awkward answers when there ' s time that passes until i realize what i said .
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

10. even in this sub . last time some dude stole a pic with the oops tag on it the entire sub ripped on that dude so bad . all memes should have a mark somewhere imo just to give credit where credit is due .
   (ID: 97f042c151ad751b2811d75ae69fd7feae42ed77)

11. every time i get used it ' s just another masturbatory story to me . who ' s next ?
