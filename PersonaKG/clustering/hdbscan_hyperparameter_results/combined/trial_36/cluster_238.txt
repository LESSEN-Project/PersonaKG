Total from this dataset: 6

1. the photos are photos of my kid and the boyfriend eg my kid going down a slide on his lap etc . i can see why she values the photos  but i think it is unnecessary to share them in this context as the only people in this group chat who these photos are of any relevance to is herself . nobody else in the group chat even knows the bloke except my in laws who have met him once or twice .
