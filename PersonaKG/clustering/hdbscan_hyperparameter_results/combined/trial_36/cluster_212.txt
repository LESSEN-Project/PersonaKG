1. little mom and pop run by their also drug addict son who would take anything from me to sell online  to his friends . even the stuff that was obviously stolen  illegal to sell to pawnshops that he ' d keep off record once i started going regularly . i got stiffed on a lot of the prices but he was the only one that would take some stuff so it was better than nothing

2. i bloody love barcelona  my favourite european city by a mile . i never , ever get bored of going there . the first thing i do when i get home is book my flight back again . it takes a special city to be equally amazing on a wet tuesday morning in february as a friday night in july  barcelona is the one that does it for me . never have got my head around catalan though !

3. some of that stuff looks great but i ' m not sure it ' s all going to fit in a 30l rucksack like the one you ' ve linked . you ' ve got at least 60l of items by my estimation , and it will be very heavy to carry once you include water bottles .
