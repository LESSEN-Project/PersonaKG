2. well a ton of socially anxious people think of similar shit like this that happened years and ages ago so just add it to the end of the queue .

3. i think they ' re just not putting up with people ' s shit anymore . at this point it ' s like " i am who i am some fuck you if you don ' t like it ! " they just people to stop treating them like shit for it .

4. other family members watched all of it , so i ' d be in the room through most of it . i think early on i just decided it wasn ' t for me . i get why people like it but it was marmite to me .

5. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .

6. i have the mentality of " well i don ' t like myself so why would other people like me . this just makes me push people away . the few people that i feel comfortable talking to always remain aquaintances .

7. some dogs don  t like people with hats on . might just be something they aren  t used to . or a bad experience .
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

8. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .
