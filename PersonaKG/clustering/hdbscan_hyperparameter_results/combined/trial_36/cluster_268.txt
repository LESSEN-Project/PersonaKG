   (ID: 26831d6557d17492ae3b0b54585b32e08055f834)

7. wouldn  t the accounts receivable of banks be completely thrown off though ? the banks would simply be wrecked financially and the federal reserve requirement eventually . someone would make money off of the hedging the risk but i would think that ultimately banks would lose millions if not billions in accounts receivable . hell if it actually happened i don  t think the us would have serious consequences . i think it could happen if everyone started to default on there loans alone .

10. yeah . i dont get that . even as someone who likes trump , this is something i think is okay to make fun of . he even makes fun of his own typos like when he typed covfefe
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

11. cause trump would think of funny names for them like " beto the creepo " and " bad touch biden , " steal their thunder at every turn and make it hard to take them seriously . p . s . i didnt bother thinking up a name for bernie because hes too old to make it to digit .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

12. i apreciate that you think my art is worth stealing but i really don ' t mind . i don ' t make art for the clout , i do it to practice and get better . it ' s only one drawing , i can easily make another .
   (ID: 8f5b0c902ce9c2bf19ecdb9205cb3d9f2a7c14fa)

13. i used to be like that too , not anymore though . but i ' m afraid i will at some point think about it again so i like to make jokes because it makes something i ' m scared of a little less scary .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

14. . no , it doesn ' t , but i can see why dooku would make you think that
   (ID: 800762ac8d54632109094a4e9132fe0aed711561)
