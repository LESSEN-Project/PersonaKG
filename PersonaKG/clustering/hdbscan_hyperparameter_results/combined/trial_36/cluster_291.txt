2. basically they wanted a discount , so of course they  knew the owner  and made a name up . so catching the blatant lie , i firmly say i am the owner , and they turned red and left . funniest lie i  ve ever told , it was obvious i wasn  t the owner but it was hilarious that they believed me .

3. hunters do not ask anyone else to adopt thier morals . hunters are not compelled to kill by tenet but by choice , there are plenty of times i ' ve sat in a blind had a few beers and never touched my bow as deer wandered by . i can say that i didn ' t even try to kill anything today when i get back to the lodge and no one will say that i ' m not longer a hunter . my bet is if you say to a group of vegans that you just a little bacon today or a bit of scrambled eggs this morning the reaction will not be as favorable .
