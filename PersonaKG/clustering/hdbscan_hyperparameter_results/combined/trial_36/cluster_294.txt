3. i took this question as what policy the manager should implement for themselves . i have noticed that management only does what the higher ups tell them . there is no leadership . what is lacking in most places are leadership . i ' m not in a good headspace on this topic bc of my current employer lacks leadership especially at the lower levels . our turn over rate is atrocious . i always think of the old army doctrine of " people first , mission always " if you can understand what that requires , then you are on the path to good leadership .
