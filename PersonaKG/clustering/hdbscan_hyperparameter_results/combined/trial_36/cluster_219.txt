5. i had been at my job only a few weeks . the guy i worked closest with was a real jerk . he gave me one hershey kiss . just to act like i wasn  t embarrassed i said thanks and immediately ate it . everyone else in the office told him that was a dick move . he said ,  just kidding  and gave me the case of beer he carried around in the trunk of his car . he later got fired for being a total slacker and i got his job .

6. i havent experienced this myself purely , but i got lectured by my mom ' s colleague about it . apparently robbers just hand a sticky note to the bank teller sayain , " i have a gun . give me money " and if the teller tries to resist , they will be fired because if they get hurt , that hurts the bank ' s image . usually , the teller would just give the robber  digit or so and the police would find the criminal later . so no . it is absolutely nothing like how the media portrays it .

7. should not be a problem even if you get by yourself , just be confident . you do know how to ride and drive then it shouldn ' t be problem passing the test . as for not having a bike , i suggest you borrow a bike from any friend or relative because they don ' t provide the bike . last resort would be asking one of the people who have got their bikes for the test . for car lisence test they gave me the rto car maruti digit which was horrible but manageable to pass if you know your driving . go through an agency only if you don ' t want to fill applications and are very unsure about the procedure . i got mine done through an agency because i learnt driving through their school . if you know driving and riding i see no problem for you to get it done yourself .

8. i had a problem with that too . and it just got boring for me , so i don  t do it anymore . finding a girl could help .

9. stop begging for attention i know for a fact if someone wants to kill them selves they do it they don ' t got whining about it on the internet
