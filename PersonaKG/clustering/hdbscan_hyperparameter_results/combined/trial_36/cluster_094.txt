1. there ' s really no difference functionality  wise between the newer generations of smart phones . do we really need more powerful phones if we won ' t even use the to their full potential ? do we really need to go thinner instead of thicker for more battery life ? and storage is really dependent on how much money you throw at it . the only thing i see separating iphones and android phones at this point is the os and a headphone jack .

3. hypothetically . would you really need to launder it if there  s not more  illegal  money coming in ? cause you  d have to use some of it for a front to actually launder it . but why not just keep it in cash ?
