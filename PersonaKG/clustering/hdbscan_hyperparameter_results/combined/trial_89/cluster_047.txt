   (ID: cfd691d6aeaf46cc644b0e21187d10dfc62b0bc8)

2. okay , but that  s not a valid sample . results will be purely anecdotal . you may want to point that out to your teach so they know you  re aware of the faults and limitations . also , the same study found that about digit percent of shower water is from the hot water source . and if your calculating enviro footprints , don  t forget about all the embedded energy in water , both hot and cold .

   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

5. oh i do . i let people know right away that they are dumb for asking a question when we both know they already know the answer . why would you want to force a conversation with someone ? do you enjoy bothering people ?
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

6. i want to know as well . do politicians pay them ?
   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

8. eh , no big . you stop taking the estrogen and move on . shit happens . don ' t know why we have to pigeon hole people and make them miserable , in any capacity . be what you want to be , even if you change your mind later , and everyone else can go fuck themselves .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

   (ID: cd4ad4cc67fcfb39fcb1f11e52709d863f1c0215)

11. the connections you make can be more important than the things you learn in the classroom . so if there are clubs and internships related to the job you want do them . look for jobs that have skills related to what you want to do , or can at least sell to your future employer . the worst ? you find out you hate what you are going into but can change to something else before you are too invested ! the best ? valuable connections that will help you get where you want to go . remember , its not what you know its who you know .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

12. if you ' re sure this is something you want to do . make constant sexual innuendos around him . touch him just platonically enough so nobody bats an eye about it , but linger just long enough for him to know that it ' s something you want . you could just straight  up tell him . i don ' t know that many men who would turn sex with a willing 16yo especially if it ' s legal where you are .
   (ID: fe56409176d2a6089f323227d5b07061f851d63b)

   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

16. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

17. yeah , i know it ' s the hardest and worst but i simply want it . the why ? i already played a dozen worlds to where i was starting to mine iron , and this stupid black bronze has always eluded me . the most i ever managed to make were digit tools at any one given time . i refuse to progress further until i get this .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

18. i don ' t know why they switched . most articles on the topic mention the same sequence of events , with that detail missing . 1800s  kids ' clothes are unisex . everyone wears white dresses until around the age of digit or digit . white because it ' s the easiest to clean at the time . 1910s  blue is mentioned for girls , pink for boys . 1940s  the public decides they want gender  differentiated clothing . manufacturers , for whatever reason , go against the social norms of the previous few decades .
