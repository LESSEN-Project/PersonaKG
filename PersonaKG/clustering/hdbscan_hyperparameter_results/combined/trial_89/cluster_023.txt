2. it ' s confusing . long story short . if you have the capability to fall in love with a person , that says so much about how powerful your capacity to love is . people have all of these rules to let them feel emotions . we forget that we don ' t always need to wait for company to have fun , for money to feel rich , for gains to feel strong , or for a partner to feel love . we can feel these emotions really whenever . when you give yourself permission to love someone , you are actually just exercising your very talent of being able to generate love , and you subconsciously let the feeling override other programs in your brain . it is a practice that you are actually doing with yourself and all by yourself , you just think that you are having that experience because someone else is there . similar to how hateful people deep down truly hate themselves , people who are loving people deep down truly love themselves . this isn ' t toxic at all , it ' s just a dynamic that what you project onto the world is a result of how your feel inside . if you can go so far as to fall in love with someone , you must perhaps underneath many layers truly and genuinely love yourself .

5. people lying to you about how great they are and how deep and full of significance and meaning their life is . nobody cares about how your grandmother grew tomatoes instilling your love of fresh produce , or how your mother ' s use of seasonings opened up your senses , or your soccer coach touching you filled you with a love of sausage . i just could not remember if i needed digit tbs or digit of flower for a basic roux . please put the recipe at the top and your poorly written life story at the bottom so i can choose to not read with out being annoyed by having to scroll through it .
