2. i completely understand . i just imagine my inner meaner as something ridiculous or someone i disrespect  don ' t like so i can tell it as sassily as possible to shut up . sometimes goals take time . its important to remember that no matter how smol the steps are , you are taking them one day at a time , and it should be celebrated . you will get there ! i know it ! just hug your stuffies and dream big lovely  digit

3. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted

7. tbh that ' s probably your friend being low on energy and overwhelmed by trying to reply in a genuine way to all those messages . i honestly don ' t see the point on commenting on it at all instead prehaps try regulating the amount of messages you send at once , and if you feel you are being ignored don ' t send more right away to test the theory , because it won ' t help . just wait till she feels like replying . not everything is personal . as for me , if i get a lot of messages i tend to do exactly this , i try to reply to as many as possible but in general it feels non genuine to me to reply to all of them when the other person texted them a while ago . hence i tend to reply mostly to the things i perceive as important or at least are most interesting to me . if i get frustrated i know it ' s nothing to do with the other person but only the way i prefer interacting with people . i never actually get mad at someone for doing this . unless it ' s excessive .

8. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .

10. oh , believe me , noah aint the worst shit you could have gotten . i have a name that only two other people have in my country , so . its pretty embarrassing . and well its just a one crush . i know it feels like shes the one , but let her make a decision , and accept it no matter what it is . you can try taking her out on date to show that you aren ' t some random retard . good luck man , waiting for the best news from you !

11. i know its not so easy to do when shit like this happens but . do people who do this not train themselves to get out of this situation ? as i understand you are supposed to roll onto your front , get your ice axe thats tied to you and kinda use it as an anchor ? i mean there were parts there where it seemed like he was just sitting up like he was on a slide

12. this happened recently a actually . i normally never interact with neighbors as i lived in apartments . i had moved into a townhouse community , little yards and all that . i was in the back smoking a cigarette around 11pm when this very attractive girl yells over from digit doors down about digit feet and asks me if i had just moved in and if i wanted to come over and have a drink as she was having a party . i said sure and came over . i meet her husband , a couple of her friends and another neighbor . i ' m thinking that this is pretty cool , i found some people i can hang out with once in awhile close to home . well about digit hours later she and her husband get in a huge fight , yelling  cussing . i ' m sitting at the kitchen table not knowing what to do . the husband storms out and drives off and the girl runs in the bathroom sobbing , everyone is trying to console her through the bathroom door and i ' m like wtf just happened . anyway , digit minutes later we are all in the kitchen taken shots and this girl tells me her life story , some dark shit . abuse and drugs , everything . i ' m thinking , i don ' t even know you , why are you telling me this ? long story short they get evicted two months later because of an " altercation " that involved the police . i learned my lesson and i will never meet another neighbor .
