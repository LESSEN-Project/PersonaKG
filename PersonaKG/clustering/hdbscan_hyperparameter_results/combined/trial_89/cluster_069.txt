1. personal preference  rest . there is no reason for you to swap if you really dont want to but you might aswell try and see if you like others more . a different crosshair literaly changes the whole way the guns feel . starting with a simple dot to weird crosshairsettings . fool around , copy others and see what suits you best . as for me . coming from digit . digit i really need someone similar to that .

3. well , i don ' t go around telling everyone i don ' t believe in the bible and all that nonsense . and i believe there are many people like me . it ' s easier to say nothiing most of the time unless confronted by one of those crazy people who want to send you to hell because you don ' t believe exactly like they do .

5. this is a very unpopular opinion and for good reason . people do play video games to escape reality , like you might eat tasty foods because they taste good , and because you don ' t want a plain , boring meal . there is one gamer who gets paid 500k annually and is digit y  o .

6. i get it , honestly i do because i ' m the same way . this might sting but it ' s the truth . you ' re lazy . you want instant gratification . i get it , i do too ! i ' m lazy as well , but i don ' t like that about me and so i grab that feeling with both hands and i squeeze it down and say " fuck you quitter , i ' m going to learn how to play  do this " . my dad used to tell me this and i hold it close to this day , " toughen up buttercup " . you have to fight for what you want , even against yourself .

7. buckle down and raise a son when i really wasn ' t ready to . i don ' t want to be a deadbeat dad , but sometimes i feel like it would be a hell of a lot easier than what i ' m going through now

8. in toronto theres a company called fix it females that higher mostly women but they want ppl who are ' ' experienced ' ' even though a lot of them aren ' t , but apply anyway say you have painting experience . best way honestly is to be a helpelabor at sites , sweeping , passing tools , moving what you can etc . and you gain experience through that . tbh like digit  of construction crews your ganna experience peverted guys cause most of them are rough around the edges high school drop out type guys so you gotta find the right crew
