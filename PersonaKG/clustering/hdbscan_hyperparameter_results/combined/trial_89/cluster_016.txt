1. great show , excited to see where this goes in a month when we get by all the obvious games starcraft , cs , ext . do have one suggestion that might already be true but has to do with twitch . could you produce this show inside the " game " category and not the " gaming talk shows " category . since this talk show is digit  just about a the single game and not a of variety game talk show . if you do it inside the " game " i would guess you would get more people checking out the live stream . twitch might have rules against this but its my idea .

4. there are many alternatives to driving , and to say you can ' t afford not to drive is ridiculous unless you live outside of the city or the commute is immensely far .   x200b  biking is a great alternative , you will have to leave home a bit earlier but you can avoid the traffic so in some casesdepending on where you live it can save you quite a bit of time . obviously you need to take conditions into account but there are many snow rated bikes and clothing that people take advantage of .   x200b  public transportation is in every city and whether it be a bus or train there is a way to get from one end of the city to the next . i know it ' s easier said than done but if you can wake up a bit earlier it can save you the headache of totaling your vehicle .   x200b  again , depending on where you live there are many transportation apps like uber that are fairly reasonable and even if you just need them to get you over a certain bridge or past a certain point and you can walk the rest of the way is great .   x200b

5. if it ' s the driveway to their property , and you don ' t live in a place where parking on driveways is illegal because of some obstruction nonsense , they can just show you the deed or even a few bills . there ' s no way they own a private house but not the driveway attached to it lol . just make sure to get your parking spot lease in writing also .

6. nta judging by the fact you could pay off all her debt , plus buy her a new car it was obviously a decently large sum , that i agree with you i would not just randomly hand out to a girlfriend of digit months that you do not live with or are engaged to . maybe you could of helped her a little if you really wanted to , but you have no obligation to give her that money , or justify how you spend your hard earned money .

7. do you draw your tags or buy them over the counter ? we have tag draws and only you can use your tag . but i have heard of sharing tags in states where you can buy a handful of tags or a punch card . the differences in hunting laws state by state are pretty neat . i was just talking to a guy the other day i forget where he lives but it is illegal to hunt with radios there , and where i live i can ' t imagine going into the woods without one .

8. nah . old people are notorious for speaking their minds , as are iranians in my experience , and there ' s even a chance the neighbour was just venting frustrations on you about their own children they don ' t see . you work a lot and still made time to go see your parents who live a few hours away , your not a bad son by any means well , no means relevant to the story anyways . and had clearly reached a breaking point for strangers bullshit . the neighbour obviously shouldn ' t have said anything that confrontational but realistically probably had no idea that western culture frown upon chastising strangers .

9. digit  . hardly any difference , then just live off the interest and fuck off the rest of my life
