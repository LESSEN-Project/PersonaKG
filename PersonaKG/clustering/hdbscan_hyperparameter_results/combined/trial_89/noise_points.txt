   (ID: 48e565f53f18e7fed27267c945fb81bb868c90f3)

5. i wanted to be bad ass and learn how to throw knifes , but i didn  t have a forest near my house to go throw knives at a tree i lived in a major city . so , i used my bathroom door since it was the only wood fixture i saw that would work . bad idea , my mother was not pleased by the aftermath .
   (ID: b3497f72ed4462f0414951db6d9ee7aa4004b515)

6. thanks all . i ' ve done a large scale crown lift on the tree , so hopefully shouldn ' t be too bad with the light . it ' s a neighbour ' s tree but i took as much advantage as i dared when they said i could do what i wanted to it . the area got a fair bit of sun in the summer last year , before i cut the tree . so will risk it , i don ' t really have much option to go elsewhere with the plots . the daikon  green manure idea sounds good . but can i resist the urge to get growing veg this year ?
   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

7. anyone answering this question seriously probably shouldn ' t be in that line of work .

   (ID: c391065478603a686531cbdd50568136a5e14508)

11. have you heard of teen titans ? well , in the crappy remake , jinx goes around town with a black cat and cause everyone to have bad luck . they have a lot of fun . when you said the cat ' s name was jinx , i couldn ' t stop thinking about that cat !
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

12. i can understand but you shouldn  t dwell on that , when they see they are not getting any results they likely to move or get mad
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

13. because the heat of the sun , and the amount of water and salt and all the time that it ' s been there . there is more water and more area affected by that than in your glass of water . although maybe it ' s an interesting experiment if you put lot of salt in a small container , you heat it up and when you ' re gonna smell it , you cover you head and the container with a towel . if you try it , let me know what happens .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

14. i guess sports where athletes are very big nice target , and do not throw anything bad thrower . so . someone from judo , heavy category ? i ' m not sure , i guess those guys could throw pretty hard . but thinking of the others , they all seem to have nice assets . either speed , strength , acrobatic dodges first pick are handballers .
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

15. you look like a discount model or aspiring actress type , you probably post black and with photos on instagram of coffee , that is heavily edited so you can live your fake ass life , you also say things like don  t talk to me before my morning coffee . high school will probably be the best part of your life you basic person if i am right you life has been lived a thousand times and it is such a cliche
   (ID: 87173aaf55980a77c94bd30c851c39fb0b52ff2e)

16. good point , i guess we ' ll have to figure it out when that happens

   (ID: b5bfc53fa7245451bad229f942e351fdc7360321)

20. this describes my problems as well . i ' m on vial smasher partnered with kraum . lots of x spells , including my finishers like torment of hailfire or jay ' s immolating inferno , and nothing infinite . its a " curious control " deck until i ' ve built enough mana through rocks , urborg  cabal coffers , and  or the two creatures that double your black mana . i play guttersnipe and a couple others like him , so i have good targets for curiosity , ophidian eye and tandem lookout . it ' s actually a lot of fun , and i haven ' t been hated out , because it ' s not like i ' m blowing up the world by turn digit or anything and vial smasher ' s triggers are random which i think helps a lot with people ' s feelings about the deck . my win rate has got to be over digit  , probably higher , but i don ' t keep records . if cedh develops a little more locally , i ' ll switch kraum out for thrasios and go full tilt .
