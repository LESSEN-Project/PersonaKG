1. we did acid with two other people , one of them had a fucked up bad trip and was eventually going to hurt himself or us he already tried to shoot us with a gun he hallucinated . before i called digit , the two other people including my former bff left . the other guy could have killed me and no one would know . it was then i realized that he didn ' t actually care about me and was toxic .

2. do you know your half brothers ? did they go to the funeral ? is there a relationship with them ?
   (ID: a1ba9b657b043ce2934cc0ae7b42c0a0bf3ba2fa)

3. if an intruder did it , they have to be about the dumbest criminal in the world . now , i ' m not a criminal but if i was and planned to kidnap a child from an occupied dwelling , i wouldn ' t be hanging around to write a long ransom note . i ' d bring a prewritten one with me so i could be in and out as fast as possible . secondly , if something did go wrong and my victim was injured or dead , i ' d take them with me anyway . the family isn ' t going to know that the child isn ' t alive or conscious anymore . i ' d take the kid , leave the note , get the ransom and dump the body . leaving the body behind means no payout . leaving the body behind and molesting it is even stupider . why run the risk of leaving dna or other evidence ? i can ' t think of a single reason for an intruder to leave jb and a ransom note that they had to know would be utterly useless since they ' d left their leverage behind .

4. how did you know my life story
   (ID: 1921dc07cd609c210cb71a0176afa3dfa4fa3772)

5. i hate to ask , but i feel i have too . at what point in your moms illness did you realize the fight was over ? or did you never come to that point ? i ask because i ' m dealing with some stuff and would really like to know . when do i stop " pretending " and start preparing for the inevitable . i ' m at a loss .
   (ID: 96ea4e7f6c3452a58ef71fc7276006fdbf2ccb01)

6. shit . that ' s a terrible thing to happen to you so young . if it helps , you ' re getting internet bro hugs from me . you should know that you ' re an absolute hero for talking her out of it . even if she ended up doing it later , you still gave it your all to save her . most people go through their lives without ever saving someone else ' s . most adults wouldn ' t know how to do what you did . you are a legend .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

7. you know . i ' m something of a scientist my self . and i wanna ask you  did you come to this conclusion after kowalski analysis ? no . you don ' t wanna tell me ? all right then keep your secrets to yourself . amen brothers . can i get digit likes . oops sorry , i guess we don ' t do that here .
   (ID: 4381fa1a63289663c5683187c0d07eadf81abfc2)

8. uh . how did you come to that conclusion ? do you know me ?
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

9. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

10. actually , you did pretty good . i couldn ' t do anything near it . at the same moment  its terrible . the eyes and the hands are the hardest parts , i know  but you gotta start fixing it first . i really look forward to see you progressing , because nothing can be achieved without any difficulties and hard work . keep it up since its my favorite anime  digit
   (ID: 8487a8406f04273c554e2e578c3a667648916790)

11. i did some research and i found a couple technical service bulletins on the spark plug wires being faulty . these bulletins are specifically for the original wires . however since your car is over 300k miles , id assume they arent stock . ill keep looking for more and let you know if i find anything
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

12. delete the number , or block the number . make it extremely difficult to get in contact with him in anyway . know what he did to you and know how you felt when you found out . do you really wanna feel that way again ? you deserve to be happy and putting yourself in that situation is going to dig yourself into a deep hole . dont give him the satisfaction of cheating on a girl and then having her run back to him . it will make him a worse person and it will only hurt you in the end .
