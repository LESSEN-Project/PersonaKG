   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

2. nice list though duplicating some of the requests earlier to the normal maps app . i  m sure if they bring them then they  ll bring it to both this one and the maps app . on another note , i recently submitted most of this feedback to not just the apple feedback site , but also to eddy cue as he  s the svp of maps among many other things . you might wanna do so too so it likely gets better prioritized as imho few from the teams read our postings here .

3. i used to do this , but several times , not just once , there was someone already in my lane even though i was still partially occupying the left lane . i ' ll wait a few seconds and not get sandwiched between two idiots .

4. so far only one of them caused problems . had that one removed around digit , but the rest have been fine so i figure i ' ll just leave em there .

5. i ' ll just grab a full plate and take it to my room everytime we ' re having dinner
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

6. op makes claim using vague terms , gets told to define term , provides definition , gets argued with or laughed at for mistaken assumptions . that ' s usually how things work around here . just substituting ' circlejerk ' for ' god ' or ' soul ' or ' spiritual ' or whatever the hell else . tell me exactly what you mean by it and i ' ll tell you what you have wrong . tl  dr whoosh

7. well that  s just it . i could do the ancestral and my bazaar and make her fairly happy . but i  ll take my lotus to the grave .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

8. good luck . if you get a craving , just do something different . for instance , if i get one in the car , i ' ll change the channel and listen to something else that distracts me . on chantix , the cravings pass pretty quickly , if you have any at all .
