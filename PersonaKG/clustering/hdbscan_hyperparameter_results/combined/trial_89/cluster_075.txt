5. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show

7. if you know anything about ceo ' s we have plenty of time to kill and this is more fun than playing golf . i don ' t care about helping your numbers . any complaints you get are your fault for hiding the merchandise while it devalues so you can buy it below cost and resell it on ebay . you are the reseller . i am just the advisor .
   (ID: a61db1f2f0a3d15376fd168a1637c028f25100e1)

8. i mean , i get it . we grow up and suddenly we ' re responsible for our own survival , when we only exist because someone else wanted us to . why do i have to get a job and pay bills and all that shitty stuff , when my parents are the ones that put me here ? don ' t know that you can really win in a court of law , and maybe you should suck it up and just deal . but i get it .

10. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

11. if you ' re doing it once a week , that ' s a habbit in it of it ' s own . now i don ' t know how it will affect your brain . i would just warn you about addiction . it ' s a slippery slope .

12. the best advice i can give to you is to either talk to your friend , let them know how you feel and give them the chance to become aware that their behavior is bothering you , or do nothing and slowly back away from the friendship . i am in a similar boat myself . as friends we should be able to voice our opinions and concerns within our friendships and not worry that the other will become defensive or misinterpret our motivations , but sometimes it just doesn ' t work that way because of bias or prejudice or just plain ol ' human error and that ' s when it ' s time to step back . good luck !

14. i dont know if this is cheating since the official album version has vocals , but the anthology version of " eleanor rigby " with just the orchestra is amazing . better than revolver ' s version imo

15. " secret " , just go through all people who can cursive and you know
   (ID: 8eba9c7d48a60bfbded2227dacd3275ae756fcce)

16. ummm . wow ! it wasn ' t the nazis who built that wall . yikes ! i correct my previous statement , you should have just learned history ! that was not such a wall , that was to keep people in . much easier to do if the gov ' t kills anyone you know if you escape . kind of puts a damper on escapes and the ability to plan them with others .

17. lol i was aware . i just wanted you to know for sure that the spoilers were legitimate and there was no going back now , dumbass ps starks nickname for rocket is " ratchet " . due to his failure , thor let ' s himself go physically and becomes a drunk . captain marvel destroys thanos ' main ship and forces it to crash in the finale . captain america says " avengers assemble " when all the heroes are revived and charge towards thanos .

19. i know that . i was just saying that for an eli5  level explanation , x  x " equals " digit at digit . meaning that the limit of the function exists . of course , as others have pointed out , you can define other limits that are still indeterminate that come out to other values . or no values at all . at x  digit , ln1  x  sinx  digit  cos  digit x evaluates to digit  digit . but , as any mean girls fan knows , the limit does not exist ! but the limit of literally taking x  x to digit does , in fact , equal digit .

20. songs you know the lyrics to . it makes you feel good about yourself . just make sure you don  t get too distracted by the music
