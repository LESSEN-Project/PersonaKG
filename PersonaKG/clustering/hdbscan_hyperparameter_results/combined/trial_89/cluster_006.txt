2. i see what you mean . i ' ve never played reach ' s multiplayer so i can ' t say much about the problems you mentioned , though they do seem pretty bad . personally my main draws were more from the single player modes , especially campaign . i thought the alien invasion story was actually quite good , since it showed how massive and powerful the covenant was , and how ill  equipped the humans really were to fight them . it was definitely more grounded and military  based than the other games , but i personally liked that sense of desperation and scale the setting gave off .

3. is . is that . a cat ? that is the fattest motherfucker i ' ve ever seen . i feel sorry for the poor thing . i thought this was a fleshy dog or a colored tank whirring on the lawn

4. first off bud , i  ve played since alpha . secondly i didn  t say anything was over powered , you do know how to read don  t you ? they asked what we thought was the best character offensively , it  s an opinionated post , the  competitive  aspect of the subreddit has nothing to do with options or thoughts . your assumptions and negative responses are the exact reason this game is dying .

6. it . can actually , i ' ve never thought about that .
   (ID: 5173a1d5475490650d7365b2c2b2f2c579d33099)

7. mortality . i thought of mortality as a distant subject which happened to only others when i was younger . i was a naive kid for sure . lately i ' ve been surrounded by loss and it ' s readjusted my attitude to some things .

8. i ' ve actually ran into this issue and i thought i was trash , thanks .
   (ID: ef2135d90df57b27df5e96791848d8d9201afd29)

9. i ' ve never been good at social interactions , the guys at my elementary school liked to fight people and hit them for fun , and i wanted to get along with them . i liked to run and was very fast , so i would tell the boys in my class that if they catch me the could beat me up . i thought that we were friends until one of them broke my feet by kicking it so hard and broke my glasses . i guess i would have done whatever to have friends .

10. i have a bug and spider phobia . it started when i was a kid and woke up with a huntsman spider on my face . this is not a good phobia to have growing up in australia . so far , the most success i ' ve had at dealing with it has been moving to a country with less bugs new zealand . it ' s not so much overcoming it as running away from it , but it means the panic attacks are much less frequent . they still happen , one time i found a weta in my house and i didn ' t know what it was because it was the first time i ' d seen one and i was in such a panic that i locked myself out of my house trying to run away from it so i could call a friend to come and deal with it . in my panic i apparently thought it entirely logical to trap it in the house so it could be removed and i ended up having to get a friend drive me to my husband ' s office so we could bring him home and he could let me back in the house and remove the weta for me .
