17. that wasn  t me who said that lol . i played the shit out of the first destiny . every dlc , did every raid , all of it . the game is absolute shit . i understand that that  s my opinion , but i truly do not get how people like that game . didn  t even waste my time buying the second one . so disappointing that bungie abandoned halo for this garbage
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

18. we ? did you really help her out ? from the tone of your post is sounds like you object to this direct help . i ' m sure many donated to both an organization to help generally and to rebecca directly . we like rebecca .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

19. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .
