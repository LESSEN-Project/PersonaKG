1. hey . firstly you need to speak to someone be it a doctor or the samaritans , someone . secondly why are you looking up reasons instead of looking inwards and seeing what the actual issue is . do you have depression or something that maybe people around you don ' t know how to handle ? what kind of person are you ? are you kind ? thoughtful ? generous with your time ? empathetic ? honest ? nice ? these are all traits that people like . or are you selfish ? negative ? deceitful ? apathetic ? narcissistic ? irresponsible ? egotistical ? you can change your behaviour and your characteristics . you are not always going to be the person you perceive yourself to be now . everyone has the potential to change and grow . believe in yourself . only you have the ability to make yourself happy . don ' t depend on others to validate you . mind yourself .

2. i have time every single night when i rubber band my controller and go to sleep . yes i know banding isn  t necessary but i like my guy to stroll around carelessly , like andy dufresne

3. how does the caption generator work ?  know police serve you with very high iq , kids . that sounds like a botched attempt to give me useful advice .
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

4. like i own the xs and i taught that the price was worth it , but i was upgrading form the se , tbh the only person that know that answer is you grinning  face  with  sweat
   (ID: 87173aaf55980a77c94bd30c851c39fb0b52ff2e)

5. i didnt even know doxxing was a thing . like who even cares enough to go through all of that trouble .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

6. how are you supposed to know what you like if you don ' t try it ? so wait has the narrative shifted away from being born that way to trying it and liking it ? you guys make this shit so confusing it ' s impossible to keep track . half of me thinks the definitions keep getting changed because y ' all can ' t admit you don ' t even remember them .
   (ID: f39e591889b6331bd255039773030c1b50c7e201)

7. i know lol . she really is great . shes like a blessing in my life that came upon me when i was very confused and didn ' t know where to go . whenever i feel sad i listen to litterally any of her songs and feel better . i am not a robot has such a special place in my  . so does happy . especially becuase i have anxiety and depression so it makes it even better .

8. wouldn ' t you like to know , piggy boy ?
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

9. how would we know ? we don ' t know anything about you ! it ' s like you have to play a game you played everyday in your life , but instead you ' re handing us the controller to play it blindfolded .
   (ID: 4381fa1a63289663c5683187c0d07eadf81abfc2)

10. in that case , greet her and chat up . you can assess the friends interest in the same time . why do i feel like a wolf ? i don ' t know . it ' s probably because i read something about this in the game .
   (ID: 9adb5fb6fb9aeeeb65afe41002460d73817044b0)

11. that can ' t be healthy . yeah my friends are literally the reason i even know of furries because their the ones that told me about them in the first place . now of course it wasn ' t good stuff but i gradually started to like them from my one sided mind .
   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

12. but how will i know what the food looks like if i dont take digit pictures . then i complain the food is cold and send it back . the sad part is that shits probably true for some people .
   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

13. i don ' t know if this applies to you but i ' m gonna throw it out there anyway . i work night shifts and day offs are on monday and tuesday . i don ' t get to hang out with people because of my work schedule . what i do cope up with the loneliness is i play mmos like guild wars digit . i get to be with people , albeit virtually , but at least i still get to talk with people which somehow lessens the feeling .

14. as a kid , hell . i was the youngest , so i was constantly picked on , and my parents would tell me " don ' t provoke them " even when i hadn ' t done anything . they also acted like if one of us knew something , we should all know it , even though some of us had way less experience  education than the others . and yes , parents have favorites , and it makes the others feel inferior as shit . as an adult , we stopped fighting and now it ' s like we ' re friends that will never grow distant , even if we don ' t see each other for ages .

15. actually what your describing is a thing that has nothing to do with anger . " call of the void " is when you see an opportunity to do something you know to be horrible and feel a sudden urge to do it . this happens to let your mind know it has control over the situation . like standing on the edge of a cliff . the mind goes " this is scary , i could fall , i could die " so the next step is " i could kill myself , but i won ' t kill myself , so i ' m not going to die . does that make sense ? tl  dr you ' re fine , everybody feels this , it ' s a way to feel in control .
   (ID: d54a04c3eba52404f5dd7abb0e459a949dbc7f93)

16. anywhere except where op works . i didn ' t even get a reprimand . the guy didn ' t ask to see any sort of supervisor . sounds like i was being rude , i know , but in my line of work , you can give as well as you get . its sort of the best version of customer service ever .
   (ID: 20b71c431f98b1f88ec1b3e7ada79d31df65a8c2)

17. well i always walk into a room with my head held high and with purpose so i start off looking like i belong  have confidence . really watch how you present yourself , use your body language to exude confidence . one thing i try to do but is so hard is to make eye contact when speaking with others . when interacting with people , i try to stand still and not fidget with random shit like my hair , phone or whatever because that comes across as being anxious . one thing i do which isn  t the greatest is i act cocky and borderline conceded . it makes me feel better and people who know me know that i  m not being serious . but sometimes you really do start becoming this person you  re channeling .
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

18. if you ever find that  feel good  character let me know . i would like to try them for myself
   (ID: 48e565f53f18e7fed27267c945fb81bb868c90f3)

19. do you know where you have the most trouble in ? i found that the historical passages always hit me like a truck .
   (ID: fc02053133b0aa8d444b95ed56c24999ae82879b)

20. i can  t seem to remember any right now but when someone keeps saying  like  you . already know they  re making the story or dream they have right on the spot
