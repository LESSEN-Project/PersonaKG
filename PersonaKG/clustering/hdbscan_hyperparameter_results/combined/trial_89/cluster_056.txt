1. listen , you  re not a humanitarian , you  re not a good person , from your post history you  re an extremely sad person , you  re the definition of a piece of shit . yet you seem to think you stand above others because of physical appearance . just because you weren  t happy with the way you were does not give you the fucking right to belittle those who are content with their body , regardless how much extra weight they have . i  d bet my bottom dollar that digit  of those fuckers are happier than you . nobody wants to be as sad you . fuck off . humanity is better without you

2. by god its a little baby . what country sends babies to school ? i ' m not judging per say , if that ' s what your country does that ' s fine . it just seems odd from where i ' m sitting . then again my kids came to work with me from the age of digit to digit when they started school . you probably think that is weird .

3. a few years ago , i was sitting in class doing my homework . the kid in front me , who at the time was my friend , turnt around and said " i think we should just nuke iran . this pissed me off , because im persian and i would prefer if my aunt wasn ' t turned into nuclear fallout . he then went on to say that the second amendment shouldn ' t apply to muslims  middle eastern people . a quick google search showed him that most of the post digit  digit terrorists were native born white people with more in common with him than me

4. of course my argument makes sense so long as you think about it properly . the effective skill of your team lowers when someone is simply feeding , or their focus blinded by anger . getting tilted and becoming unable to play your best handicaps you and your team , effectively lowering the skill of that player .  and you can ' t control soccer or football in that regard because people who throw in those games get permanently banned from the league yeah , and the exact same thing happens in professional dota digit . another similarity between dota digit and football  soccer is that you don ' t get permanently banned from throwing games just by playing casual matches with randoms .

5. shadow assault is unquestionably the least desirable . it ' s not a ' bad ' , heroic in reality , vp is just fantastic . most of the other less than desirable heroics i can think of niche use for , but that ' s the most difficult one . the other two that come to mind are rain of chaos which is decent for zoning during a push , and mind control can be used for picks in some cases . i wouldn ' t recommend picking them most of the time , but you can come up with situations where they are pretty decent . abby ' s construct blanking out on the name , is good and bad in so far that if not stopped it can do a lot of damage . it limits his team  fight potential though , so unless your team can compensate in some other ways it can be difficult to use properly . it has high potential though , and under the right circumstances is arguably superior .

6. hmm . good point . my argument seemed to be a bit flawed . i guess it  s just down to the amount people use and nothing else . or is it . i guess imma have to come back to this topic at a later date and think about it a bit more
