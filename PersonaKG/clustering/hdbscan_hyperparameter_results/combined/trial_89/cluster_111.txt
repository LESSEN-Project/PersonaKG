1. nah the only challenging monster is behemoth and it ' s only because of the weird mechanics . great game don ' t get me wrong on of my top picks of the year , but compared to mhgu that came out on the switch it just doesn ' t hold a candle to the amount of content .

2. shark . i ' m more likely to survive . crocs kill quickly , a shark will most likely just take a bite and move on once it realizes humans don ' t taste good .

3. is the mail pre sorted for you or do you have to sort it ? our complex has digit mailboxes all in a row and our mail man just throws it all in and we have to sort it ourselves . almost daily i get other people  s mail . is this common ?

4. . so ? i don ' t recycle . why should i conserve the planet for a bunch of assholes making billions exploiting it ? just give them more time to do what they please ? what ' s my " contribution " gonna do , compared to an oil spill ? what ' s my carbon footprint compared to a multinational ' s empire ? fiat iustitia , et pereat mundus .

5. i agree with this digit  . when i put my blinker on to get over , more than half the time , the person i ' m trying to get over in front of speeds up to stop me from getting over . so i just quit using them .

6. people complain about how capcom makes this game too casual friendly and that it ' s just too easy . here they are making it so you can dp after the opponents cock is down your throat and it doesn ' t even trade but digit  just hits them even though you were slow as balls . now that you can ' t be punished for being slow but are actually rewarded for it , making this game that much easier and now everyone is happy about it . what ' s gonna be next ? digit button supers ? an option to pause online because you have to finish painting your nails ? pathetic .
