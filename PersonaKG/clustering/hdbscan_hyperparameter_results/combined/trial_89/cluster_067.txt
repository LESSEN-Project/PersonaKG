1. no problem . hopefully there are more like you in the world . fair play to you for wanting to brighten up a strangers day . another thing would be leaving post  its on mirrors in public toilets telling the next person how great they look  have a lovely smile  fabulous hair . or if you are out to dinner and it ' s really good , specifically ask to see the chef and give them a tip . i don ' t think they get them very often .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

2. maybe fairies ? i think that would be really cool . i like dragons more but i ' m afraid they might destroy the world .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

3. my mother was an only child , she said it was very lonely growing up as an only child and she always wanted a big family . i have digit siblings , after seeing how expensive it is raising a child and all the other drama that goes with having digit kids , i think it is insane ! i personally would like to have two kids . maybe three .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

4. no way . i don ' t think i ' d like to be a kid in this day and age . potentially everything i do would be saved for posterity somewhere on the internet
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

5. i used to be like that too , not anymore though . but i ' m afraid i will at some point think about it again so i like to make jokes because it makes something i ' m scared of a little less scary .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

6. i think it ' s like disco domination where it ' s release is delayed but alot more worse
   (ID: 84a0b9e5d9e0e37c98f992c96c029f6ec99fb1ca)

7. cause trump would think of funny names for them like " beto the creepo " and " bad touch biden , " steal their thunder at every turn and make it hard to take them seriously . p . s . i didnt bother thinking up a name for bernie because hes too old to make it to digit .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

8. thats cool . it does really depend on the girl . i think we all probably have little things we like  dislike about women . its not that one is right or wrong . for example i like it when i can see the impression of a girls ribs some people would say the idol os anorexic or too skinny but i like it for some reason

9. i think the proper analogy would be  a person who does not post  leave home won ' t get banned  mugged . the more often you ' re outside  you post , the more chances there are that you will be considered a mark  offend a mod . the more often you go to dark alleys  sb and sv , there more you risk , as the muggers  mods are more vicious there . one can give the mugger his valuables when confronted  be civil , follow the rules , and take his lumps when he and the mods don ' t agree , and then he probably wont be beaten up  banned .   x200b  see ? i too can make up loaded analogies .   x200b  i insist that " zoat asshole , zoat hissy fit " is a childishly simplistic view of the situation . to me it looks like  zoat is more active , so is at higher risk of ban all else being equal  zoat is a bit abrasive , so this also contributes to conflicts that may occur  sv and sb mods are power tripping , sb mods more than sv ones  you seem to think zoat is in the wrong and behaves childishly , completely disregarding that mods can also power trip and behave childishly .   x200b  also , at which odds are you ready to take a bet that zoat will receive next ban before eaglejarl does ? digit  digit ? digit  digit ?

10. you  re making it seem that everyone who plays video games or anything like that is a lowlife piece of shit , my dad  s an avid gamer , is about 240lbs and could probably bench press about 250lbs , i  m not that far behind him and i play video games as well . maybe don  t generalize when you say that every gamer is lazy or is weak . and the reason that men don  t think that women should get it into their minds that hitting a man is okay is because , what if that man retaliates ? the woman could die , and it  s hard sometimes not to fight back , especially if it  s really bothering you . men don  t like to feel pain , neither do women , so why benefit one at the other  s expense ? double standards are bullshit .

11. it looks like a rose , i can see how some people would like this . because they think that they are special little flowers .
   (ID: 3b45915d58b20f0e2abb6b26d4534980a5d3aa68)

12. then you really are as stupid as i suggested at the outset . they are completely accurate and they are about digit times more useful than your nonsense because they ' re the meat and potatoes and nobody gives a shit if you could add digit tomes of ands , ifs , or buts to them . " meat " is not a complete description of steak and " vegetables " is not a complete description of salad but those are the main points you think of when you see steak or salad on a menu and an adequate description of the difference between them for you to decide you feel like having one a lot more than the other . and all i asked you , was the difference between autism steak and retard salad .

13. i think hot manifests crazy , and i like hot . so by the power of association , i like crazy
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

14. i dont think it works like that but ok
   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

15. i think it ' s more like when you go to pick up your kid from school but you forgot his name .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

16. funny . i don ' t like religion because i think it ' s ' icky ' . i have a hundred other reasons of course but my gut instinct is ' it ' s icky ' .
   (ID: d02dbb1cf70aa95df2b9f1bbd0a0c5bf0a966933)

17. spoiler this makes me think of jason segel at the end of episode digit , season digit , of how i met your mother . what was he going through to produce a scene like that .
   (ID: ccc20fb024de820a5ad1bfc4117d69d6b7c3a6c9)

18. it  s more like you return to home . i think it  s a pun on peter being a kid like spider man get back home ! or the chancla !
   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

19. haha ! so we are quite the opposite ! i always wear jogging pants and stupid ass t  shirts that say something like nanana boo boo stick your head in doo  doo . i try to go for the slavic style so i can blend in with all the polish and russian people in my area . hell even my car when i hit the throttle it will have diesel fumes in the entire street . i try to give more gas when i see mom ' s with strollers so the diesel will inject their bodies with microparticles . i dislike my family and will never go to " social occasions " but to really give an answer on your question . don ' t get caught in the first place ! watch every law and order episode . and one day you think to yourself he this is pretty easy .
   (ID: 14bd1366b004b74cfd8c9cb269849740d12cff80)

20. i think everyone pronounces their ts like ds if its in the middle of a word
