1. its was my first one too , so i recommend you jojo ' s bizarre adventure , mob psycho digit and overlord . jojo ' s is a must have for anime fans . just watch it even if the first episodes are more or less bad . if you liked one punch man you will also like mob . that all i want to say to that . try overlord if you want something new .

3. i typically find it easier to show them a picture if i want a new style . if i want a trim i just say something like " a digit fade on the sides and just the tips off the top "

5. i don  t see the shtick about being toxic to jojo fans , jojo is anime . it  s a fact . just let people like what they want to like

6. no offence taken , it ' s not just about the pvp , it ' s also about farming , which is fine if that ' s how others want to play . i was of the understanding that fw was about conflict and dominating the enemy , this can be pretty hard if the enemy just warps off when i turn up , if you ' re at ' war ' then be at ' war ' . i can understand why these ideas may not be for you in particular , but maybe , just maybe , a lot of others may be just as frustrated as me and actually want to have some gf ' s . i like different points of view as sometimes brilliant ideas can evolve , how  what would you like to see done to improve fw ?

7. they ' re just doodles i felt like sharing with the sub . there ' s plenty of great fan art out there , so go look at that if you want something more professional . don ' t gatekeep what other people can post .

8. also i am deleting this post now since it ' s just spamming up the sub and the mods don ' t want shit like this on here thanks for wasting more of everyone ' s time on here
