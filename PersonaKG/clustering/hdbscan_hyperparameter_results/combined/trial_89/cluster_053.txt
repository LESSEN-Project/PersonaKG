1. in what way ? wanting to know what specific thing you think makes it shitty .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

2. i think being loving first and getting to know them can permit the conversation about jesus to go more smoothly . they may even come to see god through through tour loving relating as the candle shown for all to see . if we don  t tell our co workers at our jobs about hell digit  digit why should we do it to homosexuals ?

3. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

4. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

5. how do you deal with people like that ? i struggle with people already but when it ' s someone either not listening or think they know better i end up snapping at them
   (ID: f8771fc63bc4c52bb04b2e71d4aefe7bf406c65c)

6. i think you mean more openly discussed . murder and violence should be discussed while at the same time nobody needs to know the details of someone ' s sex life .
   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

7. fuck , i think i know him ! well actually i know his mother . intimately .
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

8. sometimes i think that no matter how hard our life is , no matter how much we suffer or put others in pain , the people who have passed on are laughing because they know it doesn ' t matter and nothing matters in life because there ' s something else that ' s better for everyone once we pass on . as far as i know , death only affects those that are living .

9. hey there , i know you have gotten some good advice and i know you have gotten some sketchy advice . im about to give you middle of the road advice . lol . i dont think you need to have some long drawn out serious " come to jesus " talk with your boyfriend . a simple statement like you made should suffice . if you say no more sex without a condom that should be fine . you dont even have to be mean or demanding about it , just make the statement , as i think you already have and then just make sure that the penis never touches the vagina without a condom . you can put it on for him , you can have one ready or close by , or just ask him to put one on . i think if you make too big of a deal about it that it will kinda of put the blame on him and it is digit  his fault but its digit  your fault too . not that i am trying to make you feel bad , that kind of stuff happens sometimes . if for whatever reason he doesn ' t want to play along then a more serious talk is required , but i don ' t think the first conversation about it needs to be too over the top . i know as a male that if i were told no more sex without a condom , i could take that at face value and move on without a big long discussion about it . i ' m hoping your bf is the same way .

10. just hear me out ! taking time to really think about what you ' re eating is connected to whether or not you ' re living a happy life . that ' s why i think it ' s really important . so , there are animals that are carnivores , right ? you know , like lions , cats , and vultures . you won ' t find meat from carnivores like that at a restaurant . why is that ? because its too smelly to eat ! it ' s disgusting ! listen up , guys ! cats are too disgusting to eat . are we on the same page so far ? on the other hand , have you heard of a fish called " sweetfish " ? sweetfish don ' t eat bugs . they only eat algae . they ' re vegetarian . usually fish guts are too bitter to eat , but sweetfish guts are delicious . it ' s because they ' re not carnivores . so with that logic in mind , all the meat we consider delicious is from herbivorous animals ! cows , pigs , and chickens ! the better their food , the better they taste ! which leads us to this conclusion . humans would taste gross because they eat meat ! well ? how do you like the conclusion i came up with ?

11. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

12. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

13. i think it ' s more of a confidence issue for me . if he makes the first move than i know that he likes  wants me rather than me taking the chance and getting rejected . although i have asked out all of my past boyfriends so i don ' t require it .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

14. thanks , good to know i ' m not alone . i think the problem comes from how people take the word " noob " to mean . most people here think not being a noob is just able being able to win or get high ranks , so if you win or have a high rank then you ' re not a noob . for me not being a noob means being able to aim well , win fights and just having good general fps skills , as well as all the br skills survival , camping , etc . lots of people who win are terrible at fps stuff and they don ' t even realise it . i see it often when spectate .

15. i didn ' t know about the ice cap thing you mentioned , but i feel like governments should do what they can to try to minimize it , i think that we should work towards developing a way to harness fusion power and attempt to proliferate that around the world and that would solve nearly all of our energy problems and it wouldn ' t polute
   (ID: feb4a6aeed8e7e14b0592329bd91d7933a93217e)

16. i don ' t know if i ' m ready for the next chapter . i don ' t think my heart can handle it .
   (ID: 8764a223ca1af7d1792e76a58bf3b1209bf73ad3)

17. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

18. we never see the other people of the game world  they don ' t actually exist and are just artificial memories and illusions to the characters that are actually modeled . the game has an incredibly limited amount of locations , people , and things . she would have no future there except to continue living through the same experiences over and over . even besides that , we know that natsuki ' s home is not a comfortable or safe place for her . as for the matter of jobs and such , any of the dokies even monika would have the same problems with qualifications and paperwork . monika would be the least initially shocked at the transition , but i think any of them would end up being grateful to have been given the chance to make more of their lives than was allowed them within the confines of the game .
   (ID: 0b52265db13bf8bc27ad36aad94e870706eb6689)

19. i know several people who think that is the funniest thing ever on family guy .
   (ID: 627809b826e1a364fb65664e0749e9e9eb90081d)

20. you know you don  t have to follow a guide right ? one thing about majority of the players playing this game is that they don  t bother to adapt , they just mindlessly play and when something kills them , they think it  s bullshit or the build is trash .
