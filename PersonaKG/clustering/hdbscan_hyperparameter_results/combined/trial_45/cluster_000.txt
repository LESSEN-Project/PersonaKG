1. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .

2. ooh boy heres muh story freshmen year , i lived in a hick town for the last digit years and i was always sad , usually because the rednecks hated me and my two hick friends that did like me shared digit of the same interests , or it was because i  m somewhat of an idiot and say shit i  d regret all the time say dumb shit you  d see on 4chan , not edgy , but embarrassing enough sophomore year , we move to a much bigger , more diverse town and school with more classes and opportunities for me . i made a ton of friends , my grades were tip top , and i had an amazing significant other . also , i wouldn  t act as stupid anymore . junior year , parents decided to pack up and move me one thousand miles west to the devil  s armpit az . girlfriend and i mutually broke up , super sad all summer , alone and very warm . school year was pretty much the same . anyway , in the fall of that year i bought a ticket back to visit for the break , and i spent the next four days as happy as i can remember , i hung out with my friends , saw and said hi to teachers , and spent an entire night out with my lady friend we went out to see a movie and went to barnes and noble and other fun things but after that visit things went downhill fast . still super sad in az , i started arguing with my parents more often , lady friend stopped talking to me , for various reasons , and i couldn  t get my shit together . i ended the year with one c , knocking my gpa down and my chance to get a full ride to nau . i decided to pack up myself and move in with some friends back at my previous school for my senior year , and while it  s been fun , i  ve been kind of emotionless the entire time . i see great things happening all around me , but i can never quite grasp the moment . i think my lingering relationship with my parents has to do with part of it .

3. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

4. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

5. you found a girl you enjoys soviet jokes ? i wish . such a dumb thing but i enjoy it anyway , man you just broke my heart . best thing you can do is just talk to her . by the sounds of it you may never see her again so what  s there to loose ey ? it would be ideal if you could just set a date that one day you two can meet up but that  s hard i know . at the same time life is full of those relationships that you are so unawarely fond of until they disappear . the worst part is sometimes you can  t save them . however those are the ones you cherish the most . don  t look at it on times missed out . you had a great time and should see it as that . it  s all about perspective . it  s only depressing because you see it that way . don  t forget to look at yourself from further away . i am a little depressed as are we all but i just imagine a camera zooming out from my view and into a third person view of me right now . then it just pans out as far as you can picture . it helps to just realise how small all these things you are worried about are . look at the whole picture instead of fixating on a single fault .

6. the guy is just bad at grammar and making coherent sentences , yet some people still believe that he will actually go and admit things like that to public .
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

7. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

8. hey . firstly you need to speak to someone be it a doctor or the samaritans , someone . secondly why are you looking up reasons instead of looking inwards and seeing what the actual issue is . do you have depression or something that maybe people around you don ' t know how to handle ? what kind of person are you ? are you kind ? thoughtful ? generous with your time ? empathetic ? honest ? nice ? these are all traits that people like . or are you selfish ? negative ? deceitful ? apathetic ? narcissistic ? irresponsible ? egotistical ? you can change your behaviour and your characteristics . you are not always going to be the person you perceive yourself to be now . everyone has the potential to change and grow . believe in yourself . only you have the ability to make yourself happy . don ' t depend on others to validate you . mind yourself .

9. life ain ' t what you think it is . find an older person you trust and listen .
   (ID: ae0b5b35ef79984eec810d26abc05e9a757ae0ca)

10. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .

11. since this platform is free for everyone to post and comment all kinds of things i won  t take your note on keeping my nose out especially from someone with attitude you possess . by all means you deserve to be called out and maybe you should take a note about changing your attitude towards others , because too much negativity is bad for everyone . i  m not american btw , stop assuming , looks like it  s not for you .

12. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

13. huh ? i did not say that . were you answering to a deleted comment ?
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

14. ok i ' m not putting anymore energy into this so there you win have your invisible winning points , now scream your extremist views somewhere else where neckbeards can bathe in it

15. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .

16. you should never give in to he demands of someone who asks you to choose your friends over him . i ' m sorry , but that is controlling , insecure behavior . you might " love " this guy but he ' s insecure and feels threatened by anyone who he doesn ' t directly control or have any influence over . think about that . do you really want to be with someone like that ? do you really love him that much ? what if this were your parents or your family who he objects to ? you seem like a nice person and if i were you i wouldn ' t give in to such egregious demands for anyone . you can do better . i hope that you do .

17. if they understand everything else i said , then they understand the last part too , they ' re just in denial .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

18. you deserve attention and love and happiness . you sound dedicated and committed and that ' s amazing . however , and i don ' t mean to sound rude , maybe family is not something to invest your efforts in . you matter . other ppl don ' t . don ' t be a devoted wife  mothehousewife if it makes you feel like you ' re just spread thin . maybe it ' s time to re  shift the paradigms so to speak . have you addressed the issue in your family ? stressed how underappreciated you feel ? if the ppl around you don ' t give anything back to you they are the wrong ppl . family isn ' t everything . marriage is a common cause of depression and self  loathing in women . while you ' re waiting for the current ppl on your life to show you that you matter you could easily replace them with others who really do care about you . eventually you might find that the greatest love you can ever experience is the love of you for yourself . find what makes you so unhappy . then iliminate it .
   (ID: f042043ff04e1f2bd28d7c34b7937eb8bf31c76e)

19. i have been in a similar situation . you just got paroled my friend . look at it this way . you can be happy now . that relationship ? that was never going to happen and your attachment was just going to make you more miserable as time went on . now you finally have the opportunity to find someone who will make you happy . you  re like truman burbank stepping out of the studio and into the real world .
   (ID: ead4924f7abc0f9258d2b484a3f379aedee2cc5c)

20. if you  re on a break it means you  re not together at the moment , right ? if you  re expected to continue to be faithful then i feel like instead if a break it  s better to work through things as a couple . i guess i don  t really get the idea of a  break  that  s not a break  up in a relationship . anyway , be transparent with her if the time comes that you discuss getting back together .
