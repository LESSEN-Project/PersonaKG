13. there probably won ' t be a ww3 in the old world , but the us has been slowly going back to isolationism , stocking up on weapons and is basically preparing to go against the whole world in my opinion . on the other hand , russia and the eu have been improving relations and are more or less dependent on each other the eu  economy quite literally depends on gazprom . also , russia has also been getting quite friendly with a lot of middle eastern and central asian countries , so it is possible that a large war breaks out , seeing as how the lines are pretty much drawn .

20. well i always walk into a room with my head held high and with purpose so i start off looking like i belong  have confidence . really watch how you present yourself , use your body language to exude confidence . one thing i try to do but is so hard is to make eye contact when speaking with others . when interacting with people , i try to stand still and not fidget with random shit like my hair , phone or whatever because that comes across as being anxious . one thing i do which isn  t the greatest is i act cocky and borderline conceded . it makes me feel better and people who know me know that i  m not being serious . but sometimes you really do start becoming this person you  re channeling .
