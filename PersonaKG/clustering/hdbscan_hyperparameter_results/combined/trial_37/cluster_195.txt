2. idk i ' m just being biased provably . recently in my area there is a digit year old boy that came out as trans and is being put on hormone therapy as an digit year old . that ' s just soo wrong . children should be learning and playing not declaring to the world that they are gay or bi or trans , you know ? harmless childhood crushes are one thing but openly embracing it at an age like digit or digit is just wrong .

7. and the brits had just gotten rid of slavery themselves . would have been a bit hard to sell why , exactly , all those boys would have been fighting for the ' peculiar institution ' in america . best decision in history was for the british empire to stay out of our civil war . since we ' re playing " what if "  if america hadn ' t had  won the revolution before digit  they might have had one  another one over slavery . that would have been an interesting situation .
