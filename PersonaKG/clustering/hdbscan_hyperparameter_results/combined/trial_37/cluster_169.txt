1. good question . seems to me like they might be able to answer quite a few of the questions around this case by discreetly placing a camera to catch whoever is desecrating the grave .

2. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .

3. hmmmm . what would be a good place ? get everyone to head out to a wheeling spot like hot springs ? i ' m not coming up with a good one between me and you .

4. does that include someone shooting heroin ? correct , i would not report someone to the police for shooting heroin .  you wouldn  t report that person for their own well being ? sending them to prison is not good for their well being . so again , i would not report them .  what do you define as a victimless crime ? a legal offense to which all parties consent and no party is injured .  instead of getting all defensive like a little soyboy you could have answered my sincere question . um . okay ?

6. i have done this . in highschool , me and my group of friends used to hangout , party , and usually end up crashing at each others places . i am half awake one morning , and my pen tip felt strangely good . open my eyes , it ' s literally rested between my buddies cheeks . i recoil , he ' wakes up ' like two minutes later , and never says anything . a few years later , comes out of the closet to his parents while he and i are in their car driving back to their place to spend the night and get the old crew back together . awkward .
