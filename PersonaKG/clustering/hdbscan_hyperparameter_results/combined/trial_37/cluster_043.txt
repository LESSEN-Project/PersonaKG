3. i think what he  s saying is misinterpreted . the horde has always been a family with honor bringing them together . it  s their appreciation for honor and spirit which guides them in accepting each other and bringing them closer . they  ve each faced oppression and fought to restore it . it  s the economy and empathy that brought goblins into the pool as well . i think what he  s getting at though , is  because we see sylvanas becoming more and more unpredictable  volatile burning down teldrasil  killing innocentshonorless targets there is turmoil in the horde . everyone is essentially watching her delve into madness and thinking  whoa hey that  s not cool  . literally this entire expansion has been saurfang and baine trying to stop sylvanas from her actions . they don  t mess with her entirely though because the honor that comes with vol  jin  s decision in appointing her as warchief . it  s kinda reminiscent to seeing a family member go way overboard and the rest of the family being put in a difficult decision . do we make the effort to bring this individual back to earth or do we separate ourselves ?

4. i ' ve never heard anything like that when it comes to innuendos . i think the person is just speaking nonsense . that ' s something i would do if i liked someone when i was younger . it ' s a lame attempt at flirting and the person probably gets enjoyment out of your confusion .

5. i ' ve never been on a cruise and i don ' t think i ever will . but that was damned entertaining . nawimsayin ?

   (ID: c9a98f7f4291c6c1eefeeaae838890408881f877)

8. that actually helps me more than you might think , its been eating at me because even though i have friends who cut i ' ve never met someone else who does this , so just knowing there ' s someone else helps .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

9. possibly it  s that then , i didn  t think i had particularly strong features , just a  standard  face if such a thing exists . quite possibly my personality has something to do with it as i  ve always been mature for my age .
