1. i  m talking about in a survival situation dumbass , also , do you not know that most of the police officers , firefighters , military personnel , construction workers , are men . the people that keep our countries safe from other countries are mostly men , they risk their lives so that we could live in a good , relatively safe country , first worlders have the privilege to live safely , a lot of us don  t even know what danger really is . do you want to live in constant fear in a war zone ? no . no one does , but that  s the life that people unfortunately live . no matter what anyone does , there will still be crime , there will still be bad people , and there will still be poverty .

2. funny that the place is so dirty yet people are alive ? or perhaps we live in a society controlled by chemical companies into thinking everything is out to kill us . i am far from saying i would go there but if you see an old person drinking that water , and they have been doing so all their life it makes you think .
