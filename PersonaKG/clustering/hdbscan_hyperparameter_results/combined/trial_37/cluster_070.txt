1. i totally agree ! it ' s hurtful and harmful for so many reasons and for everyone ! why does anyone want that straight bar right where the jumblies are !

2. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better

3. yea , you didnt answer the question . a drunk guy is held responsible for his actions if he is drunk and has sex with a drunk female . a drunk female cant give consent because shes not in her right mind but a drunk male is supposed to be in his right mind enough to know that the woman is too drunk to give consent . its a double standard that is ridiculous and you can down vote me all you want for it . but just answer the question , thats all i ask .

4. being a nice guy means you are helpful without expectations while " nice guy " is being helpful only to those you want something from . ex . you hold the door for a girl and expect her to have sex with you right there and then
