2. it seems rather unlikely that a full  scale war will happen . no one knows for sure of course , but north korea ' s ultimate goal is state survival beyond anything else . the us will respond to any attack with the destruction of the regime , which is something they don ' t want to deal with . the concern is that if the us strikes thousands will die , and we will be left with a major refugee crisis .

4. sure do . and then you also risk having someone see that you haven ' t touched that juicy last bite yet and assumes you must not want it . they might try to steal it from you . this causes table fights . but ofc i wouldn ' t be brining no spoon to a knife fight . especially if its my last bites i ' m fighting for smiling  face  with  horns
