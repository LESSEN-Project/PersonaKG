3. i havent experienced this myself purely , but i got lectured by my mom ' s colleague about it . apparently robbers just hand a sticky note to the bank teller sayain , " i have a gun . give me money " and if the teller tries to resist , they will be fired because if they get hurt , that hurts the bank ' s image . usually , the teller would just give the robber  digit or so and the police would find the criminal later . so no . it is absolutely nothing like how the media portrays it .
