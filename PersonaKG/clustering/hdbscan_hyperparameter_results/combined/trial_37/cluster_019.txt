1. go and be supportive . say nothing that would be upsetting to them . that ' s what friends do . a funeral is not the time or place for you to express your views . it ' s not about you in the least .

2. while i agree somewhat to the fact that hispanics like to fuck . i find it a bit distasteful to say that the problem is with hispanics . not with retarted white christians . who are too dumb to realize that their children are going to fuck regardless of what they ' re told . so hey lets get them to put on a jimmiehat

3. i would say that has some truth to it . shows and movies are getting more realistic and we realize that life doesn  t always have a happy ending but there  s still a story to be told . if look back to  50s   80s , almost every movie that depicts the future was very vibrant and colorful and everyone was happy . but in today  s cinema every time we see the future on screen it  s dark and dismal and destroyed . something to think about

4. i was ringside , and saw things that cannot be unseen . the way the room was set up , i had no choice but to see what was going on . all i can say is that i give women some serious credit for childbirth .

5. exactly , you ' re not here to entertain me , but this post was meant to entertain whether or not it ' s for easy karma is a different matter . this is the first time i saw this , and judging from all the up doots , i ' d say i ' m not the only one . nothing is original because someone is always going to say it first , all that matters is how and when you do it .

6. im diagnosed with anxiety and all i have to say is a couple things . i used to have panic attacks everyday . it was the worst years of my life . there is no way to get rid of anxiety . everytime i see someone ask " how do you get rid of anxiety " i just tell them my story and say there is no way . ive had it for so long that i get used to it . im aware its not going to go away . i listen to music , that helps . i meditate , hard but helps . i paint my nails and chill .

7. lol what are you going to say ? just straight up ask  what are your views on feminism ?  you think a guy that wants to have sex with you is going to say  oh i hate women  ?

8. i would say this is now my favourite audio on here , but i am still determined to get through your jerk off contestpart digit without having to hold back almost the entire time . your voice is perfect both for submission to the bull , and humiliating  dominating the husband . your cute but evil laugh is perfect for cuckolding . i keep looking forward to your new posts .
