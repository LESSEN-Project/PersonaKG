1. i found it when i became independent . everyone has their own way of finding their self worth that correlates with their personality , soul , etc . i don  t usually like to think that way , i like to think more like   with all my flaws my ups and downs , it makes me who i am and i love myself for it .  some albums  love yourself  answer , love yourself  tear , and you never walk alone are some albums i highly recommend .
