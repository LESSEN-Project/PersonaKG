3. that ' s really interesting thank you ! in my mind i always believe that businesses would seek vc but it ' s really interesting that they proactively seek you out , which kind of makes sense because if i had a shed load of cash to invest i wouldn ' t be sat around waiting for the golden goose . good luck in your business , it ' s a fantastic idea !

4. i saw a comment on a post recently imagine your lonely dying breaths , ending with you feeling comforted by what you feared most your entire life . get out there and face your fears , because behind all of them is a chance to gain new perspective and expand it and really grow and learn . our fears force us into our  comfort  zones , es little stimulation in comfort . anyways i  m rambling good night victory  hand  dark  skin  tone
