2. wow ! that ' s a lot lol thank you . i own a aspire breeze and it says on the packaging that i should not go over 70vg or 6mg . so after reading this i could go past digit but it would just take more time to wick ?

3. this one time me and two of my friends were all hanging out on a weekend off school . we went down to the basement of the place i was staying at , a little before noon to play horde mode on gears of war digit which had just come out a little while later we decided to come back up and see about ordering a pizza or something for dinner somehow it was digit  digit in the morning and we  d just completely lost track of time  there were no windows in the basement and no clocks , so when we were expecting to come up in time to see the sun getting low , we got hit with the really bright morning sun . all three of us just kinda went  oh damn it  s late  and wandered home

4. i agree with this digit  . when i put my blinker on to get over , more than half the time , the person i ' m trying to get over in front of speeds up to stop me from getting over . so i just quit using them .

5. . so ? i don ' t recycle . why should i conserve the planet for a bunch of assholes making billions exploiting it ? just give them more time to do what they please ? what ' s my " contribution " gonna do , compared to an oil spill ? what ' s my carbon footprint compared to a multinational ' s empire ? fiat iustitia , et pereat mundus .

6. yes it sucks and having digit  learnings to complete is a bit much . they are there for a reason and if you just skip through without retaining any if the knowlage idk what kind of employee you would be . just take them one at a time .
