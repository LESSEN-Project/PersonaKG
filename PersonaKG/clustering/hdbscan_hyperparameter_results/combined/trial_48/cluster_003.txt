   (ID: e3aadeaf18df437e62f5c1614d251bf343fd2de2)

11. i  m sorry , but it does have to do with religion . it was largely a rejection of paganism by the levites that brought it to the forefront of judeo  christian  morality  . it was reinforced throughout greece and rome by the spread of christianity and wedged its way through northern european society by way of brute force and religious indoctrination . it may have started as a cultural phenomenon , but it only held on through the passing of religion as if that was ever a passive process , but that  s a totally different conversation . to argue it has nothing to do with religion is as intellectually dishonest as it is historically inaccurate .

12. no , sorry i mixed them up , it ' s the hero power .

15. you ' re not a coward . thankfully this man was harmless , but the truth is that he could have been a horrible person . tomorrow , bake some cookies , and introduce yourself to your neighbors . learn who they are , and get a feel of the area . it ' s always best to be safe , rather than sorry .

18. text this girl while stone cold sober ! and apologize for sending her the text . admit that you were wasted and that it was irresponsible and disrespectful of you to send the text . apologize and ask her if she can forgive you . if you do this you will be admiting that you did something wrong and that you ' re truly sorry that it happened . even if she doesn ' t respond at least you can take solace to the fact that you owned up to it and are sorry .
