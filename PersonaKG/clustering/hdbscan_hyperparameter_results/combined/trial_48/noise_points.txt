1. i still think it ' s pretty impressive for how long they survived considering that basically every single brit was hunting them down . the bismarck wasn ' t only about sea superiority , but it was also a psychological weapon . the big bad wolf , the bogeyman under europe ' s bed . i know it ' s easy to lose a ship at sea but it still amazes me .

4. digit is the legal drinking age for most provinces of canada . digit is the celebrated milestone , but so is digit because the states is right below us . for me , kissing draws the big distinction on what would transpire between myself and my . er . partner . take white . i had major major feelings for him and i told him so after kissing him . his response ? word for word  " don ' t say that " . i ' m trying to understand how some people can just walk into a club  bawhatever purely for the intent of sex and they don ' t care who with . maybe i ' m just super picky , i dunno .

5. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

6. i have been in a similar situation . you just got paroled my friend . look at it this way . you can be happy now . that relationship ? that was never going to happen and your attachment was just going to make you more miserable as time went on . now you finally have the opportunity to find someone who will make you happy . you  re like truman burbank stepping out of the studio and into the real world .

   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

10. this found it randomly i guess he was japanese ? more of a poetic story . i dont know where to start . i was a weird kid had very few friends i transferred to a prepatory school where i was very joyful and joined a lot of events . i was stupid back then i had an less than the average toddlers intelligence made friends in a weird way as in not how you should ' ve interacted with complete strangers . i had fights and i was given too many chances to improve myself , like everybody is keeping me at easy mode even if i wanted to go normal . i switched to a public school because she was too worried abiut how to balance work and me the public school was a lot closer to where she worked . out of nowhere my social anxieties hit me like a truck , i didn ' t know anyone nor have any idea on what topic to start a conversation . then i thought that i should be myself and that is when everything went down f    ing hill . i did tons of weird a      t like i was autistic and stuff . my grades , my sanity and my social status suffered like hell i dropped like a bomb in through grand canyon , deeper and lower than i expected at fifth grade i never knew that it hit me like a baseball bat that i had depression , earlier than the normal basis like about digit  digit but the more i didn ' t know i had this the more it grew and affected medepression at my years was really uncommon i literally and socially closed doors to my few friend that i had . i only had one he stuck to me even i was socially and mentally weird he still still stuck with me . after a year of hell we finally graduated i never wanted to have any photos of my and my classmates but they still forced me to do it and bailed as soon as the camera flashed . i don ' t want anyone to know who i am and have any memory of me because it would be a waste of time and brain cells . me and my friend went to the same prepatory school from elementary to senior students . at the first day i made the god damn worst first impression of my life , the stupidest thing to imagine and it left my all  so  broken mind more broken than before then those boken peices were broken into more broken peices the more the year went on . i was bullied , humiliated , and teased in front of me and behind my back . the amount of sanity that i have left in my crippling mind and body was no more than a pile of dust . the amount bloodshed i wanted to do in those times , the murderous intent , the temptation to kill and torture them like they did to me . after the third period of my school i didn ' t show that much amount emotion just to hide the temptation to kill , my friend kept checking on me like i mattered the more he checked on me the less i wanted to torture someone . the bloodlust went away like it was a gentle breeze , but the depression didn ' t , from that day froward i wanted to make people happy even if it mean ' t to destroy of whats left of my reputation , the already destroyed mind of a person trying to make others happy despite the pain it felt , making them happy and having depression balanced each other out . my friend inspired me to be a better person by not verbally saying it but by showing it to me . thank you  from

11. as newly single father of three in my thirties , i can give you my impression of online dating because it really wasn  t a thing before i was married . i feel few people take online dating apps seriously , especially men . for the same reason there is so much acrimony on facebook and twitter . it  s a place where you can do or say anything with little to no consequence , and unfortunately , it seems the most vocal  active are the ones who get a thrill out of that . i  m kind of old fashioned , and i am saddened by the amount of women who become surprised and impressed that i didn  t just send them a picture of my manhood ! that  s alarming to me , and it is a terrible precedent that has been set . i didn  t spend much time doing online dating because it feels the same as being in a shady neighborhood . and i  m willing to bet there are a bunch of decent guys in their thirties who have done the same thing . i would much rather do the things that make me who i am , and happen across a beautiful woman doing the same things . sure , being in person makes it a little uncomfortable at first , but that  s part of the fun of flirting with strangers , right ! and if that makes me  old  , so be it man  shrugging

14. i wouldn  t say your original post came off as humble . i didn  t think it was arrogant though . all i have to say is , if the women that you  re talking to desire you more when you  re being a jerk , they must have no self  esteem .
   (ID: 256407c5e6c8d9342d8aabf5c9c392fc179ba9f3)

15. you didn ' t understand . not an issue my friend . let me say it again for you . there ' s a site that high school kids use , it ' s called hidden answers . i ' m pretty sure you must have heard of it . pretty boring site . on the site , you ask questions . and a person , understandably , had asked a question . me , being a nice and polite person , pursued to answer the question , which was regarding a not very well known library site . i was shocked that someone else knew about it , so i went to answer it . the question was regarding the link and any mirrors that could be used . note  as i ' m sure you ' d know , onion sites are jumbled up letters and numbers . i did not know what this link truly was but i did assume it was to a site that i had visited numerous times before . clicked the link , and up came a forum for child abuse . the literature was very detailed . no media content , so just headlines and the names of other child abuse sites . there was lots of them . it was not nice . it was very descriptive . lots of sites . hundreds , maybe thousands i ' m not sure . i don ' t know the legitimacy of these sites . i did not click them . but i do assume they were real . i hope i cleared this up for you my friend just remember , be polite . you don ' t know what others are going through . if you don ' t believe someone , ask them for proof . but do not accuse them of horrible things . it really is not nice . i hope you have a good day , stay blessed

18. well , sometimes we dislike something and we don ' t know why but we need to dig deep to figure out the cause . let ' s do that . tell me how it makes you feel when you encounter a woman who has piercings . are you revolted ? what thoughts go through your mind . what do you think ? maybe we can get to the heart of it .
