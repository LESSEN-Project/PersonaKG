5. ah yes , the worldwide  feared british nukes would totally scare russia into submission , it ' s not like russia has c  300s that are proven to be capable of stopping nato ' s balistic missiles or anything like that . also , if russia were to produce just one more tsar bomba  class nuke and drop it on top of the british isles , the uk is gone and so is ireland , the northern part of france , the benelux and possibly parts of nothwestern germany .
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

   (ID: 1885b01dd0970230fea2a9c9ae9c4eaeaceb59a3)

   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

9. they why has the whole logo changed at the top of box changed ? marvel bobble heads do not change like this . for example , you have the punisher funko pop . there are a few different versions . the marvel logo remains the same , but they just put the different version in in brackets by the name . ie ' the punisher thunderbolts '
   (ID: 03bd0b4bb3465eba83e1c9a00af15f7b35f1ec6d)

14. real are worse than atleti at the moment . even on paper , atleti seems stronger . real just has many players who peaked a couple seasons back like kroos , modric , marcelo , ramos and carvajal , and have become very inconsistent now . add to that permanently inconsistent players like isco , vazquez , etc . and compare them to atleti ' s squad .
   (ID: 798fc9f22ec2a1c21f6d387916d4d56336b802ef)

15. stumbling through the club , the lights strobing so i can ' t see where my feet are planted and it feels like my body is being chopped up into different sections , and this songhttps    just blaring . finally unable to keep my balance , i accidentally pitch forward , i fall down . and someone turns up the music .
   (ID: a3c37892d1eb5776c9a4299ce29fc6200c20dd34)

16. a bot from this subreddit automatically posted this on photosfromthe1920s or something like that so now there  s a bunch of black and white picks and then there  s just this
   (ID: 95583dff17d109cd099c45c49642d5da447bf632)

   (ID: 29b9b56e163cbfecbc98e83c436b436aca056a8c)

19. i just chose the movie i like . and i am not being racist . i dont find the race appeal for bploved it as a ' marvel ' movie as racism is not part of my upbringing . also , i am brown .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)
