9. yeah i ' m really sorry dude . this is often how it happens with something prescribed . it works really well to treat a symptom , but then it turns recreational . the only way i can put this is that you have to allow yourself to suffer . i ' m not sure if you have to be absolutely miserable during your break while your throat is healing but you have to give yourself permission to feel worse before you start feeling good again . as with lots of medicines that treat the symptom well , ironically they don ' t tackle the cause . without alcohol , do whatever you can to knock yourself out . use valerian , or make a pot cookie . do whatever you can to sedate yourself and don ' t use uppers . then , when you are all healed you can use recreationally without such a large concern for your health . you do need to stop though , strep is horrendous . you have to get out of your own way .

16. my second year of college a girl named alice fake name took my water bottle . sounds weird but stick with me on this . it was sitting next to me and i left it at my desk while i went to bathroom halfway through class . after i came back it was sitting a little closer to alice than it was to me but i didn ' t notice too much . class ends , everyone leaves , and a few of us start talking about weekend plans . and alice is holding the bottle . i thought " oh i forgot that and she ' s kindly returning it to me . sweet " nope . suddenly she takes a massive gulp out of the bottle . a bottle that i got for free from the lunch room . filled with water that was from the free drinking fountain digit feet outside the classroom . my friend greg fake name is the next one to notice and asks " isn ' t that jen ' s water " alice responds " oh , i thought somebody had left it from the last class . oops " cue another large gulp . greg is instantly disgusted and very confused . he rightly starts asking wtf ? alice tries to defend herself with " it ' s no big deal " and " finders keepers " and the perfectly reasonable " yolo . keep in mind , alice is a sophomore college student who has lived a completely normal american life as far as i know of . five minutes into this discussion , alice gets angry enough to leave in the middle of greg ' s sentence about personal space . no apology . no hint that she understand why it ' s wrong . next day she acted like nothing had ever happened . tl  dr girl in my college doesn ' t understand that stealing free water from other students for no reason is kind of weird .
