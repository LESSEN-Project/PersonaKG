1. i would certainly agree with you on healthcare although from an outsider looking in it seems a very controversial topic in your country but to most non americans your health care is lunacy especially when we see medical bills running into the hundreds of thousands although i ' m do appreciate some of these may be dramatised for upvotes i was explaining an american colleague a short while ago that we are entitled to at least digit months off full pay for maternity leave , she was gobsmacked .

2. no , only sticking to " the evidence " at the exclusion of personal experience is where things go awry , you limit yourself and others , and science becomes your master god instead of science being your tool . look , the reason we keep demanding evidence is based on one simple premise .   x200b  people can be wrong .   x200b  do you disagree with that ? you can be wrong . i can be wrong . preachers can be wrong , science teachers can be wrong . anyone can be wrong at any time about anything . everyone  is  wrong about  something  at any given time . i ' m probably wrong about lots of things .   x200b  which is why   verifiable evidence   is the superior method of figuring out what is true , instead of personal anecdote . evidence that can be verified by anyone , and everyone can draw the same conclusion from . that is part of the scientific process known as peer review , where your work is scrutinized and quested by your peers to find out where you are wrong .   x200b  no one single persons anecdotal experience determines truth . nobodys . not mine , not yours , not anyones . only what can be verified to be true via demonstrable evidence can be considered " true . i don ' t claim to have the whole truth . i don ' t claim anyone has the whole truth because nobody does . but we can figure out what is true by doubt , scrutiny , and skepticism . that ' s why we are able to plug our electronics in to our walls and power our devices . it ' s why we have gps , and medicine and vaccines . our entire modern world was built on doubt , skepticism , and science .   x200b  science gave us literally every aspect of our modern world . it is demonstrably true . and i would accept that as a " god " though i would never call it a god , because thats stupid , rather than some ancient fables , or someone ' s lsd trip .

3. i am trying to show you how i feel when you tell me to do something because of your " lord " i won ' t stop cursing until you give me a fucking reason other than a deity with a debatable existence said it isn ' t okay . why don ' t you try and help those over at atheism or at least get some questions answered by somebody smarter than me ? many people there are smarter than me .

4. if it hurts someone , it ' s wrong . just the golden moral rule . you know , general moral principles are same for all people . anyway , i don ' t need a god watching me to understand that murder or rape is wrong and helping people and making them feel better is right . make love not war .  . also my atheism helps me easily accept some progressive modern trends  i support lgbt rights , feminism and sexual education , for example , while these things are considered as sins in many religions . also , it ' s interesting , i read somewhere , that there ' s a bigger percentage of religious people in prison that in the society . i don ' t remember the numbers exactly , but it ' s probably about digit , digit  atheists among the prisoners and digit  in general in the us

5. oh i miss what unpopular opinion was chocked full of this juice . though i seriously gotta side with you . some men and women simply are attracted to children . having those thoughts alone does no hurt expect , potentially to the thinker but it ' s only when actions are sought that justice is needed . for example i guarantee there have been multiple times you ' ve thought of killing someone . isn ' t that just as bad if not worse than rape ? so why isn ' t that condemned

6. so it ' s okay to take people ' s rights away as long as they don ' t get angry about it . i am learning so many things today . thank you . you ' ve explained something to me that i didn ' t understand until now .
   (ID: 98df62eadd0a0c80a6084d5e352985209b46cce9)

7. it ' s just that you refused to address my points or say anything but lol you are stupid , since you are so far beneath me and you lack the intellectual capacity for rational discussion i have moved on to doing something better with my time . you know it as well as i do that socialism will when you ' re watching it happen on tv every day and you ' re burned up with impotent rage . i don ' t give a shit what you say about me because i have people in my life who actually love me and care about me unlike trump supporters who are disowned by their own children do to how awful they are .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

8. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .

9. so tell me child . how much joy do you get out of this ? and it seems as though you ' ve forgotten there is a world outside of america . where left and right wings protest peacefully , intellectually an through many generations . you seem , perspectively through your comments on this thread alone . like nothing more than an imbecile , a child , an idiot . i hope you come to learn one day that there are benefits to all sides of the political compass . and if your narrow . you ' ll only lead to a narrow mid which in all cases . is simply , useless . good day

10. i haven ' t told what you can and can ' t find funny , i ' ve told you what is innapropriate to say , there ' s a difference . when i said it was a joke , you said this  " no , it ' s not . jokes are meant to be funny to more people than just you . " sure you might not be saying that i didn ' t find it funny , but you were saying that no one else finds it funny . which is wrong . you are wrong .  my actions here were mostlt for the benefit of the op . you ' re words most likely bothered them in a big way , and as well as wanting to stand up to someone behaving like you did , i also wanted to show the op that someone would stand up for them and hopefully counter how you made them feel . a person on the internet who is mature enough will understand that most people will be sarcastic when given the chance . especially since he didn ' t put a " serious " tag on his post . my comment was very much clearly a joke , made obvious by the exclamation point . the fact that you got so triggered by it just highlights your immaturity and inability to recognise jokes on the internet . you might find that this flaw , this cluelessness to social cues , is one of the reasons you were bullied .  think what you want of my actions , i feel like i did the right thing . you didn ' t do anything wrong . you are just acting like a stuck up bitch . you ' re like that one person that always takes a joke seriously , gets offended because it isn ' t a " clean joke " and complains about it while other people just laugh .  and well done for admitting you made a dick move , most people don ' t have the balls to go back and admit a mistake . no need to congratulate me on something everyone like me will do , this is just showing how naive you are . there is no mistake , there never was a single mistake . i am a dick . people like me will always admit to acting like a dick . why do you think i do the things i do ? i ' m not oblivious like you .

11. i don ' t care what they prefer , to be frank . shemale is unacceptable but ladyboy is . just imagine the logic in that when shemale is slightly more accurate . if you can ' t use logic to help facilitate your mental illness , then you probably shouldn ' t transition to begin with . i will say this though . trans chicks may be fast approaching the point of no return in telling their difference from biological women , but they still tend to be more humble than said women . i ' d sooner trust one of them not to steal from me than i would a natural woman . because they actually have to work to look how they want . a biological woman hasn ' t worked a day in her life .

12. morality ? politics ? if a woman decides she wants an abortion then she should get an abortion . it ' s none of our business . who cares about the colors of fetuses ? let ' s say you ' re a busdriver and there are digit black people and digit white people on the bus . why would you feel the need to kick digit black people off or lure digit more white people in ? who cares except for maybe people with ocd ? things are what they are .

13. for one  you didn  t answer my question . but my point  is not that it makes me uncomfortable . my point is that laws , rights , privileges , and all governing cannot be based on a subjective  feeling  regardless of how deeply rooted it is . if i can be ticketed for using the wrong pronoun in cities like toronto , where does it stop ? does nobody get that  s it  s not always about the specific example  situation at hand but a bigger picture ? for fuck sake , it  s a slippery slope . years ago people were saying  what  s next , defending pedophiles ?  and look . exactly what is happening i don  t give a fuck how you feel or what you do , but you get the same set of rules i do . and back to my original point  the left is so  science science science  but basic fucking biology is literally ignored to appease people  s  deeply rooted sexual bullshit .  just wait , you will see how this is not about who cuts their dick off and wears a dress but an endless rabbit hole of subjective legislation .

14. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

15. right , because one gender has medication for a thing and the other doesn ' t , but it ' s all sciences fault , our people aren ' t smart enough to figure it out . sure we can fly in space but equal reproductive control ? pssshh . you can see how that isnt a chip on my shoulder , right ? like everyone thinks everything has to be personal , but . maybe it doesnt . maybe i just look at it and see one gender being pressured to use bc but the other doesn ' t even have the option . and i think it sucks ! i think it would be way easier if we could choose who got to use bc . maybe it doesn ' t work well for someone so the other does it . but it ' s not like that . it ' s a condom or female bc , or you are screwed . and the fact that we didn ' t even start until relatively recently , is more evidence to the fact . things won ' t be solved overnight . hell i ' m happy i can vote and live by myself without a caretaker man . but it is a process . saying it isn ' t a gender issue is ignorant , because it kind of is . either you just aren ' t listening , or you just don ' t care .

16. really , i have to thank you for the exchange we ' ve had . i intend to share it with as many people as i can . my friends all over the internet , my peers at work , and all the folks i have contact with on social media . i plan to share it with strangers at every opportunity . and you know what , those folks will share it with their friends and acquaintances . it will go far and wide . on and on . all over the country . look back at the lengths you ' ve stretched to bend reality because of your obsession with guns . the facts you ' ve attempted to dismiss because they don ' t square in a gun nuts head . the reality that americans kill eachother with guns more than any other developed nation . that america leads the world in mass shootings . keep hunting your hogs as the world looks back at you with disgust and pity . i should feel sorry for you but i don ' t . i have common sense and you do not . this is the last time i ' ll be responding to the nonsense you post . just know that you ' ve provided me with enough evidence to convince all those that have yet to be subjected to the garbage you and your ilk spew to reject it on a logical and factual basis . sleep on that . like i said earlier . thank you . your posts are nonsensical and increasingly bizarre . you have confirmed to me and to all that i intend to share this exchange with lol , which is a hell of a lot that gun nuts are real and are preposterous . so in love with the ability to create death that the essence of living is total lost to them . thank you . you have gone beyond proving any point i wished to make . once more . the gun control lobby have nothing to fear from you and will soon see their advocacy pay dividends because of crusading sophists like you leading the charge .

17. but reddit is a place where people care more about being morally right than factually correct . how dare you prove them wrong !
   (ID: d048a45810866f7b853972f50c2c2746bc339a21)

18. read  watch the fucking news . you sound like a total fucking idiot when you don ' t know what the fuck is going on around you and you make so many fucking stupid political statements when you don ' t fucking know what ' s fucking happening . don ' t correct me on something that you don ' t have a fucking clue about . fucking damnit .

19. the only reason we have more shootings is because we have the right to bear arms , and almost digit times the population of the uk at least we don ' t have fucking acid attacks in broad daylight where police don ' t do shit and can ' t do shit because they don ' t have anything to protect themselves or civilians besides a glorified bat and a taserwhich hardly ever works . not to mention that the us healthcare system , i agree the us is overly expensive , but it attracts the best doctors based on pay . what ' s the point of paying for a doctor if you ' re not gonna wake up after surgery . the government shutdown has literally done jack shit , and is completely and utterly useless . it hasn ' t changed anything of any importance . we have the most powerful military in the world , were not warmongering , the us goes after high priority targets that european countries cannot track down because their limited spending co tributes to poor technology in comparison .

20. ok i ' m not putting anymore energy into this so there you win have your invisible winning points , now scream your extremist views somewhere else where neckbeards can bathe in it
