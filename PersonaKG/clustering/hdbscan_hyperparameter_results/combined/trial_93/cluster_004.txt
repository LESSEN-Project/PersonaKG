1. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

2. i read , " however , she does seem to assume i don  t know what i am doing at all "  if my daughter was digit with a baby i would assume the same . being a parent is a major responsibility , i currently have digit . i ' m in college as well , and i ' m almost twice your age . college is literally the only thing i have the energy for outside of motherhood , i can ' t imagine what you would want to go out and do that your mother is like , " no , no , no " to .   x200b  as far as getting your mom to give you more freedom , she ' s probably afraid you ' re going to go out and get pregnant again  it ' s a very valid fear . she questions your judgement , your ability to be responsible . what she has to go on is you getting pregnant at digit . your first decision as an adult was to become a parent , it sounds like she ' s afraid you will continue to make decisions that have her questioning whether or not you are capable to live an adult life where you can make rational decisions for yourself .

3. from what i understood is that you ' re wife is basically boycotting you in bed for weeks at a time . you should know that according to the hadith , the angels curse her until dawn for that and she is constantly sinning . your ' fantasy ' about getting a second wife is not haram . allah has made it halal for a reason , and if you can fulfill the requirements , go for it ! otherwise , this can be reasonable grounds for divorce . allahu ' alam .

4. first , i don ' t think you ' re stupid . so many people send and receive naked pictures every single day , myself included . i send them with the knowledge that the person i send them to may very well use them or keep them for whatever reason . from your post it doesn ' t seem like you did anything heinous that he might try to use them against you . i think the most you have to be concerned about at this point is him using your pictures to pleasure himself to . he might always keep them . while i delete any risque photos of other guys when i start talking to  dating someone new , i know guys that i ' ve sent pictures  videos to in the past have kept mine . maybe i ' m just weird and lucky that no one has used them against me , but i kind of find it flattering when a guy admits to me he ' s kept my pictures  videos for years . the only time i feel bad about it is when i know they have a girlfriend . i think that ' s just disrespectful . it sounds like he didn ' t respect you , so he very well might keep them . just know that you are not stupid . you presented him with the option to do the right thing and he didn ' t . that doesn ' t diminish your character , it diminishes his .

5. hey , first off , i wanna thank you for being real with how you feel . and congrats to losing 90lbs , that ' s absolutley insane ! the first thing i thought of was the concept of " stinkin thinkin " and how our mind sometimes plays sick games on us by saying we are " not good enough " in reference to tinder , , , anyone can make a profile so why would you deny yourself the opportunity to have one if you want one and try it . you may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome . but it starts with you making one and knowing that if others can have it , you can too . also youre so young that you can bounce outta this mindset . first i would take your chance on the girl you want . ask her to the gym or something , and if that doesnt work , go in on the tinder and try what have you got to lose ? nothin , but a mindset that needs updated . im sorry if thats harsh because i do empathize feeling that way , because ive been there but ive found the way out too by putting one foot in front of the other and takin that chance with a girl . i believe in you bruddah

6. should i tell her ?
   (ID: 6212c082850f067a67618ad2a3b9f8ed336590f4)

7. honestly yeah i think you ' re kind of an asshole . men are always much more likely to leave their significant others due to illness  here we go , another example of it . like the girl you ' re meant to love could have something terribly wrong with her and you ' re out here just thinking about yourself and any future  key word future  kids ? come on dude . if you do break up with her because of this , i want you to look her dead in the eye and say " i can ' t deal with you being sick , and that ' s why i ' m leaving you "

8. if things change that quick there is a hidden reason for it . maybe something like a better option if she was seeing someone else around you and you were a close second . maybe an ex contacted her again . maybe there was an aspect in your later talks that she couldn ' t get past . either way i think it ' s a lack of communication on her side as to what the reasoning for the drastic shift was . luckily you were early into it and minimal damage is done . one thing i ' ve always told myself and kind of my own line " expectation only leads to disappointment . " remember that , if it ' s expected and happens , it ' s nothing special . if it doesn ' t happen then it ' s only negative emotions .

9. i feel like you don ' t understand anything about the human mind . you are objectively wrong , yes i am now talking facts not opinion just to be clear . when someone is in a relationship their brain becomes attached in certain ways after experiencing things so for an example , you cuddle with your girlfriend and you two both enjoy that , then your brain will start to crave that to fell good , but if your girlfriend stops cuddling with you , you and or your brain might feel like now it needs more out of the relationship to feel good because it ' s missing that important piece , cuddling . now after a long while your brain will instinctively tell you and make sure you know and are aware that you need to cuddle to feel good , so now instinctively your brain will want you to find someone else to cuddle with , but but you still love and adore your girlfriend but she isn ' t giving you everything out of the relationship so you need someone else to fill the gaps , it ' s usually not something someone can just control . people don ' t just cheat cuz they think it ' s fun , unless if they are clinically insane or extremely sadistic . usually another factor in cheating is that your brain doesn ' t want to ask for it from your partner because you may think you might not ever get it from them . cheating is still fucked up and wrong but you need to understand all of that before saying anything

10. she  s taking my advice and basically just dropping subtle hints to see if she is bi or gay . asking her outright could go multiple ways and , like you , doesn  t wanna risk her friendship but is contemplating if it  s worth the risk since if she is bi or gay they might end up in a relationship . so it  s a difficult scenario . see what kinda friends she hangs out with since gays tend to congregate in my experience and find out what her previous relationships were like if she  s had any . so far it  s going pretty well and hannah is pretty sure she  s bi but still needs to find out more before she moves forward with it . oh yeah i actually had a situation similar to that with my partner , neither of us knew if the other was gay or straight or not . i  m pan so and i  ve dated girls and guys in the past , they  ve dated only one girl and regretted the relationship . after i found out they were pan too because i noticed a lot of their friends were gay , they had an even amount of girl to guy friends , they never denied being gay , etc so i asked them out and apparently they liked me for months on end . now we  re in an almost three year relationship . i hope all goes well for you smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

11. oof , as a woman i suggest you not to spoil women that much , some of us get used to get all we want and then it ' s really hard to get on track again . not my case , i made clear to my boyfriend we are equal and he can count on me as much as i can count on him . i suggest you to talk to her and give her an ultimatum , you should take care of her but she ' s abusing it and not thanking what you do for her . obviously you need to change this , and don ' t have any kids for now , neither more pets or expenses . that wouldn ' t be good for the kids or you .

12. i don ' t know about the falling in love and all that . but if you ' re looking for advice take it from someone digit years older than you . forget about her . don ' t even think about it anymore . you ' re young as fuck and there ' s plenty of women out there . and don ' t fall in love .

13. ahhhhh . that  s not okay . i mean i get that there are stay at home moms and all the power to them , but to rely on someone to keep you fed and clothed and then treat them like shit . i am a stay at home mom . who works a full time job out of our home as well as a part time job for a family member  s business . i might not have lunch packed for him every day , but he has food to eat and a decently clean house and love and respect  which i also have . it  s kinda sad for your ex wife tho  she hasn  t been able to let go and enjoy her life because she  s too busy being a shit .

14. compulsions we love have a way of becoming obsessions we hate . you ' re impulsive , have better things to do , and are probably just very very young and not getting out enough . date people , go to social functions , go to the gym , do actual drugs like normal people .

15. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .

16. yeah this is bad man . very bad . that ' s emotional cheating . it ' s legitimate cheating . you ' ve known for a while that your wife loves attention from men . this is problematic . i think the best solution is separation and possibly divorce . you said it yourself , you feel like the bond that you had with her has been broken . don ' t think twice about it because christmas is around the corner . your wife is a cheater . she requires validation from other men that aren ' t her husband . you were there every night after work for her when you were newlyweds . it ' s never good enough for her . you deserve better , op .

17. yes , she does have a job . it ' s minimum wage but it seems like i have no other options ? we have to move out for a year because that ' s how long session digit will help for , so i guess my hands are tied ?
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

18. it ' s hard to give advice because everyone handles this sort of thing differently . we went through three miscarriages , but they were all before our first child , so for us , there wasn ' t any question of trying again . for some people , it helps to start trying again right away . some want to wait for awhile before trying again . it ' s probably best to give it some time , for your wife to get back to normal physically , and for you both to heal emotionally . make sure she knows you ' re there to support her , but don ' t smother here either , give her space if she needs it . and always keep in mind , that unless she has an underlying health problem which it doesn ' t sound like is the case since you already have two kids , miscarriages are random occurrences , and aren ' t likely to happen with the next pregnancy .

19. hey brother . you are not the only one who has experienced shitty women . i  m prior service army , medically retired . i used to be a cavalry scout . when i came home from my third deployment , i thought everything was great . for a few months even . until a mutual friend suggested that i check my wife . i wasn  t convinced , but i checked her email one time and was horrified by what i found . she had been with at least two people , had unprotected sex i know this because several of the emails was her asking both of them for money so she could pay for an abortion , and was continuing to cheat even when i was back home . we don  t always like to admit it man law or something , but when you are betrayed by someone with whom you have bonded with , it really freaking hurts . and there is nothing wrong with that , it just means you are a decent person . you  re doing the right thing by getting it off your chest . don  t feel ashamed , that is not your cross to bear . follow the advice of some previous commenters and make your place your own . have a few good buddies over or go out and get to know yourself again . you have been given an opportunity to free yourself from a toxic relationship and to learn from the past . hold your head high , and know , that just like in the military , there are countless men and women to the left and right of you , who are going through the same thing , and will happily help you too your feet again when the burden brings down .

20. you only live once . i say ignore these folks and do what makes you happy . time is precious . if you  re unhappy , try a  trial separation  after explaining to your wife why you need it . date the other girl then weight the pros and cons of each option . at least you  ve aired what your wife is doing that makes you unhappy and are giving her a chance as well .
