2. look at the sun first . then look at the data of the other planets in the solar system . you may find that there might be something similar going on ? you may also want to look into nasa ' s current observations on sunspots and solar activity and the average temperatures since this sun cycle ended . either your suv is reaching and has changed the heat of pluto  or . well , maybe i ' ll let you be the observational scientist . meanwhile , all the climate projections have been wrong since mr . gore ' s power point presentation . why ? it deals mostly with carbon dioxide , not the sun   and not a single climate projection that i have reviewed has ever taken in account of the heat sync ability of the earth ' s oceans .
