3. remember to drag your health pot on the r icon . good job , you basically became immortal for the early game . yeah it ' s fun that they made an ability that heals for digit at green level if you include the shield .  reaper  s edge and legendary amulet of energy are nice on lucie . i would usually take ravager on lucie since it increases damage and healing so it boosts the lucie r heal , plus the max health bonus is very nice , but reaper is definitely 2nd pick for me .   x200b  but yeah overall sls seriously needs to nerf lucie a lot , digit seconds more on space doesn ' t do much when you can hit legendary e through counters and shields .   x200b
