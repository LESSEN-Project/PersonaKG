2. but you ' re expecting the outcome of making fire and trying to achieve it . if you had no concept of what it was or where it came from , why would you believe you could make it , or try to ? you know it can be made by friction and other sources . they apparently only know it comes from lightening . and they can ' t make that , so they have no reason to try rubbing sticks together .

6. i think it  s hit reg . as far as i know there aren  t any hacks that make you invincible but in the wake of the hit reg bug it  s entirely possibly it could have been developed since everyone would put the blame on hitreg
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

7. it  s not the case as far as i know . wouldn  t make sense either .

8. most of them you can assume are litterate , even raiders make signs and such , they know a cap is a cap and how to tell what items are which , such as the water cartons

9. shmukatelli would do well to get to know someone with genuine gender dysphoria , and shmukatelli might learn some compassion for those with the condition . getting a sex change is not something one goes through on a whim . neither i , nor anyone in my family is like this that i know of but if my children ever came forward as such , i would support whatever decision they might make .
