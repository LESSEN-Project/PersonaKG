1. i used meditation about a year ago to help cope with stress and my night terrors , i stopped over the summer , and now that classes have started up again , my night terrors have come with them . i don ' t think meditation is bullshit , but i can understand why you would .

   (ID: f3657f57aa348caf1c32ec21ef139ea41a45dc29)

4. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?

6. why does it only apply to the 2nd amendment and not any other ? the founding fathers only knew printing press , do you think freedom of speech should apply to the internet ? i don ' t think so . there were also automatic weapons when the 2nd amendment was written .
   (ID: 0be93b714cd5f5999c7ff30ac3a245ba907b2d81)

7. so just because you disagree with it , you think it should be okay to censor it ? don ' t you see how slippery of a slope this is ?
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)

8. what is their to argue about ? it  s pretty opinion based . i don  t think any scientific arguments will change someone  s perspective who truly believes it is murder
   (ID: 4f1b65a581332b9d19507ccf0e921d0967e013e7)

9. i love that joke about the guy at a job interview . " so tell me what you think one of your weaknesses are " " i am always honest " " i don ' t think that ' s a weakness " " i don ' t give a fuck what you think "
