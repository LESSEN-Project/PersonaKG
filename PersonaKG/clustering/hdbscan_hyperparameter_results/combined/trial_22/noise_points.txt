1. compromise . you need to find a way for both of you to get a little of what you want . often time teenagers are completely oblivious to what they really need as support and same goes for parents not knowing where an appropriate line should be drawn usually out of fear or anxiety for their child  s well being you may see improvement if you take on more responsibility around the home or in the community  but that  s only a vague suggestion because i have no idea about your specific circumstances .

   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

8. i think you should correct your behaviour . if your first thought when something happens is " im completely faultless " and then after everyone else says you ' re the asshole you still seem to think you ' re in the right . yta taking out your anger on others and racist comments are never valid . dont kid yourself
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

9. i should have given her my number .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

10. i think you do have a bit of a problem with the player being over  specialized , and throwing him up against some situations where his specialty isn ' t called for might gently encourage him to diversify a bit . that being said , this is somewhat of a legitimate concern . the last campaign i played in , during the last fight against the campaign ' s big bad , my character threw out an digit  shift attack and almost kill her in one hit . granted , he went heavily into debt using sponsored magic and used digit fate points to do it , but it still illustrates the issue . the next campaign my wife plans on running will start at digit refresh and go up to digit . so we ' ve been giving some consideration to this problem too . because at that point , almost anyone who can use evocation with any degree of skill will be able to dish out way more damage in a fight than anyone who can ' t . and since you get so few stress boxes and consequences , there ' s very little incentive not to throw the most powerful spells you ' re capable of throwing in a fight . what we ' re going to try is changing the way the spellcasting rules work . we haven ' t playtested yet , but here ' s the gist of what we ' re going to try . control becomes just for targeting evocations . you roll a control roll to hit your target , if you miss , the spell affects the area around your target instead based on how badly you miss . then you make a power roll , with a target of 2x the number of shifts of power you called up . if you meet or exceed the target , you take no stress from the spell . for every two points rounded up by which you miss the target , you take digit point of mental stress . so by these rules , it ' s much more costly to call up more powerful spells , but to compensate , an evoker can call up a lot more weak spells before having to take consequences or being taken out .

16. it is during these times when i am alone in bed that i remember how my head fits so perfectly on your shoulder , that your arms around me is the safest place i ever knew , that being around you is all i ever want to be . i never knew why you just left without saying anything . i should have been over this . but the truth is , i don ' t think i will be .

17. what  s the problem ?
   (ID: 57566e418da3ba7bb3e33d1def44eaef175b88e9)

18. what about friends ? there will always be single people of all ages though . perhaps the majority of people you know are in relationships or are dating , so it seems like " everyone ' s found someone " ? one of my friends is single , in her late digit ' s and she has such an active life . she holidays frequently , has friends all over the world and is just socially active in general . not sure what her dating life is like right now but i know she ' s had a few spouses . she seems happy . she also has a dog .
