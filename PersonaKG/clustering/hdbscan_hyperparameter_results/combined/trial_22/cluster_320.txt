1. men are just mad that they  re being asked to be better people . if the ad doesn  t apply to you , there  s no reason to get mad at it . if you  re getting angry at it , you  re probably a part of the population gillette has asked to be better .
   (ID: 12803a9aad224d0537b68ab83a6cdc6a45d3160f)

2. everyone  s there to improve , most people who know this aren  t paying attention to anyone else and most likely enjoy seeing other people there to better themselves . imo anyone who shames other people for trying to do that is just an asshole

   (ID: 6f291f3688a3a398f92cd165b10b1d3796d86840)

5. a lot of people just ragequit in casual so it would just mess up everyone ' s ranking and people could just farm rank with friends who just leave the game . it ' s sad to see the game dying but people would abuse the system too much .
