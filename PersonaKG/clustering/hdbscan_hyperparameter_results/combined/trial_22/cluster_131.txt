1. it is . i think it should stay that way , though . it should cost either less stamina or be nearly instant instead of its current state .

   (ID: 5cd97109ce427e13a85976a7f8927bed47b84984)

4. i was thinking something similar . it was difficult to see the way a lot of the americans think . it was also hard to not respond to any of them . what would be the point . my words won ' t change the way they think .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

5. same here . my study of religion led me to conclude they were all manmade . the way that i see it we all have certain drives for meaning , for purpose , for morals and certain emotional needs getting over the fear of death , wanting to reconnect with dead loved ones , wanting a sense of meaning in life , etc . and religions each navigate a way in which they can fulfill these human desires . and i think that the religions out there today are still in existence because partially they tended to fulfill these the best .

6. i used to be an extreme example of this . i ' d assume intercourse meant he loved me and ultimately wanted to marry and have kids with me . thank god for guy friends setting me straight . main reason to disclose and have some sort of talk is to filter out girls who think the way i used to . they may not be stalker psychos but were simply raised with a certain set of beliefs and have peers who share them .
