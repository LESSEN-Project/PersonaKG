4. it ' s quite possible that your friends are assholes . but it might be useful to take an objective look at yourself . is there any aspect of your personality or behavior that could be off putting ? when things calm down , perhaps you could talk with one of your friends  try  understand why they did what they did . or speak to someone else entirely who knows all of you .

5. must be all the beauty products she made him bring home last season . i kid , she looks great . i did kind of think it was funny when she called chantel ' s family image conscious or materialistic or whatever , considering the whole tv , laptop , entire suitcase full of beauty products , etc she demanded pedro bring to her . look , no one hates the family chantel more than i do , but you aren ' t perfect , lady !
