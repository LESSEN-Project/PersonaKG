4. why would you come to this sub if your intention was not to relate to others with the same mbti type or at least to observe traits you would expect in that type . it seems like an odd thing to be stuck on .

5. in all seriousness , like the most heartwrenching thing i could find at the moment . usually its anime cause they take some investing . in the worst part i watched how to train your dragon many times cause that one scene broke me , especially after such a heartwarming moment . for anime i recommend clannad then clannad  afterstory , that shit will break you .
