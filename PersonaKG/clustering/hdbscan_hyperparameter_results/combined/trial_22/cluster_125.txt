2. rock climbing . absolutely terrified me as a kid . i was too afraid to climb more than 15ft up the wall at an indoor gym . a couple years a go my friends got started doing it and i forced myself to climb to the top of the wall . after making it to the top a few times , and being safely lowered i found that i loved it ! i still get scared lead climbing , but it ' s a good fear if that makes sense .

5. ive done it before intentionally once or twice . it requires a good deal of self awareness . to do it i tried focusing on and idea , almost as if a mantra , as i drifted to sleep carrying the idea with me through diminishing consciousness . then at some point you are just dreaming and you have to realize you are asleep . hopefully this is done by realizing that you are dreaming about what you intended and then go from there . i realized though that i got terrible sleep when i did this so i stopped . i also knew someone who claimed to lucid dream a few nights a week for a about a year . he practiced techniques and got good at it .
