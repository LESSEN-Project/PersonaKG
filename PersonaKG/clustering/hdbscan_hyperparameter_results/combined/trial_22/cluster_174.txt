1. there are so many oscar wilde quotes that can go well with this picture . my favorite is this one  beauty is a form of genius   is higher , indeed , than genius , as it needs no explanation . it is one of the great facts of the world , like sunlight , or springtime , or the reflection in the dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon . it cannot be questioned . it has divine right of sovereignty . it makes princes of those who have it .
