2. talk to him about it . if he seems to dislike it as much as you do then i  m sure you can find a common ground of when in the hectic schedules it  s more likely to happen if either of you initiate .  dry  spells happen in every relationship at some point and it  s important to talk about it and reassure him it  s not a guilt trip rather seeking open feedback because you feel so strongly about it .

3. not a lady , but i ' m pretty sure nothing is so small you can ' t feel it . it ' s just so small you get no pleasure out of it . to truly feel nothing it ' d have to be shorter than digit inch and thinner than the opening between the labia .
