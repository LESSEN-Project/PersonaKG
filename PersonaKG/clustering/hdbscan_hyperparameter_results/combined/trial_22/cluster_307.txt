6. i ' m going to throw out some wild speculation ahead of the announcement . i haven ' t head anyone else mention this name probably because it ' s stupid . landon donovan . we know he was in salt lake in the off season , and talking to the front office . it never made sense that he was going to come out of retirement to play here . maybe that ' s not what they were talking to him about .

7. i know this may sound ridiculous to many , but one of the most dominant memes in the wingnutsphere is that obama cannot function without a teleprompter . santorum is a poster  child for dunning  kruger . he would walk into that debate thinking " i ' m going to teach this boy something . " and that is exactly what his base dreams of .
