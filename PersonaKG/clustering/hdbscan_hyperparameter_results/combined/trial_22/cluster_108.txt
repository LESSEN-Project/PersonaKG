2. since this platform is free for everyone to post and comment all kinds of things i won  t take your note on keeping my nose out especially from someone with attitude you possess . by all means you deserve to be called out and maybe you should take a note about changing your attitude towards others , because too much negativity is bad for everyone . i  m not american btw , stop assuming , looks like it  s not for you .

3. it ' s because they ' re removing anything decent with excuses like ' you ' re post has been removed because it ' s a play on words ' . i assure you non of the many i submitted were a play on words . only total bullshit gets accepted .

4. like jakkarth said there ' s a reason that ' s there and i have no idea what . maybe weirdly run vent i would go at it with something i have a lot of control of like a dremel or even a palm sander with as low as grit as you can get . go slow and either you will remove enough to fit the fridge or you will find out why its there and then post again about how to deal with x .
