3. fair . i can see why bringing penicillin to medieval europe is a tempting answer . however , i have to consider that the further back in time you go , and the more broad your cure , the more you risk causing more human birth and an alternate timeline in which war , starvation , or drug  immune diseases wipe out more people that would have died had you not tried . by sticking to a smaller number of people and a more recent event with fewer possible ramifications , you ' re more likely to come out saving more lives than endangering .

6. " fuck off " thank you for your input . when you ' re on the clock you ' re expected to at least meet corporate and customer expectations . if you can do neither then any job that relates to working with people is not for you . when you ' re off the clock and on your time you can do whatever pleases you .
