   (ID: eca32d278abf2524af02edbb3cc3041ed8b0b880)

2. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .

6. esh , but your husband more than you . he has no right to say you have no choice in the matter , but neither of you are having a productive conversation about it . both of you have your minds set on a certain idea , and neither of you is willing to actually budge .
