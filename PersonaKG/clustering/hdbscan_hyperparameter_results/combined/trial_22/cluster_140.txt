8. it ' s definitely him . he ' s an alcoholic . looks like he ' s struggling with trying to control it , but he should probably not drink at all anymore . probably a hard thing for you to do , but you should tell him to get help or you ' re going to leave . it ' s only going to get worse if he continues to drink

9. i ' m going to assume that you , as a police force , have limited resources , and you can ' t possibly investigate every reference to some crazy thing in art . so , if that ' s the case , how do you choose what to investigate ? are you investigating rappers because you think they ' re more likely to be involved in crime ? that could be racist and prejudiced . if you ' re investigating rappers why haven ' t you investigated carrie underwood for " before he cheats " ? start to see why it might be a civil liberties issue ?
