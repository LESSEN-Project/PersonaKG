3. holy sheets face  with  open  mouth this is the first time someone has responded intellectually and respectfully to me when i let it be known in a trump supporter . i have been in this politics arena since grade school , along with world history , from the time it was introduced to me as a child . i absolutely love these two topics . but i hate so much that we can no longer talk about these things . everyone loves to speak on the at  right extremism . but i become a racist or bigot when i point out left  wing extremist like karl marx and what his ideology brought about in places like russia less then digit years ago . i just want to point out to people that we are playing with fire with these semantics being thrown about on a whim . a intelligent person could never believe that the german population would support a fascist extremist who would murder perhaps digit million jews . but a seed of hate was planted a decade prior . during the depression . in the 30s the jews were made to be the villains because of their " wealth and privilege " so later when the gov started rounding these people up , nobody cared to help . this is what the seed of division brings us . history proves it hundreds of times over . we are americans , but when they divide us we are the nobody ' s they ' ve made us . skin color means nothing , wealth means nothing , sexual orientation means nothing , sex means nothing . they are all tools of division so we have to look to them for the solution . if the whites were gone perhaps the blacks could finally prosper . if the guns were gone perhaps the murders will stop . if everyone had health care perhaps nobody would get sick and die from silly shit . if we had open borders perhaps everyone could freely share in the american dream . but do you think that once the whites were gone the " elites " would stop telling the blacks they are victims ? i don ' t think so , then they would lose their control . if you belive they have some kind of control if we take away the guns , are we taking away the carnal desire to murder as well ? and will the government protect us and empower us , or would they stand on our necks ? i don ' t want to know . if we provide healthcare for all , who ' s in charge of that ? how much will it cost ? and why would it cost that ? they say digit trillion , but why ? why is a blood test digit  why is a x  ray digit , digit  ? if the government can force me to pay digit  income tax for healthcare for all . then why the hell can ' t the government force the doctors and hospitals to drop their prices to make universal healthcare affordable and not a pipe dream ? if we open the borders and let everyone enjoy the american dream . the simple fact is , the consequences of that are we will no longer be able to provide an " american dream " to anyone . this is the best place on earth because we have the best people on earth in between its borders . not everyone is good for you , not everyone belongs here with the best . plain and simple . regular life experiences proves this . the fact that we have prisons prove this . i ' m truly saddened . i ' m saddened my the left and the right . donald trump came in as a man who could turn things around for conservatives . an outsider with outside ideas , and outside money . democrats need someone to step up and take the reigns as well . that ' s the only way of beating trump in digit . a strong outsider , not influenced by nancy and chuck . there ' s is a vacuum that needs to be filled . i pray for the sake of the world it isn ' t someone like ocasio  cortez from ny .
   (ID: fa749ff7262da656e34f21f4b902bd5287bf224d)

4. this is probably the worst argument i ' ve ever seen then . i could literally go  hey conservatives eck phlack shmack and it would make about as much sense .
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

5. anti  intellectualism is great to see on what is meant to be a university community . big words , small words , what ' s the difference ? i ' m not posturing . i use the terms that i think best express my ideas . i didn ' t present a counter  argument because isanybodylisten didn ' t present any points that could be refuted in a meaningful way . it was very much , " i see you as being    " . i could say that i ' m not those things , but those are equally weak statements . in what class could you get away with making an assertion without justification ? none . if you ' re comfortable with drawing all of your conclusions about someone from the way they conduct themselves on reddit , maybe you ' re pretentious .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

6. that  s your opinion . and as far as i  m concerned my opinion you can believe whatever you want . we aren  t talking about beliefs we are talking about classifying science vs pseudoscience !
   (ID: 70fd28af0eb2c67ebb7ce51abc94c13f1a4f652b)

7. lol . who ' s trying to save face . my original post was not meant to be taken seriously . other people understood that , or were less inclined to jump into a discussion with the " i know something about something obvious to anyone with a high school education   so let me ' correct ' you " vibe we all love so much around here . you also clearly didn ' t read the thread .
   (ID: 17b8a304069d7530607e28f8e04d840e28be0d3e)

8. i ' m glad you refinined your point . this however does not eliminate your obvious bias . i ' m sorry that you think presenting a concise argument equates to shitting on people . seems to me you are angry and i have no idea why you would be , unless you really don ' t like your ideas challenged .
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

9. my my , you do a fine job of " discussing . you screech some hate , you lie and insult me . you sound like every other fox  addled right wing fascist the question is , if you live up to the stereotype , then why shouldn ' t i think badly of you ?
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

10. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

11. i should have written my comment more carefully . that ' s not what i meant at all . i don ' t think my point came across . i hate microtransactions just as much as anyone else . and i ' m sure game devs do too . my point is game designers don ' t deserve to be harassed on social media when it ' s the suits at the top who make these business decisions . game designers are employees just like anyone else and it ' s not their fault that the game has microtransactions .
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

12. really ? you feel the need for personal attacks because i disagree with you ? well , how about you try understanding the sentence before you attack someone . let me help you " it ' s exactly why i oppose tax hikes right now "
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

13. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

14. that  s very far fetched . you want to argue more than the face value of the comment but i  m sorry , there  s nothing more and nothing less . i know nothing about what you posted of , but have read about the social credit experiment china is rolling out and how those with low scores may not be able to fly . i would assume protesters would cause low points , therefore would disable a protester from flying on a plane and that  s why i commented such . as far as feeling insecure , i have no idea why you even assumed that much . by the way , your title is interpreted as you being sympathetic to both the assaulted and assaulters so your message isn  t effective . i suppose i should have pointed that out instead . good luck on your awareness campaign .
   (ID: 71de6d78a2a9fe7dfc17e6667ec92f75a8d4c302)

15. you proved my point . you have no reason to hate america  americans . we have good terms with nz and you haven  t lived here , meaning you have no clue what it is like .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

16. not playing into your hand or giving you the answers you want is not avoiding questions . i have answered each question you asked , if you don ' t like the answers stop asking the questions . once again you think you will paint me into in a corner . you cannot . you will find yourself wanting if you continue to play your social justice warrior , validation game with me .
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

17. oh , i still say israel shouldn ' t . but you wanted a answer from the left so i gave you one . me being from the right doesn ' t mean i ' m unable to give a left answer .
   (ID: a61db1f2f0a3d15376fd168a1637c028f25100e1)

18. i understand but it seemed that your question didn ' t make any sense . a cop will give you a ticket if you break the law even if what you ' re doing makes sense as is safer than following the law . a cop will give you a ticket if he doesn ' t know the law or is having a bad day . your question doesn ' t matter , hypothetically or not . you do the best you can and try not to break any laws . sorry if i became outraged because i really wanted to understand and answer the question and really thought that i had , and it frustrated me that i didn ' t .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

19. i ' m not making excuses . if trump did somthing then he should be impeached . bottom line . but they better start enforcing the law straight across the board . i want to see equal justice . kareem hunt , a football player , was just ousted from the nfl for domestic violence . keith ellison , dnc chair , just won an election in mn while also having been accused of domestic violence . that is not equal justice . they pick and choose who the law applies to . one day it may be you somebody is going after un justly . as a foreigner here in our country you should expect the best we can offer . you should expect to live the dream . what is going on now with trump is a dangerous path down a dark road . for everyone . and it ' s unfair to you in perticular because it does not showcase america as the light of the world . it ' s shows us petty and bitter . willing to ruin people ' s lives for political gain .
   (ID: fa749ff7262da656e34f21f4b902bd5287bf224d)

20. if that ' s your only takeaway , then you ' ve missed the point of my post .
