1. most of the time the  sass  is unintentional and  talking back  is often just asking for clarification about what i actually did wrong and trying to explain my point of view .
   (ID: fa9acab3fbd86b1f64e6380ef31b49912dae0c74)

   (ID: 1b90fe7ac45d325859956bedb446558d1a1d6bfd)

4. i mean it  s certainly possible just seems super unlikely to me . really a one trick pony company as solarcity probably isn  t going to take them there , and sure some of them tend to do good but just like other car companies there will be a ton of competition and to me it also seems pretty unlikely we will see a completely electric car world unless there is massive improvement in battery life and charge time . even so there are tons of other car companies . i mean we will see just seems a bit of a pipe dream to me , suppose we will see though . i mean if tesla completely eliminates all other car companies and electric cars take over the world we could see a multi trillion dollar tesla in digit  digit value , but even still it  s not  my kids will thank me later off my tax return  kind of money .

9. bitter sweet symphony by the verve . it has some really good build up
   (ID: 40fd610d82fe603b92df467e8ad559d760679a4f)

10. i feel like i answered you correctly . law enforcement is unreasonably authoritarian . there ' s no good reason for it . i mean , we just saw it . but , i would bet these cops didn ' t get reprimanded in any way at all . that generally doesn ' t happen without some sort of publicity . it ' s a moot point anyway . who cares if they were ? it doesn ' t change anything . it already happened , and the police , in my view , used extremely poor judgment . and i hate them because of it . in other words , cops should be held to a higher standard and scrutinized . but you ' re right about they military , and i feel exactly the same way about them too . the difference is that our military can ' t do this to us . other militaries can , but that ' s a different animal altogether . maybe they should have just let the guy go . he isn ' t a danger to anybody
   (ID: cca2db8a0bcb7aff323abdba1f381d7388c9f713)

11. lol i got her , any granade build you recommend ?
   (ID: 0577b566bc01c7d79464f522c720317d81923a8c)

12. no , you felt the price was fair . that ' s literally that matters . the value of an item lies in what someone is willing to buy it for and what someone is willing to sell it for . things don ' t have intrinsic value . could you have paid less for it ? maybe . the cheapskate in me wants you to get the best deal you can . but ultimately got what you wanted for what you felt was fair and you are happy .
   (ID: 5146a89965a734a4d1ec9ec9145abae872a4569d)

13. i do always love this answer . do you think you could live in the wilderness ? what would you do for food ? do you have the tools and know how to use them to make anything you need ? you won ' t have gas or electricity , remember

   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

15. reason i say this is because you rate yourself an digit and then wonder why women are looking at you ? an digit gets attention

   (ID: 521b989779e5e44f8854ed1438b914dfb8f19eb6)

17. not sure if kidding really isn ' t a question , it is more of a statement . and i have no idea why you might have gotten downvoted , so i upvoted , fwiw , as if you care  what is this " beizbol " y ' all speak of ? if it is what i think it is , the dallas fort worth area has no teams playing in the top division this season .
   (ID: e8a9698601228aac42dab1d9134099b1a5a87a50)

18. why would you assume the fbi isn ' t corrupt ? they are a violent criminal organization . i don ' t know why so many people view them as a good thing . last time i checked the good guys don ' t radicalized and arm domestic terrorists .
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

19. get off the internet . seriously . social media is very good at making you feel shit about your own life because it makes you draw comparisons between yourself and others . go out and life your life . fill it with things you enjoy and forget what other people think of it . why should you care if others approve your choice of hobbies , holidays and interest etc . don ' t live life by trying to impress others , impress yourself . do it for yourself and you ' ll reap the benefits of being happier in yourself . also exercise .
   (ID: e78c9eb3b69138ff8337dd896bc5bb1e02fc6559)
