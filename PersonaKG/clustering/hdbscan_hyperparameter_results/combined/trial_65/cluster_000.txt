1. you need to be assertive about this . the template for an assertive statement is " i feel  when you do   , and i wish you would    " in this situation you could say " i feel sad or maybe uncherished , neglected , abandoned , or lonely ? when you don ' t get to know my family , and i would like you to come to thanksgiving dinner and talk to them " please learn this and use it . it must be said calmly and conversationally without expectation of changing his behavior . you are clearly stating your emotions and the behaviour of your ideal mate . if he still refuses to change his behavior , then you should decide if you can visit your family without him for the rest of your life .

2. the unfortunate thing with being human is that despite our radical free will , we can only choose for ourselves  not others . i ' ve been through young love and know its inexplicable potency . however , first love won ' t necessarily be your best love . in situations like this , the more you try to force things , the worse they will become . a few words of encouragement about your sexuality  gay and lesbian relationships occur among many species of animals in the wild . there ' s nothing wrong with what you ' re feeling or who you ' re attracted to . i think what makes people uncomfortable about it is that it inherently presents a challenge to the privilege heterosexuals have and are generally unwilling to reflect critically about . although you don ' t want to break up , try to stay strong . the best thing you can do is let her know that you love her and are there for her if she needs you . i wish you both the best .

3. i have been in a similar situation . you just got paroled my friend . look at it this way . you can be happy now . that relationship ? that was never going to happen and your attachment was just going to make you more miserable as time went on . now you finally have the opportunity to find someone who will make you happy . you  re like truman burbank stepping out of the studio and into the real world .
   (ID: ead4924f7abc0f9258d2b484a3f379aedee2cc5c)

4. why are you assuming you are being friendzoned ? i mean you seem to be just friends at this stage . she hasn ' t rejected you , so you are not really " friendzoned . it ' s a bit hard to know if she likes you or not from what you have described . just be yourself and don ' t go in with the expectation of wanting her to like you because you are nice to her . dont assume anything , ever ! good luck !
   (ID: 1634046145226dc01b1fa030132efd0574c38352)

5. heres what id do ask her out one more time , if she says she has things to do without giving you a time where shes available then yea you did kill your chance . other than that , im sure youll find more people youll have a shot with
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

6. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .

7. okay . from your post history , i think you ' re doing engineering in bangalore ? probably final year or have recently cleared final year ? woman , i ' m in the same age group as you are . this is my advise to you  what you ' re having , is first rate depression , for which you need counseling . do that pronto . you have hobbies  you draw , you crochet , you write beautiful poetry . focus on those . it ' s amazing . slightly  smiling  face you swim  exercise , so you ' re probably athletic  doing your best to stay in a positive mindset . i sincerely appreciate the efforts you ' re taking , to make your lifetime worthwhile . hugging  face there is this issue of being abused as a young girl . this , and i can ' t stress enough about it , needs to be addressed immediately . talk to a psychotherapist , talk with your family , talk with your best friend regarding this , but talk . it is important to get those feelings out there , it ' ll heal you to some extent . also , do you have lupus ? being a female would put you into that ballpark of lupus . but yeah , doesn ' t mean you can ' t lead a healthy  fulfilling life . i ' m pretty sure you ' re on your meds by now . if yes , check with your doctor if there are any meds that may be inducing a depressant effect on your psyche . don ' t run away from your life . don ' t be stuck onto this aadhar manipulation  escapism that you ' re seeking . it ' ll complicate things , won ' t give you a permanent solution to anything .

8. were you overreacting ? i feel like you didn  t react enough . if this shit was the other way around would he be cool with it ? the answer is hell no . so should you be alright with this ? hell nah . whatever feelings or reactions you have here , i say they are warranted and very much valid . i  m sorry this happened . at least you know what signs to pick up on next time some douche tries this bullshit .
   (ID: d28c94c02761dbceb7bd64e3288f28eeef3a75cf)

9. the short answer is , get in and be the doer , not the done to . if he ' s wishy washy , unless you ' re in super deep , consider the fact that you are the age you are and the people you spend time with rub off on and affect you with you wish them to or not . pull back , give him some space and give yourself some space to evaluate what you want from a relationship . it sounds to me like you want a lack of games and a proper commitment of " we are together and we love one another , so let ' s make this work " it doesn ' t sound like that ' s the case .
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

10. i ' m really sorry you ' re going through this . that sounds like a huge burden to have to deal with . you left her though , and you have yourself to thank for that . how are you feeling in the shelter ? do you feel safe ? if you ' re having trouble talking to your boyfriend about this i would urge you to try , or reach out to someone . living at home and going to a shelter is a huge shock and can be very overwhelming . please reach out to anyone you trust in your life for a couch to crash on . are you close with any of your siblings ? try to reach out to them as well , at least they might be able to understand where you ' re coming from . please don ' t stay at the shelter though . it ' ll be hard to cope with everything .
   (ID: a3811395c0f6d89e991295b692a54743e657581e)

11. remember that people change man , and everyone ' s always going through something . try not to take things personal .
   (ID: 2e30252ab6ce4c1807bb315c6103be324b841909)

12. absolutely speak to your therapist . you trust them . they will help you . you need to get yourself out of that relationship for your safety , physical and psychological . this is not a one  off occurrence .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

13. yes , our minds love to punish ourselves when we are low . i promise if you truly try you can feel better and once you do it will be easier next time and so on and so on . feeling like this i truly know can be dangerous . don ' t be afraid to talk . get it all out . it ' s ok to be sad . but you have to tools inside your head to make yourself better ! remind yourself that you are worth it red  heart
   (ID: dc0783c6951122c6edfc85430901cf133c146b32)

14. yeah this is bad man . very bad . that ' s emotional cheating . it ' s legitimate cheating . you ' ve known for a while that your wife loves attention from men . this is problematic . i think the best solution is separation and possibly divorce . you said it yourself , you feel like the bond that you had with her has been broken . don ' t think twice about it because christmas is around the corner . your wife is a cheater . she requires validation from other men that aren ' t her husband . you were there every night after work for her when you were newlyweds . it ' s never good enough for her . you deserve better , op .

15. maybe i ' m coming off as too depressed . i wouldn ' t say i ' m officially " depressed " i live my own independent life . i go to school in a major that i love . i workout digit  digit times a week , i taught myself to play guitar , i fly  fish any free chance i get , i love hanging out at winery ' s , i love to cook for other people and i love to just be outside . today i did a ten mile bike ' n ' hike . the problem is , is that i do most of these activities alone or with my guy friends . i don ' t know though . maybe i do need some form of therapy and anti  depressant . the main issue is , it would mean i ' d have to tell my parents . i don ' t want to admit to them that i have a social anxiety that comes from fear of initiating a conversation with a woman . my dad made a joke the other day that he thought i was gay because i ' ve never brought home a girl from school . i took it personally . i don ' t know why i ' ve built this up to be so much harder than it should be .
   (ID: 380598f491e44cdd92f2ec6105505f0f439372e2)

16. first of all , get help second , distract yourself . it can be hard now but find something you like to do . it worked for me one day at a time
   (ID: e216f2a1e0d7d814b7ad58452ce6ac21e0b763fc)

17. i  m sure that you will find someone better , but for now , im here if you wanna talk . i feel you dude .
   (ID: 5ad91cf15026f9d604e90af77be91ab4f6b7289a)

18. you individuals can ' t do anything . my depression began with being ostracized . i suppose the best thing you could do is not bother me .
   (ID: fddeeaa11799939dfe96bc7fae74a22b474aaf20)

19. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .

20. seems like he has a lot of baggage going on . he ' s sexuality interested in other people and is likely cheating , or going to cheat outside of the rules . if you have rules like you do , you shouldn ' t be together . it ' s gonna get ugly if you stay .
