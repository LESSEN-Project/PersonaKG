1. hell yeah ! preach ! just one correction tho  transgenderism isn ' t the right word . it ' s just " being transgender " . the term has a lot of baggage from people using it as a slur so for the most part we avoid using it unless joking about people being dick .
   (ID: 77e0b8c51dfb89ff57bd838b86ee4d78a9fe856f)

2. sex trafficker because most king pins have standards a lot of people have mom ' s that they ' d die for , but a sex trafficker is one cold motherfucker . just the fact that he  she could be manipulating you and you not knowing is unsettling .

   (ID: 5bb6e2d4db1d5ccf3a1f430564735551dfb4c28b)
