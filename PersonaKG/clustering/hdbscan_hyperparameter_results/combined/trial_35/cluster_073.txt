1. whilst browsing hentai porn as a horny teenager i was popping in and out of various categories looking for something fapworthy when i spotted ' loli ' without yahoo or altavista ' ing the term . ' pre google ' i clicked it and instantly felt sick , turned my computer off and worried for almost a week that someone was going to find it on my computer and think i was a pedophile . iirc i reinstalled windows thinking it would hide it . heh bad times .
