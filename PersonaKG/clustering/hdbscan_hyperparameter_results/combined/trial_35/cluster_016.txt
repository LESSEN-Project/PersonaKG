3. for me , when i ' m challenged in a field i specialized in by those whom i deemed unqualified to rebuke me . my thought process is something like this  you question me ! you ! a person who has no qualification whatever in this field tries to rebuke me ? this field is not about opinion , but cold hard facts consists of numbers ! ' i tend to punish them by pushing them aside and excluding them altogether because i deemed them to be near useless to me and that i should set a very low standard of them . their only duty is not to get in my way .
