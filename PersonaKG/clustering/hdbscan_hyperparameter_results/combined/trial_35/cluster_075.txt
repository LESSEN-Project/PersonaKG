10. i know this may sound ridiculous to many , but one of the most dominant memes in the wingnutsphere is that obama cannot function without a teleprompter . santorum is a poster  child for dunning  kruger . he would walk into that debate thinking " i ' m going to teach this boy something . " and that is exactly what his base dreams of .
