   (ID: 2c1d97aa622f6ad7ec3a9aad9285dd4ec1e1f28d)

2. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

   (ID: 84a0b9e5d9e0e37c98f992c96c029f6ec99fb1ca)

4. i think its ok if it advances the plot along . like if a character is sleeping with someone to get information or something . otherwise yeah it seems kinda dumb .
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)

5. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

9. there ' s a film i think it ' s called cannibal family or something like that . it ' s a pretty ok film for its budget . but if i ' m not mistaken someone who was involved in someway with the original . and i think they called it and " unofficial " remake . i could be totally wrong and please call me out if i am . but it might be worth a watch
   (ID: 4ffb044c26007ae2bade7d602b40fcd747aae147)

10. true , but to me , i think it seems like a question they should be answering rather than asking . that ' s why i ask several questions about working conditions and technologies used , etc .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

11. i think a lot of this comes down to the definitions of coercion and seduction . yes , in seduction the idea is to do your best to be enticing to someone . however , this should not be confused with a bending of their will or a manipulation . coercion is doing whatever is necessary to achieve a desired response from someone else , including putting extra pressures on them , which can be easily done if the coercing party is in a position of power , whether that is physical strength , employment , or status . seduction is like giving someone all green lights , coercion is like trying to take the steering wheel .

12. hopefully given a break . like , a few lifetimes waived or something . i think about this often .

13. i think the question is asking what industries you ' d like to kill off , i think you ' re taking it as an insult
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

14. i think it was more that his character evolved the most . he started out as a date rapist and eventually ended up a monogamist who openly loves blair . he still makes mistakes of course , but he is actually remorseful and doesn ' t continue to repeat bad habits like all the other characters . also , his character has a lot of dimension , which makes him more interesting than someone like nate .
   (ID: 169c51cc138a4161080068ded4dcf87863ffee36)

15. i think it ' s a dessert , rather than ingredient , but yeah . interesting item . i wonder what it ' s like .

   (ID: 080eedcfaabe8f67b2c0a8da33a3a401906822f2)

18. what sucks is that i think all of these colors are so pretty and would purchase them all if it wasn ' t for the vaginal inspection thing and the fact that they ' re trying disney like that .
   (ID: 1b90fe7ac45d325859956bedb446558d1a1d6bfd)
