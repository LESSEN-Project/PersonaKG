1. i guess it just depends on how strong the wish is and somebody would consider a song . if someone considers the song the same even if it is slightly different , it still might be erased . on the other hand , if it was considered a completely different song , every different recording of that song would save but one , not even allowing someone to profit off of the song , as it is already famous .
