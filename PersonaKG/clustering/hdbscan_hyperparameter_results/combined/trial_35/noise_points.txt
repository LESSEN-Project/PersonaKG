1. i can  t be the only one who wants to know who the hell they ate and also does anybody actually like this crap or is this just a huge troll
   (ID: 6b1a5069121a216d43b11b6d5c61b018eb668aaa)

2. good feed back . thanks . unfortunately , i won ' t have time to read a book . what i ' ve been asked to find out is how much the site will cost to develop , design , host , and maintain . i don ' t know the answers to these questions . i don ' t even know where to start , i don ' t know what a server is or a host . but when your digit years younger than everyone else at a business they just ask you shit and expect you to know everything . the problem is i don ' t even know what i ' m meant to know . i realize its a stupid question but i make no suggestion that i am an intelligent man . thanks for the feed back anyway . at least i will have a reference point to show that their question that i have relayed is indeed idiotic .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

3. i think it makes an easy segue into talking to him , if you can be kind of matter of fact about it . it gives you a reason to discuss it with him . and to discuss about how what you see in porn isn ' t how it really is in life . and how you want him to have good information . and how you should have talked to him before it got to this point where his curiosity got the better of him . plus , it lets him know that you ' re keeping an eye on what he ' s doing with his phone . i know this sounds silly to some people but i find when i have to get ready for conversations that might get uncomfortable that if i practice saying it out loud it gets easier . there is something about hearing the words coming out of my mouth before anyone else does that makes it much less awkward . you ' ll do great . i have faith in you .
   (ID: 1293e72aa7301baf0ecb3a2509e46cdcca834cd9)

4. amlo is just another stooge that protects and propagates the interests of transnational capital . he provides cover and a nice veneer while the capitalists go in and loot the natural resources , markets and labor of the country . much in the style of an obama or trudeau . i have no idea why you think anyone would care what time the asshole wakes up at and why you find this at all admirable . it ' s funny you would leave out the chavistas and maduro . why do you have such little political imagination ? why do you think your liberal tendencies are at all permissible in this sub ? are you another one of these white latin american men that has no problem stomping on the rights of indigenous peoples so long as capital accumulation processes can go on unabated ?
   (ID: 77d0324af3e030bb9fb9365a16e870bd522fd275)

5. the best thing is not to " find a trick to fool yourself into not buying things " but to look how much money you earn in one month and don ' t spend more than that . it is irrelevant how much your credit card lets you spend . what matters is how much you earn .
   (ID: 417f107ec53971c82b0d9bb8ee79067ec512bdbb)

6. and it ' s always the best ones .

8. there ' s nothing you could do about this anyway . plus , if you did manage to change something who knows in what way you would fuck up your own future thinking of a sound of thunder here ,
   (ID: 5fe12b36dc6d3370836c6683997c005efb656c99)

9. i have been outside of us for digit months in poland , which isn ' t a great perspective as someone who is now foriegn , but seeing as you ' ve had no replies i remember missing peanut butter or reese ' s and ranch for a few foodsface  with  tears  of  joy maybe some beef jerky ? also some adults i knew over seas in poland loved nutter butters and wanted me to bring that over
   (ID: ab7b04c861ea53216d337be29676deb59279c791)

10. terrorists who do nothing but play into the hands of other radical groups . whether or not their ideologically is inherently as bad as say a nazi is irrelevant , it ' s more that they add fuel to the fire so to speak .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

11. ahhhhh . that  s not okay . i mean i get that there are stay at home moms and all the power to them , but to rely on someone to keep you fed and clothed and then treat them like shit . i am a stay at home mom . who works a full time job out of our home as well as a part time job for a family member  s business . i might not have lunch packed for him every day , but he has food to eat and a decently clean house and love and respect  which i also have . it  s kinda sad for your ex wife tho  she hasn  t been able to let go and enjoy her life because she  s too busy being a shit .

   (ID: 0fbaeef283f7b2090f763028c227ed73724f3e6c)

16. i like seeing other people progress , and its inspiring to some people . no hate towards you op , but please realise that not everyone thinks like you and just because you dont like it , doesnt mean everyone doesnt like it . thinking like this is how you get toxic people who shame anyone different not accusing you of this tho
   (ID: ba841e2486d1df5b5baefde5ead0636c7c03c79c)

17. i ' m digit  would love to cosplay . i ' ve seen some online images of costumes people have made  it looks so amazing  fun . something like elizabeth from bioshock infinite or elsa from frozen . but i ' m probably too old to start  would probably be called mutton dressed as lamb if i dressed as these younger women . i have no idea if cosplay existed when i was in my 20s in the early ' 90s when the internet was a noisy slow dial  up affair , but if it did i wish i had known about it . it looks so fun . especially steampunk . i ' d love to go steampunk . but at my age i ' d probably look ridiculous .
