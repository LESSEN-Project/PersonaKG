11. he says he wouldn ' t vote for hillary and his second most important reason why not was that she shamed her husbands accusers . then she points out that trump shamed his accusers and his immediate response was that that is not something he is concerned about when choosing to vote for a candidate and that is something that is a private matter between the parties involved . he really doesn ' t hear his own words .

16. the fact that the devs communicate to us at all is fantastic . as someone who works for an it company , i can tell you that none of our devs ever have communication with our customers . the customers call support . support opens a case and investigates . from there if support can ' t do something about the problem it gets escalated to development . so seeing all these devs talking to us and listening to our feedback is really cool
