1. because their accusing someone of a serious crime they havnt committed . and it happens a lot more often than you think , falsely accusing someone of murder isn ' t really as common is it  is easier to discredit . where as , a girl can sleep with a man consenusally , regret it . and accuse him of raping her , which happens a lot . that poor guys life  reputation is essentially ruined

2. the voice thing , i never really imagine a voice in my head when reading subtitles . maybe for an argonian or kajit in the elder scrolls , but it ' s never something i have really had consciously noticed myself doing . i felt the it added to the immersion when you were scavenging and the character would comment when picking something up , as opposed to be totally silent throughout a huge dungeon . as i said , i think it could be done better and has some way to go if it were to be in the next game , but i think it helped .

5. you ' re right about that . they really tossed those jumpscares out there for more character development and comic reliefthan legitimate scares , i think .
   (ID: f67f4ffc3afd37a9ece4ede606682407c9b920b1)

9. how many more companies are you talking to ? do you really think it ' s between these two companies ? there ' s a problem in decision theory called the secretary problemv that has parallels to your situation . might be worth reading , if you ' re so inclined .

10. i think there is too much blur in the foreground , you can  t really see it  s a leaf anymore . it  s gives a cool effect , but i think if you wanted it to give it a more  nature  feeling , the leaves in the foreground shouldn  t be that blurry .
