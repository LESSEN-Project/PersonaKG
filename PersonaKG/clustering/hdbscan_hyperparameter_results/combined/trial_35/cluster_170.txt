   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

3. they  re wrong and so are you , because there literally is not a correct answer . sorry if what i said stung , but i hear it all the time from fans who obsess over it instead of just enjoying the show .
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

4. that isn  t just a football thing , it means greatest of all time so it can be applied to anything
   (ID: bef3bdf131cc9dbe9d33343a3b9988680236cf9d)

   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

6. i hear you everyone  s different , to an extent , but yh probably was psychosis but you was young at the time so it was probably just that
   (ID: 7dfa169bdfe2df7e214baa35fc2f2b73cbb10c46)

7. thanks . this actually makes sense to me . we actually leave ours out all the time and it just confused me why if we never wrap the chord up it gets messy
   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

8. what if she ' s just trying to get comfortable because it ' s gonna take a long time to show u all those memes ? eh ?
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

9. they are not quite playmates since they are pretty much ignoring each other . i am just happy i can have them in the same room and can spend more time with each of them . condescending karens are everywhere lol
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

10. is the stoning for adultery pertaining to both genders ? because every time that i do read or hear about it , it ' s always the punishment for women . what if the man commits adultery ? not trying to toss gender  equality into an already cans  of  worm belief . just genuinely curious .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

11. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .
   (ID: 7c96bac704435347f721cc9a3056b8d7be16cc06)

12. sometimes when i type " just a sec " i mistyped and write " just a sex " awkward answers when there ' s time that passes until i realize what i said .
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

13. my gf and i tend to devolve common phrases and words over time to more just nonsense noises . we can have almost whole conversations with bizarre words and noises . we often ponder that to anyone on the outside it might seem we were both handicapped in some way
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

14. it  s true that it is kinda a waste of time anyway , the problem is that instead of having fun wasting my time i just get depressed
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

15. the thing is , phoenix aren ' t meta . they just help a lot early in the game as their tags allow you to unlock ep , thrawn and chimaera . it saves you time and makes you pretty competitive early on in arena .
   (ID: 480f3d8feb42f76cdfa6ea3a1dfffaf98bf91060)

16. even in this sub . last time some dude stole a pic with the oops tag on it the entire sub ripped on that dude so bad . all memes should have a mark somewhere imo just to give credit where credit is due .
   (ID: 97f042c151ad751b2811d75ae69fd7feae42ed77)

17. every time i get used it ' s just another masturbatory story to me . who ' s next ?

   (ID: faebbe18abd4d1c69e3bb9106178f797255444c5)

19. wait , what ? you can only get it once ? i too lost it a long time ago . i was just waiting to find another prismatic shard .
   (ID: 32963b268f862205bfe0776470d7730e54b581ec)
