   (ID: 6b55ac21377298601038ad44ea0f65b18e7c5b51)

   (ID: 2623e4996f6df0e5814dbede4fbc9c1f13de4382)

3. if you found them because you were also using the app , then you can ' t really be mad , but you should definitely talk , discuss being open , or just break up . if someone else found them and showed you , just break up .
   (ID: 603a231fe5a5d93e7d1121f6265baf1dcb11f624)

4. that ' s not really her goal though , is it ? if westeros was being run by a benevolent ruler , she would still be invading the continent to reclaim the iron throne . she just happens to have lucked out that someone worse than her is currently in power .
   (ID: 1daf414799a71e9da93424af4505068a3a02f6ce)

   (ID: f179711c18514780c1b0257643d893ef1cf5a081)

6. awesome design very nice . really modern and suits the type of content you ' re displaying . the only thing that annoys me is if you look at the top left logo , the text is slightly too high . nothing major i just noticed it haha .
   (ID: b12500102e2c3acecd4aa0f307ed2ad270fe1c53)

7. maybe we ' re just lucky . its a really popular video from what i can remember .
   (ID: 4e0f41bc85f51f64d9103c2a165328ff6329dea1)

8. ive reached point where material items dont really do much for me anymore . im just looking for a relationship at the moment , and to plan out my life so i dont end up working until im dead .
   (ID: ae9e10cc82b9b20c52f819c70c83f657724f9f44)

9. not really , it ' s not all that uncommon in the lesbian community if you ' re in a relationship . which she is , just definitely not with me . we each have a wife at home .
   (ID: b8935e64705419fa81f156d0d29b88ffd1e2f443)

10. they could just be really busy . that is a possibility , i hardly speak to my best mate anymore , but he works real fucking hard now so i understand we can ' t hang out everyday anymore
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

11. my eyes are bleeding . even if all these emojis are a part of the joke which just makes no sense in this case , it ' s still really painful to see
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

12. surprisingly no alcohol was involved . the guy in the vid my classmate is just really stupid .
   (ID: 97a098bef8517b2080cad8aa73f738b95e795b18)

13. i ' m with you on this one . nah is really the best answer . his family just lost their son , but op is justifiable in his response . unfortunately , death changes things
   (ID: 40e9f2306751118eda95174d093680e74831a34d)

14. i legit prayed once . it was to move into a certain house . we ended up moving there . i guess i prayed to " god " or whatever . wasn ' t really a clear person in mind . just wanted to move lol .
   (ID: 23436d4a3b029dec718d52bd8f69b7b3bb78dd25)

15. i ' m really sorry but you have asked so many questions about absolute random stuff that you would probably be better off without . just go on tinder and get yourself a man or something , please .
   (ID: 93e3d10c1d0bffae76c0adb5d9a96d6abf1aade9)

16. nothing really . i was allowed to watch just about whatever and even if i was told not to , i would watch it anyway . i understood things a lot sooner than most kids as a result .
   (ID: 55510b17a4f0d7b5820e6f21287525ef6cd60994)

17. it  s actually insane to me how ppl call tat waiter a creep and suggest op should report him to the restaurant . with the given info the waiter really might have just tried to be as friendly as possible  maybe just really likes kids  has grandchildren himself . he even gave her a desert for free , jesus . just to be stigmatized for being a pedophile , potentially being fired ? op , yta .
