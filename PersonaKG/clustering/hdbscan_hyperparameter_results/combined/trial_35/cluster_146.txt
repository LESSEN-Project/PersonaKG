16. that sounds like you have some really tense fingers , no idea what would help with that . my best guess would be to pay attention to your hand while you play and see if it gets super tense , and if so relax a bit . otherwise visiting your doctor might help

   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

19. i draw the line up to where someone tells another person to harm another . example   go out and cause x harm  or  go harass x  and the logical call to actions like saying there  s a fire in a movie theater when there really isn  t . other than that it  s fair game no matter how hateful the words are .
