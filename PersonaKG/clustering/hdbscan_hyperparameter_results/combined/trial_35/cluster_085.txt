1. how do you say you ' re pretty well sized and in the next sentence say how it has been problematic for you but my lizard brain still manages to ignore that and think  " damn , having a huge dong sounds great . " it ' s so ingrained .
   (ID: d7b75c00237dc445cdc3ebc380fbcb79a40b1a5f)

2. i wouldn  t say your original post came off as humble . i didn  t think it was arrogant though . all i have to say is , if the women that you  re talking to desire you more when you  re being a jerk , they must have no self  esteem .
   (ID: 256407c5e6c8d9342d8aabf5c9c392fc179ba9f3)

3. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .

4. you might think we ' re done . but no matter what you say , we will complete this dungeon . if rocks fall and yolnaak dies , so be it .

5. personally i would say that altair and edward would be the last ones standing . kenway , being a pirate would be prone to fighting dirty and altair was trained from the moment he could walk , if my memory serves pun totally fucking intended , would , and should absolutely kick ass . personally i think that altair takes the cake but it would be a pretty close call .

6. thank you . i think i needed someone to say that to break the feedback loop of doubt that i sometimes get stuck in .
   (ID: 063122b93a40a719244d27587193e154f2fed59d)

7. i ' d say no . but i think a lot of it is personal bias or what one would prefer to watch .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

8. i think you meant to say ,  would you be harder than dark souls if this were a game ?  . yes , yes i would be .
