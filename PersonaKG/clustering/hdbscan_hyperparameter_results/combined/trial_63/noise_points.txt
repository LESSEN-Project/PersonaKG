1. there ' s nothing you can realistically do about this apart from get a hold of yourself and learnt to move past it . remind yourself that you have no reason to be angry about it and make sure you never treat your girlfriend poorly because of it
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

2. i dont get it . normal people ? of reddit ? how do you look in both eyes at the same time ? wat
   (ID: 0ddaeffad510fe540496c0e0b97a1a85b13282eb)

3. being treated nicely isn ' t what everyones after , some people prefer someone who ' ll challange them . whether it be intellectually or spiritually or whatever . lots of people are also still searching for what they want . someone might think they want excitment rather than someone who ' s more chilled and later find out they were wrong . there is also the possibility they just don ' t want you and thats it . idk its not an exact science . last possibility assuming you haven ' t made a definitive move on her is they think you ' d make a move if you wanted to and have given up on their end . if you think this is it , just try having a chat with them and say your piece . it ' ll happen or it won ' t but its better to have a answer i hope you enjoyed my ted talk
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

4. so now i can tell all crossfitters at my gym to stop give other people advice . what is up with that ! everytime even my boss who is a crossfit guru or something like that tells me what to eat , that i need to join him and hog all the playground equipment from children . i said kindly no sir !
   (ID: 14bd1366b004b74cfd8c9cb269849740d12cff80)

5. immediately owning up to your mistake and making a visible and concentrated effort to prevent repeating it in the future works wonders .
   (ID: f39e591889b6331bd255039773030c1b50c7e201)

6. cut your loss and move on . obviously easier said than done but sitting around wondering what you did wrong , why she would do that , etc . is only going to make the hurt last longer . just do your best to forget about it and maybe try something easy like tinder to keep you distracted . you don ' t need to use it for sex or anything unless you want to but talking to girls on there is super easy . keeps me distracted when i am hung up on someone .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

7. i don ' t like playing russian roulette . easily digit  of the time i used to quickmatch i ended up alone . server browser is now my default . maybe since they ' ve been opening some of the dlc to non premium players it ' s gotten better . i should try quickmatch again i suppose .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

8. dude , stop . check if there are any hidden cameras . it must be a prank !
   (ID: b5bfc53fa7245451bad229f942e351fdc7360321)

9. how does the caption generator work ?  know police serve you with very high iq , kids . that sounds like a botched attempt to give me useful advice .
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

10. i hate this world
   (ID: 79b35c8caff79f47f37bb4856cc6b57bcd49e5bf)

11. it ' s about the dust bowl . especially if you ' re from the states , it ' s worth a read . it ' s hard to believe this happened not that long ago . pretty horrific stuff .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

12. I am abuser.
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

13. i find people who have a drinking problem love to judge those who don ' t . i was told once that i ' m only fun when i drink by someone i mostly saw through the bottom of a wine glass , so i stopped drinking and hanging around that person . don ' t allow anyone to cross your boundaries , it ' s not worth it even a little . best of luck !
   (ID: 8b7590cb8502d6abd38b320b842aa7642186b6d8)

14. basically , if he  s a changed man , why is he bringing this up now ? if he  s moved past this , why does he feel the need to express this ? being love and validated aren  t synonymous . you can love your pops , but think his actions are wrong . furthermore , people are in love with what they think liam is . who outside of his close friends and family really knows him . how many people loved kevin spacey before he was ousted ? i dont think you understand what i mean when i say he  s seeking validation . he wants people to say  yeah , i understand how you could have those thoughts  . that  s why it  s selfish , it  s self serving . he could have said ,  i was a racist who unjustly went around hunting people i knew nothing about hoping to kill them to satisfied my twisted definition of justice . instead he churched up the story to try and justify is actions . like i  ve said , if a white person raped his friend , would he have acted the same way ? i  m willing to wager he wouldn  t . we can be empathetic , we aren  t monsters , but we don  t have to validate it . these are the thoughts of a fucking racist .
   (ID: b5cc14fd703a97548093b4e06f7e3e92575b80b9)

15. you get to the center of the galaxy and it is nothing . the game pulls away and you end up in another galaxy with all your stuff broken .
   (ID: a70e276355baaea2f732281343d3f63ea5d96365)

16. so how do you meet new people today without walking up and talking to them ?
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

17. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

18. soul ? come on , milhouse , there ' s no such thing as a soul . it ' s just something they make up to scare kids , like the boogeyman or michael jackson .
   (ID: 34784a4c9eca2e43db08bf9f548798a984337741)
