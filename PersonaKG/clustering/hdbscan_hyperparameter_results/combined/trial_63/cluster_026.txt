1. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers

2. once people started to judge me , didn ' t feel so good
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

3. you don ' t get a lot of these jokes , do you ?

4. put the good deathrattle minion in your deck i found the problem in the good word . there are no really good deathrattle minions right now .

5. i have the mentality of " well i don ' t like myself so why would other people like me . this just makes me push people away . the few people that i feel comfortable talking to always remain aquaintances .

6. it ' s a big mix of stuff but time is just one component . youtube is full of really socially intelligent folks that know how to help you navigate heartbreak . finding the right advice along with finding healthy distractions is key . you have to acknowledge your feelings , while at the same time giving yourself liberty to feel different emotions through other activities and diversion . you have to delve into healing while at other times work on suppressing certain emotions since they are not all constructive and sometimes even accurate . stay social . don ' t be afraid to hook with folks . i personally recommend tripping on molly , mushrooms or lsd to create an experience that could heighten your sense of how beautiful consciousness is . it sucks to say , but pain is a very helpful tool for progress . some people use it masochistically to self sabotage and wallow in a cycle of victimhood , self pity and depression . you could instead use pain to turn around and help other people , perhaps hold yourself to higher standards in important ways and above all use this opportunity to learn more about yourself and how to become the best friend to yourself you could possibly be .

7. not american either , and sure , sanders would have been a better option than any other candidate . as far as unemployment , i will admit i have not seen data about it however , i seriously doubt it ' s been lowered significantly without useless spending from the government . i personally don ' t see a problem with oppressing people who have done bad things before or believe in white supremacy . not sure what is the other type of oppression you mean . why do you believe people should own firearms ? do you seriously not believe there is danger associated with that ? what is this islam problem you are talking about exactly ? if it ' s extremism , it ' s really not exclusive to crazy people with islamic beliefs . this problem is due to mentally unstable people misinterpreting their religion and brainwashing uneducated people . have you ever had a real conversation with a muslim ? what is your honest opinion about how sweden should be handling muslim immigrants ? last thing , do you not see any problem with blatant lying to the press and population ?

8. i don  t think it  s women that like you less , it  s just not the best women who are acting like this with you . i mostly have female friends i knew before and after transitioning and they were all really supportive , same with any male friends i had . they are good people , so they accepted me wholeheartedly . i suggest finding those types of people in your life , regardless of gender yknow ?

9. people do that here , what ' s your point
   (ID: a2291731ea6532473dc0e3f9275ce68c86abfad6)

10. i mean hey , different people , different opinions . i ' m not taking that away from you . i don ' t wanna force my opinions and ideas down on people that do not show signs of wanting to .
   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)

11. this post is actually a pretty good start . whether you realize it or not , you ' re reaching out . now you need to go to a doctor , or a therapist , or whoever you feel comfortable with , and tell them all of the things that you have told us here . i ' m no doctor , so i can ' t say one way or the other whether or not you actually need medicine . but that ' s all the more reason to go talk to a real one . if you really do have depression , you might need meds . you wouldn ' t leave any other disease untreated , right ? as for the girl in the pic , i ' m guessing you look nothing like her . the hard reality is that you probably never will . everyone is different . you need to stop comparing yourself to other people , because you ' re only hurting yourself more . chances are , that girl has insecurities of her own . everyone does . but you can ' t let it control your life .

12. it ' s hard to give advice because everyone handles this sort of thing differently . we went through three miscarriages , but they were all before our first child , so for us , there wasn ' t any question of trying again . for some people , it helps to start trying again right away . some want to wait for awhile before trying again . it ' s probably best to give it some time , for your wife to get back to normal physically , and for you both to heal emotionally . make sure she knows you ' re there to support her , but don ' t smother here either , give her space if she needs it . and always keep in mind , that unless she has an underlying health problem which it doesn ' t sound like is the case since you already have two kids , miscarriages are random occurrences , and aren ' t likely to happen with the next pregnancy .

13. yeah i ' m really sorry dude . this is often how it happens with something prescribed . it works really well to treat a symptom , but then it turns recreational . the only way i can put this is that you have to allow yourself to suffer . i ' m not sure if you have to be absolutely miserable during your break while your throat is healing but you have to give yourself permission to feel worse before you start feeling good again . as with lots of medicines that treat the symptom well , ironically they don ' t tackle the cause . without alcohol , do whatever you can to knock yourself out . use valerian , or make a pot cookie . do whatever you can to sedate yourself and don ' t use uppers . then , when you are all healed you can use recreationally without such a large concern for your health . you do need to stop though , strep is horrendous . you have to get out of your own way .

14. because we leave the freedoms to the individual . some people are retarded and make poor decisions ie not paying attention in school , have kids at digit years old , or joining gangs instead of filling their time with more productive means

15. digit i  m not straight digit wouldn  t it make sense to argue that nobody should be harassed for their sexuality . your hatred of straight people really confuses me .

16. tights will hide things , but leggings don ' t . also , they still make girdles and people still wear them .

17. i strongly disagree . mace is awesome . here is why  digit it ' s non  lethal  digit it ' s cheap  digit it ' s very good at blinding and disorienting an opponent  digit it can be carried almost anywhere . ccw is better than mace . however , if for some reason you cannot concealed carry , mace is a thing to use . not a knife lethal , bad stopping power , requires a lot of skill to use effectively , not a taser too easy to miss , dense clothing can defeat  mace . because mace is non  lethal and cheap , it can be used in a situation where deadly force is excessive . when in doubt , spray opponent with mace and run away . also , you really should be aware how mace works before using mace . if you decide to carry it , watch some tests on youtube . read advice . buy two cans of mace , spend one on target practice to get a hang of it and carry second one . or , better , carry more than one can . tl  dr mace is better than knife , baseball bat or other improvised weapons . edit  i just remembered one very important thing . mace is not scary . do not threaten people with mace . do not even hint you have mace . when in doubt , spray and run immediately . threatening people with mace does not work .

18. hehehe , whatever you do , don ' t be yourself

20. i believe that for british people complaining and grumbling about life is an important part of social bonding . it ' s a common thing that when two british people meet they will grumble about something before having any kind of in  depth social interaction . almost anything will do , the bad weather , their house , the high fuel tax , the weather etc . all british people will understand this and understand that it isn ' t really a proper complaint about society . it ' s a shared comradeship in a bitter life that favours nobody in the end . it ' s a social lubrication . a shared misery that finds common ground and a place from which to build a friendship . australians just don ' t seem to get this . brit  ' fuck me , it ' s hot here today ' australian  ' what are you complaining about ? it ' s fucking beautiful . what ' s the weather like in the uk right now ? ' brit  ' uh , yeah . i guess you are right ' australian  ' whinging pom , eh ? ' brit  ' yeah , the weather is great here . you are right ' british people use shared misery and grumbling , whether real or perceived , in order to form social bonds . this doesn ' t really exist in the same way in australia . british people are rather socially retarded on the whole so shutting off their one shared mechanism for social interaction is a great hindrance .
