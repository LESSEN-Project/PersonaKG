1. used to work at tb . changing your order to only beans or fresco style is super easy and employee are supposed to make your food however you want it . the only issue i ' d say is that when there are a lot of changes on multiple items during a rush it can get overlooked on the food makers ' order screens and you might get something you didn ' t want or not get something you wanted . food makers learn to make the items a specific way and it can be difficult to alter what is actually just memorized movements . i was never bothered about people asking to change the ingredients in the digit years i was there .
   (ID: 238316960c030f561912bd63e9f572a4170f991b)

2. if you can come up with a name you both like , it would be nice if you changed it together so you have that connection even though , like you say , a name doesn ' t equal family , but it ' s a nice thing to have in common . if you ' re serious about changing your first name too , have a look at lists there are plenty online or ask around i ' m sure people here would be happy to give you suggestions . pretty soon you ' ll work out which styles and sounds you like and dislike . i ' d also recommend having a look at the top 100ish names for the year you were born and maybe a few other years from around that time as a starting point , that way you ' ll know if you want something in  keeping with your generation or something a bit more unusual .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

3. so basically you can not take an interest in another persons culture because , someone might get offended , so should different people from different cultures be separated so that they don  t share and grow from their cultural history  s ?
   (ID: 87173aaf55980a77c94bd30c851c39fb0b52ff2e)

4. One of my favorite things is trians bu.
   (ID: b5bfc53fa7245451bad229f942e351fdc7360321)

5. yes i like this . i want this to be the truth
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

6. personal preference  rest . there is no reason for you to swap if you really dont want to but you might aswell try and see if you like others more . a different crosshair literaly changes the whole way the guns feel . starting with a simple dot to weird crosshairsettings . fool around , copy others and see what suits you best . as for me . coming from digit . digit i really need someone similar to that .
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

7. One of my favorite things is yooo.
   (ID: c374848a7cde05ee9d6d14f7ab991b3b11f71a87)

8. it ' s less about the frito pie and more about the discovering of it . i ' d had most of the others you mention well before moving here . that one i hadn ' t even heard of , didn ' t know it existed . you ' re right , there are southern foods i like better , and a lot of em . but frito pie was somehow a secret

   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

12. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

15. this has given me food for thought . i have just weaned off my antidepressant because i  ve been experiencing all over body pain and a variety of other negative symptoms for more than digit months and my doctor is convinced that they are all side effects of lexapro . i suspect fibromyalgia but ssd is another possibility i hadn  t heard of before . i  ll be looking into it more , thank you . thanks for the blog link too , i love how this community comes together to share advice and resources toward healing !

17. it is the helicopter mom of states . has too many kids and not enough time but it is hell bent on showing the other moms it not only loves all its children equally but more than they could ever love their children , and it will shame them for that . you let you kids drink sugary drinks sssssstttth well alright , oh you let your kids walk half a block to school oooh well i ' m sure they will be alright , oooohhh my heck you let your kids play with guns i should call cps . oh and don ' t forget all the social work . done half ass . entirely so she can judge all the other moms for being selfish bitches who only worry about their own kids , mean while her kids are dressed in hand me down second hand store out fits , and she has them on a diet that is really because she can not make ends meet despite her husband bringing in 200k .

19. I am novice slow cooker.
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

20. thanks for the detailed response back i  m really the same way a lot of the time  i really only talk when it  s important to me and try to stay comfortable wherever i am with a calm attitude . i would rather observe than participate . it  s hard for others to  read  a person who acts so chill i don  t think being late would really affect someone else feeling uneasy around you  it  s not necessarily a  flaw  but could be misconstrued as being confident you  ll be okay if you  re late . i would definitely try to stop being late . you wanna be seen as putting in as much effort as everyone else . also , help out your coworkers ! especially the new ones  being the big kid on the block is intimidating especially if they don  t feel like they  re meeting your standards . ask someone who seems to be nervous around you for help to figure out nyc mass transit and see what happens  they might start to feel more comfortable . try to be a little less chill  most people are uncomfortable around others who seem to be confident in their silence because it kinda makes you seem like a stranger . try to observe others around you  are they asking questions often ? are they talking amongst themselves while you just observe ? what can you do to relate to them ? incorporate yourself into other peoples  lives and i think you  ll see a big change . in regards to meeting a girl  you should remember that women want to feel calm with their man  don  t try to throw out how chill you are  instead just show them a different side to you . as a first date do something really actively fun and faster paced like roller skating or an adult jump house . if they have strong opinions on something you kinda feel indifferent about , join along in their fury if it  s not that big of a deal . just little things to make you more relatable . relatable is the key word here for sure ! good luck
