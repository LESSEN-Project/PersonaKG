   (ID: c9a98f7f4291c6c1eefeeaae838890408881f877)

2. i ' m sorry you hate dogs ? people coming together to save a life , or give more time , is somehow a bad thing because its not human life ? this makes zero sense to me . i know people who have spent just as much if not more on their pets . you do what you can for those you love .

3. very understandable . it helps if you can sell eggs , grow some of what they eat , and use their litter productively , but those aren ' t realistic options for everyone .

4. well , i don ' t hate pugs , they are not responsible for it . but i do hate that humans made something like that .
