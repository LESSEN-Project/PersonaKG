1. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .
