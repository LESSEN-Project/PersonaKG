7. i just chose the movie i like . and i am not being racist . i dont find the race appeal for bploved it as a ' marvel ' movie as racism is not part of my upbringing . also , i am brown .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

8. just off the top of my head . race is an optical illusion , bernie sanders doesnt like socialism as much as he likes attention , trump and chris christie are having an affair , and reddit is a cia project designed to gather psychological data on americans .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

13. kind request to my fellow muppets when posting a link to a tweet or instagram post or whatever could you please copy paste what was actually written in quotes ? just in case it gets deleted like it happened in the past days but also cuz my browser is a cunt sometimes and doesn ' t let me open twitter . thanks and muppet on .

14. games like that are just depressing . the only reason people play it is to jerk off but if you have to put more than digit minutes into something just to start jerking off you ' re wasting your time . especially when it comes to this where you have to either spend digit hours or another digit bucks to see the outline of a tiddie . it makes no sense since you can just type in " anime tiddies " in google and get a million results instantly and for free .

16. well my friend you sound like a worthy gentleman . is this fair lass of yours isn ' t ready for the snorlax then it ' s her loss . sloth is the enemy of greatness and if she continues to drag it along , you certainly deserve better . apologies , i ' m so drunk that my atheist  heathen ass may have just quoted the bible . nonetheless , the point is the same . if she keep stringin ' ya along , you deserve better mate .

17. you can find them on sale for like  digit . it  s nice to be able to just set it and let it cook for a couple hours . the rice cooker setting alone is worth it .
   (ID: 45768598053a5b3cdf1e6e286b99114b7acf5f3c)

18. ah yes , the worldwide  feared british nukes would totally scare russia into submission , it ' s not like russia has c  300s that are proven to be capable of stopping nato ' s balistic missiles or anything like that . also , if russia were to produce just one more tsar bomba  class nuke and drop it on top of the british isles , the uk is gone and so is ireland , the northern part of france , the benelux and possibly parts of nothwestern germany .
