7. sadly , hormones can  t fix all our features  even though hrt for transmen is stronger than trans women most of the time . i know personally i  m a guy and all but after going on t , i got more dysphoria around my chest when i was pre op , female organs and bottom area . i changed drastically but that made things i can  t change stand out even more . that happens a lot when people transition . hrt is not going to make our lives perfect and amazing like many people think . i personally believe that  s why a lot of trans people are depressed and stuff after hormones , they imagined their life to instantly become perfect and all their problems go away . our problems will still be there after hormones , i knew this . i just knew that my problems will be easier to deal with as a man than a girl for me .

15. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

16. and there ' s no reason for them to not understand it , they just mentally disconnect . ask if they know what a penpal is , they say yes . ask them if it ' s possible to fall in love with a penpal , they say yes . ask them to imagine having a penpal over the internet , they can handle that too . but ask them to imagine falling in love with an internet penpal , and suddenly they don ' t know left from right .

   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

19. personally i think the flavors go well together . i ' ve heard people talk about acidity being the main factor as to why they don ' t go for it and that i can understand . i just don ' t like people saying it ' s weird or the thought of fruit on pizza baffles them .
   (ID: 2db14c004e6ef125f85aa3678978a5718eebd11a)
