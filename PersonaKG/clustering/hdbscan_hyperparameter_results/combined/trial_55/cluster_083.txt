6. let ' s be real tho , how many times is a centurion gonna charge his heavy from neutral ? if we ' re talking about casuals , then yeah that probably works , but if we are talking high level duels then most often than not the centurion starts with a kick or a feint . btw i ' m not talking about just dodging the kick , almost the whole cast gets some sort of guard break or cc after dodging one but kensei doesn ' t , he just dodges because the recovery is so slow to do anything .
