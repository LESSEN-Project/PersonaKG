   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

3. this is how players get hurt . having to think to much and letting up , not doing what you would naturally do . this is more of a problem than the refs . they should just play digit  hand touch and qbs should wear red jerseys the whole year if this is how it  s gonna be . i understand the league trying to protect the qb , but this is just absolutely ridiculous now .
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

4. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

5. she invited you to her house , showered while you were there and was willing to let you see her in just a towel ? i think you missed some signals , buddy .

   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

8. yep ! i think we also see her mention it briefly in a season digit flashback to the red center just before she mentions the colonies and we see the picture of junes mom too .
   (ID: e387b7eddf8ab01e3dd767dc2f5ca52494fbe9b0)

9. the planet or just life on it ? i think it would be cool if we explored to other planets and earth became obsolete .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

10. why should you panic if there is nothing to lose . youre not playing in the katowice grandfinal . just try your best and if you fail , think . about what you could have done . better in that situation . you learn by mistakes
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

12. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
