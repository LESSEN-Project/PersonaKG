1. i  m getting one that isn  t a full controller but offers triggers so i can switch my shoot  aim button on pubg to be where they press . i  d say your best shot is to just search game controller for phone and see what would fit you best
   (ID: cd907372aff0871825a64e977822586e3bb0ecb7)

2. she was too centered on me , for lack of a better articulation . not that she was clingy , but there was not enough " texture " in our relationship . perhaps someone who ' s experienced similar can say it more eloquently .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

5. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

8. terrorists who do nothing but play into the hands of other radical groups . whether or not their ideologically is inherently as bad as say a nazi is irrelevant , it ' s more that they add fuel to the fire so to speak .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

9. i will say this , nice to see a skx009j for once . and your bezel seems to line up very nice !
   (ID: 14bd1366b004b74cfd8c9cb269849740d12cff80)

10. i can answer this despite being an english speaker . it ' s because you haven ' t been taught that cuss words in other languages are just as bad . we never snuck around our parents to say " mierda " , unless of course you ' re spanish , so yeah . it ' s just that it wasn ' t drilled into your head like it is with your own version of the word . like americans using bollocks
   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

12. why wouldn ' t he change ? if people say something is annoying he ' s bound to stop
   (ID: b6c3e540255084641f0e148a3992d9113c560f0b)

13. hard to say it ' s deserved for real . that ' s what happens when you don ' t put away your chances . the other team comes back .
   (ID: 3fb1292a0bd26711d797fe1a61e6229794c21b68)

14. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

15. let ' s just say that it isn ' t their voices i think of when i ' m in the shower .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

16. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

19. definitely ! and what bugs me even more is when my friends correct the mistake they made when i can clearly understand what they were trying to say . does anyone else get mad when their friends correct their typos ?
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

20. yeah just about to say it looks like the bird thing from botw
