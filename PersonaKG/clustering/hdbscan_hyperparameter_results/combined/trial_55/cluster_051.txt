1. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .

2. no offence taken , it ' s not just about the pvp , it ' s also about farming , which is fine if that ' s how others want to play . i was of the understanding that fw was about conflict and dominating the enemy , this can be pretty hard if the enemy just warps off when i turn up , if you ' re at ' war ' then be at ' war ' . i can understand why these ideas may not be for you in particular , but maybe , just maybe , a lot of others may be just as frustrated as me and actually want to have some gf ' s . i like different points of view as sometimes brilliant ideas can evolve , how  what would you like to see done to improve fw ?

3. just ask her  random question . if i asked you if you  d date me , would you ?  or something like that . don  t make it seem like you want to date her , just like a funny question .

8. i believe it . i sometimes think about spirits as the human part of the deceased that didn  t want to leave . they want to stay , for some reason . and they aren  t necessarily hostile or scary , they just have unfinished business and are hanging out until they can complete it . it appears he may have cared about you so much that he wanted to meet you before he left .
