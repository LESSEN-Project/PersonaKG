1. i ' m not that much stronger than you are uh ? aren ' t you digit or 11k ? modesty is good , but don ' t contemn all that you ' ve already achieved . you are much stronger .

3. i ' m digit and have this problem . i have to go over the line again once or twice to fill in skipped spaces , and sometimes add a little matte eye shadow to really darken it up . i ' ve resigned myself to the fact that i ' m not going to get crisp , perfect eyeliner lines . my looks are more " smudgey "

4. tricky one this . i suppose if you went for a girl with those tendencies in the first place , or if that  s what first attracted you , then it would be hypocritical to ask her to change . if it  s that your partner has become sexually suggestive online recently , i would assume that there  s an underlying reason for that perhaps . not saying it  s necessarily a sign that they  re unhappy in the relationship , but some people need more flattery or attention than others . i  ve seen the huge amount of likes girls get on instagram for these types of pictures and it must be quite tempting  addictive .

5. i  m sober too and sometimes say politely  i  m sober  when someone offers me a drink and i  m trying to head off or end a conversation about why i don  t want a drink  prevent a future offer . sometimes people don  t take  no thank you , i don  t drink .  as a full answer without follow up questions which i may not be opening to answering . i  ve had many first dates where i  ve had to say i  m a recovering alcoholic to get people to stop questioning me about why i don  t drink . for the record i  m not saying op was going to question her thusly or that the coworker was polite , but , just that  i  m sober  can have a more valid , less self righteous context versus a simple  no , thank you .  .

6. generally they don ' t notice . i stopped completely shaving because of the amount of ingrown hair so now i trim . i ' ve even been known to not bother for a while and go natural and again no problems with partners .

7. i haven ' t been everywhere in the world but enough places outside of the states to come to the conclusion that minimal eye contact is an american thing . a lot of the places i ' ve been the social norm leans more toward staring . i thought maybe it ' s just cause i was a tourist i get extra attention but noticed how people interact with their other countrymen . i guess what i ' m saying is eye contact is fine and a simple smile or wave to acknowledge the other party makes it less awkward .
