2. huh . i never romanced tali but i figured he would say it at some point , maybe you missed it ? i don ' t think shepard ever says it first though , i remember him answering " i love you too " to most of them , but not the other way around . i guess it ' s usually the love interests who confess their undying love and stuff , shep tends to show more with actions than words .
