Total from this dataset: 7

1. youre probably just paranoid . you dont even notice the mistakes you make . going to the same position each round , doing something " obvious " . most of the time you dont even need to know where someone is cus its obvious . if you face a wallhacker you can still outaim him . however if the guy has an aimbot it doesnt matter if he sees you or not . he just holds down lmb and you die

2. i ' m fresh out of high school , and i hated when people would do this . or brag about how they only smoke the ' good ' weed . granted i know there is a difference between mid grade weed and high grade , just shut the fuck up and smoke it . it ' s pot , it ' s going to get you high regardless . why do people feel the need to brag about such things ? shouldn ' t weed unite us ?

3. you ' re gonna get camped one every dozen , dozen and a half or so games during the start of the season , it ' s just people hungry for their old rank . it is a trade off because if he literally facecamps you and you do the right thing draw it out as long as possible then the rest of the team will basically secure a victory in the meantime , but that ' s not a huge relief for the guy getting facecamped . just incentive to learn how to evade better ! as for the rank reset , it happens every month so this isn ' t exactly the moon and sun aligning to screw you personally over . there ' s just a couple days of weird ranking while stuff gets figured out , not a big deal . it ' s gonna happen again in october and november and december and so on so it ' s not really worth complaining about

4. everyone  s there to improve , most people who know this aren  t paying attention to anyone else and most likely enjoy seeing other people there to better themselves . imo anyone who shames other people for trying to do that is just an asshole

5. if someone  s tailgating you , just get out of the way if you can . stopping hard and flipping them off is only gonna make them angrier . if you can  t get out of the way , learn to properly brake check . you  re supposed to lightly tap on your brake , so that you don  t decelerate but your brake lights come on , letting them know they  re too close . if all else fails and they persist in riding your ass and possibly following you , then i  d say it  s okay to stop short . just brace yourself for a possible hit and a lot of yelling afterwards .

6. we all screw up and make mistakes . you will make more in your years of driving . just kind of put your hands up and shake them and that kind of acknowledges that you know that you were wrong . it ' s sort of a visual " sorry . he can ' t do anything with your license plate . even in the worst possible case that he could , it ' s his word against yours . it ' s not even worth his time . he probably just let the dust settle . if you ' re on the road , you have to deal with people who make mistakes and assholes alike .

7. don ' t try to act it was intentional or that you were serious . just laugh in a way , that indicates that you know you just did something awkward . thats how you show confidence and the ability to laugh about yourself . but you still need to stand your ground , if your awkward moment becomes a permanent joke about you . but the absolute worst thing you can do ist to become the aggressor , if you try to bring the attention to somebody else , by beeing an asshole , you show everybody your low self esteem and bad character .
