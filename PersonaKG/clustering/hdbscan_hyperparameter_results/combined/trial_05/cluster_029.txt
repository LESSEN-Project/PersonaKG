3. info  what  s your real issue with dating someone who  s had more sex than you ? you keep dodging around what specifically makes you uncomfortable about it under the guise of  well i haven  t had as much sex as them  . so what if you haven  t ? is it a purity thing ? a confidence thing ? being scared of settling ?

6. well yeah of course , but most if not all guys are clueless then misinterpret reactions to mean a completely different thing than what she wants including myself . could you be a bit more specific with examples perhaps ?

7. the same thing applies to others , even with different situations . people will treat you differently based on who is and isn  t around . if you find someone who seems interested in you who does not change under attention , then you should go for it so long as you are interested .
