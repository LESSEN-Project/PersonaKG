8. no , the short  term outlook is that capitalism is doing fine and working as designed . sure , class antagonisms are becoming more pronounced and contradictions are heightening but the capitalists are doing fine . there may be an upcoming " market correction " or recession , but recessions are fine and sometimes good for capitalists . workers lose a lot during recessions , e . g . they ' ll accept worse working conditions , worse contracts , etc but the same is not necessarily true for capitalists . recessions serve as an excellent disciplinary device of the labor market and just because you ' re struggling , doesn ' t mean the capitalists are struggling as well . with respect to the socio  political institutions , sure there is some intermittent turbulence but they remain relatively stable , e . g . the democratic party of the u . s . is collaborating with the other major political party and serving as a bulwark against the more radical  progressive wing of their own party . capitalism is amazing at constantly reinventing itself , swallowing old contradictions and creating new ones their wake .

9. nice list though duplicating some of the requests earlier to the normal maps app . i  m sure if they bring them then they  ll bring it to both this one and the maps app . on another note , i recently submitted most of this feedback to not just the apple feedback site , but also to eddy cue as he  s the svp of maps among many other things . you might wanna do so too so it likely gets better prioritized as imho few from the teams read our postings here .
