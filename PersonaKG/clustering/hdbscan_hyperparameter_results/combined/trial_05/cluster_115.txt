1. nta . as a lesbian and as a human being with good communication in a good relationship , i see no issue with what you did . your other doesnt trust you and is very insecure . i ' d talk to her and if it didnt resolve , i ' d get a new girlfriend that trusts me enough to not cheat .

2. holy fucking christ nta , the kid is four , four year olds chat shit with out even meaning too plus she apologised . a calm conversation explaining what she did wrong was fine to corrected it bf is a fucking psycho never said this before but yeah major red flags in this post you need to leave and never look back

3. that was quite shitty of her . lots of people use others as kink dispensers and then get mad when they ' re not comfortable with what ' s going on . you did the right thing in stopping .

4. i see what you mean . i have been called stuck  up because i keep to myself and sometimes have a serious expression on my face that really doesn ' t reflect what ' s going on in my head . i ' ve heard of the marco guy  he really doesn ' t have much to be stuck  up about  simply being the drug  addled son of a rich man is hardly an accomplishment . did that sound snooty ? oops !

5. i agree ! to pretty much anyone in a western  hemisphere or of european lineage context it  d be a fist fight . but , in their context though they see it as innocent not to say it  s not ignorant of medical conditions and genetics , etc , caring and a less awkward way of telling a person they  re getting pudgy . if someone was really offended they would be profusely apologetic , but also completely not understand what they did wrong and still chalk it up to a foreigner not understanding the culture .
