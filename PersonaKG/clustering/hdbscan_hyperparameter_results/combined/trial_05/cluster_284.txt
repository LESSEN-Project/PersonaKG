1. what ' s the worst that could happen ? someone yells at you ? you freeze up and don ' t know what to say or you stutter a bit ? it ' s just talking to someone on the phone about politics . you want a political revolution , you want democracy to return to america ? well talking about politics is where that begins . seriously , i suck at talking on the phone . i ' ve done the stuttering and saying something dumb loads of times and i feel like an idiot but it ' s really not that bad . you can do it !

3. i lost digit . digit stone  90lbs . then found 56lb of it again . am back on the losing it again . it ' s a war not a battle . don ' t give up if you start to slip . it didn ' t go on in a day and won ' t come off in a day . find your reason that motivates you and will help when what you want right now mmm . chocolate seems more important than what you want to achieve long term . but don ' t beat yourself up if you slip , you ' ve not failed . find like minded people for motivation . seek support from friends so they don ' t put temptation in your way . don ' t be surprised when resistance comes from the oddest places . people who ' re scared that you ' re changing or don ' t want to be the group ' s new ' fat one ' . just keep trying . you can do it .

4. digit you don  t have to meet him if you don  t want to . lots of people never really get closure , and that sucks , but really what is the goal here anyways ? you could easily exchange longer messages over email or something and give him closure that way . digit why are you so concerned about the image he has of you ? are you hoping that something will be rekindled ? otherwise i feel shattering that image that he has of you will probably just help him move on and you won  t have to hear from the ex again . digit even if you do meet up , you don  t actually have to reveal any information about yourself that you don  t want to . just keep it vague . there  s nothing wrong with just broadly answering  i  m taking out some time to figure out my life , i  ve grown out of x interest  etc . if the subject of what you  re doing these days comes up .

5. just so i understand  you  re gay but have a girlfriend and this isn  t enough to keep up your charade . you need to make the guys you hang out with jealous by making this girl dress to show off her body . then you  re going to introduce this girl to your family and want her to dress like this again for them . what  s the plan here ? you seem like you don  t know what you want . in another thread , you say you  re coming out to your mother because you don  t have any money . you  re all over the place . any way you could just be your authentic self ? or if you  re going to remain closeted to some in your family , why march this girl around having her partake in your lie ? you could just be single .

6. why do you need to tell her he is trans ? just say they are your boyfriend . you don ' t need to " out " him to her , even with permission . its unnecessary in this circumstance additional information , and if you want your grandmother to fund your education , it seems like you should just either not say anything or just not disclose that unnecessary detail .
