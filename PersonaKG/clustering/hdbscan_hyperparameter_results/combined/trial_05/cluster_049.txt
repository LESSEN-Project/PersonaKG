1. are you taking about trails in the sky digit or trails of cold steel digit because the english release of sky digit came out last year and the japanese release of cold steel digit came out last year and they usually take a couple of years to be translated . you can definitely start playing cold steel digit without having played any in the trails in the sky series . the first sky is only  digit at the moment but the other two are still somewhat expensive , by my standards at least . i haven ' t actually played the third sky , but i think the story is only somewhat related to digit and digit , in that it has the same characters but runs somewhat parallel to the story of digit and digit , which is a continuous story .

2. lol ! i liked it a lot , especially the sense of isolation and vulnerability you had playing as a regular soldier rather than a spartan . it also reminded me a bit of metroid prime , which is one of my all  time favorite games .

3. solid picks . erased is ridiculously good , time travel isn  t a done enough genre if you ask me . attack on titan , baccano , durarara , and cowboy bebop are some of my other favs .

4. it depends . if you have friends with the forest , it ' s really fun . doom is more fast  paced and difficult comparatively .

5. i beat this game in one night a few months back for old time ' s sake . one of the best nostalgia trips ever .
