1. that ' s good ! when i say as an avid moviegoer , i mean that the encroaching on space maneuver would annoy me even if it was an agreed upon date just because it can be distracting  if i go to the movies , i want to watch the movie . but i ' m glad he ' s found someone . he can ' t be faulted for explicitly being told it was a date . the virtue of it being valentine ' s day though isn ' t a defense i would hold up in court though . how did you end up liking deadpool ? did you see the second one ? do you have any thoughts about once upon a deadpool ?
