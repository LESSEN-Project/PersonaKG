1. deserving something means they ' re worthy of it . i personally don ' t think anybody is worthy of leading an entirely bad life . sure , we make mistakes that can negatively impact our lives for a period of time . however , i believe people are trying to have a good life to the best of their ability . their best may not be seen as such  for example , people who intentionally inflict harm on others . there ' s some pain they feel that is relieved by doing so . of course there are other outlets yet they don ' t know that . i also should clarify that i don ' t agree with using harm to heal personal wounds  there ' s very few i downright despise . maybe i ' m just too nice though

2. so you keep telling me , i must have really made you angry with my opinion . didn ' t know it would shake you so badly . at the point you just parrot what i say while putting crying emojis in it i would really call it a conversation .

3. i didn ' t imply that , you inferred that very incorrectly i might add . all i said was they matter , and you twisted my statement around to make it something it ' s not . you really don ' t know how mental illness works , do you ? tell a suicidal person to just buck up and see what happens . most likely , it ' s not gonna do a damn thing for them .

4. god , i hate all of the rock fans . from the gatekeepers to the lewronggenerationhttps    type people . it makes me ashamed to be a rock fan . i can hardly wear a nirvana shirt without someone saying " oh i bet you don ' t even know that ' s a band and think it ' s just a brand " . bitch , you can fuck right off .

5. i don  t think people understand this . it  s important to know life is gonna change nothing will ever he permanent , idc what you say it will never be , so people need to learn how to push through tough times . mourning for a few days is good but you have to start grasping yourself after that as if not you will never learn to accept what happened and move on to a extent where it doesn  t affect your day to day living , i can say what a joke i was at digit i was so fucked up that i just coped with my friend being in coma with getting more fucked up . but idk how i would feel if she never woke up or etc , . , . i probably would not be talking to you rn if she hadn  t as i would never did a digit and just killed myself

6. really don  t know anymore lmao i use to be fucked up and pushed my emotions aside not caring about anything to deal with the shittyness and stress i had to deal with , currently i did a digit and quit all the bad habits cold turkey it  s been a few months and honestly i  m going insane . just before reading this a thought of suicide popped through my head and i was asking myself how would i deal with my friend who stood by my side for the worst of my years in life . how would i ask her if she wants to ask me anything before i did the act ? this is just a theoretical and not physical . i don  t plan to kms ever as i just can  t deal with the effects of it , even if i  m dead i would regret abusing my friends generosity . regardless i will just deal with this battle and just see where it takes me i  m envious that the friend has moved on from near where i am currently and i hope she never goes back but sometimes i do feel like shit when i look at myself . regardless she has a jump start as she  s digit  digit compared to where i  m digit  digit . here  s a funny talk we had . i noticed that most of he people i talk to are older then me and she said yes you attract older people . face  with  tears  of  joy even so i told her when i talk with people i never think about their age much as long as their above digit as their mature and not overhyper or etc . and she said she never though anything about it either and we always talk as we are equal not teen  adult teen . no this is not a sexual relationship and no this is not me abusing someone else or vice verse . she looked after me when i was deep and i did the same . i can say this if she never got out of coma i would have died a few years later probably . here  s the irony of this post ? you ready ? i never met this girl irl lol . goal is to meet up later after college and tour the world and just fight over a few stupid inside jokes . who knows maybe i will have my digit nova build by then and maybe will part with it as a thank you gift , always can just build another one haha . goal is to build roughly digit  digit before i drop dead haha . being digit in a toxic family sucks , but i  m glad to an extent of being able to see the things i can . and mainly meeting the people i have let it be irl or over facetime  online .

7. because most people know that they can just choose to ignore things that don ' t interest them . i suggest you work on that , for your own sanity .

8. this one ?  look , having nuclear  my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer , dr . john trump at mit  good genes , very good genes , ok , very smart , the wharton school of finance , very good , very smart  you know , if you  re a conservative republican , if i were a liberal , if , like , ok , if i ran as a liberal democrat , they would say i ' m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world  it  s true !  but when you ' re a conservative republican they try  oh , do they do a number  that  s why i always start off  went to wharton , was a good student , went there , went there , did this , built a fortune  you know i have to give my like credentials all the time , because we  re a little disadvantaged  but you look at the nuclear deal , the thing that really bothers me  it would have been so easy , and it  s not as important as these lives are nuclear is powerful  my uncle explained that to me many , many years ago , the power and that was digit years ago  he would explain the power of what ' s going to happen and he was right  who would have thought ? , but when you look at what ' s going on with the four prisoners  now it used to be three , now it  s four  but when it was three and even now , i would have said it ' s all in the messenger  fellas , and it is fellas because , you know , they don ' t , they haven  t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men , so , you know , it  s gonna take them about another digit years  but the persians are great negotiators , the iranians are great negotiators , so , and they , they just killed , they just killed us .

9. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show

10. we never see the other people of the game world  they don ' t actually exist and are just artificial memories and illusions to the characters that are actually modeled . the game has an incredibly limited amount of locations , people , and things . she would have no future there except to continue living through the same experiences over and over . even besides that , we know that natsuki ' s home is not a comfortable or safe place for her . as for the matter of jobs and such , any of the dokies even monika would have the same problems with qualifications and paperwork . monika would be the least initially shocked at the transition , but i think any of them would end up being grateful to have been given the chance to make more of their lives than was allowed them within the confines of the game .
