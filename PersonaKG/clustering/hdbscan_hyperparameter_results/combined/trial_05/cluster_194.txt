1. seeing as i am a guy whenever i see some random person say that all men should die it makes my blood boil . i  m sitting over here living my own life of trying not to insult or annoy anyone around me and then here  s this lady that thinks that all men should die ? that includes almost half of the earths population a good chunk have luckily never come in contact with this woman but no , just because she feels like she  s owed to be desired and when she isn  t that means that people like me , my younger brothers and every male should just drop dead because she was too toxic for anyone to go after her

2. " being gay just means you like guys , so if you are a girl that likes guys you ' re gay . i don ' t see why people make a big deal out of being gay "

3. i understand intersex . i get transgender . you wanna be the opposite of what you are . you identify with being the other sex . i ' m talking about people who claim they are neither . no , you were born with a vagina or a dick . you can ' t be neither just because you fucking feel like it .

4. i like seeing other people progress , and its inspiring to some people . no hate towards you op , but please realise that not everyone thinks like you and just because you dont like it , doesnt mean everyone doesnt like it . thinking like this is how you get toxic people who shame anyone different not accusing you of this tho

5. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .
