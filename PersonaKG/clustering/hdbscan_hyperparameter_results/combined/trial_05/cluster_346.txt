1. different people react in different ways , dude . not everyone goes right to fight mode , and that ' s probably a good thing for humanity . the only bad thing in the video is the people doing this to her .

2. i ' m generally against shaming suicide because they clearly feel bad enough to kill themselves already , but if you have kids and you kill yourself you ' re no better than a someone who abandons their kids for any other reason .

3. whoa i didn  t even realize this at first . that  s a good point . i remember my therapist asking me  why do you keep people like that around ? they tell you bad things others say about you and all it does is hurt you .  when talking about a friend it made me realize a lot about people and setting my own boundaries . those people aren  t in my life anymore and since then it  s actually been so much better . i feel bad kinda reading this because that  s a life lesson learned the hard way .
