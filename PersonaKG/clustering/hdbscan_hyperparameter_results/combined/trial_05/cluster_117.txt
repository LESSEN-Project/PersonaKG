SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 6

1. that ' s pretty neutral , it ' s always best to be positive and not talk about what you didn ' t like but what you did like . for instance , your old boss might have been a real hard ass , riding you all day . instead of saying that you could say your old boss was really involved in my day to day tasks and was really focused on the job getting done . i learned a lot from him . this is not a lie and it spins the situation in a positive light .

2. the hike is about digit km if you begin and end at fureai park a digit minute walk from jr kaimon station . it took us about digit hours round trip , but we were going pretty fast and didn  t linger because it was cloudy and no views . we kind of winged it from yamakawa jr station i asked people and the bus driver told us to get off at the wrong stop  we ended up having to pay a fee and talk to the attendant at a golf course kaimon nature park for digit minutes . the train to kaimon from kagoshima  chuo runs like once every two hours , but if you plan your timing better than we did , you can bypass all the bus nonsense !

4. it was kinda unbearable , but in a good way ?  i get exactly what you mean ! it  s like , what you  re doing feels good , but at the same time the area is too sensitive so it feels like too much at one time ? i was also confused by that the forst time i came , f17 too here btw !

6. fucking up happens . its okay  if you learn something from it . why not try drawing on yourself instead any time you feel like that ? keep drawing even if it takes up a whole leg or arm . i recommend crayola .
