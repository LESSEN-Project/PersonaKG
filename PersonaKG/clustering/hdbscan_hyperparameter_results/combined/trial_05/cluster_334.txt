1. last time around it took digit minutes . but this is an outlier  usually you need to book your appointment first thing in the morning to be seen at some point in the day . i think it  s worth mentioning that we have private healthcare too . so if you have the cash or good insurance you don  t ever have to wait . london , uk .

2. sf would give you some good experience especially if you don  t have any . it  s my experience that they usually recruit people with experience .

4. i suppose it ' s the same in every country , you need to be relatively educated and have an okay job . i guess the problem with britian is that whatever the reasons you don ' t have these . if you don ' t your pretty much left to rot . there is a very large underclass here who have no opportunities and for them life is a real struggle .

6. if i have to go someplace new for some sort of obligation , i don ' t mind a long  ish drive . it gives me time to get mentally ready .
