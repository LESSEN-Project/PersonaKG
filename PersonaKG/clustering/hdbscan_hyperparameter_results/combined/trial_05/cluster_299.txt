1. exactly , no way to win . only thing to do is avoid the situations with people who are like that and try to have worthwhile conversations with people who are more reasonable . the stuck up sjws aren ' t worth you time

2. i feel the exact same way about people of color that constantly shit on white people and make blanket statements about them . you don ' t like it when people do that to you , so why would you do that somebody else ?

3. no . it literally gives me zero satisfaction . i gain nothing from the interaction . seriously . i hate people who hug each other like it ' s such a waste of energy , space and time . if you ' re going to interact with me , at least make it worth my time .  s

4. i mean , he  s really good at management but he  s so busy with other people  s stuff that he doesn  t have time for our network . as for temperatures , it  s actually pretty good because most of it is audio stuff but on hot days it can be like digit degrees celsius hotter

5. i see your point in a sense . it ' s not that they ' re being confrontational , it ' s that people come up to the camera . there are plenty of   boring   videos where nothing happens . there are also videos where people learn their rights . there are auditors i disagree with and auditors who react well to the public better than others . suspicious activity is only suspicious to the person who doesn ' t understand what ' s going on . i suggest watching a bunch of different auditors and see which ones you like best , or none at all . i really like the boring ones where nothing happens because it shows that they ' re not out there to harass people .

6. our commanders does the same thing and i understand why are they so pumped when giving out orders . if you are in the middle of a fight , he  she doesn ' t really have time to type out orders specially if the group was portal bombed . so at least the people in the channel gets the right instruction so that they could react appropriately . sometimes our guild run havoc groups when we don ' t feel like joining the zerg and i sometimes speak rapidly when we are in the middle of a scuffle . it ' s not much scolding but more of excitement specially if you can feel you can wipe the enemy zerg .

7. if we are quiet in a group setting it does not mean we are having a bad time . although it ' s a nice gesture , you don ' t have to constantly check on us . it makes us feel insecure and like we ' re doing something wrong .

8. i have more than a few issues with this but among them  digit people act like college students aren ' t adults . why isn ' t this conversation geared also to digit  digit yr olds who are not in college ? digit being on a college campus does not mean you can ' t call the police . i someone feels they were raped , call the actual police , especially if you feel the campus police don ' t react adequately . i was on a college judicial board and cases were frequently dealt with in both places .
