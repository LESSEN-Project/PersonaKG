4. it ' s been implied that the infertility problems are due to pollution and bad farming practices . during the visit by the mexican delegates i remember either fred or serena talking about the improved pollution problem . also in flashbacks to the red center we see aunt lydia talking about pollution lowering the birthrate and she also pins some blame on women who can give birth but refuse by taking birth control or aborting . edit to add  i ' ve read the book too and know it was much more nuanced than that . my comment is based off what information they ' ve given us in the show so far .
