1. probably one of my favorite game . the combat and movement are fluid , and the maps are very well designed . if you want to play stealthily , the maps offer many different ways to achieve your goal . if you want to don ' t want to play stealthily , you get a large array of weapons and powers . just watch stealthgamerbr on youtube to see what i ' m talking about . great replayability , and the dlc that comes with this bundle is excellent as well  they ' re not just short missions , but lengthy sets of missions which introduce you to new characters and powers . the only drawbacks i can think of are that some people may not like the artstyle , and that people complain about some powers being op . also , if you ' re a completionist , finding all gold in every stage is a pain . for  digit , it ' s a must buy imo

2. no , in normal  raids you have a lot more personal responsibility . you can ' t just afk through the fights . it is a helluva lot more fun than lfr . you should try playing each of those specs through lfr a few times . get a feel for how you ' d perform in a large group setting . lfr might not be " real " raiding but it ' s close enough to give you an idea . tanaan , lfr and mythic dungeons can get you into normal raids easily , then from there you ' ll go to heroic and mythic raids , ofc . race only matters if you ' re going for extreme feats like world first . play what you want to stare at for hours on end .

3. if i said fuck that school for all those colleges i ' d end up not going to college or going for something i don ' t enjoy and i ' m not passionate about . although i really like fl ableton is good too and i ' m just as happy to work with that as i am with fl . honestly i think that if you become stubborn and say i ' m only gonna use daw " x " you aren ' t gonna get very far because for example if you want to do a collab and the producer you want to collab with uses a different daw that ' s a problem . also it really couldn ' t hurt just learning a bunch of them even if you aren ' t going to use them as your main one . it ' ll really just expand your knowledge and help you in the long run

4. i think people should play for the enjoyment and not just to win another uhc  like if you want to play dirty there ' s a cutclean game in digit minutes .  it should be for the audience .

5. well i believe in god but like you , i can ' t stand fundamentalists like the woman you describe . they tell me i ' m going to hell too , and i laugh . just can ' t win . on the other hand , if you are an atheist , then you don ' t believe in either heaven or hell . so her telling you you ' re going to hell is like someone telling you canada is never going to win the super bowl . i wouldn ' t let it worry you . if want to get snarky , then remind her , hell is for atheists , and for people who fail to convince atheists to believe in god . guess i ' ll be seeing you there !

6. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .

7. if you can ' t countenance a person ' s art because the person is trash , that ' s totally your own personal choice . i just don ' t think that social pressure to boycott art like that is healthy . people should be allowed to choose for themselves if they want to consume that kind of culture or not .
