Total from this dataset: 5

1. i say go for it ! change is good , and for your situation and everything you described moving is definitely going to be good for you . you don  t want to keep thinking about doing it for years and regret not going sooner .

2. i think your expectation of sales is poor . digit sale a week in your mind might not be a lot but you need to look at digit things  the market  how many people need your product , how much are people willing to pay , how many schools  sporting events are there in your town . you might get digit  if your market if your lucky . do you have competition ? are people still hiring photographers for random events ? have you thought about weddings ? the messaging  you are only giving your sales people a few months and then letting them go . this is not enough time to establish a good message . maybe you don  t want a sales person maybe your stuck in your ways and only want to do it your way . the messenger  in this day in age is a sales person really necessary for a photographer ? you should be marketing yourself . you own the business and you believe in it .

3. nothing is all rainbows and puppy dogs . and , as reasonable as not wanting to be is , you are now a parent . you don ' t have to pretend you ' re not feeling what you ' re feeling but you need to be involved and educated on what ' s about to happen to your life . that ' s probably going to involve some tough conversations , reading you don ' t want to do and changes you don ' t want to make but the only way you can make it worse for yourself is to bury your head in the sand and leave everything as a nasty surprise . you might also seriously consider dropping the condescension on the people that seem to enjoy it . a " daddict " can tell you a lot more about how to survive or even enjoy what ' s coming than your single bro or childless couple friends giving you crap about your life being over . little attitude changes and environmental changes add up over time . positivity is a habit , and takes as much work to establish and maintain as working out or any other good habit .

4. look , i want to sleep . i don ' t understand why you and the other human need to bounce on the bed or whatever it is you do to make it shake .

5. depends how urgently you need an extra merge for scoring purposes . if this gets you over some arena tier threshold or makes it a lot easier , i ' d say merge . but as you said ,  digit merge doesn ' t do much in itself so i ' d say fodder her if you really want to do that build .
