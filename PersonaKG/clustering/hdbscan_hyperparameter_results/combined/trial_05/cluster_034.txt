1. i know it  s a bad idea to spoof on a primary account , but when i have the time to snipe a pokemon i usually make sure i catch it , close the game , delete the game and wait a few hours and install the regular game . i  ve gotten small short time bans but i haven  t been shadow banned yet

2. no you wouldn  t have lost your child through something like this but it can be viewed upon in a negative way . put things i place to make sure it doesn  t happen again but don  t sweat it , we  ve all had close calls .

3. she  s taking my advice and basically just dropping subtle hints to see if she is bi or gay . asking her outright could go multiple ways and , like you , doesn  t wanna risk her friendship but is contemplating if it  s worth the risk since if she is bi or gay they might end up in a relationship . so it  s a difficult scenario . see what kinda friends she hangs out with since gays tend to congregate in my experience and find out what her previous relationships were like if she  s had any . so far it  s going pretty well and hannah is pretty sure she  s bi but still needs to find out more before she moves forward with it . oh yeah i actually had a situation similar to that with my partner , neither of us knew if the other was gay or straight or not . i  m pan so and i  ve dated girls and guys in the past , they  ve dated only one girl and regretted the relationship . after i found out they were pan too because i noticed a lot of their friends were gay , they had an even amount of girl to guy friends , they never denied being gay , etc so i asked them out and apparently they liked me for months on end . now we  re in an almost three year relationship . i hope all goes well for you smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

4. make sure you ' re there before him and don ' t let on that you ' re worried about it . if asked to move , firmly say no and gesture towards the other empty desks . let him know that your momma ain ' t raise no bitch !

5. oh boy you ' ve sure fucked up . this is my opinion but i ' d cut everyone off , it ' s too much work to rebuild everyone ' s trust , after a day or so it ' s fine to come clean and be like " hey i was joking guys " but after digit years . that ' s not possible .
