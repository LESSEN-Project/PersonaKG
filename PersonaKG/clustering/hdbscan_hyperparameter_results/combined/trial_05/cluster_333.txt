1. it ' s just crazy rng . if it was a mode where it was bo2 round wise and you got all your health back after each game then it ' d be a lot more reasonable to beat . but asking players to fight digit  digit fighters that can pop off out of nowhere since they ' re a npc and can just decide when to tech every grab and aa any jump in is just ass . it doesn ' t help that you have to watch your character do his little dance every time you ko someone . you have to do digit fights and that ' s a solid digit minutes of just sitting there waiting for loading . hell , i ' d accept the game mode as is if they just made check points for hard and extreme . have it be a random drop like the current buffs and things but make it cost double the cost of a full restore or something like that and it can only be used once . i ' m thinking of this digit ways . one is where say you get to round digit  digit and you buy the check point . if you get to round digit and lose you just go back to round digit where you bought it , like you ' re setting down a marker . or when you buy one it just lets to do the fight again if you lose but you can ' t stack retries .

3. it ' s not like you ' re even trying to communicate with the living . you ' re just trying to watch the match so you can get the digit at the end .

7. i hate such mis direction . a movie should be like fight club with subtle clues all around place . maybe its just my preference .
