1. i suppose i have some perspective in a way from your girlfriends point of view as i think my girlfriend has similer feelings as i ' m still close friends with a guy i slept with the guy and i where friends long before i should add and it was a one time thing i know it kinda makes her uncomfortable so i try to take in to consideration her feelings about hanging out with him such as i would be with him alone but shes okayish with it because she trusts me .   x200b  so i guess what im saying in your gf case she must feel pressured by her ex into keeping contact and feels terrible about it , i say just try and support her as dealing with abusive ex partners can be a rough experience

2. i get social anxiety too sometimes when i ' m in larges groups of people when i smoke . i don ' t know of a way to counter that , but alcohol makes me much more sociable , while when i get high i ' m just chill and spaced out . try smoking alone a few times to get used to the feeling of it , and try to smoke with people you know well i would suggest .

3. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .

4. honestly i think you should go get a makeover and try focusing on your own beauty . i could see how that  s irritating and tbh i don  t even know how you would begin to deal with that but maybe ask her to tone it down with talking with you or maybe find another outlet for support ? idk if i felt this way i  d get my hair done and go shopping maybe get laser hair removal just feel good for yourself .

5. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .

6. admitting there is a problem is hard . fixing it even harder . your kids are likely in school full time . perhaps there is a way that you can find an after school program instead of a daycare . or , a dayhome . an hour or two in the afternoons probably won ' t affect your children negatively as a they are more connected to you by this age and can identify right from wrong and tell you , and b an after school program is guided by professional people and c less costly than full time care . i am a mom to a half day kindergartener digit and a digit mornings a week preschooler digit . i would need to find evening or weekend work to save myself from childcare costs being enormous , so i choose to wait until they are schooled full time . do you have any flexibility with your job ? perhaps you could drop off and pick up and return to work if necessary when she returns home . i ' m getting off track . i can ' t think of anything you ' re doing that isn ' t gentle , kind or thoughtful and coming from a place of love . i know my husband works long hours for our benefit and i appreciate the hell out of him for it . you are a good person and it sounds like she does need help in the form of a doctor or counselling for ppd . just keep coming from a place of love when you tell her you miss your partner in crime and that you want her to be happy , and all that growing old together stuff . i would beg and plead with my husband to come to counselling with me if i thought he needed it , but if that ' s likely to make her angry i just don ' t know . maybe if you guys are close with her family you can discreetly discuss with a trusted family member that you are worried . maybe they are worried too .

7. honestly i think the complaints about settings are overblown . sure , add a search feature for finding things even more quickly that ' s fine , but i don ' t know what jagex are supposed to do about it when people can ' t find the settings for combat experience when you ' ve got digit categories , one labelled skills and the other combat and both point to the same interface . if it ' s really taking you that long to find where combat experience in a list that literally says combat  experience i don ' t think there ' s much jagex can do to help you . people need to understand some games have a lot of options and that it ' s worth taking a few minutes to go through and see what ' s available rather than never delving into them . maybe if people really want a hand holding interface they should offer a streamlined  simplified bare bones with a toggle option for advanced settings as to not scare off new players .

8. dont worry i gotchu fam , see im digit myself and i have a gf who likes to show off skin obviously not nude . anyways if it was a real concern id explain to her one last time that if makes you uncomfortable seeing another guy is getting pictures of her with only a towel on . if shes sending you spicer pics then id see this as less of a concern anyways if this still continues ask for her friends what they think try to get them on your side and from there just ask them to help you convince her to stop . if this still doesnt do anything ask for an ultimatum this is a last resort . ultimatums work digit  of time because it makes the other feel trapped and stuck with an a question thatll change the course of the relationship . if the ultimatum succeeds be extremely nice to the other person otherwise theyll think they made the wrong decision . if otherwise then there are plenty of fish in the sea . let me know what you end up doung because im actually interested

9. people are raised in a certain way and if everyone around you thinks that way throughout your time living there it  s really hard to be critical of that way of thinking because you  d be going against everything everyone you know believes , in short , peer pressure on a larger scale

10. hey there , i know you have gotten some good advice and i know you have gotten some sketchy advice . im about to give you middle of the road advice . lol . i dont think you need to have some long drawn out serious " come to jesus " talk with your boyfriend . a simple statement like you made should suffice . if you say no more sex without a condom that should be fine . you dont even have to be mean or demanding about it , just make the statement , as i think you already have and then just make sure that the penis never touches the vagina without a condom . you can put it on for him , you can have one ready or close by , or just ask him to put one on . i think if you make too big of a deal about it that it will kinda of put the blame on him and it is digit  his fault but its digit  your fault too . not that i am trying to make you feel bad , that kind of stuff happens sometimes . if for whatever reason he doesn ' t want to play along then a more serious talk is required , but i don ' t think the first conversation about it needs to be too over the top . i know as a male that if i were told no more sex without a condom , i could take that at face value and move on without a big long discussion about it . i ' m hoping your bf is the same way .

11. why would you assume the fbi isn ' t corrupt ? they are a violent criminal organization . i don ' t know why so many people view them as a good thing . last time i checked the good guys don ' t radicalized and arm domestic terrorists .

12. my father taught me to always hold a door open . for people . it is in the guise of manners . we as well mannered people you and i both will do things for other people that are nice . i hold the door open for people , pull out a chair , help you put on your coat , carry your bags and it is all because of good manners . if i were to do the opposite  walk through the door without holding it , leave you to carry all your own bags etc . would you feel that i am being rude ? i don ' t know because i don ' t know you . maybe you would feel angry that i am just looking after myself . maybe you would feel happy that i wasn ' t assuming that you needed my help . but i know that i would feel rude . the way i was brought up was to help people and to have good manners . that is probably why benevolent sexism happens , people really feel as though they are doing the right thing . as for the calling people honey or sweetie , i am with you on that . i get called that by old ladies " oh aren ' t you a sweetie " that guest at my hotel . but if someone were to say in a certain context i can understand your frustrations . like a lot of things i think there is a line that you cross when you act too familiar . but don ' t be embarrassed for you , be embarrassed for them for not knowing correct social etiquette .

14. don ' t be too hard on yourself my friend . you are aware of the fact that she might be too young for you . i don ' t know what the age of consent or how the legislation is in your country but well . you don ' t have to feel disgusted man , things like that happen . it is up to you how you act on these feelings , i would understand that the gap between digit and digit is quite large though , so your feelings might be somewhat justified . don ' t reject yourself by saying you shouldn ' t be attracted to her , just accept that it happened and move on . you ' re not a pedophile or a pervert mate , from the reads of it you ' re a pretty consious person . just accept the feeling and let it go . if there is anything that i could help you with feel free to respond or dm . don ' t judge yourself too hard , shit happens .
