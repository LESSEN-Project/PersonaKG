1. here are your two outcomes , i too work for a large hotel , and i see this quite often . digit .  you go to hr and explain how this was not divulged to you , and you do not agree with the discipline given given it is some sort of progressive discipline , and you aren  t given a verbal warning vs a written one but , you paint a big target on your back by doing this , and moving forward they will look at you day and night until they find something you do wrong . digit .  you take it , explain to your new director that you were not aware , and you never received the information . but you are aware now , and you can assure that you are there to be part of the team and  help  him through the transition , making you an ally . it  s the high road , and depending on your short and long term goals , this might be your best option . remember the hotel industry is not that big , and someone always knows someone .
