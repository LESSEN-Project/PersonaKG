2. i hear you there . it occurs to me that because of how personal transition is even if i have someone to talk about it with it will always be something i do alone . i don ' t have trans friends to commiserate with about the tough stuff , or to share excitement with when cool things happen . the friends i do have can listen and empathize somewhat , but it ' s not quite the same .

3. it sound that those people in your life are holding you back and that isn  t good for mental health . i  m not saying you should get rid of them but certainly make them aware that your life is more than chores or work and everyone needs a hobby and shouldn  t have to hide it .

5. when you are a drug user you end up meeting a lot of people in the drug scene  the problem is you only stay friends with them while both of you are using and you soon realise that the only thing you had in common was that you were hooked on the same substance . now i ' m clean i have far less friends but the friends i do have are better quality .
