1. well look it at another perspective . you have learned from this experience . it sucks of course . but it will make you better in the en  don ' t let this be something that controls your next couple of days . let it go as hard as it seems and do some stuff with your friends . or talk to other people . in the end you will come out stronger . here is a quote i picked up "  if we see any mermaids i  m gonna ask them where their merginas are " i know this isn ' t helpfull at all but it makes me laugh everytime . have a good one !

2. yeah . help is one thing we lack here . most people can ' t understand the whole thing . and the ones who do , doesn ' t know how to help . and the organisations there to help aren ' t very effective either . it ' s nightmare to have depression here . speaking of which , can you describe what made you get out of it ? i ' m kinnda looking for answers myself .

3. i don ' t know if this applies to you but i ' m gonna throw it out there anyway . i work night shifts and day offs are on monday and tuesday . i don ' t get to hang out with people because of my work schedule . what i do cope up with the loneliness is i play mmos like guild wars digit . i get to be with people , albeit virtually , but at least i still get to talk with people which somehow lessens the feeling .

4. you have the right to be upset or angry , or any other emotion you are having right now . your wife needs to know exactly how you feel and take ownership for causing it your wife should be willing to do anything for you that would help you build that trust back up . no more expectations of privacy , no more hidden anything in her life . she needs to be an open book . look at her bank account , check her on  line presence , monitor her calls , get all of her passwords , and  or whatever you feel is needed . then you need to work on regaining that trust . if this is going to be a life sentence for her , then end the marriage now . you need to work toward her having privacy again some day . just not right now . there is no such thing as too much communication in smarriage .

5. expectant father is good for some reading . it ' s not unusual to feel pretty disconnected from the whole thing until partway through the second trimester really showing and regular detectable kicks are big . everyone around you especially her makes this big deal out of something you can ' t really connect to anything you can see , hear or feel . it adds a lot of pressure to connect to something that doesn ' t seem to exist . grab yourself a couple of good father to be books to help put things in perspective and find something to do that you can actually lay hands on , going to the appointments , planning out the nursery , planning out babyproofing , checking out dad gear you ' ll need like a diaper bag that ' s not a flowery tote . there ' s a lot of ways to make this a little more real and engaging for yourself to get connected to the pregnancy and the baby . also be aware of other factors , trouble at home , fear of the upcoming changes and all sorts of things can cause reluctance or a flight response even if it ' s only subconscious . try to identify if you ' re just not connected yet or if there ' s something else working against you . that introspection will arm you to talk to your wife , friends and family about what ' s wrong . talk to your dad and other dads you may know as well for some insight .
