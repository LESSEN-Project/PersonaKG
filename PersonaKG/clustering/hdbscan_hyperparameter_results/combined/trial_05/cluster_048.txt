2. i mean , its your call . if you wish for me to stop posting these i respect that . but may i ask what qualifies as high content then ? this is an entire essay written about the characters on the show . yes , it has speculation about why characters acted the way they did . but all the events listed happened in the show and ultimately were just a different way to view the shows events . there is a lot that could be said about these posts , but them having low  content doesn ' t really make much sense considering how much longer , more detailed , and how much more i discuss the lore then many posts on this sub .
