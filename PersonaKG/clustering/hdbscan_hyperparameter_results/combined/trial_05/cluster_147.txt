3. i get you , but how about we take it from a metaphorical angle , rather that lateral ? for example , you would metaphorically go hell due to angry masturbating over indecent images of cement . why ? hell i don ' t know what but that sure is a strange fetish to have there is no way you ' re getting into metaphorical heaven acting like that . right ?

5. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .

7. it ' s impossible to tell someone ' s religion by looking at them . at this time in my life , i ' m not sure i know any jewish people , because no one mentions what their belief system is to me . i can ' t remember when i last saw anyone wearing a yarmulke .

8. honestly , i don ' t know . i ' m agnostic myself so i believe that there ' s just no way we can be sure of anything one way or the other . i wish i could suspend my sense of reality enough to fully believe in a heaven . i would seriously love to just know for sure i was going to see my grandma again one day .
