1. sure , people eat that stuff all the time . and some of them get sick . you don ' t need to check the temperature of your food , buts leaving it out at room temperature isn ' t exactly a " proptip . you ' d be better off putting it in a low heat oven , or the fridge and then just nuking it gor a minute or digit .

4. man , i feel you , i prefer watching the anime too . i ' ve found out the hard way . if you search anything up about naruto , you are guaranteed to get spoilers . generally avoid discussion videos bc they dip into manga territory . this subreddit ' s rules are pretty good with spoilers , just avoid anything tagged with spoilers .

5. i have one friend who knows but anytime i tell them they just go  oof  and if he comes round he buys loads of food and eats it and it ' s really triggering . also my other friend who i hang out with is going to latvia so i ' m kind of screwed . i think my plan of action is to get out of the house as much as possible so i can try and ignore my urges .
