1. when having sex with my last girlfriend startet , i also had this problem digit or digit times . my problem is that sometimes my boner would disappear a soon as my girlfriend took her hand of my dick . i found out that this is linked with stress , at the beginning it was harder because it was embarrassed by it and my girlfriend startet to think it was about her body and she is unattractive to me . with even more pressure now it hasn ' t worked out again . because my ex girlfriend got really emotional at this point , i needed to tell her the truth . this was definitely the decision that ended this problem . because i already knew that it wasn ' t a problem with my body . i already feelt comfortable getting sexual with her . but as soon the point of putting on the condome comes , the slight fear overcame me , that these erection problem will lead her to believe she isn ' t sexy to me , which she struggled enough with at the beginning , because of her beeing digit years older . next time we startes having sex , my erection was there until the short moment of putting on that comdom . again i was worried about all the things that were talked about it and i stell feelt a little bit of embarrassment . and she did exactly the right thing , she calmed me down and just continued the same was we did before the condom . and it took some time again and we gave each other time and arousel by foreplay until the problem didn ' t accrue anymore . after that day it never happened again . i do see suspect some parallels with your post . and i can only suggest to you , if you want to have a chance of having sex with him , forget your plans . sit down with him and i tell him that it is ok for you it doesn ' t work out with penetrativ sex . by taking away stress factors for him , you make it way easier for him to hold his erection . also non penetrativ sex can be even more fun and it can help him to feel not so stressed before sex , when you can give him the feeling , of you beeing happy and satisfied . it would be pressure for every guy , if his girl is rarely in the country and on that rare occasion erection problems arise . knowing that you definitely want to have penetrativ sex is extra stressful . i think he knows you wish for that . and surely would like to fulfill it to you , but try to help him get more comfortable first . when you both try it viagra his stress won ' t be dissappearing . he will get depended on these for sex if you don ' t get rid of psychological boundaries first . when they are gone , you will be finding way more sex in the future .

2. i don ' t know what to say to you . but here she goes !  when you were a teen you wrote with complete freedom . it didn ' t matter what you said if it was on paper . i admired this a lot . i no longer admire you ? i ' m not really sure what this is supposed to mean . i assume your email was freely written .  now ? not so much . since you have decided to stand up for your decisions  we weren ' t disappointed that there was no wedding party . we were hurt that you chose not to tell us of your plans . you know that . my wife ' s name told her family for exactly that reason . she didn ' t want to hurt them . ha , not likely . either way they were going to be offended , told or not .  i can ' t speak for brother or sister . i can ' t but i will .  i know at one time brother looked up to you and that you said or did something to change his mind . sister has very strong feelings about family . you have said that you feel bad vibes at family events . did you think that there was any family that didn ' t have them ?  the rest of us are trying to get along . what i hear is that people have to try to get along ? why do we have to force friendships with family ?  trying to help each other without being invasive and not giving too much half assed advice . invasive and half assed only the way family can be !  i would like to be part of your life . most of all i want you to have a happy contented one . probably quite true , just doesn ' t realize the magnitude of what that might mean . if you can ' t muster the words to reply , don ' t  there isn ' t really much substance to the letter to reply to other than accusations that your siblings some how think less of you for some imaginary slight . i agree that is guilt laden . try not to let the crazy take you down

3. oh jeez . honestly . my recent ex has said so many horrible things to me not one sticks out on my mind anymore . just the most recent horrible things . the last thing he said before i blocked him on everything was that my therapist was being paid to be nice to me . one thing that stands out the most . he called my rape " what you did " . he calls it " what you did to me " . he said that because of it i was vile and disgusting and he says that i need to take responsibility for it . he also posted it all online only he changed it to make it seem like i was cheating on him . and he said that digit  of the memories he has of me in the last five years are filled with misery . when i tell him what he ' s saying is absolutely horrible he responds by telling me that i ' m being disrespectful . and that i dont know how wrong i am . he said i shouldn ' t be allowed to be in a relationships with anyone . i don ' t deserve it . that he feels sorry for me because i dont have any sensibility . he even went as far as to play the popular card . everyone likes him better . blah blah . its all really horrible stuff . hes lucky that i dont believe him because that stuff can really break a person . i mean really break someone . theres so many other things . digit years worth of horrible things . i didn ' t realize how bad they were back then though . i think back then i believed them . now i dont because i know hell say just about anything to make me feel worthless .

4. it happened about a year and a half ago . i am unsure if i could still do so . looking back on it now i wish i had right away . then again i didn ' t quite know what was happening . you hear about it and know the stories . outside it seems so simple but inside it is just a cluster of confusion . i definitely did not feel black and white about it . i was in shock about it and actually just didnt let my mind process it . not to mention the extreme victim shaming and drama that was ensued by my ex over it . the prioritizing of his own feelings . he callrd it " what you did " and how could i have done this " to him " . it distracted me from really ever doing anything about it . and yeah , it was a big thing in my life . still is . i ' m still dealing with it . i found out recently that this guy has another case against him apparently . if i speak out it would help the case . but i am trying to heal . and i ' m currently unsure if i pursue going to the authorities what will happen . will it reopen everything . make it worse . will everyone turn against me again . will i lose the little friends i have left . will i feel worse ? will i find closure ? i will have to tell my parents . now that will just open up more wounds and i am already swimming in lacerations . i am just unsure if i have the strength to survive all of those factors . and until i find that strength i have kept quiet . but then on the other hand i am beginning to feel that if speak up i will find more strength and maybe more closure than i thought i needed . i don ' t even want to face or him or ever see him again . because this guy made me believe that he really cared about me . the lies he told me . if i ever see him again i don ' t know how i would react and i fear that as well . part of me still cares for the part of him that he pretended to be . so it still scares me that i might feel those feelings if i ser him again . for me its hard to let go of that person because i really needed the person he was with that mask on . and i fell for it . ah i dont know . but i do know that hes young . and capable of getting better at being that way . so something needs to be done so he doesn ' t do what he did to me to anyone else , or worse .

5. thank you . i don ' t blame myself in a way that isn ' t realistic . i blame myself for not being aware of the warning signs of what happened to me . that ' s about the extent . i don ' t harbor any unhealthy emotions and though i suffer mildly from ptsd i am conscious enough to work on my issues . with that being said . yes , i am still with my boyfriend . the truth of the matter is that he simply isn ' t emotionally mature enough to understand the depths of what had happened . i did threaten to break up with him . the first couple of times he said it to me i didn ' t stand up for myself . i don ' t know why . but the last time he said it i really stuck it to him . i realized that if he thinks this way i can ' t possibly marry someone who will think like that and i told him that . i also told him i will happily leave because i know i wouldn ' t be suffering a loss if that ' s the way he is thinking . for the first time in all the time i have known him he stopped and gave me a very heart felt apology taking accountability for his lack of sympathy and understanding . quite frankly , a lot of other things were said . but it was true and i know he meant it . this is still a red flag for me . if i am suffering from something in the future , am i going to have to be the one to walk him through it too ? just because i am more emotionally equipped to handle ? he ' s not a horrible person . but he is selfish in his thinking . and he is emotionally sheltered . after digit years i am starting to wonder if i want to be the one who does all of the picking up .
