1. at first i was like , what ? this doesn  t make any sense . then the part about you potentially leaving the country came up and i understand better . i think i  m almost any other instance , it would be weird to ask to be exclusive without some amount of commitment . the two ideas go hand  in  hand . in your case , i think it would be ok to say ,  hey ! while we are seeing each other , let  s not see other people . but in case i end up leaving , i don  t want to get too serious .  just make sure to be clear about what you want and expect out of your relationship .

2. there is a breech of trust when incest happens . family members are some of the only people in life who you should feel completely sure don ' t want to be around you just so they can fuck you . if you take that away , ultimately you will miss the feeling of being around people you know don ' t find you sexually compatible , but still like you anyway .

3. thanks man , really means a lot . i just want to make sure that you don ' t think there ' s something wrong with me . is it really normal that i don ' t feel any sexual urges even digit weeks after that experience ?

4. it ' s hard to give advice because everyone handles this sort of thing differently . we went through three miscarriages , but they were all before our first child , so for us , there wasn ' t any question of trying again . for some people , it helps to start trying again right away . some want to wait for awhile before trying again . it ' s probably best to give it some time , for your wife to get back to normal physically , and for you both to heal emotionally . make sure she knows you ' re there to support her , but don ' t smother here either , give her space if she needs it . and always keep in mind , that unless she has an underlying health problem which it doesn ' t sound like is the case since you already have two kids , miscarriages are random occurrences , and aren ' t likely to happen with the next pregnancy .

5. it worked for me after smoking for around digit years . i haven ' t had one since fall , and i don ' t want one either . some advice . be prepared for some very vivid dreams , but they seem to subside after a while . make sure you drink plenty of water with the pill and eat something with it if you can . it can give you horrible stomach cramps if you don ' t . keep taking it even after you quit , for at least a couple of months , although you can typically taper off to one pill a day after the initial digit months . if you still feel a slight craving after the initial digit months , ask your doctor for another prescription . it gets so much easier after a couple of months . i just had a digit hour drive with an open pack of cigs sitting next to me , and i didn ' t even think about lighting up . good luck ! it ' s sooooo much better after you quit .
