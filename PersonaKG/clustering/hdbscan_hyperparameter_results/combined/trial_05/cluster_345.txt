2. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .

3. that ' s where i need to be . in a space in my head where i can ignore it or walk away from it . i ' m hung up on being angry that he gets to treat people however he wants without consequence . i honestly don ' t know how you didn ' t react with your father behaving like that ! i ' d have been terrified ! it ' s nice of you to still help him with his medical treatment even though he certainly doesn ' t sound grateful . i can see that having boundaries is important . i guess i need to know what mine are and stick to them at all times . i don ' t know if having cptsd is what makes my emotions take over when he does these things . something to talk to my psych about i suppose ! thank you so much reginaagnon , your kind words help more than you know ! red  heart
