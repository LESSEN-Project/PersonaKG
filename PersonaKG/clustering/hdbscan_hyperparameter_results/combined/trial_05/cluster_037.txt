1. the human mind is extremely suggestable and memories are pretty easy to make up . go ask one of your friends about that time you went to the gas station to grab a drink and they where out and the cashier was a dick about it . then ask them what color the cashier was . odds are they will give you details about something that did not happen . now picture you are a tiny person with a steady stream of incoming information you can ' t fully process come and your understanding of the difference between real and imaginary is still pretty fuzzy . kids can make up some wild stuff that they believe this way .

2. it ' s gonna weight on you for a longtime . the best thing to do might be just to think about it long and hard until you can accept several things  you and that person aren ' t and won ' t be in a relationship again , probably that you still like them as in don ' t dent it , and that it was your fault . you also need to make sure that you ' ve changed . if it was your personality , then you need to make sure you are less like what you were i . e . less judgemental . if it was something you did , you need to promise yourself you won ' t do it again and remember the consequences and pain it brought from doing it the first time .

3. i ' m not sure how it is where you live but digit  digit people i meet on a daily basis are always rude assholes . like it could be small shit like not holding a door , not saying thanks after i bless a sneeze , shoving me out of the way on the bus just to get a better seat , purposely causing trouble with a waitress to get the manager involved  laughing at it . seeing this type of shit everyday really stacks up on my mind . i start wondering if it ' s worth being nice to people when most of others i see , really don ' t fucking care  perhaps my life would be way easier if i acted the way they did . but i do my best not to because it ' s the right thing to do . sometimes i meet that digit  digit who does things the way i would go about it , like helping a stranger lift their luggage on a train , running to catch a door for an elderly , helping a friend by giving them a ride someplace just to help out , etc . and those people remind me why being kind isn ' t a waste . since they can do it everyday , so can i . but you ' re welcome to think i ' m a narcissistic asshole for misinterpreting my comment . i ' m still going to try to help people anyway i can .

4. when i did a few stupid things as a teenager my dad said , " people only feel sorry for you if you learn from your mistakes . screw up once , god bless you . make the same mistake again , god help you . make it a third time ? goddamn you " i have always remembered that and tried to make sure i don ' t continuously make the same mistakes in life .

5. blt  digit  cage cage stood eying morti . she was , as always , an ever growing enigma . he had run ins with morti before , and none of them ever made any sense to the brute . everywhere morti was , there was an air of danger and secrets that went well beyond the pale of cage ' s understanding . kuko seemed to know a bit about what was going on with morti , but then again , kuko wasn ' t a normal peach either . crazy women always surrounded cage , these two were some of the craziest .  " the top ? " cage pondered to himself . did she meant she fell from the sky , as they did ? or did she mean she fell from the top of the tree . if from the top , wth was she doing there to begin with . the brute would sigh . if he tried to get all the answers he needed to comprehend what was going on , he ' d die of old age . cage simply stood by and watched as morti was freed from the tree , and little creatures spawned from roots and vines , running deeper into the tree itself . the little guys were cute , sure , but that didn ' t mean they could be trusted . cage recalled on the moon where he was attacked by tiny rose people . fuck that junk , can ' t trust nothin you don ' t know . regardless , dani was the first to speak voting they take the center path directly into the tree . cage didn ' t really care , but he wanted to make sure they stuck together .  " could give a rat ' s ass in a rusty boot which way we go , ya dig ? alls i care about is that we move as a unit . i ain ' t acceptin no stragglers , and that includes you sista . you was here for some reason , so you ' s gone come with us through this tree . " cage referred to morti . he was still unsure what she was doing in this forest . if there was one thing he knew from experience with morti , she always had more information that the let on .

7. im not sure what to think of this to this day .   x200b  so my family and i were visiting the main island of hawaii , we were visiting the black sand beach at the time and some older asian people wanted to take pictures with me , keep in mind these were complete strangers . now , i was about digit at the time so i agreed . they took pictures with me and then asked where i was from and all kinds of personal stuff . i answered all the questions honestly being a naive little kid . then once they had just stopped asking me a question , they pushed me away . did they see my parents and let me go ? am i overthinking this ? what scares me is that they probably still have the pictures of me .
