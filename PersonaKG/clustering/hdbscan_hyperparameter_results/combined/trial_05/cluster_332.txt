1. is there one of these for the extra deck ? sometimes i feel like digit cards is just one to few , and theres so much nuance in deciding how many copies to run in the extra .

2. i dont have the subox but i do have some kanger tanks and i really like these  digit delrin tips from . i have bought several and they are all great . the tapered long black one might be just the ticket for you .

3. they give me a reality better than my own . i get to feel like i matter . or like i ' m a badass . or hell , just plain feeling relaxed . it ' s just something for you to look at like hey , life can suck , but at least i ' m a hero to hyrule .

4. it  s not really about hiding runes tbh you can just get to see those using the sw exporter anyways . i like having my island empty and it makes the game lag less ! mostly do it for the organization purpose tbh

5. seems like just a worse flame imp . something like a digit mana digit  digit would work better . i like the concept of discarding them getting the cards back and silence wouldn ' t feel as aweful if u had a digit  digit
