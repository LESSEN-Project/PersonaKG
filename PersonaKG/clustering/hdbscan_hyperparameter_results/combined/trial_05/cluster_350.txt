4. lol you masturbate digit  digit times a day and came to reddit ask for some sort of solution to your attraction towards women ? nah bro you need help  even though you don  t wanna hear it . there  s no magic solution  you  re gonna have to put in the work to learn why you feel this way with a therapist and that  s the only way to solve your problems .

5. on your third date , hump him awkwardly at a phish show . it ' s the only way .   x200b  raves are a special thing . i wouldn ' t bring someone around who made me feel awkward a third time . and there ' s nothing wrong with keeping looking for someone who has long term potential or at the very least is more compatible now !

6. agree  don  t change yourself , but do open yourself up to make small talk with people throughout the day . grocery store , gym , anywhere you  re around people . good luck op ! don  t rush it !

7. you can ' t change it . people are always going to make jokes that you disagree with because offense and humour are both subjective . the best you can do is ignore it , because pointing it out will make people laugh at you instead of changing their ways .

8. you should stop trying very hard to get her to orgasm . many women , even those who do orgasm from penetrative intercourse , will get flustered and self  conscious and turned off if it ' s apparent to them that a guy is that focused on her orgasm . if she can ' t make herself come by masturbating , it ' s unlikely that anything you ' re doing is going to change that . focus on pleasing her and making her feel good , by her standard of what is pleasing and feels good , not yours . most women need to feel relaxed to climax , and feeling pressured to climax by your partner is the opposite of relaxing . here ' s a question  whose problem is this ? is your wife bothered by her lack of orgasm , or are you the person who is most upset about it ? if the former , there are workshops that she could attend that might help . if the latter , why would you create a problem in your marriage where none exists ?

9. asking about my back pain . used to suck own dick . really bad for the back don ' t do it

10. this post is actually a pretty good start . whether you realize it or not , you ' re reaching out . now you need to go to a doctor , or a therapist , or whoever you feel comfortable with , and tell them all of the things that you have told us here . i ' m no doctor , so i can ' t say one way or the other whether or not you actually need medicine . but that ' s all the more reason to go talk to a real one . if you really do have depression , you might need meds . you wouldn ' t leave any other disease untreated , right ? as for the girl in the pic , i ' m guessing you look nothing like her . the hard reality is that you probably never will . everyone is different . you need to stop comparing yourself to other people , because you ' re only hurting yourself more . chances are , that girl has insecurities of her own . everyone does . but you can ' t let it control your life .

11. hehehe , whatever you do , don ' t be yourself
   (ID: 795c678726f71492166b6677c955ce0a48a9b294)

12. no . nothing can get you what you feel you don ' t deserve .

13. my wife and i were both virgins when we married at digit . we are now digit . we both waited for religious reasons and couldn ' t be happier . it is nice knowing we aren ' t being compared to someone else and we don ' t feel we missed out sowing oats earlier . we have digit kids so our sex life certainly has challenges , but it is very good e . g . experimentation , some kink , lots outdoors , lunch breaks in the minivan , etc . we are certainly not prudes or how many people would classify those who wait .

14. nobody should ever feel this way . it hurts me that your  friends  would tell you things like that . i would take some time to find a new friend group . if there is a counselor or someone on campus , i would utilize that resource too . you don  t need to feel alone . you have a bright future . i  m sorry this is happening to you .

15. when i for some reason or another , i or someone else makes stupid mistake or such say " humans are stupid " most people take it as offense  they don ' t realize i am human too and i have to explain it , always , to them .
