2. it was my first rda too but i now have several more . it is really the best though , i only use the other ones when i want to do flavor comparisons without having to re  wick . i never thought i would be a cloud chaser but it sure is fun to get some dense fog going with the mxv4 , and the flavor is really great as well .

4. mortality . i thought of mortality as a distant subject which happened to only others when i was younger . i was a naive kid for sure . lately i ' ve been surrounded by loss and it ' s readjusted my attitude to some things .
