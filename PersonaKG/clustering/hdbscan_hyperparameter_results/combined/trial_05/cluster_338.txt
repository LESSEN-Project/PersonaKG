1. you can comment on height probably because people . ant do anything about it so theoretically you shouldn ' t feel bad about it . over weight people can do something about it so in theory it makes them feel worse . just a guess through .

2. you don ' t have to feel guilty about it during the day either . if you don ' t enjoy being around people you ' re probably just an introvert , and that isn ' t something to feel guilty about . it ' s just an aspect of your personality , the same way loving being with people is part of an extrovert ' s personality .

3. i gotchu bro . you may be asking yourself , oh no what do i talk about ? when approaching a girl . no worries ! as another user mentioned , get on board day is a great opportunity to meet a girl that has a similar interest as you . you dont have to tell a joke or have some jaw dropping awesome first line , you can literally just ask  how long have you been into topic ?   what is your favorite thing about topic  keep in mind that not everyone will click and if it doesnt , dont tell yourself that youre bad with girls . i promise you that there are guys you could try to be friends with and it wouldnt go so well either . why ? because not everyone is going to click , i promise you that i wouldnt click or be friends with almost digit  of the guys in my classes if we tried to be friends . it  s just because people are different . so don  t get down , go out there , be confident , be yourself , and if you fail , get back up , dust yourself off , and try again ! you got this ! p . s . none of the bad interactions will matter in digit years when you  re as happy as can be with your s  o good luck bro

4. you just compare yourself to the people who are richer than you so you still don  t really feel rich or satisfied

5. there are some secrets that have to be kept for people  s well  being . the idea you  re proposing would make it so lgbt  members are outed to their families . that  s just a breach of privacy . you could also say that masturbating is a secret , since you don  t really tell anyone about that . how would that benefit anyone , really ?

6. it wouldn  t be a bad idea to have an older student tutor you . does your school have a peer tutoring program ? lots of people struggle with math and geometry takes a lot of understanding about different shapes as well as a lot of equations . it could be as simple as you simply don  t understand how it  s being explained to you and you need a new perspective . if you  re not willing to get a tutor you  re going to have to put in double time on studying . write and rewrite problems and how to solve them until you understand how you get the answer correct . you can do it ! it just might not be easy

7. no . you ' re not the only one . my manager does this . every time i ' m standing at the computer putting someone ' s order in , he will stand directly over me and just watch . i kind of want to turn around and just say " uh . do you mind ? " . its quite infuriating for me . it makes me forget what i ' m trying to put in . it makes me feel rushed , even though if he wasn ' t stabding there i would probably zip through it faster . i don ' t feel judged because i could literally care less if he is because i ' m not doing anything wrong . hes just a micromanager and has to control everything to a t . kind of actually makes me feel bad for him because i watch him get overly frustrated because he has issues letting go . ha end rant .

8. what for if you don ' t mind ?

9. well , if we accept ourselves  just as we are  then nobody should ever work out because you  re changing your body , put on make up because you  re changing your physical appearance , wear clothes because you  re covering your natural body , or change yourself in any way because if you do , you  re not accepting yourself just as you are . everyone  s perspective of self acceptance is different . some people don  t believe in getting butt lifts or boob implants , some do . regardless , people still get them . people getting packers is trans guys accepting themselves as who they are a man . hypothetically , and assuming your a male , if you were in an accident and lost your dick it  s happened to many guys , you wouldn  t do anything to help yourself feel better about the loss ? i mean , since you should just accept how you are now . i do recognize that i sound very condescending in this comment and i  m not going to deny it , i  m just trying to counter argue and use your logic against you .

10. life is also a game of chance . everyone can do okay but not everyone is going to enjoy life and as far as i can see it most people simply deal with what they have , it often doesn ' t get better because there isn ' t equal opportunity , people just learn to deal with their lot in life , taking things slower than those with money etc . also your parents choices are not your choices so that is bad comment yea life requires struggle but how exactly is dumping struggling people onto the street so they can ' t even look presentable enough to go for jobs in the first place going to help ? you need money to make money , even if it ' s just getting a cashier job or something , you need to be in a place where employers would actually want you .

11. it ' s hot , for both of us . seriously , if you ' re adult enough to have sex , you should be adult enough to just enjoy yourself , even if you ' re not alone . and if you can ' t be that relaxed and open in front of your so about something so important as sex , i feel bad for you .
