1. they have better moral fiber than you do which is why people abroad don ' t care for your accent and look down on you and not them . only you look down on them .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

2. i mean hey , different people , different opinions . i ' m not taking that away from you . i don ' t wanna force my opinions and ideas down on people that do not show signs of wanting to .
   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)

3. so basically you can not take an interest in another persons culture because , someone might get offended , so should different people from different cultures be separated so that they don  t share and grow from their cultural history  s ?

6. amping up teh st00pid , eh ? fine . wtf are you talking about with " opposites " some sort of straw man , i must surmise .  looks who ' s racist now . oh please . " no , you ' re the real racist " glenn beck ? is that you ?  so , where ' s the asian history month ? where ' s the gay history month ? where ' s the deaf history month ? women ' s history month , hispanic heritage month , american indian heritage month , and asian pacific american heritage  these are all stupid ideas . there ' s only one history . there is only one history in fact but the whole point of of such things is not the actual history but the presentation of history . the only history that people ever heard about was nearly devoid of blacks save for demeaning stereotypes . bhm was intended to bring an awareness of the missing history . actually , gay pride exists for precisely the same reason . prior to very recently , the only public images and perceptions of gays were nothing but gross caricatures .  i ' m aware that the blacks have had a hard time of it . i don ' t think that ' s relevant to this discussion . what ' s relevant is your apparent ignorance of the meta  history . the very fact that you are decrying bhm clearly shows your ignorance of that very thing .  where does it end ? when people no longer feel the need to complain about black history month , gay pride , et cetera , there will be no need for black history month and gay pride celebrations , et cetera .

7. it is not the same because as white people we have not been the victim of systematic oppression and fetishism and our worldview does not allow us to understand the experiences of people of colour because we are in a privileged position where we have not dealt with the obstacles faced by poc , so who are we to invalidate what this girl has to say ?

8. nah . i don  t think it  s really that big of a deal for her to go back and grab a couple of things while you are ringing up groceries as long as you  re not already done scanning and other people including you aren  t having to wait several minutes on her . on the other hand , i don  t think you were necessarily in the wrong . i mean , i understand your reasoning . if it is something that bothers you , you have the right to voice that . it  s probably something to bring up in the car on the way home or at home and not at the store , however .

9. i believe that for british people complaining and grumbling about life is an important part of social bonding . it ' s a common thing that when two british people meet they will grumble about something before having any kind of in  depth social interaction . almost anything will do , the bad weather , their house , the high fuel tax , the weather etc . all british people will understand this and understand that it isn ' t really a proper complaint about society . it ' s a shared comradeship in a bitter life that favours nobody in the end . it ' s a social lubrication . a shared misery that finds common ground and a place from which to build a friendship . australians just don ' t seem to get this . brit  ' fuck me , it ' s hot here today ' australian  ' what are you complaining about ? it ' s fucking beautiful . what ' s the weather like in the uk right now ? ' brit  ' uh , yeah . i guess you are right ' australian  ' whinging pom , eh ? ' brit  ' yeah , the weather is great here . you are right ' british people use shared misery and grumbling , whether real or perceived , in order to form social bonds . this doesn ' t really exist in the same way in australia . british people are rather socially retarded on the whole so shutting off their one shared mechanism for social interaction is a great hindrance .

10. morality ? politics ? if a woman decides she wants an abortion then she should get an abortion . it ' s none of our business . who cares about the colors of fetuses ? let ' s say you ' re a busdriver and there are digit black people and digit white people on the bus . why would you feel the need to kick digit black people off or lure digit more white people in ? who cares except for maybe people with ocd ? things are what they are .

11. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .

12. really ? you feel the need for personal attacks because i disagree with you ? well , how about you try understanding the sentence before you attack someone . let me help you " it ' s exactly why i oppose tax hikes right now "
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

13. i don ' t do stand up lol , but i ' d bring friends that way you have real incentive not to fuck up to avoid embarrassment . but at the same time that could make you more nervous so it ' s up to you and how confident you think you can be up there
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

14. says who ? who gives a shit about ' forms of charity ' when the end product is the same ? you should remember who these are really for . people in need . not our own morality .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

15. i don ' t . what i do find annoying is people who use irony ineffectively .
   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

16. pride is a place for people to be celebrated and excepted , not excluded . if people were excluded from pride , pride would become the very thing it battled to destroy .
