1. in disneyland a random person asked me , what time is the digit  digit parade . i am a teenager . i clearly don ' t work at disneyland . and common sense is if you ask someone what time an event is and you say the name as the time , they are stupid

3. i watch the zombies with binoculars from my crow ' s nest at the top of my compound on the outskirts of my town . occasionally i ' ll see a car drive by , with a zombie or two lagging behind , moving as fast as they can to chase it . i have headshot several with my . digit rifle . the first time i did it i expected them to swarm toward the sound . but no , even the closest zombies seemed to look , acknowledge my presence , then shamble away . a part of me wondered if it was me , my gun or my compound scaring them off . i wouldn ' t really mind if they came . i have a huge fence , three towers connected by my underground home and a recently installed minefield clearly marked but luckily zombies can ' t read signs . i have a water purifier , solar panels and waste disposal , as well as medical supplies . i have enough food and ammo to last digit years . it is lonely . but even when people shake on my gate to let them in i don ' t open it . the virus is undetectable and passes through saliva . i have been quarantined here since the first recorded case in brazil . i have prepared myself totally for this but now the zombies seem to be ignoring me . that ' s fine though , it ' s a good problem to have . judging by what i hear from people over cb radio , humans are the ones i need to worry about .
