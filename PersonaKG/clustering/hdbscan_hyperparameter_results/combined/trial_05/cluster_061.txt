1. " one of my straight female friends said she likes hanging out with gay men , because she knows that the only thing they want from her is friendship . i thought that was a good point . " because wanting something beyond friendship is a bad thing ?

2. i was very careful with power washing my fence . i didn ' t want it to splinter . then i thought about it . who cares if there are a few splinters . wash it and stain it . don ' t walk on it with bare feet . oh wait it ' s a fence .

4. well the easy solution is for everyone to not be obsessed with having as much sex as they can get . to treat it with the proper care and attention it deserves . sex is designed by god or nature you pick to produce a child . if you cannot take care of a child or afford the mean to have sex without producing a child then you should not be having sex . an analogy would be like having a credit card . if you cannot purchase something with the card and have the money to pay it off then you should not be buying it . of course that would be impossible to implement because more and more people do whatever they want to do with little to no thought of the larger community

5. firstly because it was a long response , and it wasn  t angry , i thought u were offended . secondly was daily in capitals i now know it was a mistake and the fact that you told me to go and get the armour myself , which would be pointless as i don  t want it

6. jeez , and i thought i had to much free time on my hands . why would anyone want to watch them without the context of the game ? that seems so weird to me

7. i constantly have this thought in my head . but i like her , and i dont want to follow the same route i always do and leave after a month  digit months .

8. hey , first off , i wanna thank you for being real with how you feel . and congrats to losing 90lbs , that ' s absolutley insane ! the first thing i thought of was the concept of " stinkin thinkin " and how our mind sometimes plays sick games on us by saying we are " not good enough " in reference to tinder , , , anyone can make a profile so why would you deny yourself the opportunity to have one if you want one and try it . you may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome . but it starts with you making one and knowing that if others can have it , you can too . also youre so young that you can bounce outta this mindset . first i would take your chance on the girl you want . ask her to the gym or something , and if that doesnt work , go in on the tinder and try what have you got to lose ? nothin , but a mindset that needs updated . im sorry if thats harsh because i do empathize feeling that way , because ive been there but ive found the way out too by putting one foot in front of the other and takin that chance with a girl . i believe in you bruddah
