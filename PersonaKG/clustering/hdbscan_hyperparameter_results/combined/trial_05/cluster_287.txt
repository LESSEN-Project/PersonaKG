2. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .

6. oof , as a woman i suggest you not to spoil women that much , some of us get used to get all we want and then it ' s really hard to get on track again . not my case , i made clear to my boyfriend we are equal and he can count on me as much as i can count on him . i suggest you to talk to her and give her an ultimatum , you should take care of her but she ' s abusing it and not thanking what you do for her . obviously you need to change this , and don ' t have any kids for now , neither more pets or expenses . that wouldn ' t be good for the kids or you .
