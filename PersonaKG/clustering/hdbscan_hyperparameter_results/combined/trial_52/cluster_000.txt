1. i don ' t really see how you weren ' t supportive of her . she seemed to make her mind up on plenty of issues without you and you ' ve tried to approach them all in a logical way . also she purposeful tries to do things that hurt you ? that ' s unsupportive . you might have to let her go . i think it ' ll be better for both of you .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

2. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

3. sometimes you have to take care of number one , regardless of how others might feel . it  ll be a different story if he was actually trying to get help , you have no reason to feel like the bad guy .
   (ID: b5cc14fd703a97548093b4e06f7e3e92575b80b9)

4. she needs to get out of her mind that she is being  forced  . nah , fuck that shit . i rather have my family be mad at me than see that pos . part of being an adult is looking out for your wellbeing cause most the time family doesn  t understand that . good luck .
   (ID: 3590b3fd811042b17c3ff7f8b851664408a349ef)

5. then would you say you ' re bored with her ? or worried that something is physically wrong with you ? how would you summarize your worry in a few words ?
   (ID: 2904e4959568457dd43970d8388e42064d7c7d34)

6. i guess what i really meant to say is i have a right to be curious and concerned . so my overall question is how to balance making it clear i ' d like to know more while also not saying , as i accidentally did , that i have to know . i want my cousin to know they can tell me as much as they want to , because i want to be looped in , but that they aren ' t obligated to tell me anything .
   (ID: 13a80daa16b50a35515cc7dd9a2f892770b9695a)

7. i think you should not do anything to hurt yourself . i  m sorry you have it so hard and it  s not fair that you have parents who aren  t responsible enough to properly raise a child . but you don  t have to give up . against all odds you can still make a life for yourself . even if it  s little by little , even when all hope is lost . you  re not alone completely and we are here for you when you need us .
   (ID: d28c94c02761dbceb7bd64e3288f28eeef3a75cf)

8. it ' s a big mix of stuff but time is just one component . youtube is full of really socially intelligent folks that know how to help you navigate heartbreak . finding the right advice along with finding healthy distractions is key . you have to acknowledge your feelings , while at the same time giving yourself liberty to feel different emotions through other activities and diversion . you have to delve into healing while at other times work on suppressing certain emotions since they are not all constructive and sometimes even accurate . stay social . don ' t be afraid to hook with folks . i personally recommend tripping on molly , mushrooms or lsd to create an experience that could heighten your sense of how beautiful consciousness is . it sucks to say , but pain is a very helpful tool for progress . some people use it masochistically to self sabotage and wallow in a cycle of victimhood , self pity and depression . you could instead use pain to turn around and help other people , perhaps hold yourself to higher standards in important ways and above all use this opportunity to learn more about yourself and how to become the best friend to yourself you could possibly be .

9. you can ' t be around your child all the time , you don ' t know who is around your child and what they could be doing . i was abused by my dad ' s family . move across the country and move in with my step dad and mom and my sister was abused by one his relatives . i ' ve decided for that reason that i don ' t want a child
   (ID: 3cc69335d54dfe26e103753b56ad7268563823e2)

10. this post is too long , but i know exactly how you feel . i grew up in a similar situation , but i had digit older sisters ranging digit  digit years older than me . first you ' re an idiot for letting your mom drive drunk . you should have at least worried about the potential harm towards others . i think my parents weren ' t nice to me as a kid because they wanted to prepare me for the real world and ive come to appreciate it . life is going to be much harder on you if your a male , so you should be able to handle it . also wanting to be a musician i tought myself how to do everything and knowing that my parents wouldn ' t pay for my school no matter what i majored in , i spent digit years getting an ok paying job first . i know you don ' t want to hear about me though . my advice is digit  psychiatrists are witch doctors , dont waste your time of money . digit  distance yourself as much as you can from your family and live your own life .

11. if you  re on a break it means you  re not together at the moment , right ? if you  re expected to continue to be faithful then i feel like instead if a break it  s better to work through things as a couple . i guess i don  t really get the idea of a  break  that  s not a break  up in a relationship . anyway , be transparent with her if the time comes that you discuss getting back together .

12. hey there , i know you have gotten some good advice and i know you have gotten some sketchy advice . im about to give you middle of the road advice . lol . i dont think you need to have some long drawn out serious " come to jesus " talk with your boyfriend . a simple statement like you made should suffice . if you say no more sex without a condom that should be fine . you dont even have to be mean or demanding about it , just make the statement , as i think you already have and then just make sure that the penis never touches the vagina without a condom . you can put it on for him , you can have one ready or close by , or just ask him to put one on . i think if you make too big of a deal about it that it will kinda of put the blame on him and it is digit  his fault but its digit  your fault too . not that i am trying to make you feel bad , that kind of stuff happens sometimes . if for whatever reason he doesn ' t want to play along then a more serious talk is required , but i don ' t think the first conversation about it needs to be too over the top . i know as a male that if i were told no more sex without a condom , i could take that at face value and move on without a big long discussion about it . i ' m hoping your bf is the same way .

13. don ' t be too hard on yourself my friend . you are aware of the fact that she might be too young for you . i don ' t know what the age of consent or how the legislation is in your country but well . you don ' t have to feel disgusted man , things like that happen . it is up to you how you act on these feelings , i would understand that the gap between digit and digit is quite large though , so your feelings might be somewhat justified . don ' t reject yourself by saying you shouldn ' t be attracted to her , just accept that it happened and move on . you ' re not a pedophile or a pervert mate , from the reads of it you ' re a pretty consious person . just accept the feeling and let it go . if there is anything that i could help you with feel free to respond or dm . don ' t judge yourself too hard , shit happens .

14. i think the first thing i ' d do is to never suggest that these are " her best years " . for a lot of kids , these are the worst years and it can feel really hopeless to think it doesn ' t get any better . peer pressure is a bitch . i agree with istara that you should try to get her involved in something new . what is she interested in ?
   (ID: 1293e72aa7301baf0ecb3a2509e46cdcca834cd9)

15. what she is doing does not seem particularly troublesome . i mean it just seems like she is changing in ways that are really freaking you out . from what you have said i would let it slide as long as he isn ' t violent , extorting money or raping her . i mean as long as she is happy and not getting hurt right ?

16. why are so many people telling this guy to get a lawyer ? no lawyer needed . just don ' t do it ! it ' s illegal as hell . also , stop paying for your brothers car . tell him it ' s transferred into your name or you stop making payments . also , also  move out ! i have to be brutally honest , your mom sounds shady as fuck . you don ' t want to be around when it all comes crashing down on her . stay at a friends place or rent a cheap room . just get out of there !

17. everyone is going to have a different opinion on here . and that  s great . here is some more confusion for you to think about  as a guy , we are always told hitting on women at the gym is a horrible idea . he gave you signs once , but not the second time where is the consistency . even  alpha  male  hunters  enjoy it when an  alpha  female gets flirty first . cautious approach  maybe just ignore him entirely the next time and see if he initiates something . that would be a pretty good indicator he wants to keep things going . the  alpha  approach  screw it ! ask him ! the worst he can say is no , then you can stop wasting your time . no shortage of dudes out there . plus , then you can you can give him the  just friends  smile if you see him at the gym , and walk by letting him watch what he  s missing out on .

18. this found it randomly i guess he was japanese ? more of a poetic story . i dont know where to start . i was a weird kid had very few friends i transferred to a prepatory school where i was very joyful and joined a lot of events . i was stupid back then i had an less than the average toddlers intelligence made friends in a weird way as in not how you should ' ve interacted with complete strangers . i had fights and i was given too many chances to improve myself , like everybody is keeping me at easy mode even if i wanted to go normal . i switched to a public school because she was too worried abiut how to balance work and me the public school was a lot closer to where she worked . out of nowhere my social anxieties hit me like a truck , i didn ' t know anyone nor have any idea on what topic to start a conversation . then i thought that i should be myself and that is when everything went down f    ing hill . i did tons of weird a      t like i was autistic and stuff . my grades , my sanity and my social status suffered like hell i dropped like a bomb in through grand canyon , deeper and lower than i expected at fifth grade i never knew that it hit me like a baseball bat that i had depression , earlier than the normal basis like about digit  digit but the more i didn ' t know i had this the more it grew and affected medepression at my years was really uncommon i literally and socially closed doors to my few friend that i had . i only had one he stuck to me even i was socially and mentally weird he still still stuck with me . after a year of hell we finally graduated i never wanted to have any photos of my and my classmates but they still forced me to do it and bailed as soon as the camera flashed . i don ' t want anyone to know who i am and have any memory of me because it would be a waste of time and brain cells . me and my friend went to the same prepatory school from elementary to senior students . at the first day i made the god damn worst first impression of my life , the stupidest thing to imagine and it left my all  so  broken mind more broken than before then those boken peices were broken into more broken peices the more the year went on . i was bullied , humiliated , and teased in front of me and behind my back . the amount of sanity that i have left in my crippling mind and body was no more than a pile of dust . the amount bloodshed i wanted to do in those times , the murderous intent , the temptation to kill and torture them like they did to me . after the third period of my school i didn ' t show that much amount emotion just to hide the temptation to kill , my friend kept checking on me like i mattered the more he checked on me the less i wanted to torture someone . the bloodlust went away like it was a gentle breeze , but the depression didn ' t , from that day froward i wanted to make people happy even if it mean ' t to destroy of whats left of my reputation , the already destroyed mind of a person trying to make others happy despite the pain it felt , making them happy and having depression balanced each other out . my friend inspired me to be a better person by not verbally saying it but by showing it to me . thank you  from

19. some people like to compartmentalize certain parts of their life and its completely natural . if you warm up to them and show you can really vibe this can change .
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

20. the first thing you do is sop pestering her about how she feels . yes , you didn ' t tell her . yes , she found out and is pissed off . but this is a forgivable offense . as long as you stopped sleeping with your roommate before you entered the relationship with your current girlfriend you have nothing to worry about . trust me , the more you apologize the madder and more distant she is going to become . i have learned this the hard way because i ' ve been in your place with a similar situation . you already apologized profusely . do not contact her until she has dealt with her emotions and is ready to talk to you about this . patience is what you need now , not another angle on how to apologize even more profusely .
