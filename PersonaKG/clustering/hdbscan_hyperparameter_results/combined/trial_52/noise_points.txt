5. look at the sun first . then look at the data of the other planets in the solar system . you may find that there might be something similar going on ? you may also want to look into nasa ' s current observations on sunspots and solar activity and the average temperatures since this sun cycle ended . either your suv is reaching and has changed the heat of pluto  or . well , maybe i ' ll let you be the observational scientist . meanwhile , all the climate projections have been wrong since mr . gore ' s power point presentation . why ? it deals mostly with carbon dioxide , not the sun   and not a single climate projection that i have reviewed has ever taken in account of the heat sync ability of the earth ' s oceans .

18. i feel a buzz in my pocket . i reach and pull it out and see an emergency alert across the screen . " emergency  lock all doors and stay inside . do not panic . " " panic ? " i wonder out loud , " why would i panic ? " just then i hear a knock at the front door . i walk over to it and peer through the blurry glass . it seems like my girlfriend sophie . " sophie ? why are you home ? " she stares back blankly . " shouldn ' t you be at work right now ? why don ' t you have your key ? " no response . i back away from the door just as her jaw opens like a snake and a dark forked tongue crashes through the window and nearly reaches me , three yards away . i turn and run to the bedroom closet . i pull out my grandfather ' s long double  barrelled shotgun and load it with buckshot . as i click the barrel back in place , a monster comes roaring through my hallway , now barely recognizable as sophie . her face is distorted , dark and cavernous and webbed tentacles flow out of her dress and pull her along both walls like an ooze . i fire both barrels in quick succession . the blast is powerful , and leaves my ears ringing badly . the monster is thrown back to the end of the hallway . the remnants of sophie ' s face were removed by the blast , revealing mottled gray reptilian skin . the impact of the buckshot was substantial , and covered the center and left side of the creature with green blood . within moments , however , the worst of the wounds begin to close and its yellow eyes snap open . i back away , ejecting the spent shells and fumbling for more from my shirt pocket . the creature ' s face opens into a wide , horrible grin . the tongue shoots out again , farther this time , and locks around my chest like a steel cable . it pulls me in while flying toward me like a smoke cloud . i am engulfed into the abyss of its mouth . i regain consciousness while walking in the middle of the street . i have no control over my body , and i notice other people walking nearby , although i can ' t turn my head to look at them . there are no cars on the road . i walk for miles , feeling no fatigue and keeping a steady pace . i arrive to a house and knock on a door . my mind is foggy and i feel numb , but i know this house . this is my parents house . i haven ' t written in a long time and i ' m rusty . nice prompt !

   (ID: 7bd4f8e2f55f684df651b44f2faa8769031fc782)

20. you should make every effort to stand on your pile of crap . it is an ancient ritual . you can peer about , survey your vista , and i believe crowing is required . plus you can do the inspections no subcontractor will do for you , so take your high quality camera , so you dont have to go up too often .
