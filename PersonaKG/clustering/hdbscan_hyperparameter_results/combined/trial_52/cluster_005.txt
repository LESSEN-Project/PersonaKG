1. your argument is therefore  " there is one candy in the shop . i have a penny . some guy comes along , and tells the shopkeeper he ' ll pay a dollar for that candy . shopkeeper sells it for a dollar . " so , i can complain about why should i not get candy just because some rich people decided it ' s worth a dollar ? that ' s called socialism . the real question then is , if the city is getting richer and more propserous , why are these poor people still poor ? something wrong with wealth distribution here .

2. hey , you  re not a bad person  you were angry and people often say unkind things when angry . i get it , that  s why i asked why you commented that way . i like rust a lot and believe it will become more and more influential . thank you for your time to respond and apologize . it  s a sign of bravery when people do that . i appreciate you .
   (ID: 2a3f07a52e2fc5e79fd2ed52f4f601fa39ebe2e4)

3. i actually agree with you in this situation but since reddit only likes edgy meme lords i guess this is the wrong place to post it
   (ID: 5be7ef463c3ba0c7a9c255bd9769c5f638d2b805)

4. it ' s just that you refused to address my points or say anything but lol you are stupid , since you are so far beneath me and you lack the intellectual capacity for rational discussion i have moved on to doing something better with my time . you know it as well as i do that socialism will when you ' re watching it happen on tv every day and you ' re burned up with impotent rage . i don ' t give a shit what you say about me because i have people in my life who actually love me and care about me unlike trump supporters who are disowned by their own children do to how awful they are .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

5. why does it matter how i respond to you ? your argument is invalid .
   (ID: 4126a6a9d5a548a6bed5e0c4992792b1c10f2b92)

6. you come across as such an entitled douche , just because your opinions are different from others . doesn ' t make them wrong . get over yourself , ever think you ' re part of the problem with society today ? such a hypocrite
   (ID: 059c976738098229106db9c4736116cbb2f47eb8)

7. i don  t understand this aversion to violence that you have . take electrical cars for instance , they  ve been around for decades and the only reason their use is not widespread is because of the influence of the car , oil , and car maintenance lobbies . cars cause , what , digit , digit  digit , digit deaths in the us yearly . is this not structural violence on a mass scale ? and how about if we were to apply this to big farming . syngenta , conagra , cargill , and monsanto now run all pretty much digit  of food production in the us . this has wreaked havoc on small family run farming operations as thousands of families have had to close their farms . is this not another example of structural violence ? there is no way to achieve the things you want  democratically  or without violence . the only way to achieve the things you want is to brutally and violently repress the ruling class , namely the purveyors of capital formation and accumulation within the transnational corporations . the transnational corporations will never relinquish their power and wealth willingly . to believe so amounts to liberal idealism .

8. not commenting and commenting are the same thing . you imbecile . you fucking moron .
   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

9. actually i kinda agree with her on this one . waiting for a revolution isn ' t what makes it happen .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

10. cheers for not being aggressive in your response . it actually made me edit the post . this isn  t meant as an attack on people who use them but rather my thoughts on why the use of memes feels like a problem . if that  s what you love , then meme away my friend !
   (ID: 9cfb696c79a211a1c5a060dfb2265f65983eeeec)

11. i  m arguing because you say stupid things and can  t accept the fact that your post is not fun , smart , or helpful . you argue like a child and need to learn that not everything you say matters . you don  t want to argue , don  t respond . your the one who posted a garbage post with moron comments . you get off reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

12. i ' m confused on your stance on racism . in another comment you claim you were denied into a committee of sorts based on you being white . so you understand what racism is . yet you make a statement like only asians and jews are good at math . sounds to me like you ' re delusional . a stereotype is formed from ignorance and ignorance comes from not understanding or not wanting to understand  which fuels racism . so unless there was a misunderstanding , i think you and i have different definitions of what racism actually is .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

13. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .

14. oh you used a big word ! was that hard ? is that why it took so long to type out ? you all wonder why woman don ' t even want to look in your direction , bold of you to call me stupid when you can ' t even understand how self destructive your life is . hating woman and then wondering why they don ' t like you back , crying about it to other basement dwellers like yourself . woman don ' t owe you shit and they never will .

15. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

16. what the hell are you even talking about ? i  outed myself  ? my comment about democrats was part of a response to someone maybe you , i can  t be bothered to go back and verify user names saying something like  spotted the trumptard  to me . there were other comments between those , but that  s the main premise . is the main point of your comment to basically say  hey , twist  digit is a republican !  ? because if that  s the case , you  re wrong . my original comment was to voice my opinion that kaepernick isn  t talented enough to ignore the media circus he brings with him . why you  re making it out to be more than that is fucking beyond me . also , i don  t know why you think i  m going to delete any of this . i stand by everything i said , kaepernick isn  t a great quarterback and he isn  t worth the media circus .
   (ID: 7a396588993d687f5528f10b200dc9d6db769270)

17. do you realize what day and age this is ? did you just get from , like , digit years in the future , where it ' s some utopia , and you ' re surprised that this sort of thing doesn ' t get the attention and reform it deserves , or something ? yes . we call the future europe .  if you disagree , we ' re literally going to have to break down the semantics of " intent " so that you can understand . yes , i do disagree . let ' s break down the semantics of intent . according to the oxford dictionary , " intent " means intention or purpose . purpose in turn is " a particular requirement or consideration , typically one that is temporary or restricted in scope or extent  " i think that fits rather well .
   (ID: e3524b3478c664f2c6e8b00a4341ff0a26995fbc)

18. ahh , now you ' re playing stupid , huh ? way to show intellectual honesty . really . well done . thanks again for displaying what fucking liars you all are . way to show , again , that you have to lie through your teeth just to feel like you aren ' t a bunch of fucking rats . seriously . thank you .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

19. you know what , you ' re absolutely right , it ' s mean for me to point out your errors  especially on a forum like idle heroes . i don ' t intend to discourage you or make you feel like you need to justify yourself . you ' ve taught me a lesson today and in the future , i ' ll know that pointing out someones minor mistakes , is not worth the effort and only upsets people . thank you for taking the time for the back and forth . peace .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

20. they are facts as you see them . your need to mock makes you an asshole and is a mistake i am trying to correct i a way you understand . further mockery . who ' s denying the facts , anyway ? to me its not what your doing its how your doing it .
