1. that ' s pretty neutral , it ' s always best to be positive and not talk about what you didn ' t like but what you did like . for instance , your old boss might have been a real hard ass , riding you all day . instead of saying that you could say your old boss was really involved in my day to day tasks and was really focused on the job getting done . i learned a lot from him . this is not a lie and it spins the situation in a positive light .

2. i understand but it seemed that your question didn ' t make any sense . a cop will give you a ticket if you break the law even if what you ' re doing makes sense as is safer than following the law . a cop will give you a ticket if he doesn ' t know the law or is having a bad day . your question doesn ' t matter , hypothetically or not . you do the best you can and try not to break any laws . sorry if i became outraged because i really wanted to understand and answer the question and really thought that i had , and it frustrated me that i didn ' t .

4. hey kyzabro , i can relate , i suffer from insomnia , first i was given vallium , then melatonin and then put on antidepressants to make me groggy and get sleep . i posted this on day three and got some really solid advice from ckreon , have a read of the comments , the hard part is actually doing it , but the first night i did it , slept like a baby , my sleep has been slowly improving ever since i get a solid 5ish hours unbroken sleep now and fall asleep pretty quick . when everyone says do some physical exercise i put it in the bullshit advice pile , but i swear to you , it really works . best of luck mate !
