6. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

7. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .

8. aren  t most guys in porn pretty desperate people ? i mean , if you have any sort of other skill or talent , do not have a criminal record , no visible tattoos , and get along with others , you can probably get a legit job instead of porn .
   (ID: cb8cb80756996949fe8fa5c308bb091367a0c6ff)

9. i don  t think it  s women that like you less , it  s just not the best women who are acting like this with you . i mostly have female friends i knew before and after transitioning and they were all really supportive , same with any male friends i had . they are good people , so they accepted me wholeheartedly . i suggest finding those types of people in your life , regardless of gender yknow ?

13. what ' s been going on inside of my head ? been staring at the ceiling , for hours on end can ' t really think of anything else that i can do  maybe i can go out , and find my way , or maybe i can chill out , stay in today they sound like fun , but maybe another day  sorry , not sorry ! i couldn ' t help it ! just ignore this post , wanted to vent out .

16. i  m digit and have lived in green bay my whole life . i  ve found vikings fans to be the worst . they  re never realistic about how good they are and they care more about the packers losing than they care about winning . bears fans are usually respectable and not nearly as big of idiots as vikings fans . lions fans are cool to
