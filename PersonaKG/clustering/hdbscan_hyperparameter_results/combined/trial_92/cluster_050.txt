2. " riley " i ' m sorry your day turned to shit . the crappy thing about fear is that it isn ' t always rational and when caught off guard it is difficult to act rationally anyway . i had a similar experience a few years ago which helped me decide i was buying a car so i didn ' t have to wait at bus stops and i have the guy half of my land line number and the other half of my cell . to this day i wonder why i didn ' t just say no . or maybe i did and he insisted . i cast it as a lesson learned for the future . sadly he got on the same bus as me and i got got off and doubled back to another route .
