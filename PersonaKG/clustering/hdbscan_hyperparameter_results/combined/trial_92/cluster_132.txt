4. terrorists who do nothing but play into the hands of other radical groups . whether or not their ideologically is inherently as bad as say a nazi is irrelevant , it ' s more that they add fuel to the fire so to speak .

   (ID: de0709ad19c458ffff0b96aab8fcfa9c40b24603)

7. if a rubber ball filled with helium is placed on the incline , it will not roll . if a ball of glue is placed on the incline , it will not roll . almost nothing ever has a single cause . most things have their entire light as their cause , and it ' s usually nonsensical to consider something to be a one true cause of an event . this is the first flaw i see in your definition of " cause . another flaw i see is  nowhere in the naive definition does it say everything must have a cause . yet your argument hinges on this .
   (ID: fae28587bce17296589bf92d656ad68ee32601d6)

8. i will say this , nice to see a skx009j for once . and your bezel seems to line up very nice !

   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

10. she was too centered on me , for lack of a better articulation . not that she was clingy , but there was not enough " texture " in our relationship . perhaps someone who ' s experienced similar can say it more eloquently .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

11. in other countries they squat over their " toilets " . so this isn ' t meant to say that natives would do this .
   (ID: 8764a223ca1af7d1792e76a58bf3b1209bf73ad3)

   (ID: 3ad18913fe75fd4a63c4ae0d0255c37d90fd7144)

16. if you walk in all you have to say is you have a gun and they have to give you money because that  s what their employers teach them
   (ID: cd907372aff0871825a64e977822586e3bb0ecb7)

17. is an extremely thorough examination of free will . a short summary of the link above would be   we have the intuitions that   the sensation of the primitive of actions , is incompatible with their physical determinism  a decision can only have a single " true " source  what is by the past cannot be determined by the present  if no single psychological factor you can see is perfectly responsible , then there must be an additional something that is perfectly responsible  when you reflect upon any single factor of your decision , you see that you could override it , and this " you " is the extra additional something that is perfectly responsible but these intuitions are mistaken , and make our intuitive idea of free will incoherent . however , the feeling of free will corresponds to a real thing , and there is a meaningful distinction between a man having free will say , choosing to eat chicken or pork for dinner and a man lacking free will say , choosing to eat chicken or pork for dinner while in presence of religious fanatics that would kill him if he dared to eat chicken .
