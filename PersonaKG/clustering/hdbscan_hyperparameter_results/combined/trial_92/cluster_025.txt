1. remember that other one where he got the volunteer to murder stephen fry ? he also used the " anchor " and " color " concepts in that one . it think it is bullshit to suggest anyone can be persuaded in this way  as you mention , there are extensive screening and editing processes that db doesn ' t share with the audience . he just really knows how to pick em .

2. well , i was ready to trash the phone . it only worked while connected to a battery pack or wall charger  and i went through that for half a year . i wouldn  t even be able to hand down the phone to my kids to play games . a cheap battery replacement was my final straw for it . and it worked out . i never opened the back to see what i got and i don  t really care tbh but my phone now works like when i first got it . thats all that mattered to me lol .
