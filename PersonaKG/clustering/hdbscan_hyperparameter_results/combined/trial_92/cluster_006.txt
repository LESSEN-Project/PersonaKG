1. i absolutely agree with all your points . especially about letting the kids wander away . but i love the show for the zombies . need more zombies ! on the flip side , i do believe that the characters really are a pathetic group that don ' t think rationally . i suppose after their world is turned upside down with so much death and destruction , they don ' t think , plan , and " survive " as well as we do in the comfort of our living room chairs . but the drawback to that as a drama series is that i lose sympathy for them , and start not caring what happens to them . in fact , i start waiting for them to get picked off by the zombies and start cheering for the undead . one thing i noticed was there were a lot more dead people this time , and they were quite rotted away  dried husks . i understand people rotting  bloating , but would they be so dried out ? atlanta is not exactly a dry desert environment . has the zombie invasion been going on for that long ? as for the radiator hose , i had an old chevy vega that broke a hose on a cross country trip . i fixed it with hose tape but it would only last digit miles before it broke again . so yeah , once your hose is shot , it ' ll keep disintegrating until you can replace it . but what bothers me , there are so many abandoned vehicles on the road , couldn ' t they switch to something better than an rv ?

2. it wouldn  t be a bad idea to have an older student tutor you . does your school have a peer tutoring program ? lots of people struggle with math and geometry takes a lot of understanding about different shapes as well as a lot of equations . it could be as simple as you simply don  t understand how it  s being explained to you and you need a new perspective . if you  re not willing to get a tutor you  re going to have to put in double time on studying . write and rewrite problems and how to solve them until you understand how you get the answer correct . you can do it ! it just might not be easy

3. hey . firstly you need to speak to someone be it a doctor or the samaritans , someone . secondly why are you looking up reasons instead of looking inwards and seeing what the actual issue is . do you have depression or something that maybe people around you don ' t know how to handle ? what kind of person are you ? are you kind ? thoughtful ? generous with your time ? empathetic ? honest ? nice ? these are all traits that people like . or are you selfish ? negative ? deceitful ? apathetic ? narcissistic ? irresponsible ? egotistical ? you can change your behaviour and your characteristics . you are not always going to be the person you perceive yourself to be now . everyone has the potential to change and grow . believe in yourself . only you have the ability to make yourself happy . don ' t depend on others to validate you . mind yourself .

4. rifle training was once taught in school . they even had competitive shooting teams . firearms in america have been part of ordinary life for a long time . it is only recently that mass shootings have become a problem . the number of shootings is increasing , while the number of gun owners is going down . this suggests that guns are not the problem . so , what is the problem ? what changed ? is it a breakdown of family values ? or that we no longer teach civic duty and citizenship ? is society encouraging a sense of hopelessness , futility , and cynicism to the point that we devalue human life ? i don ' t really know what the answer is , but it appears that there is too much fighting for enough people to think about what it might be , in order to make a change .

5. people are raised in a certain way and if everyone around you thinks that way throughout your time living there it  s really hard to be critical of that way of thinking because you  d be going against everything everyone you know believes , in short , peer pressure on a larger scale

6. as a desktop support technician at a college can i ask you all to just not . we are aware the computers are shit , we are aware you would like better ones and , i am happy to admit it , i am aware that you guys probably know more about computers , networking and other shit than i do . what i would like you guys to be aware of is . everyday i have to smile while people complain about their slow pcs and underpowered pcs and i try to do my best for them by sneaking in extra ram and setting it up so it doesnt strictly follow the start up scripts . however we are underfunded and i can only do so much . senior management at your college probably have much nicer kit than you . they will also get sweet phones and shit . they do this because they are important and although they could afford the devices themselves easily with their pay they would rather spend the money there than on better pcs for the students . i once spent two days tidying up a room making sure that all the cables were neat and the pcs were running well . one week later i returned to find everything destroyed and it needed doing again . it broke my heart . i am dead inside now . what is the point in trying to do my job if people are just going to take a steaming shit on it anyway ? one of the reasons your pcs are slow is group policy . these are not your home machines so they have to conform to a long list of things including stupid virus scans every time they are logged in and also mapping network drives on an ageing network . i cannot fix that . please don ' t make my life any harder by opening the pcs . they are going to be shit , they are going to be dirty and its some poor fuckers job to roll around when you ' re all done tidying up

7. sadly , hormones can  t fix all our features  even though hrt for transmen is stronger than trans women most of the time . i know personally i  m a guy and all but after going on t , i got more dysphoria around my chest when i was pre op , female organs and bottom area . i changed drastically but that made things i can  t change stand out even more . that happens a lot when people transition . hrt is not going to make our lives perfect and amazing like many people think . i personally believe that  s why a lot of trans people are depressed and stuff after hormones , they imagined their life to instantly become perfect and all their problems go away . our problems will still be there after hormones , i knew this . i just knew that my problems will be easier to deal with as a man than a girl for me .
