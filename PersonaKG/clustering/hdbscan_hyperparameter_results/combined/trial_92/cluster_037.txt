2. i saw a comment on a post recently imagine your lonely dying breaths , ending with you feeling comforted by what you feared most your entire life . get out there and face your fears , because behind all of them is a chance to gain new perspective and expand it and really grow and learn . our fears force us into our  comfort  zones , es little stimulation in comfort . anyways i  m rambling good night victory  hand  dark  skin  tone

8. hi , i can see that you  re really talented and you played really good if i would change one thing though i would play the original music clip in the corner so everyone who is not an guitar expert and doesn  t know what everything does can look at the original clip and the rest can ignore it because the clip is in the corner
