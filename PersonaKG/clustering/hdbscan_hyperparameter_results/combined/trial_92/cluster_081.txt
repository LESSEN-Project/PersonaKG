12. i wonder why that is . it couldn ' t possibly be because men are conditioned to keep their emotions all bottled up and also that they ' re conditioned to be more violent than women so when they do act out they tend choose more violent means of suicide the fact that women attempt suicide more than men kind of proves this  if we attempt suicide more often than men , why do we actually die in fewer numbers ? hmm it sure is a conundrum .

15. ask him if there ' s anything he wants you to help him with . i ' m sure his doctors have given him plenty of information . diet and exercise are part of the usual therapy prescribed so maybe you can partner with him on one or both of those . you can ' t force him to do anything and sometimes suggestions aren ' t that welcome but support usually is . if the idea is his .
