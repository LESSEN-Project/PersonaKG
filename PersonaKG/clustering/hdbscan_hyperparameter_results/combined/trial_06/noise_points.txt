1. a guy on my street used to try to drive us to school all the time and one of my friends used to go with him all the time . my friend always in the newest clothing , shoes , new phone , all that . well one day dude offered me a ride to school and i accepted when i was running late . during the ride to school he stopped in a neighborhood and told me  i will blow you for  digit  flat out said that . so me being like digit and this guy like digit are now face to face and he wants to blow me . i thought about it for a second , kindly declined , he tried to persuade me with more money but i again declined . in hindsight , its really gross to think about it and it still bothers me sometimes knowing a good friend was letting him do it .

5. thank you , kay  elle . it would be unfair to the child if we did let her sway us . and if we ever do foster it ' ll be because we want to and we ' re willing to put digit  into it , not because of duty or others wants . like you said , a child is a decision with life long consequences for them and you .

   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

12. the thieves guild found when me when i was a young child on the streets of taichan , the wide slums adjacent to the walled capital city samhai . at some point in those first few years they found that i didn ' t trip magical alarms and that made me much more valuable to them . i became a burglar as a child while the other children were pickpockets , ascending quickly to a middle ranking position by the time i was thirteen years old . however then things became a little strange . magic is typically an endeavor of the wealthy . magic books are expensive and complicated magic is usually learned in the academy in samhai . but nearly everyone of a certain age learns some piece of magic . there is an internal force that takes time to develop and usually begins to express itself with puberty . in strong magicians it finds ways to come out , like sparks from their fingertips or burping fire . if those magicians are found in taichan they are whisked off to samhai to be adopted by powerful families and trained in magic . even the thieves guild will make deals and surrender their talented magicians . this is why i began magic lessons at thirteen . most other burglars used magic constantly to evade magical defenses . i had never needed it , and just focused on quietly slipping through the house and identifying valuables . a part of me didn ' t believe my job was dangerous until i saw a veteran burglar ripped apart by magical wolves in a house in samhai . i wanted as much protection as possible after that and sought magic instruction immediately . the problem was , i couldn ' t do magic . everyone laughed when they heard and joked that it was good i was a talented thief because i wouldn ' t get anywhere in high society . over time however , and through my own small experiments , i learned that not only was i incapable of preforming magic , i seemed immune to it . i put my finger into a magical flame , had the best con artist in the guild try an illusion on me , didn ' t even feel the attacks from our best combat magician . at this point everyone was amazed and sort of unsure of how to treat me . even our leader was perplexed . " see , i ' m sure the academy wants you , but for what ? i ' m just as sure you wouldn ' t want to be their lab rat . " oren said . he and i were alone in his office , part of the tunnel network underneath taichan . " they would pay me for you , but you make that much every digit months . i would be a fool to give you up . in fact , i think this means we can go bigger . " " what do you mean , bigger ? " the image of ghostly wolves ripping into theo ran through my head . " i mean what ' s the one target we have never hit before ? " oren said . " there are two , " i frown , " the academy and the king . either one would be a terrible idea . " " i meant the academy . the king ' s guard has swords and spears , i ' m pretty sure you aren ' t immune to those . " " but you don ' t know if there ' s magic in the academy we ' ve never seen before . i don ' t really want to push my luck . besides , what ' s to stop them from destroying all of taichan and our tunnels if they wanted to ? " " only one thing . the thing you ' d be going there to steal . ruan ' s stone . " great prompt ! i might write a part digit if there ' s interest .

13. thank you for spending the time with your child . i wish my parents didn  t work so hard all the time because i could never see them . trust me , they  ll be grateful you were there for them because not a lot of parents are . i wish more people would spend more time with their children because it  s very important to their development . she  ll only be in your hair for so much longer . keep up the good work !

15. this is tough . it changes . when i met my wife it was exciting . not like a roller coaster more like consistently looking forward to the next time we interacted . what would happen next , talking about the future and of course the sexual appeal . butterflies . i knew we would be married one day even though we were in our late teens . i just knew . i didn ' t have " what if " thoughts to dissuade me . it ' s been nearly digit years now married digit . it ' s not excitement now it ' s deep deep caring . what would she think , how does she feel , how can i make it better . how can i ease a burden . she is my best friend . that old question about if you could go back and do it over knowing what you know now always stumps me . could i make different choices and still end up in this relationship ? because if i couldn ' t i wouldn ' t . sorry for the novel .

19. i think the idea is to hide the piercing so you look more presentable at a job interview . that said , this would probably be more questionable than the earrings .
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

20. same here . my study of religion led me to conclude they were all manmade . the way that i see it we all have certain drives for meaning , for purpose , for morals and certain emotional needs getting over the fear of death , wanting to reconnect with dead loved ones , wanting a sense of meaning in life , etc . and religions each navigate a way in which they can fulfill these human desires . and i think that the religions out there today are still in existence because partially they tended to fulfill these the best .
