2. being single does suck . i ' ve been single my entire life m16 . i usually cope by hanging out with friends . i know i ain ' t the best looking , nor am i fit . but yeah . i get how you feel . life does suck that way . whenever i feel down about being alone , i usually think " i ' ll find that person eventually " some day you will . just continue doing what you like , and hang out with your friends

3. thank you . i don ' t blame myself in a way that isn ' t realistic . i blame myself for not being aware of the warning signs of what happened to me . that ' s about the extent . i don ' t harbor any unhealthy emotions and though i suffer mildly from ptsd i am conscious enough to work on my issues . with that being said . yes , i am still with my boyfriend . the truth of the matter is that he simply isn ' t emotionally mature enough to understand the depths of what had happened . i did threaten to break up with him . the first couple of times he said it to me i didn ' t stand up for myself . i don ' t know why . but the last time he said it i really stuck it to him . i realized that if he thinks this way i can ' t possibly marry someone who will think like that and i told him that . i also told him i will happily leave because i know i wouldn ' t be suffering a loss if that ' s the way he is thinking . for the first time in all the time i have known him he stopped and gave me a very heart felt apology taking accountability for his lack of sympathy and understanding . quite frankly , a lot of other things were said . but it was true and i know he meant it . this is still a red flag for me . if i am suffering from something in the future , am i going to have to be the one to walk him through it too ? just because i am more emotionally equipped to handle ? he ' s not a horrible person . but he is selfish in his thinking . and he is emotionally sheltered . after digit years i am starting to wonder if i want to be the one who does all of the picking up .

4. this this and this . do your best to change it for her . make her feel like it  s not a bad thing and there  s no reason to feel bad . try your best to erase that part of her past . purple  heart
   (ID: 3590b3fd811042b17c3ff7f8b851664408a349ef)

5. as long as you don  t tell anyone about the crush whatsoever , i  d say it  s not cheating . and i also don  t think you should have to completely cut off contact with the other person . you liked them for a reason so just stay good friends based on that friendship
   (ID: d53ad0bccb6d6f62bf1a4957708759d7b446498b)

6. in my experience , it was hard not to want to put labels on relationships so quickly as i got older but realized it was for the better that way . you should only move as quickly as you feel comfortable . if it is too slow for her , that is her problem , not yours .
   (ID: e1d1404c2d4f1c884debe976d40ee13df3959fcf)

7. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

8. i went on because life is about the present and future . if you regret , you will be wasting your time and proving , you can ' t get over someone . be a man  girl stand up and find someone who loves you . there are more fish in the sea , and if she  he left you it ' s because she  he didn ' t love you enough so why waste time on a lost cause . you are beautiful and deserve someone who sees that
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

9. you know , i  ve been at that point in my life where i wondered why i had so many failed relationships . but then i realized all of them had one thing in common . me . there  s a reason why we pick the partners we do . go to counseling because you want to be the best you that you can be , not because she made the call . go for you . i hope you do it .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

10. does she want to be with you ? if not , then she is not the right one for you . obviously i don  t know the details of your relationship so i can  t really say but my rule is that i want someone to be with me , not because i convince them , but because i didn  t need to .
   (ID: d95d3548a9506e48c5310c85f3b2994820405e0d)

11. i would recommend advice for this , but i ' ll try to help as well anyway i think you ' re just friends by convenience . you ' re on the same team , you live near each other and give each other lifts , but beyond that , he has better friends and you don ' t . i ' ve been in that situation , there ' s not much you can do except to to find other , better friends , and accept that that ' s where your relationship is at . if you ' re scared to do things around him , find other friends and don ' t value his opinion of you so highly , that way if he does judge you , who cares ? as a rule , if a friend makes you feel uncomfortable in some way when you ' re around them , get out , find a better person to spend your time with   x200b    x200b

12. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

13. sounds like a rough situation , if s is really obsessed i guess not doing anything don  t help , so you got to take action . i would suggest telling s you don  t like her , and hope for the best .
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

14. i am so sorry for your loss . it ' s ok to be thinking of yourself right now . death is hard to deal with even if your not in touch anymore . perhaps this can be a moment in your life that makes you learn and reminds you to keep people closer . don ' t blame yourself for anything life is short . red  heart
   (ID: dc0783c6951122c6edfc85430901cf133c146b32)

15. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

16. no ma  am you are not worthless and even if nobody notices you have a lot to offer . it feels like nothing can get better or that nothing will ever change but it can . just hold on . you just keep holding on and you can get through this .
   (ID: d28c94c02761dbceb7bd64e3288f28eeef3a75cf)

17. i can  t believe i just read that whole book you just wrote lol . but look i can tell you immediately why you don  t wanna give him a chance . bc you don  t like him . period . you just see him as a friend . you never even thought about dating him til your family said something . you never mention having some chemistry or any kind of feelings for him . and that  s ok . yea he sounds like a great guy but if you don  t feel a connection with him or get all giggle with him i don  t think it  s gonna work out . the best part of a relationship is the honey moon stage . i mean you could give him a chance but don  t get all stressed about it . dating is suppose to be fun . especially around our age . goodluck op
   (ID: 3590b3fd811042b17c3ff7f8b851664408a349ef)

18. i have a few friends like you , and i want to shake them all . it  s easier said than done but you have to understand if people didn  t want you around , they wouldn  t invite you anywhere . research some small ways to help yourself with confidence .
   (ID: f14ea91df683dc236b3ffe5956871b69581e71d3)

19. you ' re not being dramatic . he ' s telling you that he wouldn ' t be there for you . i ' d listen .
   (ID: 5a15ed606a86674cb48abaf9fee4375ff6bbff09)

20. for sure , it ' s always much easier said than done . it ' s the same for every person in the world that has an insecurity that can be seen by people . it ' s tough has hell , but trying to think " i ' ll never see that person again anyway " , really can help . as long as you have close friends and family who love and care for you , regardless of how you look or feel , that ' s all that really matters
