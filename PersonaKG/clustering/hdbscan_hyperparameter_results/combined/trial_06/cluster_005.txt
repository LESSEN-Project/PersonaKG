1. why do you think rape and killing of the weak are so common in nature then ? it actually does benefit the species . however , as we became more intelligent and developed empathy , we began to start outlawing such things . also , we don ' t have a moral obligation to anything or anyone . we simply do it because that is how our brains are wired and because excuse me for saying this we live in a society .
   (ID: b7ca8beb99c98a46de3704213b38cdcc44dbb728)

2. it  s the internet my dude , you aren  t going to change the minds of people who think they  re right . all you can do is flawlessly which is an unfortunate aspect of talking to people on the internet present your counter argument and hope some people are willing to look at things objectively . maybe you  ll convince one person . just present your sources and hope for the best . the biggest thing is to never take the arrows too seriously , it  ll just make you angry because reddit has a mob mentality against anything contrary to the accepted opinion of the day .

   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

4. you have a perceived notion on the us government ' should ' run . which you literally just proved my point . you don ' t understand how they actually work .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

5. i mean , i explicitly told you do x , y , and z if you want to improve , but hey , that doesn ' t count right ? i even offered you a bet where winning it meant you made a life improvement , but that doesn ' t count right ? you know best still . i ' m blocking you now . you are one of the saddest , most pathetic , most repugnant fucking things i ' ve ever encountered here . seriously , it ' s difficult to even consider you a human . you ' re more like a parasite . a disease , that infects everything around you with revulsion at the sight of you . how fat are you ? how fucking ugly are you ? how much of your existence is spent in that incel sub ? frankly , spend all or your time there . no one wants you anywhere else . you are fucking disgusting . i am going to delete every post i ' ve made here , simply because i want to eradicate any evidence i ' ve encountered you . you sicken me that much . you ' re suicidal ? well don ' t do it . keep living , like this , forever . that would make me happy . keep living .

6. i use this subreddit for fun . this topic wasn ' t marked serious . if people want to overanalyze a comment , that ' s up to them .
   (ID: 68698bd86019a86cb34a8b2e28c6324727011b28)

7. how do you know that you are coming at me without facts
   (ID: 23df46bdba3eb265d08b02c9ec5f365cf45ae5fd)

8. no , i read it . you ' re told you shouldn ' t say something and you ' re having a fit about it . it doesn ' t matter to you what the word means or how anyone else feels about it . all that hippy care about is how you mean it and how it makes you feel that someone told you the other n  word . " no . " it ain ' t all about you , white boy . stop being a little baby and get over it .
   (ID: 5146a89965a734a4d1ec9ec9145abae872a4569d)

9. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

10. they are facts as you see them . your need to mock makes you an asshole and is a mistake i am trying to correct i a way you understand . further mockery . who ' s denying the facts , anyway ? to me its not what your doing its how your doing it .
   (ID: f15c79447707a6e701285e8c59cc3aa25d54daa6)

11. op makes claim using vague terms , gets told to define term , provides definition , gets argued with or laughed at for mistaken assumptions . that ' s usually how things work around here . just substituting ' circlejerk ' for ' god ' or ' soul ' or ' spiritual ' or whatever the hell else . tell me exactly what you mean by it and i ' ll tell you what you have wrong . tl  dr whoosh
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

12. lmao how pretentious are you ? you write like a child found a thesaurus and thought it would make him cool . i understand the historical context . slavery wasn  t ok , slavery doesn  t justify genocide . white people were awful  brutalized slaves , doesn  t mean you should go and murder everyone with a drop of european blood . but sure , go ahead pretending you  re smarter than everyone else  justifying genocide , bud .
   (ID: 280643182527d573e119c7952a08fea10d62edd8)

13. what the hell are you even talking about ? i  outed myself  ? my comment about democrats was part of a response to someone maybe you , i can  t be bothered to go back and verify user names saying something like  spotted the trumptard  to me . there were other comments between those , but that  s the main premise . is the main point of your comment to basically say  hey , twist  digit is a republican !  ? because if that  s the case , you  re wrong . my original comment was to voice my opinion that kaepernick isn  t talented enough to ignore the media circus he brings with him . why you  re making it out to be more than that is fucking beyond me . also , i don  t know why you think i  m going to delete any of this . i stand by everything i said , kaepernick isn  t a great quarterback and he isn  t worth the media circus .
   (ID: 7a396588993d687f5528f10b200dc9d6db769270)

14. okay , we get it . you want to change the subject now that you ' ve been called out .
   (ID: 8bc3c38873da8df8d450deb17fd3c4a602037c65)

15. okay , you ' re trolling . you got me . i give up .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

16. i  m arguing because you say stupid things and can  t accept the fact that your post is not fun , smart , or helpful . you argue like a child and need to learn that not everything you say matters . you don  t want to argue , don  t respond . your the one who posted a garbage post with moron comments . you get off reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

17. this is true . add to the fact that our entire media system tends to be owned by very few people and those same few people often own parts of other corporations . what results is a media system that becomes nearly incestuous , promoting other parts of itself sister companies , subsidiaries , etc . at the expense of doing its original job reporting accurately . tl  dr  our media companies are all conglomerates , we ' re turning into a real  life idiocracy .
   (ID: 699bf0afe2f1405d2208320e80156a99e90d356e)

18. lol ad hominems are a sign that you ' re triggered . calm down and see it for what it is , humor . if you cannot i certainly can ' t help you . i ' m not going to respond to you after this reply you ' ll just have to stew in your misguided anger . have a great day smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

19. feel like there ' s some built in problems with this post
   (ID: 8df56ee782672f11aeb0f19bf7978b1b1c04e678)

20. i haven ' t told what you can and can ' t find funny , i ' ve told you what is innapropriate to say , there ' s a difference . when i said it was a joke , you said this  " no , it ' s not . jokes are meant to be funny to more people than just you . " sure you might not be saying that i didn ' t find it funny , but you were saying that no one else finds it funny . which is wrong . you are wrong .  my actions here were mostlt for the benefit of the op . you ' re words most likely bothered them in a big way , and as well as wanting to stand up to someone behaving like you did , i also wanted to show the op that someone would stand up for them and hopefully counter how you made them feel . a person on the internet who is mature enough will understand that most people will be sarcastic when given the chance . especially since he didn ' t put a " serious " tag on his post . my comment was very much clearly a joke , made obvious by the exclamation point . the fact that you got so triggered by it just highlights your immaturity and inability to recognise jokes on the internet . you might find that this flaw , this cluelessness to social cues , is one of the reasons you were bullied .  think what you want of my actions , i feel like i did the right thing . you didn ' t do anything wrong . you are just acting like a stuck up bitch . you ' re like that one person that always takes a joke seriously , gets offended because it isn ' t a " clean joke " and complains about it while other people just laugh .  and well done for admitting you made a dick move , most people don ' t have the balls to go back and admit a mistake . no need to congratulate me on something everyone like me will do , this is just showing how naive you are . there is no mistake , there never was a single mistake . i am a dick . people like me will always admit to acting like a dick . why do you think i do the things i do ? i ' m not oblivious like you .
