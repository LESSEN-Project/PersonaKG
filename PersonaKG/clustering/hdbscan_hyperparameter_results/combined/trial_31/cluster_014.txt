1. yes , you need to tell someone . school nurse might help . but it may come down to child protective services . do you want to be pulled from your home and placed somewhere else ? it could come to that . is it really as bad as you think ?
   (ID: fca46720f9aa154a0559b1e4d2d28cb0df46b00a)

2. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

3. good looking guy . you probably come off too pushy or desperate . let the chicks come to you .
   (ID: fca46720f9aa154a0559b1e4d2d28cb0df46b00a)

4. one of the biggest errors our little human brains make is assuming people we know are the same from day to day . many people do not understand the episodic nature of depression . i strongly encourage you to mention to a friend of parent something like " this may be out of left field , but between you and me , i ' ve been feeling kind of blue lately . i know i don ' t show it , but i guess i could use a little extra support at the moment " say it in a way that feels like your voice . saying it out loud is scary , but surprisingly therapeutic in and of itself .
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

5. that sounds really fantastic . i had the same thing with my so , we didn ' t kiss until our third date . we ' re still together a year later , and i know we will be for the rest of our lives . it sounds like you know that , or something similar , about your new love . good on you , and i really hope it works out . thanks for posting this , it ' s nice to see something so happy and positive , especially given i ' ve been having kind of a rough time of late so aside , she ' s wonderful in every way imaginable .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

6. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

7. is there anything i could do or say to her that would make it easier without it being too weird . we have only gone out once and i feel like asking her how she feels about me leaving would be too soon right now . like i should try and take her out again and see how it goes ?
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

8. stop arguing with your brother , and have a calm conversation with your mom . listen closely to her , without interruption and without formulating any rebuttals . try to understand her views , and verify you understand by repeating her exact words back to her . when you think both of you feel like you understand her point of view , then ask her questions . an example  if you could dictate your children ' s futures , what would they look like ? do your current actions help put that in place ? what do you think dad would say about this ? how can i help to alleviate your worries or whatever negative emotion she shares . next step , request a certain amount of time for you and her , but don ' t say that to think about what was discussed , and schedule when you can meet privately again . do the same process as above , but allow her to change her stance without confronting her about the change . just make sure you both understand how she feels and why she feels that way . now you can share with her your feelings and opinions , just keep it calm . i bet you two are not as far apart as you think .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

9. well look it at another perspective . you have learned from this experience . it sucks of course . but it will make you better in the en  don ' t let this be something that controls your next couple of days . let it go as hard as it seems and do some stuff with your friends . or talk to other people . in the end you will come out stronger . here is a quote i picked up "  if we see any mermaids i  m gonna ask them where their merginas are " i know this isn ' t helpfull at all but it makes me laugh everytime . have a good one !
   (ID: 14bd1366b004b74cfd8c9cb269849740d12cff80)

10. im gonna tell you , mate , taking your life only hurts the people around you . not one single person is thinking life would be better without you . high school is no determination factor anyway , life changes after high school and you can make life what you want it . you can start and entirely new life for yourself , you ' re moving on to how you want to impact the world . i know talking to someone isnt at the top of everyones lists when it comes to mental health but from experience , it really helps . reddit is a really good place to get your emotions out mate . there are lots of people on here with the same problems you ' re going through and we ' re trying to overcome it together . we ' re here for you , mate .

11. not eat too much salt and get better sleep . sometimes a good adaptogen helps to keep the serotonin flowing , like rhodiola rosea . all in all it ' s usually an atrophied muscle you have to exercise . just like how people are full of shit when they say they can ' t run , focusing , socializing or managing can be learned because the brain is very plastic . just stick to subjects you enjoy and work to empathize with other people and listen to their stories . some people are simply boring or self centered , but there are also a lot of interesting people out there . like good books , you have to seek them out , and stick to being around them and then over time socializing because rewarding because there is commonality between you and the person you found . indeed , the beginning requires getting out of your comfort zone and making the effort . it is so worth it though .
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

12. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

13. thank you for spending the time with your child . i wish my parents didn  t work so hard all the time because i could never see them . trust me , they  ll be grateful you were there for them because not a lot of parents are . i wish more people would spend more time with their children because it  s very important to their development . she  ll only be in your hair for so much longer . keep up the good work !
   (ID: 74d9c413c2cf59d223d7510b599edf6b6b1df3a2)

14. hey , first off , i wanna thank you for being real with how you feel . and congrats to losing 90lbs , that ' s absolutley insane ! the first thing i thought of was the concept of " stinkin thinkin " and how our mind sometimes plays sick games on us by saying we are " not good enough " in reference to tinder , , , anyone can make a profile so why would you deny yourself the opportunity to have one if you want one and try it . you may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome . but it starts with you making one and knowing that if others can have it , you can too . also youre so young that you can bounce outta this mindset . first i would take your chance on the girl you want . ask her to the gym or something , and if that doesnt work , go in on the tinder and try what have you got to lose ? nothin , but a mindset that needs updated . im sorry if thats harsh because i do empathize feeling that way , because ive been there but ive found the way out too by putting one foot in front of the other and takin that chance with a girl . i believe in you bruddah

15. sounds like she  s too shallow to understand your pov and what you  ve been through . personally , that trait alone could make or break a relationship for me .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

16. makes me tear up with joy , i see what success you have and i want it . this is a motivating post for me as well as a celebratory one for the community and you major congrats on this one ! iwndwyt
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

17. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

18. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

19. compromise . you need to find a way for both of you to get a little of what you want . often time teenagers are completely oblivious to what they really need as support and same goes for parents not knowing where an appropriate line should be drawn usually out of fear or anxiety for their child  s well being you may see improvement if you take on more responsibility around the home or in the community  but that  s only a vague suggestion because i have no idea about your specific circumstances .

20. yes she is very close to her stepmother . you asked about our relationship , we have been in a de facto relationship for about digit . digit years now . i have been doing what i can to comfort her and be there for her . i took her out to lunch today i actually wrote this post on the drive home to take her mind off of things and get out of the house . at the moment she is ok then bursts into tears at random times so all i can do is hug her , tell her i love her and let her cry it out . when she was told she cried and then asked to be left alone for a while so if she needs some space i think she will tell me . thank you for the advice , there is a lot there to take in so i will have to read it a few times . her stepmother still might pull through and beat it , but all we can do at this stage is hope for the best . thank you again for helping me understand and giving me pointers on how to approach this .
