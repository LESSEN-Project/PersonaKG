16. of course my argument makes sense so long as you think about it properly . the effective skill of your team lowers when someone is simply feeding , or their focus blinded by anger . getting tilted and becoming unable to play your best handicaps you and your team , effectively lowering the skill of that player .  and you can ' t control soccer or football in that regard because people who throw in those games get permanently banned from the league yeah , and the exact same thing happens in professional dota digit . another similarity between dota digit and football  soccer is that you don ' t get permanently banned from throwing games just by playing casual matches with randoms .
