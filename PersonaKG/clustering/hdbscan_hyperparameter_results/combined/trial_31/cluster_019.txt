1. that wasn  t me who said that lol . i played the shit out of the first destiny . every dlc , did every raid , all of it . the game is absolute shit . i understand that that  s my opinion , but i truly do not get how people like that game . didn  t even waste my time buying the second one . so disappointing that bungie abandoned halo for this garbage

2. so the fuck what if i don ' t have more time to dedicate to something that didn ' t grab my attention ? why do you feel the need to defend a game or convert people to be fans of it ? that kind of attitude is just annoying . if you want to convince me it ' s good , tell me what is so amazing about it oh and why are you talking about the witcher ? that game was okay , nothing special . .

3. no mans sky always were a good game . you suckers just say it is  was bad because the creator overhyped it and lied about some features . blame the creator . not . the . creation . thats not just about nms , its about every fucking thing  your wife died giving birth to your child ? blame yourself for making her pregnant or dont blame anyone thats just one example . and also the game became really good after those updates . fuck you . haters gonna hate .  digit

4. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

5. op makes claim using vague terms , gets told to define term , provides definition , gets argued with or laughed at for mistaken assumptions . that ' s usually how things work around here . just substituting ' circlejerk ' for ' god ' or ' soul ' or ' spiritual ' or whatever the hell else . tell me exactly what you mean by it and i ' ll tell you what you have wrong . tl  dr whoosh

6. i completely agree . it ' s always the first game i let new players try out . everyone loves it . it ' s also the game i that i first tried that convinced me to get the vive . such a great vr experience .

7. first off bud , i  ve played since alpha . secondly i didn  t say anything was over powered , you do know how to read don  t you ? they asked what we thought was the best character offensively , it  s an opinionated post , the  competitive  aspect of the subreddit has nothing to do with options or thoughts . your assumptions and negative responses are the exact reason this game is dying .

8. lol , ok ok . i ' ll stop . dude , for you own sanity . realise that this is a shitpost . my account is a shitpost account . you are arguing with me on a heavily down voted thread that almost no one will ever see . look in the mirror , remind yourself that you are a human being that doesn ' t need to get upset about idiots on the internet that are clearly doing stuff to get a rise out others . cause dude . it ' s not ever gonna stop . get used to it .

9. that hs nothing to do with it . nice try though . the game had no real progression . it felt like a waste of time to me . hey look everybody ! someone who is a crybaby because someone has an opinion on reddit !

10. i have not played the first game . but i hear the second one is a massive improvement over the second one . it has gotten some pretty nice reviews .
   (ID: a70e276355baaea2f732281343d3f63ea5d96365)

11. its hilarous that this guy got downvoted for pointing out the truth . but , when you ' re drinking the bungie kool  aid . i guess you don ' t want to hear that .
