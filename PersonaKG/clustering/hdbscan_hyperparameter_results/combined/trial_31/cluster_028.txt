   (ID: 3fb1292a0bd26711d797fe1a61e6229794c21b68)

9. oh come on . we all know that  s not true
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

10. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

11. huh ? i did not say that . were you answering to a deleted comment ?
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

12. i add comments instead of editing , because i doubt people will re  read my comment . worried , maybe not , but you were the one who wouldn ' t take my word for it . sources dont usually help people that already have their minds made up .
   (ID: d8014467041b98317d9f1dec2b0dae4ff9405b91)

13. lets take a moment to appreciate how much you assumed i implied from my accusations of your implications . have fun with your lesson in reading into things
