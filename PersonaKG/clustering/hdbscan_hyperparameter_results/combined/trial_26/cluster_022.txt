7. i think it ' s normal that he should be the last one to leave the ship because the other are under his responsable si obviously he has a big big risk to go down with the ship . but the tradition of going down with it just for the principle just by honor or symbolism or whatever is really weird and stupid to my opinion but yes the valors in our time are very different than the ones at the time of the tradition so .
   (ID: a74790331386859adbbd886bd045a7391e95948c)

8. i think you are an upstanding member of a higher functioning society . i agree with you on all points . and i greatly appreciate that you have replied to people disagreeing with you . it ' s just a shame that none seems open minded to it .
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

9. some would argue if a company has interviewers who get off on asking overly technical questions you ' d be better off not working there . just something to think when you choose to grill people with random unrelated  to  work algorithm questions .

10. i ' m talking about pre flight model changes fw digit which was my first case which used to lock up 400kph and up i do have internet it ' s the fact that the closest servers are in japan that ' s bad also just reading your name and this post makes me think that you should play with

11. surely there are other avenues to take this information . you reported it to the police department of which luke murray is assigned ? nothing seems to have been done ? take it to another department , go get legal advice , take it to a lawyer , any of these options are better than posting it on reddit , and if this turns out to be a false report then you are committing an act of defamation . i ' m not doubting your honesty , just think you should find another means of having the law look at this accusation .
   (ID: 9e8a44f7c55ebce4785906436a033b33a1ccb949)

   (ID: c5e877ff3be5d3571f5fe899f55887a6f608ee98)

15. the digit year old can use a full size cue i would say . i dont think the set is a bad idea considering how young it seems your youngest is . just dont expect them to be great quality
   (ID: 6eb8259d7d6b7ae101dda44ceaaf3b9edaab4fad)

16. not a jab at you op . i just don  t think it  s a fat shaming movie . more anti  costco  amazon  lazy  consumerism  idiocracy
   (ID: dd0e84182036131d3b7cbc9bcb07384502b3c1a8)

17. that ' s just statistics at work . if you have ever even glanced at the numbers to see how many planets are around how many stars around how many galaxies then the idea of any single phenomenon occurring once and only once becomes so unlikely it ' s borderline insane not to think there is life out there .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

18. it ' s not really shepard anymore , the shepard ai has much bigger priorities than talking to an old crew now . everyone would think he just died during the crucible firing .
