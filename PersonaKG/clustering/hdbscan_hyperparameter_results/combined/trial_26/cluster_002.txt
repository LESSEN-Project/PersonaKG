5. that  s not how it works , his powers are not brutal force , he has the powers to control everything that happened in the past , he is pretty much thanos with complete gauntlet or even stronger , he would  uncreate  pretty much anyone in any universe just with his thought . the only reason he couldn  t end everything in bleach is because he is too big of a ball of pride and protagonism

6. coming from a girl who everyone assumed my whole life as " rich " sometimes it ' s not actual individuals that hold money , it ' s the family . my family has money , but they don ' t pay my bills . the only expensive jewelry i ever have received family bought  gifts  which is just likes purses , scarfs , etc . so she may be struggling just as hard as you are , her struggle just may look a lot more stylish thanks to her family . just a thought ! btw  i dont date " rich guys " because digit  are jerks so she could also feel that way !

14. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .
   (ID: b3497f72ed4462f0414951db6d9ee7aa4004b515)
