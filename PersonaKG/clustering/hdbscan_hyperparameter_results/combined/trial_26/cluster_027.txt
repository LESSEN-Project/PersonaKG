6. i get what you mean . i  d say it  s the general misconception that if you  re jewish you support israel and that if your anti  israel you  re an anti  semite . it just that the two are paired together unsurprising very often . i know plenty of jews who are anti  israel at least in its current state , it  s just the misconception that makes it seem the way you describe .

10. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show
