1. why did you take the time to question it ? were you genuinely curious or were you just complaining  either to degrade me or for the attention of strangers ?
   (ID: eab4b13c25e8e05018f7cb7159b0e36614341438)

2. what the hell happened to jeff ' s face ? did he get plastic surgery or is it just extra make up ?

   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

6. saw dogs getting killed for food . it wasn ' t even an ethical kind of kill , they just beat the dogs until they stopped whining . the dogs did even fight back btw , it ' s also on youtube
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

7. not a comment , but an entire askreddit thread . it was about creepy , real life crime stories it was on the top page a few days ago . someone in the comments did some digging and found the exact same askreddit question from a few years ago , with the exact same question and exact same answers for top comments , just under different names .
   (ID: afb250d177d47ce6467dfa3414d91e9e07eec6c4)

8. i ' m french and lots consider that we won the ww2 because the uk and the us did and they were on our side but actually . they just don ' t accept losing haha
   (ID: a74790331386859adbbd886bd045a7391e95948c)

9. but reincarnation is a supernatural occurrence that ' s only based in religion . the closest to what you are describing is jainism . it ' s still a religion though . i ' m just busting your chops though . all great fictional stories use selective liberties with facts . don ' t let my nitpicking screw with your story ideas . if all authors did that nothing would get written .
   (ID: 25ac51284c94eb6c58e189bbefc7f2bb9bb9e1b5)

10. did you read what you just typed ? if something has low odds and it happens it is generally considered lucky . doesn ' t always have to be , for example , two digit stars to be lucky . edit  yes i ' m aware that you could also be unlucky in this same manner . but i would not consider this to be unlucky .
   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

11. makes sense . just funny how all ' s i did was make an observation which is most likely correct and instead of either acknowledging it , or moving on , they have to be so salty for some reason .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

12. did anyone else read in their head the way i just did ?
   (ID: 7c7d6a809e77ab08fc65ee63a1ab44c11bd6ab7f)

13. well here is where you went wrong . you jumped into water with sharks ! what else did you expect ? these arent dogs , cats , or any other animal human have domesticated . this shouldn ' t be news , just a reminder if you take a risk expect to get bit .
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

14. well . did i ever mention it had to be something out of sci  fi ? kaijus ? zerg leviathan ? maybe , just maybe , a superhero ?
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

15. why did you delete your post ? why are you doing the exact same thing you just called the op out for ?
   (ID: a4eb94a9fe8ebabb780c319cc7d3f552eb79625e)

16. " why did i just type this incoherent bullshit , and why can ' t i stop myself from posting it "
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

17. fair enough . i was just trying to follow the guide i listed . he says wind lizardman is good for dots , which i ' m lacking in . my acasis isn ' t fully skilled up and doesn ' t have great accuracy to land her dots but i did get her third skill level ' d up which was great .
   (ID: bd951a475ac46323d867ac35ccf0cb4b3e756f83)

18. " alex what the fuck are you doing " " did you just cum in your sister  " " tiffany is not on birth control " " lexi do you ever shut the fuck up " " they ' re just kids "
   (ID: db1ffea2a957f19bfc0fffdbd89a6d65be91fd5c)

19. hahaha . i did this at work , simply tried to force a fart that wasn ' t a fart . ended up running home and yelling to my roommates " omg i literally just shat myself " . then i walk into my room and see my landlord showing some of my friends the house .
   (ID: 5d6cecafd26473d96b39b973965364f09d4d41f1)

20. most of the time the  sass  is unintentional and  talking back  is often just asking for clarification about what i actually did wrong and trying to explain my point of view .
