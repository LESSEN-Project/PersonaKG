2. understanding you can laugh at dick jokes all you want while being mature in my opinion , but if dont understand something and your trying to argue it , you are highly immature . as well as knowing when a dick joke or anything else considered " immature " would be a very bad idea ex  any serious situation my point is , you can be immature , as long as you know when you should and shouldn ' t

9. okay , but that  s not a valid sample . results will be purely anecdotal . you may want to point that out to your teach so they know you  re aware of the faults and limitations . also , the same study found that about digit percent of shower water is from the hot water source . and if your calculating enviro footprints , don  t forget about all the embedded energy in water , both hot and cold .

   (ID: 75ca79d6c5cfc50533ff56cde25edfb593ae8568)

12. yes , while most of the comments i ' m reading are asking about what happened to the mice , this is what i want to know ! . how in the hell do you get mice in your backpack ? and how is it in there long enough to have three baby mice ?

14. you know there are free hotlines if you want to talk right ?
   (ID: 02cf76dae1fda8da1d2e5bbbaeb0da5a77cb6e3e)

15. the connections you make can be more important than the things you learn in the classroom . so if there are clubs and internships related to the job you want do them . look for jobs that have skills related to what you want to do , or can at least sell to your future employer . the worst ? you find out you hate what you are going into but can change to something else before you are too invested ! the best ? valuable connections that will help you get where you want to go . remember , its not what you know its who you know .
