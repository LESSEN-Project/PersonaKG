1. oneshot . its an undertale like game , but would be even better only if it had gameplay other than speaking with npcs
   (ID: a0849f7d6d0829c8bb5f820aa9bf63584c7471df)

2. well , in capitalism there is this theory that the only things there are valuable are things that can be monetized . youtube is trying to remain profitable so it wants you to update to red so you can invest in services . in order to keep many of the channels running you simply need to donate or watch a bunch of commercials .
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

   (ID: 0ddaeffad510fe540496c0e0b97a1a85b13282eb)

5. i don  t think people understand this . it  s important to know life is gonna change nothing will ever he permanent , idc what you say it will never be , so people need to learn how to push through tough times . mourning for a few days is good but you have to start grasping yourself after that as if not you will never learn to accept what happened and move on to a extent where it doesn  t affect your day to day living , i can say what a joke i was at digit i was so fucked up that i just coped with my friend being in coma with getting more fucked up . but idk how i would feel if she never woke up or etc , . , . i probably would not be talking to you rn if she hadn  t as i would never did a digit and just killed myself
   (ID: 4422c1db26c9be5bec35694a448a490c2761d985)

   (ID: 20e44d996799f8bb3fe89546818050bf021f4be9)

8. regardless if he comes back in my lifetime or not i  ll still follow and believe in him til the day i die . there was just no reason that the bible was persevered and protected for digit  digit years . there was something about it that made more special than every other book ever written . there was something about it that millions and millions of people died for it through out history . there  s a reason that it  s still here today and now there  s digit billion copies of the bible . we wouldn  t even be where we are today if it wasn  t for the bible . the bible was a major key of history and how everything came to be . the books in the old testament was written digit  digit years before jesus and there  s been many times that they even mentioned of his coming . if you don  t mind taking sometime out of your day to watch this video , that  d be great there  s more hidden meaning in the bible than what  s seen .
   (ID: f8dc0ff928f07f3c544894b03ad92f5944e13321)

9. i have no friends and i am not in a relationship . my parents will inevitably die so yeah , forever .
   (ID: 9d1b3fafafa63d6ec9712c98a0c16b4cc697d112)

10. at my school we had to say goodbye to a teacher . in front of as all a student says something that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . everyone is like " what ? " and he keeps going on . for a good digit  digit minutes . even the teacher is trying not to cringe at the silence and confusion

   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

12. oh so you were one of those " fit fats " i read about on the internet only . you dont think your cardio suffered or your joints , knees in particular wouldnt have been stressed less , or whatever sport you were playing you could have played better if you lost digit  pounds ? you are delusional to think it didnt stress your body at all no matter how young and " active " you were .
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

13. i think people should be able to like what they like whether it ' s elvis or iggy azalea . i personally like a lot of different kinds of music and there ' s some i just don ' t like but i don ' t care really what other people listen to . the only thing i have a problem with is blatant racism or things of that sort .
   (ID: 7026695d5469f9ac5987bd602ce0be29968523db)

   (ID: 6692d386ab188df76448f18f0e9d59c1e6d88c50)

15. do i see a new post about sharing netflix account everyday or is it the same person ? it  s a good idea digit  digit  digit per head thing but i would say try someone from your friend circle .
   (ID: 5186a4f234c22a2668969b75a1a54616526c2ee4)

16. i made the mistake of posting to  relationships and someone ' s response was basically " well there are digit sides to this story , we aren ' t getting the whole picture here " . yes you fucker i know that , but you ' re hearing my side , so work with it and give me a real answer .
   (ID: d1e274dbfcf8ed1af55bb50c57e00046b961b6fd)

17. yeah kids can be annoying but the way you describe your daughter is horrible .
   (ID: 4bddcbadec311f472e8b62614b7394e14eb1d7ac)

18. i have several friends in that exact boat , and i ' m functionally in a similar one right now . i tell my mom that people my age understand the concept of orientation well enough that saying you ' re gay does not necessarily entail that you have gay sex . like they might at first assume otherwise , but it ' s pretty easy for the average non  christian my age to grasp the basic concept of a celibate gay christian . but she and others seem to just look at it as , " if you say you ' re gay , that definitely means you are actively seeking out butt sex "
   (ID: 80ae19b9093d92fad153af508f37fcd7cd9340ec)

19. I own a night terror.
   (ID: 3158d7c63f10e871a80f147fb47725c8714163c7)
