7. that doesn ' t prove your point . if i fit it into my macros and am still physically active there ' s nothing wrong with it . it ' s not like i ' m loading up a potato chip sandwich every day and shoving it in my gullet while i watch tv . on the infrequent occasion that i decide to make a sandwich , i ' m gonna put some potato chips on that mofo . you ' re acting as if any human that decides to consume an item that ' s not healthy is suddenly the fattest of the fat and the highest of the stoners . that ' s just ignorant .

17. i wasn ' t suggesting she get an elder scroll to do it . i was simply saying that there could be means of doing so that we aren ' t aware of , just like how the dragonborn is able to find a way to take down alduin and the other dragons .

19. kind request to my fellow muppets when posting a link to a tweet or instagram post or whatever could you please copy paste what was actually written in quotes ? just in case it gets deleted like it happened in the past days but also cuz my browser is a cunt sometimes and doesn ' t let me open twitter . thanks and muppet on .
   (ID: 5ea29f01c8cdade4f178fd446d00647edc5fc70e)

20. they why has the whole logo changed at the top of box changed ? marvel bobble heads do not change like this . for example , you have the punisher funko pop . there are a few different versions . the marvel logo remains the same , but they just put the different version in in brackets by the name . ie ' the punisher thunderbolts '
