   (ID: a2ca7f9e05e83928ce894848f01290dbcd0f654e)

3. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

6. ya i want to have sex . not hurt anyone just use their mortal vessal to accept my genetic material and have hehim make a decent chunk of change for a few moments of his  her time . and that way theyd be regularly tested and deemed fit for service . untill they have to " get service " so to speak , then they take some time off till they ' re ready again if they so chose .
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)

8. this question always surprises me . women want what men want according to personal preference . in other words  just don ' t be a dick . both genders , duh . no one cares about your stupidly expensive tricked out car , or if you ' re willing to wear a party dress in january . its dumb . just be people ! holy shit , i ' m frustrated now !

9. what you really want to do is find out what exactly is the source of your back pain . it could be a rib out of place , a rotated hip , twisted tailbone , bulging disc , etc . then you can start exercises to target those . if it ' s just generic sore muscles , then you would benefit from strength training to keep those muscles in shape .

10. " you can have whatever you want " , that means they ' re just buying friendship

11. you may want to play around with this idea  these gems are obviously powerful . there are many creatures in the world that want that power for their own ends , or simply just to acquire it for themselves . a powerful gem will attract interest from some people and creatures . a group of them being collected and held in the same area will attract them like a magnet . so just because your pc ' s are looking for them , doesn ' t mean there isn ' t someones else too .
   (ID: c018255fd73fced873eb4897821cd82620ba8fe2)

12. why are you assuming that it ' s fear that keeps guys from popping the question ? some guys just don ' t want what you have .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

16. what do you want ? answer that first even just to yourself and then it will be clearer what you should do . i want hugh jackman to come over to my house and rub me with oil and roger me senseless . i can want all i want  nothing wrong with wanting . it is just that what we want is not always going to happen .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

17. yta , sorry to burst your bubble , but you can ' t make someone do anything to you . if she doesn ' t want to have sex , she doesn ' t . and making her give you a bj just fucked it up even more .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)
