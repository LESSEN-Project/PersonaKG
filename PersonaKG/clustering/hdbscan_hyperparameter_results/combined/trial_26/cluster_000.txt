1. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

2. my parents are abusive shits . i hope they die already be .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

   (ID: 5a01af4f9721facf5be110d8e134d4c4da020088)

4. pve upscaleds i ' m all for everyone wanting to try wvw but i really , really , really hope they are playing to win rather than playing for the achievement  loot  xp and karma train . i have seen people running back and leaving the zerg in the middle of a siege  clash just to pick  up a gaddam loot bag left behind .
   (ID: 261413214c13676b8aee2ce20a47107c4ccfe6b8)

8. is it later yet ? thanks ! i don ' t have experience trying those so i can ' t really speak to how easy or hard they are to get . thankfully i haven ' t needed to , and i hope it stays that way .
   (ID: 99339abeb32b696e2ac12139001f76ebf63d0868)

9. i ' m not really comfortable telling too much . i hope that ' s understandable . privacy means a lot to me and it ' s really going to be his story to tell someday , if he decides to do so .
   (ID: 1293e72aa7301baf0ecb3a2509e46cdcca834cd9)

10. i guess it really depends on the location . some places may be way worse and others way better . best we can hope for is swift rollout of the new maps .
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

   (ID: 18cbf1c145fcc3d10b99255dd1de8fb616ecb38f)

13. fuck me ! i really hope he was actually doing something else in the video to warrant this . either way it ' s definitely a political thing trying to look good to the muslim community . bet you after awhile they will drop charges while under the radar .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

14. i will not be crossing the picket line and hope my friends and family choose the same . good luck to the workers , we ' re behind you digit  .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

15. i hope she shocks the hell out of you and knows sign language im in college learning it and it is one of the best things ive ever done for myself . hearing aids ideally arent a big deal but im curious so i wonder , do you have photos of you wearing them ?
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

16. i agree . i hope other moms learn to trust their gut or at least ask for a second opinion . it ' s such a hard thing to process in the moment .
   (ID: ca13e283de9a99b9eb1cf4f68eed33eccff74e35)

17. i agree with this . it is impossible to tell someone how they should feel about themselves . but for whatever it ' s worth let me say i imagine you make most men horny . i hope you get what you need from the labiaplasty .
   (ID: 05dea10a374f0f09c767062f0a3d0b51b6d20b9d)

18. religion will always be relevant no matter how smart we become or how advanced our science and technology become because that doesn ' t matter to people who turn to religion as a moral compass . religion provides some sort of hope for those living in hard times as well . obviously , large portions of mainstream religions today are pretty fucked up , but religion changes . so that ' s my answer without resorting to reddit sarcasm and typical " hurr durr religioius people stupid " answers . i ' m not religious , btw
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

19. had pretty much the same experience on switch with the new update and it ' s especially infuriating that i can ' t unlock the gunslinger due to crashing and bugs almost unlocked him twice as well . game crashes each floor when trying to unlock the gunslinger and carrot blasphemy ' s hitbox seems to be massive when i ' m facing left . hope they fix this stuff soon although i don ' t mind having a massive hitbox for blasphemy even if it is a bug .
   (ID: 7df89b558f49c9f710c5f928f61dae67f52229c7)

20. i hope someone shoryuken ' s some sense into this kid
