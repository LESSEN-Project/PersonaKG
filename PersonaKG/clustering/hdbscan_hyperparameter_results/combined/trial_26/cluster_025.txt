   (ID: 419b67e0e2cdcb7bd8ea9a89d34d0747a1f5f620)

   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

   (ID: e3f34e146ce06ba2b5fc5a249c73494f93f56e86)

   (ID: b544676f77b629fef343fb67689e28beb14aad3a)

   (ID: f042043ff04e1f2bd28d7c34b7937eb8bf31c76e)

10. you can tell them all the reasons that you personally like it but at the end of the day that  s your opinion . many people think it  s a pointless holiday myself included and my mind wouldn  t be changed from one person telling me the reasons they like it i don  t think .
   (ID: 726d5aaac9472ccdcb64345cd6d082bee4eae6fa)

11. i think , this is woooosh inside of woooosh , cuz that comment looks like another joke . i mean , that dude seems to understand the irony and he replies it with another irony , because it ' s obvious that digit hours in settings is either softwaregore or some development stuff
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

12. no way . i don ' t think i ' d like to be a kid in this day and age . potentially everything i do would be saved for posterity somewhere on the internet
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

14. cause trump would think of funny names for them like " beto the creepo " and " bad touch biden , " steal their thunder at every turn and make it hard to take them seriously . p . s . i didnt bother thinking up a name for bernie because hes too old to make it to digit .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

   (ID: 9c2d2fde31927b8cc3bc419049de8844ca720cb9)

18. does this make me a terrible person if i think i might have done something like this before ?
   (ID: 9fc60fbaff4001c6926f17d34c80b626c8cc5777)

19. i  m trying to word this carefully and please tell me if i get it wrong . do you think your family would be more sad if they felt like you couldn  t come to them ? they would probably find out eventually and then wonder what they could have done better . if your worried about your family i would think of that . sorry if this is worded wrong .
   (ID: 09ceeb62f2a165a9c38283d43984e8e6f6f5580e)
