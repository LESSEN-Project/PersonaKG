9. it depends on the quality of us and international intelligence . it ' s clear that we aren ' t sure exactly where all their military sites are , making it more difficult . either way international powers could defeat the army i imagine relatively quickly , as despite large numbers of military personnel in the nk army they lack basic supplies  equipment . they could of course do a lot of damage to south korea with their artillery , and possibly conventional forces the latter is unclear .
