1. long ass post but i ' ve read every single word of it . congrats on your successful transformation . leave while you can . you are still young and have a long way ahead of you . i really hate manipulative person and hope you find a better person . but i would suggest telling her about the divorce in advance if you don ' t want to hurt her too bad but even then , you wouldn ' t know what type of shit she ' ll pull . it ' s going to get better from now !

2. honestly yeah i think you ' re kind of an asshole . men are always much more likely to leave their significant others due to illness  here we go , another example of it . like the girl you ' re meant to love could have something terribly wrong with her and you ' re out here just thinking about yourself and any future  key word future  kids ? come on dude . if you do break up with her because of this , i want you to look her dead in the eye and say " i can ' t deal with you being sick , and that ' s why i ' m leaving you "

3. nta  i mean it is a dick move to break up over text that way especially while someone  s deployed . however , i don  t think that matters given that he was an abuser and a deployment would give you a chance to leave him without him reacting violently , not letting you , etc . his reaction of threatening to hunt you down says everything about him , what  s he going to do ? beat you ? kill you ? you don  t need such a horrible man in your life . maybe it  d have been more respectful to do it over video or phone i guess but that also just would have opened you to more abusive traumatizing behavior from him , probably would have been worse to hear it in those ways rather than text anyway . i  m sorry for what you  ve gone thru and the decisions you  ve had to make here . as for your friend , does she know how he  s treated you ?

4. thank you . i don ' t blame myself in a way that isn ' t realistic . i blame myself for not being aware of the warning signs of what happened to me . that ' s about the extent . i don ' t harbor any unhealthy emotions and though i suffer mildly from ptsd i am conscious enough to work on my issues . with that being said . yes , i am still with my boyfriend . the truth of the matter is that he simply isn ' t emotionally mature enough to understand the depths of what had happened . i did threaten to break up with him . the first couple of times he said it to me i didn ' t stand up for myself . i don ' t know why . but the last time he said it i really stuck it to him . i realized that if he thinks this way i can ' t possibly marry someone who will think like that and i told him that . i also told him i will happily leave because i know i wouldn ' t be suffering a loss if that ' s the way he is thinking . for the first time in all the time i have known him he stopped and gave me a very heart felt apology taking accountability for his lack of sympathy and understanding . quite frankly , a lot of other things were said . but it was true and i know he meant it . this is still a red flag for me . if i am suffering from something in the future , am i going to have to be the one to walk him through it too ? just because i am more emotionally equipped to handle ? he ' s not a horrible person . but he is selfish in his thinking . and he is emotionally sheltered . after digit years i am starting to wonder if i want to be the one who does all of the picking up .

5. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .

6. bro you ' re only digit fucking years old . you honestly wanna keep investing yourself into a relationship where your needs aren ' t met ? especially really important needs . what ' s the point of being in a pretty much sexless relationship so young ? that ' s not supposed to happen for at least another digit year ' s . most relationships in your teenage and early adulthood never last forever , and they ' re not supposed to . what are you getting out of this relationship ? you ' ve tried talking to her and it doesn ' t seem like she ' s interested in helping solve this problem . i know it ' s hard and break ups suck , but your feelings do matter and are important . staying in a relationship that doesn ' t satisfy you is fucking stupid and a waste of time . and your time is important . find someone that wants the same things you do , and cares enough to actually try to fix issues you two have . you might be single for awhile in the beginning , which could do you some good . but you ' ll likely be happier than you are right now .

7. should i tell her ?
   (ID: 6212c082850f067a67618ad2a3b9f8ed336590f4)

8. you ' re not doing anything wrong . relationships just kind of happen . you don ' t need to do anything differently . one night you might find you slipped on a kiss and be with someone for a good while . keep doing your own thing and girls will take notice .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

9. you did the right thing for you . your ex sounds immature and there is a good chance he has cheated plenty himself and that ' s why he is so nonchalant about it . his friend is the one who did something wrong . it isn ' t on you to keep his secrets . if you were in that situation you would want to be told , i ' m sure . let him buy you a ticket home . call your people and let them know you are coming back . this just saved you from a miserable life with a selfish jerk .

10. i can  t believe i just read that whole book you just wrote lol . but look i can tell you immediately why you don  t wanna give him a chance . bc you don  t like him . period . you just see him as a friend . you never even thought about dating him til your family said something . you never mention having some chemistry or any kind of feelings for him . and that  s ok . yea he sounds like a great guy but if you don  t feel a connection with him or get all giggle with him i don  t think it  s gonna work out . the best part of a relationship is the honey moon stage . i mean you could give him a chance but don  t get all stressed about it . dating is suppose to be fun . especially around our age . goodluck op

11. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path

12. oof , as a woman i suggest you not to spoil women that much , some of us get used to get all we want and then it ' s really hard to get on track again . not my case , i made clear to my boyfriend we are equal and he can count on me as much as i can count on him . i suggest you to talk to her and give her an ultimatum , you should take care of her but she ' s abusing it and not thanking what you do for her . obviously you need to change this , and don ' t have any kids for now , neither more pets or expenses . that wouldn ' t be good for the kids or you .

13. i don ' t think the issue here is that you asked for his last name . maybe you should just take his words at face value  that it ' s taken so long to actually meet up , that he ' s lost interest . but to answer your question  i personally don ' t usually like to give out my full name to someone before meeting them because of social media stalking . i mean it ' d be pretty hard for anyone to stalk me anyways because i don ' t use my full name anywhere besides facebook and my setting for that is pretty restricted , but still . also why did you feel the need to know his full name anyways ?

14. you have the right to be upset or angry , or any other emotion you are having right now . your wife needs to know exactly how you feel and take ownership for causing it your wife should be willing to do anything for you that would help you build that trust back up . no more expectations of privacy , no more hidden anything in her life . she needs to be an open book . look at her bank account , check her on  line presence , monitor her calls , get all of her passwords , and  or whatever you feel is needed . then you need to work on regaining that trust . if this is going to be a life sentence for her , then end the marriage now . you need to work toward her having privacy again some day . just not right now . there is no such thing as too much communication in smarriage .

15. it does take a lot of courage , but you have it in you . otherwise you wouldn ' t have made this post ! just know you ' re not alone . there ' s a whole community here that supports you . here ' s maybe an odd idea  instead of only looking at body types that you would want for yourself , try checking out all sorts of people with different body types . big , little , thick , thin . don ' t judge , just accept them for what and who they are . then after a time , try to find little things you appreciate in each one . maybe it ' ll help broaden your horizons a little , instead of being so focused on what you covet right now .

16. i know you guys are gonna tell not be with someone who i can ' t trust you ' re goddamn right .  but hear me out . maybe we ' re just doing something wrong ? mmmm nope . you shouldn ' t date someone you can ' t trust .  i just wanna fucking know who she ' s talking to lol . bit controlling but okay . ask her if its that big of a deal .

17. just to get his expectations in check  i ' ve been out for digit . digit years and i ' m no where near t . take it slow . best way to support him is what you ' re doing ! show him you care and teach him these little male things . using the right name and pronouns is also super important . beyond that , he ' s just gotta learn to be patient and remember that we ' ll all get there eventually

18. she invited you to her house , showered while you were there and was willing to let you see her in just a towel ? i think you missed some signals , buddy .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

19. yeah that ' s ridiculous . you ' ve been dating for less than a month and she constantly pesters you ! like jeez when did she start , week digit ? you ' re nta in this situation , i think a sit down discussion about it is definitely needed tho
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

20. if you  re on a break it means you  re not together at the moment , right ? if you  re expected to continue to be faithful then i feel like instead if a break it  s better to work through things as a couple . i guess i don  t really get the idea of a  break  that  s not a break  up in a relationship . anyway , be transparent with her if the time comes that you discuss getting back together .
