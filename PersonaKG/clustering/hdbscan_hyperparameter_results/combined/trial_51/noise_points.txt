1. i would love to see a show similar to origin that explores amuro ' s experiences during the war in more detail . maybe a loose remake of digit ?
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

2. i ' m not sure how it is where you live but digit  digit people i meet on a daily basis are always rude assholes . like it could be small shit like not holding a door , not saying thanks after i bless a sneeze , shoving me out of the way on the bus just to get a better seat , purposely causing trouble with a waitress to get the manager involved  laughing at it . seeing this type of shit everyday really stacks up on my mind . i start wondering if it ' s worth being nice to people when most of others i see , really don ' t fucking care  perhaps my life would be way easier if i acted the way they did . but i do my best not to because it ' s the right thing to do . sometimes i meet that digit  digit who does things the way i would go about it , like helping a stranger lift their luggage on a train , running to catch a door for an elderly , helping a friend by giving them a ride someplace just to help out , etc . and those people remind me why being kind isn ' t a waste . since they can do it everyday , so can i . but you ' re welcome to think i ' m a narcissistic asshole for misinterpreting my comment . i ' m still going to try to help people anyway i can .
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

3. basically any truck commercial is ridiculous . especially the one with martin luther king , jr . speaking in the background . i could not believe dodge actually thought that was a good idea .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

4. i don ' t really see how you weren ' t supportive of her . she seemed to make her mind up on plenty of issues without you and you ' ve tried to approach them all in a logical way . also she purposeful tries to do things that hurt you ? that ' s unsupportive . you might have to let her go . i think it ' ll be better for both of you .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

5. this is exactly how my thought process is .
   (ID: 78a7be65b9d2e7cebf18280c07d4f44e6f2b3417)

6. i suppose it ' s the same in every country , you need to be relatively educated and have an okay job . i guess the problem with britian is that whatever the reasons you don ' t have these . if you don ' t your pretty much left to rot . there is a very large underclass here who have no opportunities and for them life is a real struggle .
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

7. i forgot to mention you should also get the map that provide the ability limit breaker . i forget the name but it has a picture of ike .

   (ID: e3f34e146ce06ba2b5fc5a249c73494f93f56e86)

9. uuhhh no . you ' re using that word , but i don ' t think you know what it means . let me guess  you ' ve seen that word thrown around in the news lately and you decided to give it a try ? here , let me spell this out for you . i ' m literally not supporting a pedophile protection agency , nor am i falling for a ridiculous myth of a magical sky wizard . soooooo nice try , dimwit . way to look like a fucking moron using words you ' re clueless about .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

   (ID: d048a45810866f7b853972f50c2c2746bc339a21)

13. i haven ' t seen this week ' s walking dead yet , but in that particular example from what i ' ve seen , it ' s treated as something that ' s in people ' s minds . that ' s realistic and entirely valid . it ' s when they start actually showing afterlives and such that bothers me . lost went too far for me . there have been a few others but none are coming to mind .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

14. i like to solve problems . if someone complains about something to me , i ' m ready to jump in and fix it . apparently , people enjoy the act of complaining , and me leaping in to correct the issue startles them or something . i ' ve had people even tell me , " i don ' t want your help , i just want you to listen " . it ' s really difficult for me to just let people whine .
   (ID: 649605988d72e34fdcf0c170b6b9fa959a7d483e)

15. wow ! there are no words i can say . i can ' t even imagine how hard she must have hurt you to cause that kind of damage . there are other options to be a good mom . you can adopt for example . i know it ' s not the same as having your own child . do you have any siblings ? maybe you can be the coolest aunt on the planet . i really hope you ' re able to get a second opinion and that you find out that you can one day have kids . maybe this doctor is wrong .
   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

16. is it normal for your friends to copy you ? lol just kidding . imitation it is said , is the most sincere form of flattery
   (ID: a6171234e1a4ec65a39ad55aa0aa058eb98dff83)

17. do girls think of boys the way we think of them ? like if a girl hears someone on reddit is boy checks for photo posts or tried to imagine  what they look like .
   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

18. yesyesyesyesyesyeeeeeeeesssssss ! i have yet to watch oldboy but have heard good things about it . i can handle foreign films haha
   (ID: 920ba0628cbea5588ecca4c8ba7f80b411ff70ef)

19. info depends on how your relationship with your friend is like if this happend with me and my friends , i wouldn ' t feel guilt . it ' d be hilarious because that ' s the kind of relationship me have . we fuck with each other . it ' s playful but if you ' re having doubts , you probably don ' t have that kind of relationship with her and might be the asshole
   (ID: 28e24cb71e2c0068fef35890d39022b686e4215d)

20. yeah but why tf did you decide to post this on here . i support the lgbtq community but jeez man , chill out and talk about that stuff someone else . it  s just a meme
