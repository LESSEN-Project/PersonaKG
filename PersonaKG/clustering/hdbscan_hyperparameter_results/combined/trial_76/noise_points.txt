   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

6. you got every single guy you shake hands with , reevaluating every piece of how the date went . guaranteed digit . digit  of the time the guy thinks immediately afterwards , " did she really just shake my hand " handshakes are more busniess  esque and not informal like first dates are . truly , dont cross boundaries by hugging . but givd them a kind , happy , warm smile tell them thay you enjoyed meeting them if its genuine and be on your way . they shouldnt expect a hug or anything more , but the demeanor of a handshake at our age 24m doesnt really fit the situation . in short , skip the handshake and just wait until you are comfortable with a hug !

9. you just compare yourself to the people who are richer than you so you still don  t really feel rich or satisfied
   (ID: ad24fe51d61dbe3cddd863ba9cb6adae61265a06)

10. you ' ll have to define it by birth years . there are a lot of definitions . they swing enough that by one site , i a 90s kid am in the same generation as both of my parents trailing end of the baby boom .
   (ID: aac80ac9ebef70ab8fe6bc14a8fcccb472099b84)

11. but you could say the same for people who know bunch of languages . are they guaranteed to make good money ?
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

12. digit the lady at the pizzeria said she would serve any customers who came into the shop but that she would not provide pizzas to a gay wedding . digit i seriously doubt the law would have covered her in this instance . no doubt she would have tried to use the law to cover her but i don ' t think it would have been upheld by any court . digit if she is really against gay weddings personally do you really think its right that she be forced to service a gay wedding or loose her business ? if you think its ok to force someone to do something they are morally against then i think there is something wrong with you personally . if you think its not ok for a person to make a living if they dont have the exact same values as you do , then again , i think that there is something wrong with you .
   (ID: 35eb47890f8874bbb988ec8308ba762f8377b3b8)

   (ID: 1cedb012c7702cdd6cf28839fd31ce2bb1eea04c)

16. i have the gamecube gameboy advance player somewhere , but i can ' t find it to save my life . if i could just find the disc , i could probably find the device itself on ebay pretty easily . i just miss the ability to play pokemon emerald on the big screen . maybe one day i ' ll get emerald on the switch . until then i ' ve got a modded mini snes , but it ' s just not the same !
   (ID: 42817db6a2880fe4df5d65636e25385c67c89bb1)

17. op makes claim using vague terms , gets told to define term , provides definition , gets argued with or laughed at for mistaken assumptions . that ' s usually how things work around here . just substituting ' circlejerk ' for ' god ' or ' soul ' or ' spiritual ' or whatever the hell else . tell me exactly what you mean by it and i ' ll tell you what you have wrong . tl  dr whoosh
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

18. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .
   (ID: 9adb5fb6fb9aeeeb65afe41002460d73817044b0)

   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

20. whenever i miss something my so says she refuses to repeat it , and i get very annoyed . it  s entirely irrational and totally my fault . but i try my best to make her happy , after all if she makes me happy i should do the same .
