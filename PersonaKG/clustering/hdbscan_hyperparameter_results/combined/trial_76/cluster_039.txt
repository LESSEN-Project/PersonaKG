6. there are so many oscar wilde quotes that can go well with this picture . my favorite is this one  beauty is a form of genius   is higher , indeed , than genius , as it needs no explanation . it is one of the great facts of the world , like sunlight , or springtime , or the reflection in the dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon . it cannot be questioned . it has divine right of sovereignty . it makes princes of those who have it .
   (ID: ae2dbc0f768c4bbf71f7452c59522c05c2ccc74e)

7. a person has the right to pay as little in taxes , but not to pursue as much as possible in benefits ? this makes no sense . if i have a right to hire three accountants to nickle and dime the tax code , and this is laudable , american behavior , how is the welfare recipient doing anything different ?
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

   (ID: 5147e830e7cfa538d6990a8699ad6462b57cfb52)

16. if done right , a collection of vignettes can be incredibly engaging . suttree by cormac mccarthy is a prime example of this , or steinbeck ' s cannery row . one of the things that makes it doable is how the vignettes tap into the reader ' s humanity  there is something they can connect with . i think it ' s a cool idea . who cares if it ' s the in thing right now .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

19. here ' s how i see it . many different universes where something small that ' s different to something drastically different . anything possible could happen right ? what if each one of those , there is a god , but the gods are all on being ?
   (ID: 93e92e6a7d8e94b12bcd450fad136ec14436f359)
