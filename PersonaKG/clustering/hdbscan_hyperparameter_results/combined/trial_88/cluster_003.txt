1. i know this sounds like a standard answer giving to everyone , but i know that its the best way . i know that because i also was in that position when you have lost so many of your friends , that there is no place to start , to regain them . put yourself out there , and with out there i mean really into the world of the people you want to befriend . when i needed a friend to go to parties with , i needed to go out alone , to find those with similar interest . and is definitely not so hard when you start building up confidence to go up ro people . most people don ' t have a reason to approach you when already having their social circle , so there is no was around for you to just start randomly talking with people that think may be symphatic . nearly all of the people i started talking to reacted super positve on that behavior . some may find it strange at first , same stick to that attitude and evem some of them will become your friensy

2. she  s taking my advice and basically just dropping subtle hints to see if she is bi or gay . asking her outright could go multiple ways and , like you , doesn  t wanna risk her friendship but is contemplating if it  s worth the risk since if she is bi or gay they might end up in a relationship . so it  s a difficult scenario . see what kinda friends she hangs out with since gays tend to congregate in my experience and find out what her previous relationships were like if she  s had any . so far it  s going pretty well and hannah is pretty sure she  s bi but still needs to find out more before she moves forward with it . oh yeah i actually had a situation similar to that with my partner , neither of us knew if the other was gay or straight or not . i  m pan so and i  ve dated girls and guys in the past , they  ve dated only one girl and regretted the relationship . after i found out they were pan too because i noticed a lot of their friends were gay , they had an even amount of girl to guy friends , they never denied being gay , etc so i asked them out and apparently they liked me for months on end . now we  re in an almost three year relationship . i hope all goes well for you smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

3. the first thing you do is sop pestering her about how she feels . yes , you didn ' t tell her . yes , she found out and is pissed off . but this is a forgivable offense . as long as you stopped sleeping with your roommate before you entered the relationship with your current girlfriend you have nothing to worry about . trust me , the more you apologize the madder and more distant she is going to become . i have learned this the hard way because i ' ve been in your place with a similar situation . you already apologized profusely . do not contact her until she has dealt with her emotions and is ready to talk to you about this . patience is what you need now , not another angle on how to apologize even more profusely .
   (ID: 8f33db98a9fa29c8f9e44012d79de72291a29519)

4. i think the best thing to do here is communication with all the parties involved . make sure everyone knows what happened and they don  t see the story from one side . when shit goes down and i need to just talk to them to make sure they don  t hate me or something i usually start it off with ,  now you don  t have to talk or respond but all i need you to do is listen , then you can make your own judgment , insert story here .  i think it  s important to let the other person know hat they have control of what they think and know that you feel bad . explain fully that you were drunk and have no recollection of the event . apologize profoundly and shit . but i don  t know if you want to take my advice fully . i  m just some shit 15yo white boy . i don  t drink or do drugs or anything but my father is an alcoholic so i know a thing or two about drinking . just apologize and explain your side , of they still hate you well tough shit .

5. hey queenofhearts90 ! i  ve felt this way as well , it  s a terrible feeling . it  s not good to dwell on it too much though . i would do different activities to keep your mind off it . and speak to your husband about this  that is important . i hope you feel better soon . slightly  smiling  face
   (ID: 7f37f47fcf6439c13308caa3da8118ac14f861f6)

6. definitely say something . call her , though . tone can be kind of difficult to determine through text and you don ' t need want to give her any more reasons to push you away even more . " hey , insert sister name . how you doing , casual chatting , blah blah blah . i need to talk to you about something . i feel insert everything you just told us . i know it ' s your wedding and you can do whatever you want , but i ' m starting to think that you don ' t even want me there . if not , that ' s fine bc you ' re kind of being a bitch and i could do without all the cross country trips . if you genuinely want me to be a part of the wedding , then act like it and maybe ease up a little bit " . feel free to modify to your liking .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

7. honestly be i  d not say anything , ignorance is bliss but nta tbh if you told him although i  d rather live in bliss and not know it  s over all better to be told hurt and move on just be direct about it but be kind if you get me
   (ID: 77ab4860c32a7084ca81fd91302df6690ce56731)

8. you ' re not doing anything wrong . relationships just kind of happen . you don ' t need to do anything differently . one night you might find you slipped on a kiss and be with someone for a good while . keep doing your own thing and girls will take notice .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

9. what am i suppose to say ? what ' s done is done , no need to keep feeling guilty and letting it eat me up for months messing with my mind and shit . just letting go now and not letting it bother me sounds way better then letting stuff fuck me up like most people do .
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

10. absolutely speak to your therapist . you trust them . they will help you . you need to get yourself out of that relationship for your safety , physical and psychological . this is not a one  off occurrence .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

11. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

12. i don ' t have experience with cheating parents or spouses , at least not that i ' m aware . i do agree with you that is wrong and harmful to both women . however , if i were in your shoes , i would have to ask myself some questions . first , what do you want to accomplish by speaking with your mom ? you clearly cannot change her behavior by talking to her about it , as you have tried that . secondly , what kind , if any , relationship do you want with her ? if you intervene in some way call the wife , confront the man , etc , you will be further alienating your mom . and lastly , can you live with this knowledge and not intervene if that is the only way to save your relationship with your mother ? if you answer these questions honestly and with great contemplation or not rashly , i believe you will know what course you should take . good luck !

13. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .
   (ID: 9adb5fb6fb9aeeeb65afe41002460d73817044b0)

14. thank you . i don ' t blame myself in a way that isn ' t realistic . i blame myself for not being aware of the warning signs of what happened to me . that ' s about the extent . i don ' t harbor any unhealthy emotions and though i suffer mildly from ptsd i am conscious enough to work on my issues . with that being said . yes , i am still with my boyfriend . the truth of the matter is that he simply isn ' t emotionally mature enough to understand the depths of what had happened . i did threaten to break up with him . the first couple of times he said it to me i didn ' t stand up for myself . i don ' t know why . but the last time he said it i really stuck it to him . i realized that if he thinks this way i can ' t possibly marry someone who will think like that and i told him that . i also told him i will happily leave because i know i wouldn ' t be suffering a loss if that ' s the way he is thinking . for the first time in all the time i have known him he stopped and gave me a very heart felt apology taking accountability for his lack of sympathy and understanding . quite frankly , a lot of other things were said . but it was true and i know he meant it . this is still a red flag for me . if i am suffering from something in the future , am i going to have to be the one to walk him through it too ? just because i am more emotionally equipped to handle ? he ' s not a horrible person . but he is selfish in his thinking . and he is emotionally sheltered . after digit years i am starting to wonder if i want to be the one who does all of the picking up .

15. i understand . i feel ya . depression is certainly not a dealbreaker for me , since i have it . it  s just that i  m constantly trying to better myself and get outside my mental filing cabinet of toxic thoughts . i try to be optimistic towards new beginnings with men , but the ones i meet are just bathing in their own sadness . even though i  m depressed , i know i  m lucky . i don  t think you should feel guilty for being sad , what do they say  you have to go through it to get past it ? something like that .
   (ID: 256407c5e6c8d9342d8aabf5c9c392fc179ba9f3)

16. i ' m sorry for what you are going through . you say that you ' re tired , but i think that you are stronger than you admit . not many people can survive after going through all the trials that you ' ve mentioned , but you ' re still here and that ' s what counts .
   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

17. you know , i  ve been at that point in my life where i wondered why i had so many failed relationships . but then i realized all of them had one thing in common . me . there  s a reason why we pick the partners we do . go to counseling because you want to be the best you that you can be , not because she made the call . go for you . i hope you do it .

18. it sound that those people in your life are holding you back and that isn  t good for mental health . i  m not saying you should get rid of them but certainly make them aware that your life is more than chores or work and everyone needs a hobby and shouldn  t have to hide it .
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

19. yes , our minds love to punish ourselves when we are low . i promise if you truly try you can feel better and once you do it will be easier next time and so on and so on . feeling like this i truly know can be dangerous . don ' t be afraid to talk . get it all out . it ' s ok to be sad . but you have to tools inside your head to make yourself better ! remind yourself that you are worth it red  heart
   (ID: dc0783c6951122c6edfc85430901cf133c146b32)

20. it ' s a big mix of stuff but time is just one component . youtube is full of really socially intelligent folks that know how to help you navigate heartbreak . finding the right advice along with finding healthy distractions is key . you have to acknowledge your feelings , while at the same time giving yourself liberty to feel different emotions through other activities and diversion . you have to delve into healing while at other times work on suppressing certain emotions since they are not all constructive and sometimes even accurate . stay social . don ' t be afraid to hook with folks . i personally recommend tripping on molly , mushrooms or lsd to create an experience that could heighten your sense of how beautiful consciousness is . it sucks to say , but pain is a very helpful tool for progress . some people use it masochistically to self sabotage and wallow in a cycle of victimhood , self pity and depression . you could instead use pain to turn around and help other people , perhaps hold yourself to higher standards in important ways and above all use this opportunity to learn more about yourself and how to become the best friend to yourself you could possibly be .
