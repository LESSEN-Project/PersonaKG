1. i . i don ' t get it . can someone please explain ? or is this just not funny ?
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

2. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

3. you know what , you ' re absolutely right , it ' s mean for me to point out your errors  especially on a forum like idle heroes . i don ' t intend to discourage you or make you feel like you need to justify yourself . you ' ve taught me a lesson today and in the future , i ' ll know that pointing out someones minor mistakes , is not worth the effort and only upsets people . thank you for taking the time for the back and forth . peace .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

4. i think at this point your just upset that a little american boy has a different opinion then you and your trying to make me look like a dumb homophobic nazi
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

5. yta , from your comments you come off twice as hard as one .
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

6. going to get a lot of shit for this , but i think this is the same type of argument you would have with your son  daughter about getting transgender reassignment surgery . the " i feel " argument is so crushing that you just want to shake the person and say " no , you are wrong . that is not who you are ! " she doesn ' t have cancer and you cannot have babies just because you turn your penis outside  in .
   (ID: 306fcce176e83db604dac17838eed1e669cd5a90)

7. and what if those kids families were killed in the wars they now serve and the only thing they can do to survive is to take up arms . not justifying just saying
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

8. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

9. i add comments instead of editing , because i doubt people will re  read my comment . worried , maybe not , but you were the one who wouldn ' t take my word for it . sources dont usually help people that already have their minds made up .
   (ID: d8014467041b98317d9f1dec2b0dae4ff9405b91)

10. you ' re an idiot who clearly hasn ' t lived in very many countries . welfare is not what builds the nice parts of town or the transport channels to get a coke into the hand of any person in earth . rich people do , for their own benefit and the benefit of those who work for them . just because a few assholes kill the farm and pocket a tax break instead of giving you personally a job on a micro level doesn ' t mean trickle down economics doesn ' t elevate everyone on a macro level . i repeat , go live somewhere not built by the rich if you disagree .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

11. but the left has a ' my way or the highway ' mentality do you not even realize how biased you just were ?
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

12. you might notice that regardless of income it has done nothing but gone down for the past digit years , so don ' t really know what you ' re talking about . as for that ramble you gave , what the fuck is wrong with you ? why would you not want the place you live to be nice ?
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

13. i use this subreddit for fun . this topic wasn ' t marked serious . if people want to overanalyze a comment , that ' s up to them .
   (ID: 68698bd86019a86cb34a8b2e28c6324727011b28)

14. yep , you ' re totally just ignoring this . you didn ' t make a comment about how you were unsubscribing or respond to my comment . i can see how you just mind your own business and ignore things . you ' re totally not acting like a whiny snowflake at all .
   (ID: dc639446b154d74c8655191b5a755643abd00c2d)

15. wait . i never which side someone is on . please tell me if you are stupid or have common sense ?
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

16. i think you should correct your behaviour . if your first thought when something happens is " im completely faultless " and then after everyone else says you ' re the asshole you still seem to think you ' re in the right . yta taking out your anger on others and racist comments are never valid . dont kid yourself
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

17. maybe think more about how you title your posts next time . your title was misleading whether you think so or not
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

18. this is probably the worst argument i ' ve ever seen then . i could literally go  hey conservatives eck phlack shmack and it would make about as much sense .
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

19. i feel like you invite this kind of opposition view to your thoughts when you post them unasked for in a sub called unpopular opinion . we ' re not talking about laws here , were talking about your unpopular opinion .
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

20. ok , so the post in question was  what evidence is there that male privilege exists ? i am in no way saying we should put out a bad product . but i am saying that none of you or i are biologists and really don ' t know how hard it is . regardless the fact that they didn ' t start until later is bad . how is that so hard to get . i ' m literally not bashing . why are you even defending it ? it ' s not your fault or anyone ' s here . is it that bad to get the word out ?
