1. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

2. well , i hope that you ' re still here . those friends that your referring to , those aren ' t the type you want to have . if they don ' t like you or your interests , that ' s their lost , not yours . if you don ' t mind me asking , why does your mom want you to move back in ? you may call her narcissist , but aren ' t all parents , in a way ? i would suggest you call her . if you kill yourself , it could destroy her . i wouldn ' t know , but maybe she wants you to move back in because she likes having around . maybe she needs some help , that is if she lives alone .
   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

3. knock that bish off the pedestal . really , if you keep her there you  ll never be able to appreciate anyone else . including yourself ! ex is an ex for a reason .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

4. hey . firstly you need to speak to someone be it a doctor or the samaritans , someone . secondly why are you looking up reasons instead of looking inwards and seeing what the actual issue is . do you have depression or something that maybe people around you don ' t know how to handle ? what kind of person are you ? are you kind ? thoughtful ? generous with your time ? empathetic ? honest ? nice ? these are all traits that people like . or are you selfish ? negative ? deceitful ? apathetic ? narcissistic ? irresponsible ? egotistical ? you can change your behaviour and your characteristics . you are not always going to be the person you perceive yourself to be now . everyone has the potential to change and grow . believe in yourself . only you have the ability to make yourself happy . don ' t depend on others to validate you . mind yourself .

5. i get the feeling from what you  ve written that she  s saying this to make you jealous . i think you need to tell her that you  ve been thinking about it and it  s bothering you that she seems so hung up on her and talk about where you want to go from there . do you want her to stop seeing this girl ? do you want the communication to stop ? i think you need to decide what your ideal situation would be in regard to their current relationship . make sure she knows why you feel like this and how it makes you feel when she responds so quickly . if you guys are hanging out together why does she need to be constantly texting this other girl she used to date ? it  s not like they were only friends  you said she was in love with her and it  s inappropriate for her to still be this involved with her . i don  t know if this is useful advice but it  s what i  d do if i were in your situation . best of luck .

6. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

7. yeah if you have a gut feeling you won ' t like dating her then don ' t . i mean if she wants to just be fwb that would be cool though lol .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

8. you made several decisions that lead to this happening but you seem to be making excuses for each of them . you are a pretty shitty friend and you should come clean .
   (ID: bef3bdf131cc9dbe9d33343a3b9988680236cf9d)

9. try a psychiatrist . there ' s antidepressants for that .  source ?  chronic depression sufferer
   (ID: 8583c2f8118c4b3f3d00c452df3ca410a605ac45)

10. you seem to have normalized his shitty behavior at this point . there is no reason why you should be working full time  still taking on the domestic role . if you weren ' t working , sure . but that ' s just so fucking ridiculous and selfish , " tradition " be damned . it sucks you have kids with this guy imo . i think you should leave him .
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

11. ride it out man , hope that the next day is better than the last . try to find a hobby that will get you out and moving but still has seclusion aspects to it . hunting , fishing , hiking , etc . then gently ease into social interactions for your hobby . find others that have the same interests as you and bond with them .

12. i experience this even now . i think it ' s fine to think every now and then about your situation . it would be impossible to never think about it , but don ' t stay focused on it for a lengthy period , it ' s unhealthy . when i had a job in retail i caught the train home every night . friday and saturday nights were almost unbearable . watching groups of people your age socialize and have fun hurt bad because it would remind me how i ' ll never be able to experience it for myself . you can still find some people to hang around with , maybe from work or education . but i think we should agree that looking forward is the best thing to do

13. so he is name  calling and spreading gossip ? that tells you a lot about the person he is . it doesn ' t say anything about you . just be honest about what happened .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

14. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart

15. feels like a one side of the story . i could see how you weren ' t one that missed an opportunity to point out in the last digit . digit years to tell john he ' s a loser as often as he said you ' re a drone . i can ' t imagine someone would constantly harass you like that without anything coming back . but if he ' s truly the only " bad guy " in your stories , which i kinda doubt , then your reaction would be more justifiable . however , it was still incredibly childish and a dick move . just talk about the issue you have with him like an adult ffs . you guys are 27yo  is it so hard to talk about how you don ' t think it ' s productive to constantly harass each other ? what ' s the point ? and if he continues to be a child about then talk to your friends about it in a way  " look , i respect and want to support john in what he ' s doing and wish him all the success in the world  however he can ' t stop harassing me for what i am doing and is very insultive about my way of life  i don ' t see any other option than not interact with him anymore because he can ' t be an adult about the situation  then see what they have to say  might suggest . do that than rather making a fool out of yourself and completely escalate the situation in a childish way in front of your whole social circle .

16. you need to be assertive about this . the template for an assertive statement is " i feel  when you do   , and i wish you would    " in this situation you could say " i feel sad or maybe uncherished , neglected , abandoned , or lonely ? when you don ' t get to know my family , and i would like you to come to thanksgiving dinner and talk to them " please learn this and use it . it must be said calmly and conversationally without expectation of changing his behavior . you are clearly stating your emotions and the behaviour of your ideal mate . if he still refuses to change his behavior , then you should decide if you can visit your family without him for the rest of your life .

17. could you use the internet to learn ? have you ever considered talking to a counselotherapist about social anxiety ? i think small steps might help , it ' s overwhelming to step back and look at all the ways you think you ' re failing . the fact that you ' re getting through each day is something to be proud of .
   (ID: 345fbf1e655edda9a5f8099ba480dfe0a7a0bd47)

18. i hear you . you believe you are unworthy . you think that deep down , you don  t matter . all i can say is that the voice that  s telling you that is lying . it  s a lie that you are unworthy and undeserving . it  s simply untrue . the truth is that you are a person worthy of love and happiness and stability and help . you don  t have to do this alone . your therapist and your hr rep will help you . your therapist can get you the right kind of treatment and your hr rep will help you make sure you can take the time off . do you think that you could experiencing cognitive distortions ? and that maybe you aren  t seeing things clearly ? what if you spoke to your therapist about the possibility of getting help ? what if you  re jumping to conclusions about how treatment will really be like ? are you jumping to conclusions about  subjecting  other people to helping you ? i would think that therapists and counselors would want to help you  it  s their ultimate goal , after all . could it be that your brain isn  t letting you think clearly right now ?

19. heres what id do ask her out one more time , if she says she has things to do without giving you a time where shes available then yea you did kill your chance . other than that , im sure youll find more people youll have a shot with
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

20. basically at the end of this year it is as if the whole world shattered for me and i had the possibility to start again . during the summer i got the chance to create some new great friendships , i joined the scouts and most of my current friends all come from that group and i finally built memories i want to remember . it is something i never felt because i ' ve always been classified as weird and i rarely met people really interested in me . so when i met this girl circa four years ago and she made me believe we were friends , she became my world if it makes sense . she manipulated me very easily and then she left me roughly once i started questioning her ways . now i can see through her crap and the only reason i don ' t want to see her anymore is that i feel like everything has changed and i don ' t want to get back to that world of rumors and fake friendships .
