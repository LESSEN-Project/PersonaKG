1. however , and don ' t down vote me here just for bringing up the contrary position the nuclear fireball in the center of our solar system seems to have a majority say in the activity , heat and weather patterns of the planet earth . currently there are zero sunspots  i direct you to nasa on the data . as a result earth ' s the climate has been shifting again . a bit " cooler " than what was anticipated by the computer models that al gore used . also  the temperature of mars has heated and cooled on the same curve as the earth , as measured by nasa . which may suggest that perhaps the sun has a say in both planet ' s temperatures . all said , however , if your opponent in your debate does not use this data , and is simply quoting rush limbaugh . i would say you need to dismiss this parrot and find new friends . again , even if there were significant proof pointing to the sun as the only cause of warming , i do not suggest that humanity should continue to waste resources and continue to use oil to make plastic bags , roads , and hummers .

2. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

3. huh ? i did not say that . were you answering to a deleted comment ?
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

4. i didn ' t know what you wanted by sources but you seem like you use your own head and think for yourself even if you don ' t like a trump and have different opinions or ideas i respect that
   (ID: ab2cb4fe8a731926dde8eeb5f52a6776874b2529)

5. i ' m not going to downvote anything you say because i ' m open to anything you have to say . the question wasn ' t asking for evidence . the question was asking about what makes each individual believe in god . and you don ' t , so you kinda wasted your time by coming in here and generally just trying to start an argument . when you say there is no evidence , you are only approaching reality through what you see and feel from your own perspective , which is all any of us can really do . thing is , everyone has a different view of reality . that in itself is mind boggling . we are a collective consciousness trying to make sense of this whole thing . even me and you right now are like synapses firing in a huge brain right now trying to imagine two sides of this coin . but yeah whatever man , blow jobs and garbage , everything is nothing , and we may as well just fuck the earth to death because it ' s gonna happen eventually , right ?
   (ID: cb830ff94bb369e5db655e15ee074f392a52c14f)

6. who makes that decision ? who determines what conditions or characteristics are fine and which are not ? disabled adults would be against this idea of yours . what makes you think you know better than they whether they have a right to live ? no , you ' re talking about babies , but babies don ' t get to be adults if you ' d have them euthanized first . this is a slippery slope that starts with ostensibly good intentions and ends with eugenics .
   (ID: 5146a89965a734a4d1ec9ec9145abae872a4569d)

7. so , do you understand my comment now ?
   (ID: 9286ff57fb4290178a79b38d20f6a95da9d2267f)

8. you didn ' t understand . not an issue my friend . let me say it again for you . there ' s a site that high school kids use , it ' s called hidden answers . i ' m pretty sure you must have heard of it . pretty boring site . on the site , you ask questions . and a person , understandably , had asked a question . me , being a nice and polite person , pursued to answer the question , which was regarding a not very well known library site . i was shocked that someone else knew about it , so i went to answer it . the question was regarding the link and any mirrors that could be used . note  as i ' m sure you ' d know , onion sites are jumbled up letters and numbers . i did not know what this link truly was but i did assume it was to a site that i had visited numerous times before . clicked the link , and up came a forum for child abuse . the literature was very detailed . no media content , so just headlines and the names of other child abuse sites . there was lots of them . it was not nice . it was very descriptive . lots of sites . hundreds , maybe thousands i ' m not sure . i don ' t know the legitimacy of these sites . i did not click them . but i do assume they were real . i hope i cleared this up for you my friend just remember , be polite . you don ' t know what others are going through . if you don ' t believe someone , ask them for proof . but do not accuse them of horrible things . it really is not nice . i hope you have a good day , stay blessed

9. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

10. our rule of logic is that literally everything in the universe came from a source . you keep saying this . what " rule of logic " are you talking about ? what is the rule ? how does it apply to your claim ? can you explain it to me , and how you determined it means " everything came from a source ?
   (ID: 00b878c3a1ec656c05e2872b35fdccfcfda3baac)

11. I am misunderstanding.
   (ID: 41d66f92509db20d202cca3f348509c6cd25586b)

12. okay , you ' re trolling . you got me . i give up .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

13. i  m not going to try and convince you because i accept what you believe in but please don  t try and prove that people  s religions are wrong and don  t exist .
   (ID: 973428a61ce4e0cc447de9b99091e59e2018e42c)

14. ok , so the post in question was  what evidence is there that male privilege exists ? i am in no way saying we should put out a bad product . but i am saying that none of you or i are biologists and really don ' t know how hard it is . regardless the fact that they didn ' t start until later is bad . how is that so hard to get . i ' m literally not bashing . why are you even defending it ? it ' s not your fault or anyone ' s here . is it that bad to get the word out ?
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

15. wow you should take a chill pill if you are not happy with the way things are run you should get out there and change things . run for office , change the laws with the people
   (ID: 4776f36398122cafa421393accf6939d82603a44)

16. even if your reverse generalizations don ' t hurt anyone because of power imbalances , does that make it morally right to do so ? i think we should try to love each other from both directions . we can complain about inequality righteously without generalizing groups of people . it ' s wrong to generalize anyone , no matter their color , even when the generalized group is powerful enough to not be affected by it . aaaaand let the name  calling begin .
   (ID: 6cb8904cf2faf74f712ddb1c620007fe43bf46df)

17. it looks like you and i disagree a lot on policies . i vehemently oppose almost all of trump ' s policies . but i don ' t think the solution would ever be to personally attack you and tell you to feel ashamed . and especially not just to say that message and that alone , offering no insight into why i believe my opinion and disagree with yours . that gets neither of us anywhere expect further apart . politics is divisive enough as it is . i wouldn ' t spend my time contributing to that division . i just wanted to let you know that even when you are seeing a lot of hateful people online , remember that not everyone is like that .
   (ID: 04e13131ee0b31e4af8e34facf582fad832b1aea)

18. how do you know that you are coming at me without facts
   (ID: 23df46bdba3eb265d08b02c9ec5f365cf45ae5fd)

19. my initial reaction to this was anger and confusion which means i can learn from it if i try to understand you calmly . please expand on why you feel wealth inequality to not be bad .
   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

20. i don  t understand ! why people like you never have any facts as to why trump is bad , it  s always the same vague arguments . be glad your bitch ass is safe from isis and if you ever decide to get a job and move out of your moms basement , trump has given us the greatest economy our nation has ever seen
