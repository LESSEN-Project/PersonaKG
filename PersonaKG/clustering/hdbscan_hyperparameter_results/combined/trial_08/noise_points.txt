1. from the epilogue of the book , professor pieixoto says they narrowed the commander of the handmaid on the tapes down to either waterford or judd , and they went on to say " judd devised the particicution , realizing that it would release the pent  up anger of the handmaids . pieixoto says that particicutions became so popular that in gilead ' s " middle period " they occurred four times a year . judd also came up with the notion that women should control other women . pieixoto says that no empire lacks this " control of the indigenous by members of their own group " so yes , the women are living under the control of the men  but the men were pitting the women against each other .

3. " perception is reality " . if everyone sees you in " one way " then that ' s what you are to them . what this translates to is if people around you think you don ' t care about your job  responsibilities , even if you actually do , you wont be given the opportunity to take on more responsibility or looked at for promotions . very true words that took a long time to understand and eventually agree with .
