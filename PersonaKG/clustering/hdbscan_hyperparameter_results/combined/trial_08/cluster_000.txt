1. you ' re so , so young to be thinking about these things . you can tackle these issues if you ' re still together as adults , but for now , enjoy your time together and don ' t get caught up in things you won ' t to think about for digit  years . and also you don ' t have to be married to start a family together if you do reach that point .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

2. I am turd burglar.
   (ID: cfd691d6aeaf46cc644b0e21187d10dfc62b0bc8)

3. this is the dumbest thing i ' ve ever seen posted in reddit , i should know , i ' ve posted stupid shit .
   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

4. I am selfer.
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

5. the weirdest thing you have to get used at is that your bullets wont hit where your crosshair is when you go full auto . if you want to hit something you have to stand still and either burst or singletap . if you want to fullauto you have to learn how to control the weapons recoil .
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

6. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .
   (ID: 2168250be01c43791f88e7c8ad875c0396307047)

7. christmas shop , get to the gym , give my wife a spa day .
   (ID: 5d0b750bf77c2c6e8b41ebf03caf4038a907b876)

8. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

9. some people like to compartmentalize certain parts of their life and its completely natural . if you warm up to them and show you can really vibe this can change .
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

10. I am top sniper.

11. you could have said " oh yeah , cool " . instead you got defensive and downvoted me . a fucktard says what ?
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

12. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

13. alright i  m gonna be brutally honest . quit lying and bullshitting to your self , and be you . i looked at your history and read this post idk what you did or what you want , but the biggest thing to success will be accepting everything and not lying to cope . afterwards it  s a easy path of going out of your comfort zone and changing lifestyles . if that  s not possible then you need to live so your happy . you can live in the wilderness in alaska alone for example if you hate humanity so much . personally i would love to do this but i still have other goals that require me around humanity
   (ID: 4422c1db26c9be5bec35694a448a490c2761d985)

14. i ' m confused what you ' re upset about . a gunslinger who understands how to use his class to its full effectiveness ? much like a titan putting a bubbleshield directly over a control point and sitting there with a shotgun , or titansmashing everyone at a control point ? haha , as a fellow hunter , i have to say , i ' ve tripped my own tripmine grenade and killed myself more times than i ' d like to admit golden gun gives hunters zero shields , nor does bladedancer . all they had to do was go in one of the two other entrances , double team him and he would have been gone . instead , they filed in the same door over , and over , and over again . edit  just watched the second video . derp . yeah . this is why i always roll my eyes when titans complain that hunters are op .
   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

15. guy here . because its always followed with a " why " and that leads to more conversation they don ' t want to have with you .
   (ID: b5f9b695867ef3b560a4fe7610f75e43b62809f6)

16. One of my favorite things is good giefs.

17. I live in ct nick cage.
   (ID: 128346fc1e56ccadd25a4b200ecae44637d48f5f)

18. i know this sounds like a standard answer giving to everyone , but i know that its the best way . i know that because i also was in that position when you have lost so many of your friends , that there is no place to start , to regain them . put yourself out there , and with out there i mean really into the world of the people you want to befriend . when i needed a friend to go to parties with , i needed to go out alone , to find those with similar interest . and is definitely not so hard when you start building up confidence to go up ro people . most people don ' t have a reason to approach you when already having their social circle , so there is no was around for you to just start randomly talking with people that think may be symphatic . nearly all of the people i started talking to reacted super positve on that behavior . some may find it strange at first , same stick to that attitude and evem some of them will become your friensy
   (ID: e5a44ccd2ce03ba23fc6a9fd527ffc5440b8088c)

19. there ' s nothing you can realistically do about this apart from get a hold of yourself and learnt to move past it . remind yourself that you have no reason to be angry about it and make sure you never treat your girlfriend poorly because of it
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

20. nta . as a lesbian and as a human being with good communication in a good relationship , i see no issue with what you did . your other doesnt trust you and is very insecure . i ' d talk to her and if it didnt resolve , i ' d get a new girlfriend that trusts me enough to not cheat .
