1. what makes you think i might not already have ? the dt should not be compelled to post the images , fine , but you either do or do not . all it takes is a few seconds to unblur that ridiculous compromise they went for . it makes as much sense as censoring swear words with asterisks and grawlixes , we all know what they are , don ' t treat all of us like children .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

2. i don ' t care if you have black friends . i think it ' s wrong to only care how a person looks and not take anything else into account .

   (ID: dc1fd340b3e0a603d715d06c129c512b8197c37b)

5. the continued treatment of the american indian . it is more of a national disgrace really .
   (ID: 130fa156e7a286a021dcdff2492d6048231cb82f)

6. bizarro , argyle sweater , and the far side are some single  panel comic strips that i can think of off the top of my head that could have been what you were looking for . maybe if you recognize one of their art styles , you can go off that and narrow down your search ?
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

7. i arrived at this conclusion when i was about digit  i was in a health class at school and they showed us a video of a woman going through pregnancy , labor , and the aftermath . and that was enough for me to nope out entirely . up until that point i was on the fence about the whole thing , i figured i ' d probably have kids someday but not anytime soon  but the video showed me how invasive for lack of a better word the whole process of giving birth is , and i already dislike going to the doctor  so nope . not for me . oh btw  i was married digit years he died a few years back and he was completely fine with us not having any kids . secondly , the old folks home is full of people who either outlived their kids or whose kids abandoned them there  so much for them taking care of you in your old age .
   (ID: e387b7eddf8ab01e3dd767dc2f5ca52494fbe9b0)

8. how did that turn out ?
   (ID: 7e8d23b8f1f993c239648b064d6f3e414288a7dd)

10. One of my favorite things is funko.
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

11. the amount of shit liberty gives about older fans . if you really were an " older fan " you would remember bridgestone used this exact same system with a " soft " and " hard " tyre and it worked perfectly fine , and before that you wouldn ' t have a clue what the competing tyre companies brought to a race .
   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

   (ID: ad911088c8434d08c7a96c969a57a09b00f02e99)

14. idk , i  m able to relate to nearly every message and character in the book . halliday  s created the most immersive  video game  in the universe and yet it  s so much more than that . people get lost in it .  the missing millions .  all just because he wanted people to like what he liked . and that somebody like wade who had quite literally nothing but passion and skill for the same things was able to beat his game . i think cline wrote every character perfectly , being able to understand their plights , i mean even sorrentos character was compelling , somebody you really wanted to hate . the references were insane . i didn  t even grow up with the old school games but the attention to detail was incredible . in an era where aaa titles don  t even come with enough content for digit month , cline was able to imagine up a place where everything was under digit platform , the whole world shared halliday  s creation , gunter or not . free learning , unlimited content , whatever your hobby was , it was in the oasis . i  ve never wanted something to be as real as i do the oasis . but the themes hit home too . the problems with being overly connected , letting the real world pass you by . the want and need to not let corporations rule the world . i just think it  s amazing start to finish . i understand liking something and later feeling differently but man , this book , i don  t think i  ll ever get tired of .
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

15. i don ' t know if i ' m ready for the next chapter . i don ' t think my heart can handle it .

16. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck

   (ID: 472084017072e7ced5fed0827bae57ba801d9b7d)

20. it ' s not just you . i ' ve been here about as long as you have and have noticed the same things . when i first got here i used to look at b  as and try to test myself to see if i could guess what the cc would be in the thread . now the opportunities to do that are very sparse . the highly  voted ones almost always look amazing , and the ones that need help disappear .
