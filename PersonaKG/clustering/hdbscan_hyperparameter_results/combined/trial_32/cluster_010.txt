1. your best resource would be to go to car forums for chargers  dodge . there you ' ll find actual owners and what they ' ve dealt with . also realize that a lot of places like jd poweothers use flawed data to get their results . if someone says " i really think my ac should be colder " or " i hate where the button to my cruise control is " , they report that as a reliability issue even if there is no actual problem .
