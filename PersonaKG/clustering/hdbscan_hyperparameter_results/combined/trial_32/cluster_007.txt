--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 65

1. you have a perceived notion on the us government ' should ' run . which you literally just proved my point . you don ' t understand how they actually work .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

2. posting something that i as a muslim support doesn ' t make me a cunt . you using a generalising term clearly shows the upbringing you ' ve got . wow . shows where you stand ? oh wait . nowhere !
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

3. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

4. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .
   (ID: 2168250be01c43791f88e7c8ad875c0396307047)

5. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .

6. yes i  m fully aware , but through consistent elaboration then maybe i could help at least one person learn the truth and show them the difference . as long as just one person learns from me , then my efforts are all worth it
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

7. I am misunderstanding.
   (ID: 41d66f92509db20d202cca3f348509c6cd25586b)

8. well that ' s just like your fucking opinion , man
   (ID: ecc98de1e575d7e863a2124b364b8ed586778ba5)

9. lol , ok ok . i ' ll stop . dude , for you own sanity . realise that this is a shitpost . my account is a shitpost account . you are arguing with me on a heavily down voted thread that almost no one will ever see . look in the mirror , remind yourself that you are a human being that doesn ' t need to get upset about idiots on the internet that are clearly doing stuff to get a rise out others . cause dude . it ' s not ever gonna stop . get used to it .
   (ID: 39ba9a65a55c27b50eef7c5cecbc66cc866c4a4c)

10. do they ? i rather doubt that . what ' s your source ?
   (ID: 800762ac8d54632109094a4e9132fe0aed711561)

11. imo when you say you believe in something , you stand up for it even when it doesn ' t benefit you . if you believe in freedom , then you have to protect people ' s freedom to do things you don ' t want to do . otherwise you were lying about valuing freedom .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

12. ok , please inform me about this joke . i have seen it and haven ' t get it , if it ' s a video or something i will watch it rn because i ' m at a loss . fell free to whoosh me or something .
   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

13. i have never stated that disobeying an officer means you deserve to die . i don  t think that at all , i think that anyone when encountering the police should obey an officers orders because it gives you the best chance of getting through the situation with a a better outcomelesser charges and b reduces risk of bodily harm . please don  t put hateful intentions onto me as i wouldn  t apply them to you . i  ll i want is for people to be more informed on police work , by doing so we make lives easier for everyone
   (ID: 350ebf5f22b005c6fa011b8241361bb7184ec8d5)

14. you have got to be kidding . how in the hell do you classify this as racism ?
   (ID: 7928bd3c3e727c94ff476240a27ed7199d92d666)

15. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

16. why are you wooshing me you happened to explain the joke
   (ID: 2264050ea82d909575d6593daf8246fa8655751e)

17. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .
   (ID: f7356e924b370675e942b29b9c2184dc895ea5b7)

18. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

19. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

20. oh god you are fucking stupid i already answered that dumbass question before you answered it . also , quit projecting i  m in between rolls on a machine i operate so sometimes i have to hurry typing . but back to your stupid question , you  re just so sheltered it  s unfathomable for you to actually be in a situation where racism applies . you just wanna be like everyone else , huh , lil puss puss ? i got a question for you , how about you pm me your address  an adress where we can meet up so i can show you what it  s like to suffer real racism , bitch boi .
