1. you gotta look at the context of the scene . the lizardman was extremely strong but slow as a snail . kirk was nimble and fast but not near as strong . so after looking at this a little more objectively and considering what i just said . , i would have to say yea , you are right . this is the shittiest fight scence ever . pretty funny after smoking a fat one though . i remember many years ago , every week night at midnight , after everyone finished their homework , a bunch of guys would crowd in my dorm room and get high while watching star trek . it ' s a great show when you have a buzz .
   (ID: f76420437c1e4fb2e8ba8a9e9b0e116c7fc513ab)

2. this makes me uncomfortable for no reason .
   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

3. one good hit . if the other guy just swarms you w  punches  ties up with you which is what most people do , getting that shot in with a tire iron is gonna be tough . so if that ' s all you ' ve got in terms of offense , you ' re kinda screwed .
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

4. well , i often think there ' s a reason why fictional journals and diaries don ' t tend to last more than a year the ones that i ' ve read , anyway . it also brings to mind something i once heard about creating stories  " is this the character ' s most exciting time of their life , and if not , why aren ' t you showing us that ? " now , an immortal ' s diary set at some point , past or present , that covers just a short and exciting period of their life , yeah i ' d read that , but digit years sounds like too much . plus , as a fleshy human , it ' d be hard to relate to anything of that scale unless there were other immortals with whom the experience was being shared , but then i wonder what difference would the lengthy time make ? having said that , i ' ve been wrong before , and if you can make it work then great !
   (ID: e2865528dd17e86320ca523d3db462efa29e7ca7)

5. hope this gets added with the heavy update , i will literally spend my life savings for an unusual of this
   (ID: d72952657a3571deff985040e565d95d8206db60)

6. just make a new character ! that  s part of the game ! learning and trying new builds ! just re  level another character ! it  s endless excuses over at that community when the fact of the matter is  the game is complicated for the sake of being complicated . plus , the story  theme  tone is nothing great like diablo digit and digit were . poe is not a valid replacement for diablo in my eyes .
   (ID: 9414b9913220ebe2601862e3001aac74ebcffe33)

7. not exactly sure what you mean , but the only thing to do while peeing is hitting into the bowl , which isn ' t to hard .

   (ID: c57c1c4a7bc322137f33348912909a05c50dd624)

10. well , i don ' t go around telling everyone i don ' t believe in the bible and all that nonsense . and i believe there are many people like me . it ' s easier to say nothiing most of the time unless confronted by one of those crazy people who want to send you to hell because you don ' t believe exactly like they do .
   (ID: fca46720f9aa154a0559b1e4d2d28cb0df46b00a)

11. ahh fuck it , humanity ' s had a good run . argue your point till she says whatever , at that point you ' ve won , . but you ' ll never have sex with her or any of her friends again
   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

12. no . what i  m saying is check it if you do have intercourse . it  d be even better to not have intercourse if you don  t want kids or cannot afford the expenses , that makes sense . if you cannot afford kids yet get pregnant , you knew the risks and took them , you should have no right to kill the baby .

   (ID: 3a74a7f224822b70fc5b403157367714c46b161a)

14. you look like a discount model or aspiring actress type , you probably post black and with photos on instagram of coffee , that is heavily edited so you can live your fake ass life , you also say things like don  t talk to me before my morning coffee . high school will probably be the best part of your life you basic person if i am right you life has been lived a thousand times and it is such a cliche
   (ID: 87173aaf55980a77c94bd30c851c39fb0b52ff2e)

   (ID: fd9de666ca1e952a2f9c7367d60476a6d4b8b996)

17. yeah , i don ' t care of tseries vs pewdiepie either . i enjoyed his content in digit  digit , but i was like digit in digit . i agree that rewind is trash , but i also hate the memes about it . also , i stopped using youtube for almost half an year , i do not like it . i only watch simple history , geography now , armchair historian , half as interesting , seeker , allan pan , crash course , it ' s okay to be smart and others , but all of them rarely . i use reddit but i am losing a bit interest . anyways , returning to the subject , i agree with you

18. One of my favorite things is quotes.
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

19. that ' s the problem . they shouldn ' t be yours . the system would be far more fair to all styles of play if collecting the oro from the kill of another simply removed it instead of giving you points . i know for a fact that you are against players joining your server just to hide or not actually participate in battle for the sake of making it through the event . in my opinion , spamming movement techs , not actually killing anybody , and only stealing oro is just as destructive to the point of " pvp " as sitting there hiding or feeding oro . rewarding people for doing so is a bad idea , and it ' s part of the reason people continue to complain about pvp and treat it like garbage . there ' s a reason i used the word " relatively . there ' s a mile of difference between hitting a fast  moving , erratic target with a bullet  projectile and simply swinging a melee weapon in proximity to them . whether or not i fall under the definition of your pretentious jargon is irrelevant . thanks for the clip , but it completely misses the point of what i ' m talking about . there ' s a reason oro theft is a popular complaint .
