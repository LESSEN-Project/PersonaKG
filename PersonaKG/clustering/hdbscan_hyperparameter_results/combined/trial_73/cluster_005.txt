1. i couldn  t back a source on one thing which was actually quite unrelated . how about you back a reliable source that states the refugees are going to rape and kill us all . is hitler your trigger word or something ?
   (ID: e3a8d029dbe0e064b831a416498d58bb3aec1eda)

2. you should see his previous speeches where he essentially generalized the population of mexico as a bunch of rapists , murderers , and thieves . i can ' t figure out the exact reason , but this has to be a smoke screen . someone , somewhere is doing something diabolical , but we ' re fixated on trump and what he will say next . tl  dr illuminaughty touched my body .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

3. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

4. for one  you didn  t answer my question . but my point  is not that it makes me uncomfortable . my point is that laws , rights , privileges , and all governing cannot be based on a subjective  feeling  regardless of how deeply rooted it is . if i can be ticketed for using the wrong pronoun in cities like toronto , where does it stop ? does nobody get that  s it  s not always about the specific example  situation at hand but a bigger picture ? for fuck sake , it  s a slippery slope . years ago people were saying  what  s next , defending pedophiles ?  and look . exactly what is happening i don  t give a fuck how you feel or what you do , but you get the same set of rules i do . and back to my original point  the left is so  science science science  but basic fucking biology is literally ignored to appease people  s  deeply rooted sexual bullshit .  just wait , you will see how this is not about who cuts their dick off and wears a dress but an endless rabbit hole of subjective legislation .

5. i haven ' t told what you can and can ' t find funny , i ' ve told you what is innapropriate to say , there ' s a difference . when i said it was a joke , you said this  " no , it ' s not . jokes are meant to be funny to more people than just you . " sure you might not be saying that i didn ' t find it funny , but you were saying that no one else finds it funny . which is wrong . you are wrong .  my actions here were mostlt for the benefit of the op . you ' re words most likely bothered them in a big way , and as well as wanting to stand up to someone behaving like you did , i also wanted to show the op that someone would stand up for them and hopefully counter how you made them feel . a person on the internet who is mature enough will understand that most people will be sarcastic when given the chance . especially since he didn ' t put a " serious " tag on his post . my comment was very much clearly a joke , made obvious by the exclamation point . the fact that you got so triggered by it just highlights your immaturity and inability to recognise jokes on the internet . you might find that this flaw , this cluelessness to social cues , is one of the reasons you were bullied .  think what you want of my actions , i feel like i did the right thing . you didn ' t do anything wrong . you are just acting like a stuck up bitch . you ' re like that one person that always takes a joke seriously , gets offended because it isn ' t a " clean joke " and complains about it while other people just laugh .  and well done for admitting you made a dick move , most people don ' t have the balls to go back and admit a mistake . no need to congratulate me on something everyone like me will do , this is just showing how naive you are . there is no mistake , there never was a single mistake . i am a dick . people like me will always admit to acting like a dick . why do you think i do the things i do ? i ' m not oblivious like you .

6. the explanation to a cooling and warming planet is a natural cycle . in the digit ' s it was " global cooling . more recently it was " global warming . since neither of those bogey men ever materialized it is just called the vague " climate change . also , a large amount of environmentalists point their fingers at the united states as the bad guy . imagine that . i say start with china and then get back to me . how certain does one have to be you ask ? digit  or no deal . i am all for a clean world for all living things . no one likes pollution and unhealthy practices . however , i consider it the height of human arrogance to believe we can actually influence the environment to the degree many claim . i dismiss the attitude of " it might be happening so we must do something . i find this to be absurd thinking . it looks like you and i shall respectfully agree to disagree .

7. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

8. you didn ' t understand . not an issue my friend . let me say it again for you . there ' s a site that high school kids use , it ' s called hidden answers . i ' m pretty sure you must have heard of it . pretty boring site . on the site , you ask questions . and a person , understandably , had asked a question . me , being a nice and polite person , pursued to answer the question , which was regarding a not very well known library site . i was shocked that someone else knew about it , so i went to answer it . the question was regarding the link and any mirrors that could be used . note  as i ' m sure you ' d know , onion sites are jumbled up letters and numbers . i did not know what this link truly was but i did assume it was to a site that i had visited numerous times before . clicked the link , and up came a forum for child abuse . the literature was very detailed . no media content , so just headlines and the names of other child abuse sites . there was lots of them . it was not nice . it was very descriptive . lots of sites . hundreds , maybe thousands i ' m not sure . i don ' t know the legitimacy of these sites . i did not click them . but i do assume they were real . i hope i cleared this up for you my friend just remember , be polite . you don ' t know what others are going through . if you don ' t believe someone , ask them for proof . but do not accuse them of horrible things . it really is not nice . i hope you have a good day , stay blessed

9. they are facts as you see them . your need to mock makes you an asshole and is a mistake i am trying to correct i a way you understand . further mockery . who ' s denying the facts , anyway ? to me its not what your doing its how your doing it .
   (ID: f15c79447707a6e701285e8c59cc3aa25d54daa6)

10. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

11. even if your reverse generalizations don ' t hurt anyone because of power imbalances , does that make it morally right to do so ? i think we should try to love each other from both directions . we can complain about inequality righteously without generalizing groups of people . it ' s wrong to generalize anyone , no matter their color , even when the generalized group is powerful enough to not be affected by it . aaaaand let the name  calling begin .
   (ID: 6cb8904cf2faf74f712ddb1c620007fe43bf46df)

12. well i could explain it to you , but i can  t understand it for you .
   (ID: 4776f36398122cafa421393accf6939d82603a44)

13. never said i ' d stop replying to you for good , i made it clear i was talking about the specific post i said it in . it really wasn ' t a struggle , just search dbd on f13 sub . doesn ' t matter when it happened . it happened and you were proven wrong and can ' t handle that fact . i made a reddit account a month ago , yeah . not sure why new accounts have to be considered troll but . cool ? if anything , just proves my point that you ' re always paranoid . i mean i don ' t reply to nothing , but like everything else mentioned , keep living in denial , i guess .
   (ID: 8bc3c38873da8df8d450deb17fd3c4a602037c65)

14. why does it matter how i respond to you ? your argument is invalid .
   (ID: 4126a6a9d5a548a6bed5e0c4992792b1c10f2b92)

15. i ' m not going to downvote anything you say because i ' m open to anything you have to say . the question wasn ' t asking for evidence . the question was asking about what makes each individual believe in god . and you don ' t , so you kinda wasted your time by coming in here and generally just trying to start an argument . when you say there is no evidence , you are only approaching reality through what you see and feel from your own perspective , which is all any of us can really do . thing is , everyone has a different view of reality . that in itself is mind boggling . we are a collective consciousness trying to make sense of this whole thing . even me and you right now are like synapses firing in a huge brain right now trying to imagine two sides of this coin . but yeah whatever man , blow jobs and garbage , everything is nothing , and we may as well just fuck the earth to death because it ' s gonna happen eventually , right ?

16. when they riot they also block ambulances from tending to the wounded . this is assuming the worker was black which is a fair assumption .
   (ID: 24bccbf5956c17ad493afaca1dced8dd5090f865)

17. just recently i was on my school  s subreddit and commented on a post concerning the strike that  s on right now . the post was a rant from an anonymous ta that was full of anger and hatred toward their students . they complained that the school treated them like shit which is why they  re on strike . okay , fine , maybe that  s the case . but then they proceeded to swear at and belittle their own students which makes me want to see their side less . so i posted a comment asking how exactly they were treated poorly and what the whole thing was . i also told them that they should at least try to understand that the strike is financially killing us . i also said that i know it isn  t that simple , but if it  s so bad and it has been for a while , just quit your job . even if it  s hard to find a new one , it  s not worth it . then i got a reply from the same person who posted the rant , under a different account seeing as their old one was deleted , and they threw a whole slew of insults my way . such as  you probably still live with your parents you fucking retard . you don  t understand shit , maybe see the bigger picture before you run your dumbass mouth .  sorry what ? i literally just asked how they were treating you poorly . and i wasn  t even rude . i  m sorry ? i then told them that , i do in fact not live with my parents and if i did so what ? i  m really young . then i asked for them to explain to me , please what exactly is going on with them in terms of how they  re treated so i can understand them better . but instead i got  you  re young so that explains why you  re talking out of your ass . stop rambling on about this fucking shit , you don  t know what you  re talking about .  the fuck ? thankfully people stuck up for me and the ta got downvoted to oblivion . but they had a rebuttal for almost everything and avoided answering any questions in regards to clarifying their rant . the post was then locked due to fear of rising conflict . why does this ta not understand that insulting me makes me want to help and understand them less ? if they had explained themselves it would have been much easier

18. wow a trumper yeah if you voted for him your a racist moron weather hillary was a bad candidate is imaterial and if you think democratic socialism and socialism are the same thing just shows how out of touch with reality you are . hopefully one day you ' ll go back to school and try again
   (ID: 0def2b70456d7a000d0e2b3611ac80cd2990e21c)

19. yeah , it ' s a real problem . everyday i hear the same thing , " we should segregate blacks because they are naturally more violant " , and " if you really think about it hitler wasn ' t even a bad person " every fucking day , why can ' t we be a better nation like china that cares about all of it ' s citizens .  s
