1. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !

2. so he is name  calling and spreading gossip ? that tells you a lot about the person he is . it doesn ' t say anything about you . just be honest about what happened .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

3. if you  re on a break it means you  re not together at the moment , right ? if you  re expected to continue to be faithful then i feel like instead if a break it  s better to work through things as a couple . i guess i don  t really get the idea of a  break  that  s not a break  up in a relationship . anyway , be transparent with her if the time comes that you discuss getting back together .
   (ID: 3f4f5511095f668b3c84312b8bfeb87b30dd8f03)

4. i understand . i feel ya . depression is certainly not a dealbreaker for me , since i have it . it  s just that i  m constantly trying to better myself and get outside my mental filing cabinet of toxic thoughts . i try to be optimistic towards new beginnings with men , but the ones i meet are just bathing in their own sadness . even though i  m depressed , i know i  m lucky . i don  t think you should feel guilty for being sad , what do they say  you have to go through it to get past it ? something like that .
   (ID: 256407c5e6c8d9342d8aabf5c9c392fc179ba9f3)

5. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

6. if he say to his brother " i wanted to sleep with your girl " he will get mad obviously . so you can either say nothing and after some time things will be normal again or you can say everything and hope that you won ' t make them angry . but whatever you do , do not go with " little moves " like wanting to apologising or something like that because you are going to make them confused and maybe angry .
   (ID: dcb1bc1d0feb2af72f09ec35633379706e2b36f0)

7. im sorry they are making you feel this way man i hear you . i can relate and it fucking sucks when your own family treats you like this . how old are you ? maybe save up and move out as quickly as you can . its not permanent , youll get through it !
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

8. sometimes you have to take care of number one , regardless of how others might feel . it  ll be a different story if he was actually trying to get help , you have no reason to feel like the bad guy .
   (ID: b5cc14fd703a97548093b4e06f7e3e92575b80b9)

9. well you are setting yourself up for a fall . you said she  s super religious , this will not end well for you . she will either make you go to some other crazy jesus freak that will attempt to rid these devils from you , lol , or she will blow a nut just like you said she does and call you a fag and want you to get out . now sit back and take all that in because you are heading down a path that has no positive outcome for you . sorry . you already said who she is . good luck dude .
   (ID: 3cd64a42c43aaba8bcfe70482cd19250f58de2f0)

10. you gotta get out , this is the tip of the iceburg . if you want a red flag this is a huge one . as a matter of self preservation you get the hell out . been there it does not get better with time . don ' t be a schmuck
   (ID: 02e4b90101e07338b4251209256c01652a022c5d)

11. this wasn ' t your fault . yes , it was inappropriate masturbate in someone else ' s house especially govern the fact that you had already had a run in before , but , and i can ' t stress this enough , you were not at fault . you did not have sex with a married woman . you were raped by a married woman . it must be beneficial for you to speak to a professional , one who specializes in working with rape victims and rape advocacy . there is no right way of doing way to proceed , but a professional can help you find the best way for you . our would be beneficial in my opinion to have a record of what happened , should she end up pregnant . a therapist or rape counselor will help document what happened , but will only release or testify of you allow it . if you need to vent , feel free to message me . i ' m not a professional , but i ' m more than happy to lend an ear .

12. i ' ve reasoned that because christianity was my coping mechanism for such a long time i never developed a way to handle life . that ' s a really aware and mature way of looking at it . but seriously , just enjoy life . don ' t worry about the big issues for a bit , find something that ' ll make you happy and do it . go out with your friends , play a video game , do something you ' ve always wanted to do but have never done before . reality isn ' t nice , but that doesn ' t mean we have to think about it all the time .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

13. you do need to suck it up eventually . at the end of the day you ' re the only one in control of your own happiness . this seems mean but it ' s the truth .

14. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .

15. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .

16. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path

17. don  t blame yourself for being cheated on . no one deserves to be cheated on . it  s her being fucking shitty and don  t let anyone including yourself tell you otherwise
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

18. i feel like im at edge because i honestly thought i had real willpower to stop and now here i am failing multiple times . constantly persuading myself to give in and juat have a drink and now i cant even last longer then digit days without a drink . its heart breaking and im afriad about how this has come to be . i juat dont know anymore

19. basically at the end of this year it is as if the whole world shattered for me and i had the possibility to start again . during the summer i got the chance to create some new great friendships , i joined the scouts and most of my current friends all come from that group and i finally built memories i want to remember . it is something i never felt because i ' ve always been classified as weird and i rarely met people really interested in me . so when i met this girl circa four years ago and she made me believe we were friends , she became my world if it makes sense . she manipulated me very easily and then she left me roughly once i started questioning her ways . now i can see through her crap and the only reason i don ' t want to see her anymore is that i feel like everything has changed and i don ' t want to get back to that world of rumors and fake friendships .

20. this boy is not worth your time . just dump him now and move on to someone that ' s not going to shame you repeatedly .
