1. im gonna tell you , mate , taking your life only hurts the people around you . not one single person is thinking life would be better without you . high school is no determination factor anyway , life changes after high school and you can make life what you want it . you can start and entirely new life for yourself , you ' re moving on to how you want to impact the world . i know talking to someone isnt at the top of everyones lists when it comes to mental health but from experience , it really helps . reddit is a really good place to get your emotions out mate . there are lots of people on here with the same problems you ' re going through and we ' re trying to overcome it together . we ' re here for you , mate .

2. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

3. dont worry i gotchu fam , see im digit myself and i have a gf who likes to show off skin obviously not nude . anyways if it was a real concern id explain to her one last time that if makes you uncomfortable seeing another guy is getting pictures of her with only a towel on . if shes sending you spicer pics then id see this as less of a concern anyways if this still continues ask for her friends what they think try to get them on your side and from there just ask them to help you convince her to stop . if this still doesnt do anything ask for an ultimatum this is a last resort . ultimatums work digit  of time because it makes the other feel trapped and stuck with an a question thatll change the course of the relationship . if the ultimatum succeeds be extremely nice to the other person otherwise theyll think they made the wrong decision . if otherwise then there are plenty of fish in the sea . let me know what you end up doung because im actually interested

4. hey . firstly you need to speak to someone be it a doctor or the samaritans , someone . secondly why are you looking up reasons instead of looking inwards and seeing what the actual issue is . do you have depression or something that maybe people around you don ' t know how to handle ? what kind of person are you ? are you kind ? thoughtful ? generous with your time ? empathetic ? honest ? nice ? these are all traits that people like . or are you selfish ? negative ? deceitful ? apathetic ? narcissistic ? irresponsible ? egotistical ? you can change your behaviour and your characteristics . you are not always going to be the person you perceive yourself to be now . everyone has the potential to change and grow . believe in yourself . only you have the ability to make yourself happy . don ' t depend on others to validate you . mind yourself .

5. well again , not to take away from your problems , but everyone has them . even those that seem to have all their shit together are dealing with something . hang in there my friend .
   (ID: 7c5209c3b827e0de0cd436466f80ce09b615606b)

6. she  s taking my advice and basically just dropping subtle hints to see if she is bi or gay . asking her outright could go multiple ways and , like you , doesn  t wanna risk her friendship but is contemplating if it  s worth the risk since if she is bi or gay they might end up in a relationship . so it  s a difficult scenario . see what kinda friends she hangs out with since gays tend to congregate in my experience and find out what her previous relationships were like if she  s had any . so far it  s going pretty well and hannah is pretty sure she  s bi but still needs to find out more before she moves forward with it . oh yeah i actually had a situation similar to that with my partner , neither of us knew if the other was gay or straight or not . i  m pan so and i  ve dated girls and guys in the past , they  ve dated only one girl and regretted the relationship . after i found out they were pan too because i noticed a lot of their friends were gay , they had an even amount of girl to guy friends , they never denied being gay , etc so i asked them out and apparently they liked me for months on end . now we  re in an almost three year relationship . i hope all goes well for you smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

7. my opinion , go out more . not to a bar or club more like a social event at the park find someone whose doing something similar to something you feel passionate about . ex girl jogging in the park go join her keep her company ask like how long have you been jogging here ? then improvise from there obviously ask her for her name just dont make it the first question so you seem interested at her hobby aswell as herself . next try to get into the friend area yes i know you don ' t want to be here but this stage is where youll learn the most truthful information about her . next start sharing life moments you wouldnt tell most people just think before you say it so it doesn ' t sound like extra baggage for the person . eventually youll know when to ask her on a date

8. i mean you could just ask if he wants to hang out just the two of you , and if je suggests more friends to bring take it as a hint he doesn ' t like you like that .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

9. ahhhhh . that  s not okay . i mean i get that there are stay at home moms and all the power to them , but to rely on someone to keep you fed and clothed and then treat them like shit . i am a stay at home mom . who works a full time job out of our home as well as a part time job for a family member  s business . i might not have lunch packed for him every day , but he has food to eat and a decently clean house and love and respect  which i also have . it  s kinda sad for your ex wife tho  she hasn  t been able to let go and enjoy her life because she  s too busy being a shit .

10. maybe i ' m coming off as too depressed . i wouldn ' t say i ' m officially " depressed " i live my own independent life . i go to school in a major that i love . i workout digit  digit times a week , i taught myself to play guitar , i fly  fish any free chance i get , i love hanging out at winery ' s , i love to cook for other people and i love to just be outside . today i did a ten mile bike ' n ' hike . the problem is , is that i do most of these activities alone or with my guy friends . i don ' t know though . maybe i do need some form of therapy and anti  depressant . the main issue is , it would mean i ' d have to tell my parents . i don ' t want to admit to them that i have a social anxiety that comes from fear of initiating a conversation with a woman . my dad made a joke the other day that he thought i was gay because i ' ve never brought home a girl from school . i took it personally . i don ' t know why i ' ve built this up to be so much harder than it should be .

11. that ' s where i need to be . in a space in my head where i can ignore it or walk away from it . i ' m hung up on being angry that he gets to treat people however he wants without consequence . i honestly don ' t know how you didn ' t react with your father behaving like that ! i ' d have been terrified ! it ' s nice of you to still help him with his medical treatment even though he certainly doesn ' t sound grateful . i can see that having boundaries is important . i guess i need to know what mine are and stick to them at all times . i don ' t know if having cptsd is what makes my emotions take over when he does these things . something to talk to my psych about i suppose ! thank you so much reginaagnon , your kind words help more than you know ! red  heart

12. the same thing happened to me . i do believe that there are induviduals who misuse sm and take it too far crossing the line to rape . mine eased me into a light sm world . very light . made me trust him . told me all of these things . then when i was pulling away from him he went from digit  digit and choked me into a submissive state . when you fear for your life and that you won ' t wake back up the next time he chokes you until you pass out , you go into shock . or at least i did . i thought " i can ' t say no because if he doesn ' t get what he wants he will hurt me more " and that was a serious thing for me because i couldn ' t possibly have imagined that he wanted more . but he did . then he went right past sm and straight towards torture and humiliation . all without my consent . he knew exactly what he was doing . he knew from our previous discussions that i never would have allowed that to happen . he also knew me . so he choked me enough to make it happen for him . i ' m sorry you went through all that . sm can be really tricky , my personal experience aside . because i really don ' t have any . but i did do a lot of reading on it after my rape . to help me understand why . it takes a lot of trust . if someone goes against your comfort zones it is not a good sign . a sm shoukd always be respectful no matter what .

13. i don ' t know about the falling in love and all that . but if you ' re looking for advice take it from someone digit years older than you . forget about her . don ' t even think about it anymore . you ' re young as fuck and there ' s plenty of women out there . and don ' t fall in love .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

14. i don ' t think the issue here is that you asked for his last name . maybe you should just take his words at face value  that it ' s taken so long to actually meet up , that he ' s lost interest . but to answer your question  i personally don ' t usually like to give out my full name to someone before meeting them because of social media stalking . i mean it ' d be pretty hard for anyone to stalk me anyways because i don ' t use my full name anywhere besides facebook and my setting for that is pretty restricted , but still . also why did you feel the need to know his full name anyways ?

15. not really , but if you don  t like your life change it . take a step and talk to someone my dude doesn  t hurt i was a shy dude but still had a lot of friends . i wouldn  t think of your teenage years wasted because you e spent time with yourself either you probably know more about yourself than a lot of others . stay strong home dog and go talk to someone about how you feel .
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

16. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

17. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

18. once i fully realized i was an alcoholic and couldn  t control myself like i had been desperately trying to do , i was like  fuck it , what can i do to make this downward spiral faster !  . eventually , i had a moment of being willing to try something different , even though i didn  t know how or what to do . six years ago , i went to a crappy rehab , where we couldn  t even have coffee and i didn  t always want to be there , but , i  ve stayed sober every day since . i  m totally not extraordinary in any way , i just decided to give doing something different a chance and be open to not  knowing  what was gonna happen . i hope you find some comfort , regardless of your next move or circumstances .
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

19. you have the right to be upset or angry , or any other emotion you are having right now . your wife needs to know exactly how you feel and take ownership for causing it your wife should be willing to do anything for you that would help you build that trust back up . no more expectations of privacy , no more hidden anything in her life . she needs to be an open book . look at her bank account , check her on  line presence , monitor her calls , get all of her passwords , and  or whatever you feel is needed . then you need to work on regaining that trust . if this is going to be a life sentence for her , then end the marriage now . you need to work toward her having privacy again some day . just not right now . there is no such thing as too much communication in smarriage .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

20. cut your loss and move on . obviously easier said than done but sitting around wondering what you did wrong , why she would do that , etc . is only going to make the hurt last longer . just do your best to forget about it and maybe try something easy like tinder to keep you distracted . you don ' t need to use it for sex or anything unless you want to but talking to girls on there is super easy . keeps me distracted when i am hung up on someone .
