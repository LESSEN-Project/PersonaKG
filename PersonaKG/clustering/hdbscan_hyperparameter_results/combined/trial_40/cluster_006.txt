1. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

2. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

3. ok sorry , i might not have been clear enough about that point . i ' ve edited the post now .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

4. i am trying to show you how i feel when you tell me to do something because of your " lord " i won ' t stop cursing until you give me a fucking reason other than a deity with a debatable existence said it isn ' t okay . why don ' t you try and help those over at atheism or at least get some questions answered by somebody smarter than me ? many people there are smarter than me .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

5. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .
   (ID: f7356e924b370675e942b29b9c2184dc895ea5b7)

6. yes i  m fully aware , but through consistent elaboration then maybe i could help at least one person learn the truth and show them the difference . as long as just one person learns from me , then my efforts are all worth it
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

7. hahahahaha . no buddy . telling someone words is not a threat to them . actually committing acts is a threat to them . they have shown time and time again that they are willing to actually kill people . stop fucking defending these fucks . they ' re scum . and they deserve everything that is coming to them .
   (ID: fe56409176d2a6089f323227d5b07061f851d63b)

8. i feel like you invite this kind of opposition view to your thoughts when you post them unasked for in a sub called unpopular opinion . we ' re not talking about laws here , were talking about your unpopular opinion .
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

9. you could have said " oh yeah , cool " . instead you got defensive and downvoted me . a fucktard says what ?
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

10. i  m not talking about your initial comments , i  m talking about the whole conversation . and during this conversation , you  ve been all over the place . you  ve told me that you  re just giving me food for thought and i shouldn  t actually change what i  m doing , then you blatantly told me you  re telling me to change what i  m doing . you  ve called me apathetic , then you  ve told me i  m taking it personally . i should stop reading into your comments , but you get to interpret mine however you want . now you  re saying you enjoy disney movies , but you draw the line at writing quotes on the board . that  s not where i draw the line , and i  m sorry you feel that  s wrong . we could discuss the meaning of that song and why i specifically chose that lyric , but i  m not really wanting to open that can of worms with so many other things already on the table . what you  re not seeming get is that i  m not trying to do any mixing . i  m not making grey , as you suggest . i  m keeping the two issues entirely separate . and the definition of apathy is showing a lack of emotion or an indifference . i am telling you that i have thought a lot about my stances on these issues and am far from apathetic .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

11. lets take a moment to appreciate how much you assumed i implied from my accusations of your implications . have fun with your lesson in reading into things
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

12. okay , you ' re trolling . you got me . i give up .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

13. i have never stated that disobeying an officer means you deserve to die . i don  t think that at all , i think that anyone when encountering the police should obey an officers orders because it gives you the best chance of getting through the situation with a a better outcomelesser charges and b reduces risk of bodily harm . please don  t put hateful intentions onto me as i wouldn  t apply them to you . i  ll i want is for people to be more informed on police work , by doing so we make lives easier for everyone
   (ID: 350ebf5f22b005c6fa011b8241361bb7184ec8d5)

14. huh ? i did not say that . were you answering to a deleted comment ?
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

15. i add comments instead of editing , because i doubt people will re  read my comment . worried , maybe not , but you were the one who wouldn ' t take my word for it . sources dont usually help people that already have their minds made up .
   (ID: d8014467041b98317d9f1dec2b0dae4ff9405b91)

16. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

17. I am misunderstanding.
   (ID: 41d66f92509db20d202cca3f348509c6cd25586b)

18. someone doesn ' t play the game for the same reason you do , therefore they are objectively wrong , nice argument there .
   (ID: 2a4bb889e40b61bb1755181c2b46750d3a082604)

19. ahh , now you ' re playing stupid , huh ? way to show intellectual honesty . really . well done . thanks again for displaying what fucking liars you all are . way to show , again , that you have to lie through your teeth just to feel like you aren ' t a bunch of fucking rats . seriously . thank you .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

20. lol ad hominems are a sign that you ' re triggered . calm down and see it for what it is , humor . if you cannot i certainly can ' t help you . i ' m not going to respond to you after this reply you ' ll just have to stew in your misguided anger . have a great day smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes
