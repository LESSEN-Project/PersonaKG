1. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .

2. i don ' t really feel like he holds me back , but my life isn ' t the way i want it to be living with him . i ' m gonna say the same shit everyone else says , i do love him and i enjoy being with him . but lately it doesn ' t feel the same . he ' s a good person but i feel like i don ' t really like him anymore . maybe it ' s my mindset but i feel like we don ' t have fun or enjoy each other ' s company . but if i leave i know i ' ll miss him and be sad . i ' m not going to go jump on another guys dick .

3. tale a day . sit down and talk . spend all the time finding something easy to talk about . don  t let her leave . if she gets mad tell her why , explain very clearly why you  re sitting her down and just talking all day . let her know that you are just worried . this isn  t her problem alone , it  s very much about both of you and you need to make her understand that the main reason you get in a relationship is to help each other and be happy . take all the time you can without hurting your own mental health and spend it with her . i hope you and your so will get past this and go forward even happier than ever .

4. i don  t think it  s women that like you less , it  s just not the best women who are acting like this with you . i mostly have female friends i knew before and after transitioning and they were all really supportive , same with any male friends i had . they are good people , so they accepted me wholeheartedly . i suggest finding those types of people in your life , regardless of gender yknow ?

5. he ' s digit years older than you and you ' re gonna have a miserable life ahead of you if you stay . you gotta worry about yourself first . you do what you think you need to do .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

6. " sucking it up " is a bad phrase to use imo . idk your life , but " accept " is a word that works for me . i am me , the world is the world . if you ' ve been sheltered , use every experience as a lesson that helps guide you in your journey exploring the world . going back to your bad trip , personally i think it ' s your body trying to tell you something . we have amazing , intuitive instincts that are buried within us but we ' re afraid when they try to tell us something . even if it ' s scary , you have to embrace what you feel so that you can get to know yourself a little better . baby steps are absolutely ok for this process .

7. sounds like she  s too shallow to understand your pov and what you  ve been through . personally , that trait alone could make or break a relationship for me .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

8. i know you guys are gonna tell not be with someone who i can ' t trust you ' re goddamn right .  but hear me out . maybe we ' re just doing something wrong ? mmmm nope . you shouldn ' t date someone you can ' t trust .  i just wanna fucking know who she ' s talking to lol . bit controlling but okay . ask her if its that big of a deal .
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

9. eh , no big . you stop taking the estrogen and move on . shit happens . don ' t know why we have to pigeon hole people and make them miserable , in any capacity . be what you want to be , even if you change your mind later , and everyone else can go fuck themselves .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

10. cut your loss and move on . obviously easier said than done but sitting around wondering what you did wrong , why she would do that , etc . is only going to make the hurt last longer . just do your best to forget about it and maybe try something easy like tinder to keep you distracted . you don ' t need to use it for sex or anything unless you want to but talking to girls on there is super easy . keeps me distracted when i am hung up on someone .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

11. i totally understand . i have add and many times my parents at mad at me for stuff and i don ' t know why . then later it hits me and i ' m like shit this is totally my fault i ' m an idiot . i don ' t blame my parents at all for getting mad . many people with mental illnesses don ' t recognize there ' s a problem and that just makes it so much worse . all i can say is i hope everything turns out of for you and your brother eventually

12. i find people who have a drinking problem love to judge those who don ' t . i was told once that i ' m only fun when i drink by someone i mostly saw through the bottom of a wine glass , so i stopped drinking and hanging around that person . don ' t allow anyone to cross your boundaries , it ' s not worth it even a little . best of luck !

13. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

14. make sure you love yourself . be happy with doing things on your own and don ' t rush into anything without getting to know the other person well .

15. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

16. do you value your marriage vows ? because if you don ' t then maybe it would be better to leave your husband sooner rather than dragging out a relationship where you fundamentally disagree on some major aspects .
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

17. i ' m not going to give any more flak as i believe you have received more than enough . please just let your husband go . he deserves better . if you truly love him as you claim in your post , you would do so . holding onto him like this is just disgustingly selfish .
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

18. you have to remember as a child those pets are one of the few friends they have at home . i  d try breaking the news as soon as you can so she can at least try to understand . just tell her your situation and what you had to do .
   (ID: 74d9c413c2cf59d223d7510b599edf6b6b1df3a2)

19. being single does suck . i ' ve been single my entire life m16 . i usually cope by hanging out with friends . i know i ain ' t the best looking , nor am i fit . but yeah . i get how you feel . life does suck that way . whenever i feel down about being alone , i usually think " i ' ll find that person eventually " some day you will . just continue doing what you like , and hang out with your friends
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

20. in my limited experience  it ' s best to set boundaries clearly , but one issue at a time . you walking up to her mother and saying " you need to back off " immediately sets you up as the adversary trying to cut her off from her baby girl in the most important time . you ' ll be treated that way from that point forward . instead , you need to talk about the individual things with your wife so you have an agreed stance the next time they come up with your mil . it ' s way less likely to lead to war if you can hold your wife ' s hand and speak up for her saying ' we ' ve decided it ' s best if it ' s just us and the medical staff in the delivery room ' , ' we ' ve done the research and want to do x ' , etc . than if you go in by yourself and try to lay down the law to a mother about her child . you can be the one to make the statements , but they need to be phrased as joint decisions with your wife ' s clear if silent support . if your wife doesn ' t want to have those conversations alone alone , that ' s fine . her part becomes to deflect , i . e . " we ' ll talk about it next time we see you " , or just not respond when the mil isolates her on an issue . her backtracking or bargaining alone will kill any progress you make by standing strong together . talk to her about that , too . also , congrats and good luck !
