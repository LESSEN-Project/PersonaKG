1. that was a brilliant game . i remember playing that when it came out  2000ish ?  and thinking that video game graphics couldn ' t possibly get any better . still think that gp4 is the best f1 game ever made apart from possibly grand prix legends .

2. that wasn  t me who said that lol . i played the shit out of the first destiny . every dlc , did every raid , all of it . the game is absolute shit . i understand that that  s my opinion , but i truly do not get how people like that game . didn  t even waste my time buying the second one . so disappointing that bungie abandoned halo for this garbage

3. first off bud , i  ve played since alpha . secondly i didn  t say anything was over powered , you do know how to read don  t you ? they asked what we thought was the best character offensively , it  s an opinionated post , the  competitive  aspect of the subreddit has nothing to do with options or thoughts . your assumptions and negative responses are the exact reason this game is dying .

4. darksouls was the most challenging game i ' ve played in past decade , and imo is one of the best games ever made , so hyped they might remaster it next year . as an emotional wreck of a human being and welding a heart so deep one could say it ' s . the dark , the game and stories of the npcs really hit me hard .

5. it has significantly more edm than the first two albums but i still like it better than infamous . i ' m not sure this band will ever get back to the levels of geeving , maybe if they get a better screamer because angelo sounds pretty bad , but i can hope right ?

6. i see what you mean . i ' ve never played reach ' s multiplayer so i can ' t say much about the problems you mentioned , though they do seem pretty bad . personally my main draws were more from the single player modes , especially campaign . i thought the alien invasion story was actually quite good , since it showed how massive and powerful the covenant was , and how ill  equipped the humans really were to fight them . it was definitely more grounded and military  based than the other games , but i personally liked that sense of desperation and scale the setting gave off .

7. solid picks . erased is ridiculously good , time travel isn  t a done enough genre if you ask me . attack on titan , baccano , durarara , and cowboy bebop are some of my other favs .

8. yeah , the first week of season digit the planes were just fine to everyone , i didn ' t see a single post about how op it is until the freaking sword was realest . now the sword is gone people want to attack the planes now ? excuse me , what the fuck . i just think people doesn ' t want anything added in season digit if this is the case . whats the point of playing fortnite if you can ' t have fun and keep bitching on how everything added is ' op ' . in conclusion , plz stop this , bring back the sword , and subscribe to pewdiepie .

9. yeah , i don ' t care of tseries vs pewdiepie either . i enjoyed his content in digit  digit , but i was like digit in digit . i agree that rewind is trash , but i also hate the memes about it . also , i stopped using youtube for almost half an year , i do not like it . i only watch simple history , geography now , armchair historian , half as interesting , seeker , allan pan , crash course , it ' s okay to be smart and others , but all of them rarely . i use reddit but i am losing a bit interest . anyways , returning to the subject , i agree with you

10. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

11. how rock are we talking bout ? i personally think back in black is such a great album , i still play it every now and then .
   (ID: 5bb6e2d4db1d5ccf3a1f430564735551dfb4c28b)

12. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .
   (ID: 95c90f0b7430996843a42a4f365667a13e4c2eb5)

13. it does a good job at being a shooter , the single player is just an after thought , i really hate when games don ' t have a worthwhile single player mode to them because some weird reason most develpers probably don ' t even know but just go along with it because everyone does it . i am not a fan of multiplayer especially not online i don ' t know i just don ' t like it . so splatoon went in my opinion from interesting to it is a good concept . it is just focused on multiplayer and the single player seems to have no replay value

14. i think the movie is better than the series mostly because the movie used the lyrics
   (ID: 2e2a44cdfc726423ec202a2fe420543af441d1ad)

15. why people doesnt complain about egypt arc opening ? its awful , have you seen it with subtitles ? it may sound good in japanese but its awful . and if you say that its better than chase because it matches the situation then u can get your opinion and keep to you because nothing wil chage my mind . oh boy i cant even say that the only good part is when it is ending , because that oraoraoraoraora thing on the openingand the time stop part are just awful .

16. no mans sky always were a good game . you suckers just say it is  was bad because the creator overhyped it and lied about some features . blame the creator . not . the . creation . thats not just about nms , its about every fucking thing  your wife died giving birth to your child ? blame yourself for making her pregnant or dont blame anyone thats just one example . and also the game became really good after those updates . fuck you . haters gonna hate .  digit
