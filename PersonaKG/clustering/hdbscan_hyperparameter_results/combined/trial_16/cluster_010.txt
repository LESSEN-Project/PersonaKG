1. however , and don ' t down vote me here just for bringing up the contrary position the nuclear fireball in the center of our solar system seems to have a majority say in the activity , heat and weather patterns of the planet earth . currently there are zero sunspots  i direct you to nasa on the data . as a result earth ' s the climate has been shifting again . a bit " cooler " than what was anticipated by the computer models that al gore used . also  the temperature of mars has heated and cooled on the same curve as the earth , as measured by nasa . which may suggest that perhaps the sun has a say in both planet ' s temperatures . all said , however , if your opponent in your debate does not use this data , and is simply quoting rush limbaugh . i would say you need to dismiss this parrot and find new friends . again , even if there were significant proof pointing to the sun as the only cause of warming , i do not suggest that humanity should continue to waste resources and continue to use oil to make plastic bags , roads , and hummers .

2. ive watched the whole video and i am not sure if you read my post . my main argument is not autism . it is other minor damages caused from vaccines
   (ID: 23958be5bf9424a3f6c71e7474e54c2eabcfab9d)

3. lol , ok ok . i ' ll stop . dude , for you own sanity . realise that this is a shitpost . my account is a shitpost account . you are arguing with me on a heavily down voted thread that almost no one will ever see . look in the mirror , remind yourself that you are a human being that doesn ' t need to get upset about idiots on the internet that are clearly doing stuff to get a rise out others . cause dude . it ' s not ever gonna stop . get used to it .

4. the difference is , we aren ' t actually a threat to them . they ' re a threat to women like me , seeing as they constantly worship propped like elliot rodger and talk about how great he was . it ' s better that they take their frustrations out on themselves than another human being .
   (ID: fe56409176d2a6089f323227d5b07061f851d63b)

5. okay , you ' re trolling . you got me . i give up .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

6. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

7. i mean , i get it . we grow up and suddenly we ' re responsible for our own survival , when we only exist because someone else wanted us to . why do i have to get a job and pay bills and all that shitty stuff , when my parents are the ones that put me here ? don ' t know that you can really win in a court of law , and maybe you should suck it up and just deal . but i get it .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

8. hahaha no , i ' m sorry ! i think i know what ' s happening . i didn ' t object to you using the term pseudoscience , but to you defining as science with shaky bases . it ' s just flat out not science of any kind , only posing as such . that ' s the distinction i was trying to make you understand . i think i might have been a bit clearer , but i ' m on the phone , so i was perhaps too curt . sorry again .

9. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

10. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

11. how am i ridiculing incels ? i only asked a question . nothing about this post was meant to be derogatory .

12. digit i  m not straight digit wouldn  t it make sense to argue that nobody should be harassed for their sexuality . your hatred of straight people really confuses me .
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

13. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

14. many people are like that , you are even being judgmental and know  ishould ve done something  that makes much better then the rest of us
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

15. i add comments instead of editing , because i doubt people will re  read my comment . worried , maybe not , but you were the one who wouldn ' t take my word for it . sources dont usually help people that already have their minds made up .
   (ID: d8014467041b98317d9f1dec2b0dae4ff9405b91)

16. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

17. why would someone doubt this ?
   (ID: aa8abed66c32a0519ab922c1a606563d97de28fc)

18. oh come on . we all know that  s not true
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

19. why can  t everyone mind their own fucking business ? we all have our own weaknesses , some just happen to show on the surface

20. she is violating the child ' s body by having it torn up and sucked out of her . she is using the child ' s life as a sacrifice to her convenience . yes , slavery is always wrong . in a perfect world this wouldn ' t be a problem in the first place . but in the real world i choose the lesser of two evils . taking an innocent life to prevent your own suffering is wrong . please be intellectually honest and stop using the fringe cases as an excuse to justify the common occurrence . they are definitely worth considering , but even if they were justifiable , it doesn ' t mean the others are . i am pretty sure i have heard every reason that pro  choice advocates have for abortion . and so far , they don ' t change what i see as a very simple truth . it is always morally wrong to take an innocent human life . and , though you are free to disagree with my view on morality , i can ' t think of anything worse that one person could do to another . saving innocent life  saving bodily autonomy .
