1. i know they are different , i just didn ' t know if they are different versions of the flash or something . for example you can buy ' the flash ' pops from the tv show . you know this because the logo at the top of the box reflects this . i didn ' t know if one of these flash pops in the picture are from dc universe online or something . i cannot find any info on the reason for the change in logo to just release the same pop , with a slightly different costume .
