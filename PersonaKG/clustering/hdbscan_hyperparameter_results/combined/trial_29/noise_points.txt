12. you may want to play around with this idea  these gems are obviously powerful . there are many creatures in the world that want that power for their own ends , or simply just to acquire it for themselves . a powerful gem will attract interest from some people and creatures . a group of them being collected and held in the same area will attract them like a magnet . so just because your pc ' s are looking for them , doesn ' t mean there isn ' t someones else too .
   (ID: c018255fd73fced873eb4897821cd82620ba8fe2)

13. i have a very simple solution , use the dark ages v20 rules , it steamlines combat , i also have a couple house rules for combat . have your turn planned ahead of time . know what you want to do , or have your questions ready . feel free to converse with other pcs in between turns to coordinate . have your dice ready and roll fast . this is the most important advice i can give you about combat stop trying to make it challenging . just stop . stop trying to challenge the combat character every time you ' re in combat . he wanted to murder things , let him murder things , if he ' s able to slaughter ghouls with relative ease , let him do it , it doesn ' t need to be challenging unless he wants it to be , in which case it ' s far more effective to use single strong enemies than multiple weaker ones . making every single combat life or death , an insane challenge , etc . is unrealistic and gets grindy very quickly . use combat as a way to tell a story , not as a ' we need a combat ' scene . i would need to know the specifics of the combat pc in question before giving you any advice tho .

17. lol that ' s not what i meant . let me rephrase it . i have to do that for my pedantic kid all the time eventually everyone would be returning their worn out lifetime warranty shoes and getting new ones for free . when all their customers are doing this , how do they make money ?
   (ID: 6b04f3448a053338b902c242d1883da1e90dc7bb)

18. you know what , i  m gonna play devils advocate here and say if you really truly genuinely mean it and are willing to face the repercussions , say  in love with  . saying  i love      is thrown around far too much and has started to lose meaning
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

19. this is not quite what was in the question but . i was born in a catholic family and baptisted but i rejected faith as a small kid for some reason . i didn ' t like it . what made me rethink it later was the paranoia of estimating years that left me to live , like . i needed to use them as good as possible because there would be nothing after death . i was digit at the time . anyways my life has always been shit , it was full of tragedies that was so ironic that i thought and still think my life is literally joke . in addition i had depression that had been developing since i was like digit . i started praying because i had no better thing to do to fix it all . it started slowly getting better . my " dialogue with god " was the only conversation i would have during the day . i had no one to trust , nothing to lose . it ' s been digit years by now . still a lot of ironic shit happens to me , like i was cursed or something , but the depression vanished and isn ' t going to come back soon .
