Total from this dataset: 3530

1. i  m talking about in a survival situation dumbass , also , do you not know that most of the police officers , firefighters , military personnel , construction workers , are men . the people that keep our countries safe from other countries are mostly men , they risk their lives so that we could live in a good , relatively safe country , first worlders have the privilege to live safely , a lot of us don  t even know what danger really is . do you want to live in constant fear in a war zone ? no . no one does , but that  s the life that people unfortunately live . no matter what anyone does , there will still be crime , there will still be bad people , and there will still be poverty .
   (ID: 93c3b3d523de0afd404d3bcb4acdf023866f9281)

2. i don ' t mind a bit of rugby although i prefer league to union , but the thing annoys me about rugby fans is that they are incapable of not comparing everything that happens on the field to football . they love to talk about the superior moral code of rugby to football , but imagine if wayne rooney had been found guilty of eye  gouging , biting , punching , swearing at a referee , elbowing , headbutting and striking , and still not been sacked as england captain . it is absolutely not an exaggeration to say there would be questions in parliament and general moral outrage . but of course dylan hartley is a nice middle  class boy playing a nice middle  class sport , so it ' s all good .
   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

3. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

4. One of my favorite things is jasper.
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

5. sorry , i do not know much about these things . hope you will get more help from others who are into this subject . god bless !
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

6. One of my favorite things is hyper-masculine gun games.
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

7. thank you ! i ' m in a lot better of a place then i was a few days ago and now i think the storm has passed so now i can prepare for the next one
   (ID: 168d1161144e63a83a23f04ae4e64bd4b25684c0)

8. that ' s a very shallow assumption . also you can ' t tell me i can ' t . you ' re not even contributing any ideas related to the thread so why are you here anyway ? to put me down ? you ' re wasting your time . i got what i came for which was a little bit of light shed on a subject that i was more curious to learn about .
   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

9. One of my favorite things is risalamande.
   (ID: b5bfc53fa7245451bad229f942e351fdc7360321)

10. i hope you find the love you deserve . you ' re definitely more aware of the fact that fast moving relationships , are enticing at first but maybe not the most rewarding . here ' s to the opportunity for a better chance next time . everything happens for a reason
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

11. where can i find it ?

   (ID: 800762ac8d54632109094a4e9132fe0aed711561)

13. no . i don  t hate gays . or promote hate . just realize some people are don  t believe the same things i do . why not just go on and live your happy life . and not waste your energy on hating them . don  t give it power .
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

14. One of my favorite things is opening piety.
   (ID: aac80ac9ebef70ab8fe6bc14a8fcccb472099b84)

15. I own a payout.
   (ID: 7fcbabb8b5590a9f0879c20f0dc6ce0b503615d3)

16. yea i think that  s what it all comes down to at the the end of the day . i  m always looking for a quick fix or an escape or the easy way out , i need to just confront my problems . i know exactly who i wanna be , i  m just too lazy or scared to get out my comfort zone and just do it . but nobody can make the decision but me . no therapy , distractions , drugs are gonna do it for me . sorry if this is all rambling and incoherent , i  m still pretty blazed . but i think i  m starting to understand . you don  t know how much this means to me man , thanks
   (ID: 2401680976bbdfe87278659ff11173d22161b22d)

17. i don ' t think i ' ve ever known anyone ever admit to being a jerk to other people . that would actually be quite refreshing .
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

18. why ?
   (ID: aaee7c28c6f1f83a427cf3dccf635bb78656a19d)

19. One of my favorite things is bree larson in.
   (ID: 4654e3a9a75835f9ff28170ddf31d5d3cf296ea2)

20. memorization in university  ? do you mean you cannot have whatever books you wish in tests there  ? if so , it ' s totally useless  most assumptions of world  space  materials will be old and unusable after , say , digit years , so wide area on  how  to find stuff in books allowed everywhere is important , memorization has very little to do , only that you know what part of book to use and then home on it on each test . please tell me it was a grammatical error they make you memorize something in university ! because you memorize the important stuff automatically when you get to work and you don ' t know what work yet when you ' re in university .
