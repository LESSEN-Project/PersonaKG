1. i ' ve only seen a few of these comics , yet every single one i keep asking myself why is she still with this guy ? what reason in the ongoing narrative does she give to justify his behaviour ?
   (ID: 808718709a1de9360ade79304c59728079eae812)

2. no . but being clean taking a shower helps . ladies like it when a fella listens to what they have to say , and treats them like a friend . smiling , saying nice things , and validating their feelings really helps . something that i think that most incels fail to realize is that ladies get lonely too . they get bullied even worse them fellas do . plus , when it comes to sex , they have to worry about being seriously hurt . i mean put in the hospital with injuries hurt . if you hope to one day achieve your wildest fantasy , you will first have to learn how to treat them . not frightening them is a good 1st step . incels that i  ve talked to prescribe to ideas that are frightening to ladies .

19. my uncle said all pot smokers smoke menthol cigarettes . he also blames poor modern family dynamics are because of pot . my grandma said pot smokers are bad people , lazy , and can  t believe we  re all able to vote about it now . so i asked them what went wrong when they tried it . neither of them have ever tried it so i told them anything they think is invalid and it started this huge fiasco
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

20. i didn ' t smoke , so i didn ' t know . you could always make a fake email address , and shoot an email to ask if they disqualify applicants for medical marijuana . that way if they say yes , its not your email and you can " detox " . depending on how regularly you use it can take longer than a month though .
