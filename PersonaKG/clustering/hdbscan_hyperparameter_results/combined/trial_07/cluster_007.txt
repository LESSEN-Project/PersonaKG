1. hmm . personally , i ' d say that it ' s less our intelligence and more our savagery . we destroy everything in our path if we have to , and we are the most versatile animals on the planet . we also hold a long , long grudge against other species if they harm us , going as far as killing off entire family units to get revenge  not because of territory , or food . because we ' re angry .
   (ID: b8935e64705419fa81f156d0d29b88ffd1e2f443)

   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

3. as someone who puts up walls like it  s my job and also someone who  s last relationship crumbled because of it , the best thing i can say is to try . also , be patient , it takes time and you have to let the person get comfortable with you
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

4. i was ringside , and saw things that cannot be unseen . the way the room was set up , i had no choice but to see what was going on . all i can say is that i give women some serious credit for childbirth .
   (ID: f8d48136e1ccbc739d4b7fb8db1e8f668422b145)

5. " yeah not to bad " such a normal thing to say and me and my friend die every time it is said
   (ID: 4dbd3fd527caa93836f895d72dfef9276ea4809f)

6. how long until uber just decides to give the police real  time data on us instead of fiddling with our phones ? then , if they can ' t solve a crime they can just pin it on the closest driver at that time , case solved . now that i think about it , nsa and cia probably already have this . unconstitutional you say ? nah , they say ! it ' s for your protection ! it ' s to get the terrorists ! astonished  face
   (ID: 9789fadf3a050c71c64ca7e31c4857fc9094d643)

7. i was an idiotic teenager who would chase after guys that didn  t give two shits about me . the whole time i was oblivious to my best friends massive crush on me . that boy was there for me through all of my problems and it  s safe to say that he  d give me the world if he could .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

8. if yo i get raided the cops have a full history of your dealing and you can  t say it  s a one time thing .
   (ID: bdf7e254fb732651bb0373067c57200731f7ca55)

   (ID: 877420760b51bd6d6215f29b022f67d56f77a7a8)

10. aussie here , so what i ' m about to say may not apply in the us , but going around to talk to sparkies face to face is worth digit resumes you send out . do the leg work .
   (ID: 9e8a44f7c55ebce4785906436a033b33a1ccb949)

11. if you just kind of brushed him off at first or just nervously laughed you ' re kind of screwed . he thinks he ' s " wearing you down " at this point . just tell him no and do not explain why . just say no . if he doesn ' t get the message , it may be time to talk to your supervisor about it .

12. exactly , you ' re not here to entertain me , but this post was meant to entertain whether or not it ' s for easy karma is a different matter . this is the first time i saw this , and judging from all the up doots , i ' d say i ' m not the only one . nothing is original because someone is always going to say it first , all that matters is how and when you do it .
   (ID: 2168250be01c43791f88e7c8ad875c0396307047)

13. while i agree somewhat to the fact that hispanics like to fuck . i find it a bit distasteful to say that the problem is with hispanics . not with retarted white christians . who are too dumb to realize that their children are going to fuck regardless of what they ' re told . so hey lets get them to put on a jimmiehat
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

14. if this were true i ' d say goodbye to all my time
   (ID: f9d3bf7ce779e854aa865f12a7dfaaee14a65cfa)

15. i would say this is now my favourite audio on here , but i am still determined to get through your jerk off contestpart digit without having to hold back almost the entire time . your voice is perfect both for submission to the bull , and humiliating  dominating the husband . your cute but evil laugh is perfect for cuckolding . i keep looking forward to your new posts .
   (ID: 720bf2762acb0f756492e6e40ae840126dae87ce)

16. go and be supportive . say nothing that would be upsetting to them . that ' s what friends do . a funeral is not the time or place for you to express your views . it ' s not about you in the least .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

17. me too . it ' s something i ' m going to say to one of my kids in particular .
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

18. if it were that bad , id just say it outright , but then again  im working as a part time cashier so me losing my job is less of a big deal lol . i doubt youd lose your job for that though .
   (ID: dd1a306ab5abb82ade20a2c7f74d928797a35a61)

19. " allowing " for direct negotiations is a fallacy because it ' s far easier for a large employer to play hard ball than it is for an individual worker to find another job . " allowing " for direct negotiations is not a kindness . i ' m happy that you enjoyed your own employment situation , i have no personal problem with this kind of thing so long as it isn ' t coercive . like you say yourself , by offering more money for the time they should be able to find willing workers . but allowing them to compel this kind of thing is terrible .
   (ID: d8e39e092041fc01f24bedce425d10f55bd2a764)

20. lol what are you going to say ? just straight up ask  what are your views on feminism ?  you think a guy that wants to have sex with you is going to say  oh i hate women  ?
