1. or it ' s a bullshit made up story , hoping that they will be one of the first to receive it . reminds me if some guy who demanded to receive his kickstarter shit faster than other people because of some condition . think it was shiftware .

   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

4. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

5. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

13. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it

14. being happy and being usefull for other people . for me if you think you shouldn ' t be happy you are living wrong and if you think it ' s fine being a useless piece of shit you are living wrong as well .
