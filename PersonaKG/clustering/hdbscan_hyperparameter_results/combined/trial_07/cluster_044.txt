5. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .

6. i wouldn  t say your original post came off as humble . i didn  t think it was arrogant though . all i have to say is , if the women that you  re talking to desire you more when you  re being a jerk , they must have no self  esteem .

8. i wouldn ' t say i have a big ass . it ' s not flat either , i think it ' s nice and i always check myself out in the mirror , but i would only say it ' s a little above average . i don ' t think ass size has anything to do with it though .
