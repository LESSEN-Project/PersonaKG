--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 29

1. i think a lot of this comes down to the definitions of coercion and seduction . yes , in seduction the idea is to do your best to be enticing to someone . however , this should not be confused with a bending of their will or a manipulation . coercion is doing whatever is necessary to achieve a desired response from someone else , including putting extra pressures on them , which can be easily done if the coercing party is in a position of power , whether that is physical strength , employment , or status . seduction is like giving someone all green lights , coercion is like trying to take the steering wheel .

   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

4. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

5. it just adds to the badass effect , i like to think of it as having my gun out passively but always ready for shit to hit the fan .
   (ID: 23394798067974e95a922a95c6609d16ca1b11dd)

6. i like that . i think the origin of " god bless you " was the belief that when you sneeze some of your soul escapes .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

9. i think i found it ! something called " captain blasto . this article says that one of his lines is " honey i ' m home "  here ' s a gameplay video , though it looks ps1 instead of n64 . but this is definitely your guy , in space with a blaster with the wisecracks very much like the gex game i remembered
   (ID: abbe051c76bbb939d8594349cac549cb5435920d)

10. " you can just speak plain language to yourself " if you speak words in your head , like think whole sentences , you can change your mindset .
   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

11. i think the question is asking what industries you ' d like to kill off , i think you ' re taking it as an insult
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

14. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

15. isn ' t that a power move ? for someone to pick a much younger partner ? they can do whatever they like and have full emotional and sexual control . that ' s what i think is happening .
   (ID: f042043ff04e1f2bd28d7c34b7937eb8bf31c76e)

16. i think it was more that his character evolved the most . he started out as a date rapist and eventually ended up a monogamist who openly loves blair . he still makes mistakes of course , but he is actually remorseful and doesn ' t continue to repeat bad habits like all the other characters . also , his character has a lot of dimension , which makes him more interesting than someone like nate .
   (ID: 169c51cc138a4161080068ded4dcf87863ffee36)

17. guys his past posts are all like this , i think he is a creep
   (ID: d34dab0dded997c6aa6e6d2792ea9d8a26881a2b)

18. i agree with you for the most part , but some of the halloween items , like the templar ' s spirit for the medic and the squid ' s lid for the demo actually look pretty cool . i think they should just do away with the restriction .
   (ID: e53542ff680164cdf45964372fb47cf6a7d48484)

19. i think the guy just look like him , not much more to it .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

20. true , but to me , i think it seems like a question they should be answering rather than asking . that ' s why i ask several questions about working conditions and technologies used , etc .
