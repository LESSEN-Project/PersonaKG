7. no , it ' s quite normal to be sedated for it . you generally have to ask for them to keep you awake . it sounds like a failure of the anesthesiologist if they were unable to keep you sedated , and it ' s battery unless you told them you want to be awake plus you described it as what sounds like battery to me .
