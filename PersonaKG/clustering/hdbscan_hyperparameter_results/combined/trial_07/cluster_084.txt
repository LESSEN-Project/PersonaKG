1. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .

   (ID: 8ea8e4a00c3f2a64096e00bdbba0247e580cdb17)

   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

   (ID: 3e906e06d59fb5c2993270f0b4efed5b9ab122f7)

   (ID: 782311f0352356940fd2c1e77bc3cfa9f74b06fa)

9. so just because you disagree with it , you think it should be okay to censor it ? don ' t you see how slippery of a slope this is ?
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)

10. no . i meant the gap between the back of her ears and her head . i was just trying to think of the weirdest place you could stick your dick on a person .
   (ID: 7a396588993d687f5528f10b200dc9d6db769270)

11. i think it  s pushing your luck not to get two fish . often they stop eating and just lie there and give up on life if they are all alone . my piggiest boy went on a hunger strike for a week when he was in his own for his friend had to go to the fishy vet tank .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

12. i think you should have pride that you haven ' t slept around alot . but not in a way like you are better than any one else just i guess in a " i respect myself " type of way . which is why i don ' t think you should just fuck someone for practice .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

13. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

14. you don ' t . you just think you do .

   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

16. to answer you directly . i think no . just get gifted the money and you do the paying of debt .
   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)

17. if there ' s nothing i can do , i just think .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

18. why should you panic if there is nothing to lose . youre not playing in the katowice grandfinal . just try your best and if you fail , think . about what you could have done . better in that situation . you learn by mistakes
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

19. what  s he think was happening , everyone is just stopping in the middle of the road for no reason and he  d have room to go around ?
   (ID: a154763d4a1c7d2d412ab13eeed4849772817d9a)
