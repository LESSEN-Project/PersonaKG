1. fix the fear . they just have to be shown nothing is scary . good things should be happening . treats and whatnot .
   (ID: 23436d4a3b029dec718d52bd8f69b7b3bb78dd25)

2. just sit with good posture ! i have some friends who game with their feet up on the desk . one of them already has back issues and he still does it !
   (ID: 5d6cecafd26473d96b39b973965364f09d4d41f1)

3. that ' s good you seem to be pretty open and receptive to your players and it never hurts to throw a challenge at them they can ' t overcome just to show them they are mortal . good luck !
   (ID: ca6f75f7c2f9d1175fa6abae36369351bda1afb8)

4. i should of known that the prices for these pokemon ones were too good to be true . they are quite hard to get hold of here in the uk , so fraudsters have filled the gap in the market by flogging these fake ones . ebay will be on your side to and help you and get you a refund if you receive a fake , it is just a lot of hassle that is probably best avoided !

5. if you send me pc vods i can still analyze them and give you coaching tips or just discuss strategy via discord , but i cant join games on pc . good luck finding a coach though !
   (ID: 01ce69fc209a030b404f270c5d5a650bbb706d87)

6. just change your definition of ' instant ' and you are good to go !
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

7. good god , that sounds horrible , my respect for adcs just grew even more .
   (ID: 41b9459dbd87b475322566af693bf5fe2a47086d)

8. that just leaves the rule of thirds , it may also help to do a quick google for photography rules and  or tips . honestly , i was just trying to find a suggestion for you because you asked , the picture looks good
   (ID: 80d504f68f5028edc4d8e5926e3a2a93b0c84d8f)

9. good explanation , thanks . i agree . manhood can  t be measured , as that plays into the concept toxic masculinity . then the belief of manhood being measured should instead be just considered how macho someone is ? not in a negative sense for example , if you see a strong , burly man with a beard and place him next to george constanza , considered the former with higher manhood is wrong , but instead maybe more macho  stereotypically masculine characteristics ?

10. ooh good point . just because something or someone has left you , there is still the emotional trauma left behind . i have no idea what that trauma would amount to when it comes to an extra sliver of someone else ' s evil soul inside another .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

11. quick question instead of posting a new thread  for you toy collectors , is there a particular set  line of sw toys that is sought after or preferred ? or do you guys just collect figures that looks good
   (ID: b4fb8e20516a28baa38075931e9715db2375a956)

12. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !
   (ID: f179711c18514780c1b0257643d893ef1cf5a081)

13. do you have any friends that are on the soccer team ? maybe they can help you practice outside of the tryouts ? i  m assuming this is high school so just give it your best shot ! good luck !

14. there ' s a few good youtube videos on it . watch mark kermode revisit on the film , where he feels more warmer to it . take a look at ' the philosophy of cloud atlas , how beauty will save the world ' and the in  depth analysis by ' the angry hippo ' such a shame the film is so polarising . as jim broadbent ' s character says " if you extend your patience for just a moment , you will find there is a method to this tale of madness "
   (ID: 5fa74a7d6a70c6f2f8a149864f494ac72eefd3e4)

15. not an answer but atlas is not that good maybe just the puch , just team up and go farm him . i ' d suggest look in recruit for casuals every now and then to get it eventually . so you
   (ID: 9adb5fb6fb9aeeeb65afe41002460d73817044b0)

16. their eyes . you can see whether or not someone is good or bad just by making eye contact , or at least i can .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

17. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .
