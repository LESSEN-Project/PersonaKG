1. i  m a dude so technically you haven  t . also i know what mansplaining is . also how the hell did autocorrect know that , but i thought feminists thought all men  mansplained
   (ID: ad911088c8434d08c7a96c969a57a09b00f02e99)

2. it ' s hard to give advice because everyone handles this sort of thing differently . we went through three miscarriages , but they were all before our first child , so for us , there wasn ' t any question of trying again . for some people , it helps to start trying again right away . some want to wait for awhile before trying again . it ' s probably best to give it some time , for your wife to get back to normal physically , and for you both to heal emotionally . make sure she knows you ' re there to support her , but don ' t smother here either , give her space if she needs it . and always keep in mind , that unless she has an underlying health problem which it doesn ' t sound like is the case since you already have two kids , miscarriages are random occurrences , and aren ' t likely to happen with the next pregnancy .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

3. as i told the guy above . i redacted that information so i didn ' t have to do any lore or numbers thought . purely cheating on my side , and it gives enough room for the mechanics of the device to be taken and stuck in most other stories .
   (ID: 8360c6d04ba11da7a727532482d78505e52a4150)

4. the problem is , the real authentic ones are actually made in china . i agree with the stock image though . unless buying from a proper online shop , i shall not be purchasing from anyone that has a stock image . lesson learnt ! unamused  face
   (ID: 03bd0b4bb3465eba83e1c9a00af15f7b35f1ec6d)

5. did you wrap the burger in the pizza ? using two slices is a good bun replacement .
   (ID: ed8c4bb1975edb0f627baa6dac44e74cbc7237c6)

6. it is pretty gruesome most of the time . sometimes it ' s like far away shots where you can ' t really see anything but you know they ' re dying  dead . i ' m not sure why other people watch it , but for me it made death more real , if that makes sense . as someone who has never actually seen someone die in real life it has been informative . before i watched some of those videos it was like " oh , that sucks " when i ' d hear on the news that someone got shot , stabbed , in a car accident , died in a fire , etc . after seeing those kinds of videos i take more of a pause after hearing something like that . i take the moment to mourn a life that ' s been extinguished , and be thankful for how fortunate i have been . but that ' s just me . though i will say , i can ' t watch the ones with kids . i saw one video with kids and even now i want to vomit .
   (ID: 28ecb35c880034ee5298d0c4abb71cabdafd1e4f)

7. true . quick question and sorry for my ignorance , but at digit . digit both syndra and khaxiz seem to be lagging , so my cardboard v ass is thinking may be the vayne had really good ping , oh who am i kidding , that ' s script . don ' t mind me , i ' ll see myself out now .
   (ID: 41b9459dbd87b475322566af693bf5fe2a47086d)

8. the only reason we have more shootings is because we have the right to bear arms , and almost digit times the population of the uk at least we don ' t have fucking acid attacks in broad daylight where police don ' t do shit and can ' t do shit because they don ' t have anything to protect themselves or civilians besides a glorified bat and a taserwhich hardly ever works . not to mention that the us healthcare system , i agree the us is overly expensive , but it attracts the best doctors based on pay . what ' s the point of paying for a doctor if you ' re not gonna wake up after surgery . the government shutdown has literally done jack shit , and is completely and utterly useless . it hasn ' t changed anything of any importance . we have the most powerful military in the world , were not warmongering , the us goes after high priority targets that european countries cannot track down because their limited spending co tributes to poor technology in comparison .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

9. lol what , did it take you the full digit hours to come up with that shit spray ? you couldn ' t be more wrong about everything you just slammed your ass on the keys to write out . what a waste of my time reading such garbage .

10. i agree . even fighting should be done with respect . all fists no weapons and no kicking while the other guy is down . kicking someone in the head while they  re down is done pansyass bs . give them a chance to stand and fight like fights should be

11. i don  t know about you but i  m not made of money . if i could keep an extra digit  of my income rather than giving it to the government so they can license people who put paint on other people that would be very beneficial for me .
   (ID: 8b20a772d1697ecc1b19f9f6451e7346e8b98987)

12. One of my favorite things is hunter green.

13. first thing , get closer to her . become friends so you can test the waters and see if it ' s something you want to get into . if not , you gave a good friend who you care about alot . if yes then you can try to date her and that ' s even better .
   (ID: f2cec4af782c7d455288420e90648dc9c6d12538)

14. sometimes you think your a tits or an arse man , but then you as a great one of either and you change your mind until another great pair emerges .
   (ID: b3a8447862df1e30a18d38c5c0ad1c8595c18d4c)

15. not all parents do this . i have two kids and when anyone asked i would just tell them in years . " he ' s digit . she ' s digit etc " truth is , most people couldn ' t really give a shit about your kid ' s age down to the exact month . the nearest year is good enough in daily conversation .
   (ID: d02dbb1cf70aa95df2b9f1bbd0a0c5bf0a966933)

16. no dairy ! a hot , steamy bath , hot tea , lots of water .

17. the same one i get every month . you cannot rely on anybody else . you are in your own . only you can understan your thoughts and only yoh can execute them without screwing it up . if you put any responsibility on another person they will let you down .
   (ID: 7008f149db59fea91167255eafa8bc84beab0f01)

18. i appreciate the offer , but i ' m trying to learn how to do this . do you have any advice you could offer me instead ? your song is very cool . i like how it ' s pretty stripped down but doesn ' t feel empty or lacking in anything . very chill
   (ID: cb830ff94bb369e5db655e15ee074f392a52c14f)

19. i ' m all for setting up factories in other parts of the world to sell u . s . cars in those countries not to import what we should be employing people to make here .
   (ID: 4751dd6f6e1bc0e55d1193f8d9e0a104d87e9e98)

20. i totally agree ! it ' s hurtful and harmful for so many reasons and for everyone ! why does anyone want that straight bar right where the jumblies are !
