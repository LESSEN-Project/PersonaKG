   (ID: 20704d953f0b1774a4782d2f049f69736ac4eea2)

   (ID: 86aa9f4e4439cfc2f93b784da95581053937806c)

3. i think the idea is to hide the piercing so you look more presentable at a job interview . that said , this would probably be more questionable than the earrings .
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

   (ID: 800762ac8d54632109094a4e9132fe0aed711561)

8. yeah , kraus make some weird stuff . if you think theyre neat , check out some old altmans faucets . i think altmans closed the buisness though , so they ' re not made anymore .
   (ID: 40f1dd99755dca159ccdbdacafea183ed0a104cd)

9. a brief look and i am guessing it is real . i can ' t take any more than a brief look as my liver is already in open rebellion and i think exposure to that site would probably prompt a few more organs to join it .
   (ID: 59ebeb8d8fee755bce043a6482743bde8a2a0bb1)

10. i think they should make it epic and legendary , keep it the same in all the other ways
