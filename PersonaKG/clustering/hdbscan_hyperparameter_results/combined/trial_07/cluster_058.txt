   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

6. if it really bothers you , you could pretend like you ' re balancing a stack of books on your head while you walk .
   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

8. yeah , that ' s a little unfair . although there would be false positives there too , like " you must really enjoy the elliptical "
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

9. well i would really like to see your sister . because she must be the most beautiful girl ever if you are  the ugly sister  .
   (ID: c787052a42459acc9cd2034c7531250ccd441795)

   (ID: e6c4a2b8e8c999b54ade342babc3d7b48868cc6d)

11. my girlfriend loves indian and mediterranean eggplant dishes , but not most western ones . eastern dishes tend to break up the eggplant a lot more like baba ganoush , and if eggplant isn ' t cooked all the way through it does have a really woody  reedy taste and a fuzzy texture .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

   (ID: 88279b92dca36b3b3c236d960135a2afe2e68b33)

15. what is the worst thing about you ? how dirty is your bathroom , really ? where would you like to go on your next vacation ? how many monkeys can fit into a barrel ?
   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

16. really ? i would like to see that .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

19. that sounds like you have some really tense fingers , no idea what would help with that . my best guess would be to pay attention to your hand while you play and see if it gets super tense , and if so relax a bit . otherwise visiting your doctor might help
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

20. a herobrine event quest with special equipment based on him would be really cool but like somebody else said , it  s not very likely . still a cool idea though !
