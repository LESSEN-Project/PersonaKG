11. i agree digit  people who are like ' god helped me study and pass my exams ' or ' god saved me from a car accident ' are so brainwashed . once people realise it ' s themselves that are in charge of their destiny , they decide their own morals , actions etc and not some invisible sky daddy , the better we will all be .

   (ID: 7d39153e3adadffd15e1638679c2e1cdc5c64fde)

15. that ' s what it was like for me , maybe the business was dodgy , maybe not though because my other friends who worked in other businesses experienced the same thing . maybe i was unlucky ? but it can affect people in big business .
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)
