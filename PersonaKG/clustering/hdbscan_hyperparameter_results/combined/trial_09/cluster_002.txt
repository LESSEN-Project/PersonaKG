1. you have the right to be upset or angry , or any other emotion you are having right now . your wife needs to know exactly how you feel and take ownership for causing it your wife should be willing to do anything for you that would help you build that trust back up . no more expectations of privacy , no more hidden anything in her life . she needs to be an open book . look at her bank account , check her on  line presence , monitor her calls , get all of her passwords , and  or whatever you feel is needed . then you need to work on regaining that trust . if this is going to be a life sentence for her , then end the marriage now . you need to work toward her having privacy again some day . just not right now . there is no such thing as too much communication in smarriage .

2. wow ! y  all need to calm the fuck down sunshine . your old man obviously just wants the best for you and for you to do your best . that comes from love . not hate . recognise that and be thankful you still have a father . there are a lot of people that don  t .
   (ID: 89fd53ef642d85d9a24d63f88469480646354104)

3. am i missing something here ? you love your boyfriend but hard hanging out alone in your room with a drunk guy who tried to kiss you . you stop him and clarify that this is a no go and you love your bf . perfect . but then you have him spoon with you all night as a comfort to you ? that makes no sense . but whatever . if it is eating you up inside and you really truly did not do anything , you should tell him . i mean why not  particularly since there is no longer contact with the mf .

4. seems like he has a lot of baggage going on . he ' s sexuality interested in other people and is likely cheating , or going to cheat outside of the rules . if you have rules like you do , you shouldn ' t be together . it ' s gonna get ugly if you stay .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

5. definitely know how you feel . it sucks big time . but i  ve learned that those kind of friends aren  t real friends . i tend to only have digit or digit close friends who i do stuff with  activities that require other people such as going to the cinema or jamming . all my other  fake  friends , i just don  t expect anything from them . if they invite me out somewhere , fine . otherwise i try not to give a shit . and truth be told , i can  t really stand being around them for too long . helps with the not giving a shit part . hope you feel better soon . xx

6. no you handled it well . i would of done the exact same thing . think of it this way  if he did kill his self and you didn ' t inform anyone , you would feel a lot worse . you ' ve done the right thing . you ' ve broken up with him and told several people so now it ' s their job to look out for him . not yours . you are free .

7. i suppose i have some perspective in a way from your girlfriends point of view as i think my girlfriend has similer feelings as i ' m still close friends with a guy i slept with the guy and i where friends long before i should add and it was a one time thing i know it kinda makes her uncomfortable so i try to take in to consideration her feelings about hanging out with him such as i would be with him alone but shes okayish with it because she trusts me .   x200b  so i guess what im saying in your gf case she must feel pressured by her ex into keeping contact and feels terrible about it , i say just try and support her as dealing with abusive ex partners can be a rough experience

8. you ' re welcome . you know what you need to do . i ' m sorry , i know it sucks , but you can ' t change people . in the long run you will feel better without him . happy birthday !

9. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !

10. nta . as a lesbian and as a human being with good communication in a good relationship , i see no issue with what you did . your other doesnt trust you and is very insecure . i ' d talk to her and if it didnt resolve , i ' d get a new girlfriend that trusts me enough to not cheat .

11. one of the biggest errors our little human brains make is assuming people we know are the same from day to day . many people do not understand the episodic nature of depression . i strongly encourage you to mention to a friend of parent something like " this may be out of left field , but between you and me , i ' ve been feeling kind of blue lately . i know i don ' t show it , but i guess i could use a little extra support at the moment " say it in a way that feels like your voice . saying it out loud is scary , but surprisingly therapeutic in and of itself .

12. well , i hope that you ' re still here . those friends that your referring to , those aren ' t the type you want to have . if they don ' t like you or your interests , that ' s their lost , not yours . if you don ' t mind me asking , why does your mom want you to move back in ? you may call her narcissist , but aren ' t all parents , in a way ? i would suggest you call her . if you kill yourself , it could destroy her . i wouldn ' t know , but maybe she wants you to move back in because she likes having around . maybe she needs some help , that is if she lives alone .

13. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .

14. i was a full blown alcoholic , who treated my friendships as transactional relationships and always had a reason why it wasn  t totally my fault some terrible thing had happened to me or that i had done something shitty to someone else . everyone , including me , was a victim of circumstance and anyone in my position would have done what i did . i got sober over digit years ago , sorted out a bunch of my shit , tried to make up my past transgressions to other people and barring the ability to take direct responsibility for those things , am just trying to live my life better . sometimes i get hung up on what i used to be like , but , can also step back enough to recognize that i can  t redo any of that time in my life and just try to be my best self now . i think past me did some shitty stuff , but , that doesn  t make me a shitty person through and through . i don  t think you can hate yourself into making or maintaining positive changes in your life . present me learned a lot through that experience and especially through getting sober . hopefully , i  ll continue to grow more , keep working on being the best version of myself and , if presented the opportunity , can help others who have similar life experiences .

15. i ' m digit and feel some of your pain . i like some peoples answers of oh just feel better thats all you need . some days isn ' t that easy . i don ' t have a bad life by any means but struggle to motivate myself to do fun stuff or even daily chores .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

16. i can think you should be honest with your feelings . i say with experience and to ignore or overlook it can be more destructive than anything else . if she genuinely likes you , she ' ll come back . if it ' s just the physical stuff the friendship will fizzle out . that ' s the worst part though . fwbs ruin good friendships most of the time .
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

17. it is not a petty reason at all to be angry at this . you said it yourself you guys had a rough childhood and you still have struggles . you are allowed to feel like this no emotion is invalid . im sorry you are going through this , you seem like a really strong person . focus on your school . i believe in you .
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

18. being single does suck . i ' ve been single my entire life m16 . i usually cope by hanging out with friends . i know i ain ' t the best looking , nor am i fit . but yeah . i get how you feel . life does suck that way . whenever i feel down about being alone , i usually think " i ' ll find that person eventually " some day you will . just continue doing what you like , and hang out with your friends
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

19. sounds like she  s too shallow to understand your pov and what you  ve been through . personally , that trait alone could make or break a relationship for me .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

20. yeah that ' s ridiculous . you ' ve been dating for less than a month and she constantly pesters you ! like jeez when did she start , week digit ? you ' re nta in this situation , i think a sit down discussion about it is definitely needed tho
