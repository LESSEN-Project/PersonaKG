1. all good , manicstoner . so what about you ? you said you ' re having trouble answering the question ?
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

3. the explanation to a cooling and warming planet is a natural cycle . in the digit ' s it was " global cooling . more recently it was " global warming . since neither of those bogey men ever materialized it is just called the vague " climate change . also , a large amount of environmentalists point their fingers at the united states as the bad guy . imagine that . i say start with china and then get back to me . how certain does one have to be you ask ? digit  or no deal . i am all for a clean world for all living things . no one likes pollution and unhealthy practices . however , i consider it the height of human arrogance to believe we can actually influence the environment to the degree many claim . i dismiss the attitude of " it might be happening so we must do something . i find this to be absurd thinking . it looks like you and i shall respectfully agree to disagree .
   (ID: 130fa156e7a286a021dcdff2492d6048231cb82f)

4. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

5. posting something that i as a muslim support doesn ' t make me a cunt . you using a generalising term clearly shows the upbringing you ' ve got . wow . shows where you stand ? oh wait . nowhere !
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

6. huh ? i did not say that . were you answering to a deleted comment ?
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

7. did you read the question ?
   (ID: 1afb7597077681179430af152997f04fd73ba0ee)

8. how can you speak for someone else regarding their own intentions ? for arguments sake , let ' s say that i thought the two bombs were a step too far , does that make me anti  western ?
   (ID: f8771fc63bc4c52bb04b2e71d4aefe7bf406c65c)

9. wait what ? if i choose based on skin color then that  s absolutely racism . you  re picking the better one of the two
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

10. hahahahaha . no buddy . telling someone words is not a threat to them . actually committing acts is a threat to them . they have shown time and time again that they are willing to actually kill people . stop fucking defending these fucks . they ' re scum . and they deserve everything that is coming to them .
   (ID: fe56409176d2a6089f323227d5b07061f851d63b)

11. yes i  m fully aware , but through consistent elaboration then maybe i could help at least one person learn the truth and show them the difference . as long as just one person learns from me , then my efforts are all worth it
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

12. but the left has a ' my way or the highway ' mentality do you not even realize how biased you just were ?
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

13. oh , i still say israel shouldn ' t . but you wanted a answer from the left so i gave you one . me being from the right doesn ' t mean i ' m unable to give a left answer .
   (ID: a61db1f2f0a3d15376fd168a1637c028f25100e1)

14. i have never stated that disobeying an officer means you deserve to die . i don  t think that at all , i think that anyone when encountering the police should obey an officers orders because it gives you the best chance of getting through the situation with a a better outcomelesser charges and b reduces risk of bodily harm . please don  t put hateful intentions onto me as i wouldn  t apply them to you . i  ll i want is for people to be more informed on police work , by doing so we make lives easier for everyone
   (ID: 350ebf5f22b005c6fa011b8241361bb7184ec8d5)

15. ok you think that then . no issue here .
   (ID: 02cf76dae1fda8da1d2e5bbbaeb0da5a77cb6e3e)

16. first off bud , i  ve played since alpha . secondly i didn  t say anything was over powered , you do know how to read don  t you ? they asked what we thought was the best character offensively , it  s an opinionated post , the  competitive  aspect of the subreddit has nothing to do with options or thoughts . your assumptions and negative responses are the exact reason this game is dying .
   (ID: ef2135d90df57b27df5e96791848d8d9201afd29)

17. i feel like you invite this kind of opposition view to your thoughts when you post them unasked for in a sub called unpopular opinion . we ' re not talking about laws here , were talking about your unpopular opinion .
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

18. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

19. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .
   (ID: f7356e924b370675e942b29b9c2184dc895ea5b7)

20. ahh , now you ' re playing stupid , huh ? way to show intellectual honesty . really . well done . thanks again for displaying what fucking liars you all are . way to show , again , that you have to lie through your teeth just to feel like you aren ' t a bunch of fucking rats . seriously . thank you .
