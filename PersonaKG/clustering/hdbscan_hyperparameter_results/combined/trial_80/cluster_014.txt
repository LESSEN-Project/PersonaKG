1. you ' re not doing anything wrong . relationships just kind of happen . you don ' t need to do anything differently . one night you might find you slipped on a kiss and be with someone for a good while . keep doing your own thing and girls will take notice .

2. nobody said anything about pushing anything on anyone or being pervy . there ' s nothing wrong with saying hi to a stranger . and by rejection i meant it as a broad definition in this sense . normal people should be able to immediately sense if the other person is not up for a conversation . but there is absolutely nothing wrong with seeing a pretty girl and saying hey . if she seems flattered or interested in a chat at all take it from there to the next level by maybe flirting a little or saying something you noticed about her . but to generally assume i meant just walk up to some hot chick in a random location and immediately running up to her with some cheesy pick up line is both wrong and hysterical to even imagine . you shouldn ' t do that in any setting . but talking to a girl you notice in a mall or grocery store is no different than talking to them in a bar or club .

3. i gotchu bro . you may be asking yourself , oh no what do i talk about ? when approaching a girl . no worries ! as another user mentioned , get on board day is a great opportunity to meet a girl that has a similar interest as you . you dont have to tell a joke or have some jaw dropping awesome first line , you can literally just ask  how long have you been into topic ?   what is your favorite thing about topic  keep in mind that not everyone will click and if it doesnt , dont tell yourself that youre bad with girls . i promise you that there are guys you could try to be friends with and it wouldnt go so well either . why ? because not everyone is going to click , i promise you that i wouldnt click or be friends with almost digit  of the guys in my classes if we tried to be friends . it  s just because people are different . so don  t get down , go out there , be confident , be yourself , and if you fail , get back up , dust yourself off , and try again ! you got this ! p . s . none of the bad interactions will matter in digit years when you  re as happy as can be with your s  o good luck bro

4. it ' s hot , for both of us . seriously , if you ' re adult enough to have sex , you should be adult enough to just enjoy yourself , even if you ' re not alone . and if you can ' t be that relaxed and open in front of your so about something so important as sex , i feel bad for you .

5. there is no guy in the world that will turn down a girl who wants to hit him up and compliment him . and a solid digit  of guys would love it if you hit it off after that first compliment . but just ask yourself before you do . are you really in a position where you feel so desperate that you are looking to hit on guys on twitter just to feel something ? and i mean that not as an insult but a genuine question . know the difference between knowing when something is real and just falling into a pit of your own loneliness .

6. bullshit . no wonder men out there chicken out when they have to approach any real life woman out there . do you see why that happens ? they grow up watching these anime where girls are shown as more manly  boys blush to talk to girls . suddenly these anime  nerds develop affinity for the women who kicks them into the nuts . and these anime girls are shown as physically hit the protagonist . everyone brush it off saying " it is cute " . i do watch anime but i never liked these themes . consider dragonball . dude is one of the strongest warrior in the universe but he is terrified of his wife . and she hits him when he does any mistake . people watching these things laugh at it  say it is cute . man if physical violence doesn ' t look cute when a man does on a woman then you can not have double standards when a woman does it on a man . and this is how you program those boys to chicken out in approaching any real woman . sorry to say mate . but this opinion is you is actually the product of the buffer you ' re making in your own brain to avoid meeting real life girls . real life girls are way better than your waifus .

7. good looking guy . you probably come off too pushy or desperate . let the chicks come to you .
   (ID: fca46720f9aa154a0559b1e4d2d28cb0df46b00a)

8. actually i just got more confident and outgoing . you can ' t expect to meet someone sitting in your house . also i was already attractive to a lot of girls , i just never noticed . it also helped that i have a good job and very responsible . side note  women need to be more open with their feelings with the stupid hints . i ' m sick of having to guess what you ' re thinking , then you get mad when i guess wrong . if you like someone then actually show it . a lot of us guys are clueless as fuck .

9. i am a guy and i don ' t understand how it is awkward . just go around her or go slow if you aren ' t in a rush .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

10. while you are correct that i lack empathy , i am not a  nice guy  at all . just courteous . i don  t understand people who aren  t . and aren  t you a dude ? didn  t you just ask me if i smile at dudes in public too ? i give basically anyone who makes eye contact with me a quick smile . if they don  t return it , fine . if they actively attempt to be nasty back , i think they have some kind of problem . regardless of gender .

11. hehehe , whatever you do , don ' t be yourself
