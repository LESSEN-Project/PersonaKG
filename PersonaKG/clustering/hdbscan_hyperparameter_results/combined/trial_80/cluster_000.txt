2. i came to this thread to point out the soundcloud recording and defending this prof . glad to see reddit has actually followed through like i have and now are asking the same  or similar  questions like " what is going on with this picture ? " and " what ' s this about the student doing something illegal ? "

5. lol ! but seriously , it ' s ok for people to talk about thing in hindsight , but if you are in a situation like that and feel threatened and are concerned for your families safety then calling ti an over reaction is slightly wrong . i mean , an over reaction would be to keep going right ? one hit and she was down , he didn ' t start stomping on her like so sort of berserker . that would have been an over reaction . he pushed her way after she pushed him to show that they shouldn ' t mess with him . she started to advance on him , in his mind he is surrounded by a bunch of teens who will most likely fallow her lead . one punch in self defence and in defence of his family . situation deescalated . obviously one punch could have killed the girl . but she and her pack of friends were the aggressor . should he just man up and let them feast on his bloody corpse while his family run for shelter ?   x200b

6. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .

7. guy seems like a creeper , seems drunk , and is getting borderline inappropriately physical with a woman . i also kind of agree with the " he ' s a visitor , what right does he have to dictate how locals act " idea but . vietnam is trying to change . they ' re making more of these pedestrian walkways including the nice one in hcmc that opened not too long ago . if you read yes , quite possbibly progpagandized local newspapers and comment sections , they are full of comments from local citizens who are tired of the more rude behaviours one faces on the streets , e . g . littering , traffic violations , and exploitative  scamming  corrupt  unhygeinic business practices . on the tourism side , the country knows it has a problem , with falling numbers and an extremely low return tourist rate . if somethings gotta change , can ' t there be a way for an outsider to help open people ' s eyes ? i for one , do my part by never letting anyone jump my place in a queue . this is my imperialistic crusade in vietnam . it seems to be a losing battle , but my smile , shaking head , and admonishing " no no no " seems to get the job done in a much more pleasant way than this guy .
