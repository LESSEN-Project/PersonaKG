1. it ' s up there but not on the top . it was so fascinating in so many ways but not th best . and if you ask me what is you ' d have to give a day or digit to look through huge library of amazingly animated movies .

2. hercules . it ' s hard for me to sit through the movie now , nearly every line in the entire movie is some sort of mythological reference or joke . great movie too .

3. lol ! i liked it a lot , especially the sense of isolation and vulnerability you had playing as a regular soldier rather than a spartan . it also reminded me a bit of metroid prime , which is one of my all  time favorite games .

4. that was a brilliant game . i remember playing that when it came out  2000ish ?  and thinking that video game graphics couldn ' t possibly get any better . still think that gp4 is the best f1 game ever made apart from possibly grand prix legends .
