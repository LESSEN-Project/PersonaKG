6. definitely say something . call her , though . tone can be kind of difficult to determine through text and you don ' t need want to give her any more reasons to push you away even more . " hey , insert sister name . how you doing , casual chatting , blah blah blah . i need to talk to you about something . i feel insert everything you just told us . i know it ' s your wedding and you can do whatever you want , but i ' m starting to think that you don ' t even want me there . if not , that ' s fine bc you ' re kind of being a bitch and i could do without all the cross country trips . if you genuinely want me to be a part of the wedding , then act like it and maybe ease up a little bit " . feel free to modify to your liking .

   (ID: 2af8a0ff2295d21473f0e6ff67565738eb8f4df1)

9. admitting there is a problem is hard . fixing it even harder . your kids are likely in school full time . perhaps there is a way that you can find an after school program instead of a daycare . or , a dayhome . an hour or two in the afternoons probably won ' t affect your children negatively as a they are more connected to you by this age and can identify right from wrong and tell you , and b an after school program is guided by professional people and c less costly than full time care . i am a mom to a half day kindergartener digit and a digit mornings a week preschooler digit . i would need to find evening or weekend work to save myself from childcare costs being enormous , so i choose to wait until they are schooled full time . do you have any flexibility with your job ? perhaps you could drop off and pick up and return to work if necessary when she returns home . i ' m getting off track . i can ' t think of anything you ' re doing that isn ' t gentle , kind or thoughtful and coming from a place of love . i know my husband works long hours for our benefit and i appreciate the hell out of him for it . you are a good person and it sounds like she does need help in the form of a doctor or counselling for ppd . just keep coming from a place of love when you tell her you miss your partner in crime and that you want her to be happy , and all that growing old together stuff . i would beg and plead with my husband to come to counselling with me if i thought he needed it , but if that ' s likely to make her angry i just don ' t know . maybe if you guys are close with her family you can discreetly discuss with a trusted family member that you are worried . maybe they are worried too .

   (ID: 48e565f53f18e7fed27267c945fb81bb868c90f3)

11. well how would you know if you avoided drama if they didn ' t tell you ?
   (ID: b721d508c3e10f143c9836626787b26136faa266)

13. how do you know its a clone ? you know that betaflight has a kiss target now right ?
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

14. you have the right to be upset or angry , or any other emotion you are having right now . your wife needs to know exactly how you feel and take ownership for causing it your wife should be willing to do anything for you that would help you build that trust back up . no more expectations of privacy , no more hidden anything in her life . she needs to be an open book . look at her bank account , check her on  line presence , monitor her calls , get all of her passwords , and  or whatever you feel is needed . then you need to work on regaining that trust . if this is going to be a life sentence for her , then end the marriage now . you need to work toward her having privacy again some day . just not right now . there is no such thing as too much communication in smarriage .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

15. you ' re welcome . you know what you need to do . i ' m sorry , i know it sucks , but you can ' t change people . in the long run you will feel better without him . happy birthday !
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

16. i don ' t know and it scares me .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

17. i suppose i have some perspective in a way from your girlfriends point of view as i think my girlfriend has similer feelings as i ' m still close friends with a guy i slept with the guy and i where friends long before i should add and it was a one time thing i know it kinda makes her uncomfortable so i try to take in to consideration her feelings about hanging out with him such as i would be with him alone but shes okayish with it because she trusts me .   x200b  so i guess what im saying in your gf case she must feel pressured by her ex into keeping contact and feels terrible about it , i say just try and support her as dealing with abusive ex partners can be a rough experience

18. i ' m curious  are the feelings regarding the second cheating different than the first ? in my mind , i somehow imagine it as ' getting even ' , while i logically know it ' s still a breach of trust .
   (ID: a283688fea41e1110e58705ec74d4e325e46d87e)

19. you know to much .
   (ID: d42f47f147cdc8e97117f0e4963e2c1309d1dcd8)

20. the very fact that you  re expressing you don  t know is reason enough to know you  re not ready .
