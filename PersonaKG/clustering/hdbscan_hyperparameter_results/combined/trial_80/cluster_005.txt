1. maybe they were once a delivery driver and knows what it ' s like to have to turn around and go back so they feel bad even though it is your fault .

2. why would someone who has anxiety need to park marginally closer to the shops or need the extra space for getting in  out the car ? is the argument that it ' s so traumatic for them to be out , that those digit seconds they save by not walking from the regular non disabled spots really makes a difference ? pretty much . imagine you ' ve parked up at your local asda or somewhere . there are rows upon rows if cars and you have no idea what any if them are going to do . is one of them going to pull out and hit you ? is one of them going to come around the corner really fast ? could one of them be behind you right now ? you ' re standing still trying to process it  could that one next to you beep so that you move ? wouldn ' t you be better off moving ? or better off not moving ? my young son has issues with some things , particularly loud noises . if we go out anywhere and he needs the toilet he ' ll never use the hand driers , and start to panic if other people are there because they could use them . he ' ll frequently burst into tears if someone uses one , and on occasion has hidden his need to use the toilet and soiled himself instead .

3. people trying to bum out booze and  or cigarettes from random people are sooo annoying . i sometimes get approached outside of a train station and asked if i don ' t have some on me , usually really bad looking smelly people

5. i work as a bike messenger for a company that shares a name with a " country  wide " insurance company . almost every time i go somewhere new someone sings that goddamned jingle to me " you  know  what  company  i ' m  talking  about is on your side " . really fucking done with that

6. good point ama71832 . this is also why i never take cash . we could make a little more here and there , supposing these pax promising cash aren ' t the same ones that promise to tip in the app . but any protection we have is taken away . which means the passenger won ' t be held liable for damage or messes unless you actually took them to court for it . it also means that in the case of an accident , you ' re now liable under your insurance . insurance not enough ? you can bet your ass the pax will sue .
