1. don ' t try to act it was intentional or that you were serious . just laugh in a way , that indicates that you know you just did something awkward . thats how you show confidence and the ability to laugh about yourself . but you still need to stand your ground , if your awkward moment becomes a permanent joke about you . but the absolute worst thing you can do ist to become the aggressor , if you try to bring the attention to somebody else , by beeing an asshole , you show everybody your low self esteem and bad character .

2. i believe that hacking is fine if you are say in a 1v1 trolling someone , basically if it  s not being used to pretend that your really good or something along those lines i  m fine with it . unless i  m the one getting cheated lol .

3. we all screw up and make mistakes . you will make more in your years of driving . just kind of put your hands up and shake them and that kind of acknowledges that you know that you were wrong . it ' s sort of a visual " sorry . he can ' t do anything with your license plate . even in the worst possible case that he could , it ' s his word against yours . it ' s not even worth his time . he probably just let the dust settle . if you ' re on the road , you have to deal with people who make mistakes and assholes alike .

4. in watching my replays over this past year i ' ve noticed that for some reason a good amount of people seem to only press one button per input . i laugh at those people . i laugh at them because only an insane person would put even an ounce of faith in this game when it comes to online connections . if you ' re doing locals than you ' re gonna have to play like that or at least you ' d find some benefit to it . but online you ' re not only fighting your opponent but you ' re also fighting the connection . at any moment some frames could drop and completely cancel out your single button press . at the very least you should double tap or triple tap everything you ' re doing . triple may be too much in some situations on some characters but double tapping seems to be pretty solid on everyone in this game aside from the few digit hit combos in this game but you won ' t even be able to do those reliably online even if your execution is perfect anyway . tl  dr mashing  bad , just relax , it ' s just a game . the more knowledge you have the more confident you can be in your play . however , if you ' re playing anything other than at your locals , double tap that shit . don ' t trust this games online connection with your lp . it will leave you a rookie for the rest of your life .

5. may i ask what system you play and what rep you are ? because there is no way in hell you ' re playing high level duels and landing a mix of lights and heavies consistently as kensei . its most likely mid tier at best . people don ' t parry in high tier . they just block . and kensei is left useless at that point .

6. if someone  s tailgating you , just get out of the way if you can . stopping hard and flipping them off is only gonna make them angrier . if you can  t get out of the way , learn to properly brake check . you  re supposed to lightly tap on your brake , so that you don  t decelerate but your brake lights come on , letting them know they  re too close . if all else fails and they persist in riding your ass and possibly following you , then i  d say it  s okay to stop short . just brace yourself for a possible hit and a lot of yelling afterwards .

7. crap , i like playing support characters because i am not too great at gw2 when it comes to playing against people as it is my first mmo and i don ' t even know if my builds are any good . the server i play on is henge of denravi , when i play , there is hardly ever anybody on because of the time difference . over the past month i have not been playing gw2 as much because i have hit a wall . i do love jumping into a zerg as a sup gaurd or just tailing a small group i don ' t enjoy pve much since i have run all the dungeon paths multiple times , farmed the crap out of world bosses and getting my ass handed to me in pvp over and over isn ' t appealing . the only thing that has got me coming back is my guildies and doing living world because my so likes living world stuff so we do that together . i have the nbn where i am so latency is not an issue for me tbh , but i spent most of my time playing on an adsl1 connection with an average digit . 5mb speed , latency was a killer . but now the only issue i have with being able to play the game is the constant drops in connection , it ' s not my pc or internet connection either , if my so is playing at the same time she usually drops a few seconds after me . have run a tracert on the hod ip address , it always seems to time out around the 40th  43rd hop so there is nothing i can do about it . because of the drops i can hardly play let alone compete lol .

8. ultra necrozma malamar is probably more consistent than this . you have way too much going on . i also don ' t see why you run ditto since you don ' t run metang . also you need digit ultra balls

9. we all kind of rely on each other to be honest . i play all roles and i feel there should just be more respect , and more competency between them . healers keep everyone alive yes but a good tank stops everyone else taking damage . without the tank you would be equally screwed . likewise good dps will kill things so you ' re not fighting a war of mana . they should interrupt and stay out of danger . what i am trying to say is that everyone should work together , show some support and learn your class so you can adapt quickly . as soon as one of these digit roles thinks they are more valuable or don ' t have to try as hard the whole thing fails .

10. keep your ears open for people coming up behind you . don ' t panic and get out of their way safely . there are cunts in every sport so if you meet one ignore them .

11. no shame in going alone ! i  d probably prefer it honestly . the important thing is having a great time and celebrating the bride and groom  s wedding day

12. is it really that big a deal to ask to do that in a custom match or with a full party of digit ? i dont normally have much fun when we decided to all go one hero then proceed to get stomped . i don ' t think losing is all that fun and when a good digit  of my matches are that and i get penalized for leaving ? yeah it gets old .

13. of course my argument makes sense so long as you think about it properly . the effective skill of your team lowers when someone is simply feeding , or their focus blinded by anger . getting tilted and becoming unable to play your best handicaps you and your team , effectively lowering the skill of that player .  and you can ' t control soccer or football in that regard because people who throw in those games get permanently banned from the league yeah , and the exact same thing happens in professional dota digit . another similarity between dota digit and football  soccer is that you don ' t get permanently banned from throwing games just by playing casual matches with randoms .

14. i have just practiced to use l2 to confirm . i can say its really good and a lot of controller players on the normal br reddit have said that thats what they do . basically what i do now is l3 to edit . r2 to select and l2 to confirm . i used to use circle but holy shit is l2 fast . you just need to practice it will pay off . im still not perfect and i practiced yesterday

15. i ' m always telling my friends that watching too much pro play is bad for you if you don ' t think critically about it . the best way to counter someone is just to play a champ you ' re really good with . counters don ' t work if you suck at them .

16. from your post i ' m guessing your australian ? are you casual or part time ? i have one of those managers too but luckily he doesn ' t do rosters and i ' m pretty close with our rostering manager so he normally puts me on shifts where he is working and i don ' t have to deal with the bitchy guy , or if he ' s there as well the rm just tells him to piss off nicely of course only real advice i can give you is if they tell you off for doing something wrong , ask they how to do it right and try get them to show you . firstly if your not actually doing it wrong they get completely defeated . even during rush or whatever just ask them . i know a girl who the bitchy guy at my store was doing this to , she just annoyed him so much he stopped telling her they she was doing stuff " wrong " she wasn ' t because every time he did she made him waste digit minutes showing her how to do it the way she was already doing it .

17. introduce yourself to everyone . don ' t do anything that might leave a bad impression .
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

18. having ts on in the back ground shouldn ' t affect the way you play . if it ' s too much trouble , then perhaps a different alliance  corp would be better for you ? fly safe .
   (ID: a911ed792d3b26b115aedaee6218a4a944c38521)

19. i don ' t do stand up lol , but i ' d bring friends that way you have real incentive not to fuck up to avoid embarrassment . but at the same time that could make you more nervous so it ' s up to you and how confident you think you can be up there
