Total from this dataset: 51

1. i think it was the first time i played the last of us , i absolutely loved ellie  s character and wanted to raise a badass kid like her . also , i felt the same way when playing god of war . so i guess if i ever have kids i  m naming them ellie and atreus
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

2. no way ! i grew up on the prequels so i have the nostalgia goggles going on . that being said , i rewatched them last year after years of not seeing them and view them differently now . i like the phantom menace , but still think jar jar and anakin significantly make the movie worse . i do hate that the actors suffered immensely after the film but that doesn  t change that their movie parts sucked .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

3. then you really are as stupid as i suggested at the outset . they are completely accurate and they are about digit times more useful than your nonsense because they ' re the meat and potatoes and nobody gives a shit if you could add digit tomes of ands , ifs , or buts to them . " meat " is not a complete description of steak and " vegetables " is not a complete description of salad but those are the main points you think of when you see steak or salad on a menu and an adequate description of the difference between them for you to decide you feel like having one a lot more than the other . and all i asked you , was the difference between autism steak and retard salad .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

4. no problem . hopefully there are more like you in the world . fair play to you for wanting to brighten up a strangers day . another thing would be leaving post  its on mirrors in public toilets telling the next person how great they look  have a lovely smile  fabulous hair . or if you are out to dinner and it ' s really good , specifically ask to see the chef and give them a tip . i don ' t think they get them very often .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

5. i think everyone pronounces their ts like ds if its in the middle of a word
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

6. well then . i could explain where i think it may come from , but no matter what i come up with , i feel like i would have to join  imgoingtohellforthis permanently .
   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

7. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

8. he didn ' t almost collapse a grooming gang trial and it utterly transparent that you only all of a sudden give a shit about the victims because you think it bolsters your point of ' football man bad ' . you didn ' t care about those girls before and you don ' t care about them now and that is precisely why someone like tommy robinson came to prominence .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

9. yeah i fear that a lot actually , especially since i watch hentai from time to time which is nothing like real life . think i should quit ?
   (ID: 1e6ea64fb15fb5b12b1d82a3a5bdced4e3a6559a)

10. i think they can be funny with context , i don  t think people are laughing directly at rape when they make those jokes . ones that are like that are very stupid .
   (ID: cae6d1fb1a818280e66de4a71148560d2d217d70)

11. i think the proper analogy would be  a person who does not post  leave home won ' t get banned  mugged . the more often you ' re outside  you post , the more chances there are that you will be considered a mark  offend a mod . the more often you go to dark alleys  sb and sv , there more you risk , as the muggers  mods are more vicious there . one can give the mugger his valuables when confronted  be civil , follow the rules , and take his lumps when he and the mods don ' t agree , and then he probably wont be beaten up  banned .   x200b  see ? i too can make up loaded analogies .   x200b  i insist that " zoat asshole , zoat hissy fit " is a childishly simplistic view of the situation . to me it looks like  zoat is more active , so is at higher risk of ban all else being equal  zoat is a bit abrasive , so this also contributes to conflicts that may occur  sv and sb mods are power tripping , sb mods more than sv ones  you seem to think zoat is in the wrong and behaves childishly , completely disregarding that mods can also power trip and behave childishly .   x200b  also , at which odds are you ready to take a bet that zoat will receive next ban before eaglejarl does ? digit  digit ? digit  digit ?

12. thank dude , but i posted this hours ago and there is like digit person registered on it . don ' t think this is going well .
   (ID: e3524b3478c664f2c6e8b00a4341ff0a26995fbc)

13. i dont think it works like that but ok
   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

14. never ever pay first for challenge services . if they refuse , find another person . i think this is the only way i got scammedwasn  t much , like digit chaos , but the act of being scammed leaves a bad taste in my mouth . item trades are much easier to avoid
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

15. " hey mike , you ever think that shock therapy stuff could work on an incestuous fuck like me ? fire it up ! "
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

16. it cost you  digit to build the whole thing from start to finish ? or is that not including the case and wires and all that ? if it was digit bucks total that ' s pretty good . it cost me i think like  digit  digit or so to buy my te2 chun stick although it is an amazing stick all ways around so i like it a lot .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)

17. maybe fairies ? i think that would be really cool . i like dragons more but i ' m afraid they might destroy the world .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

18. rehorical gramps . i got class we can continue talking shit when i figure out what we  re doing . i enjoy banter winking  facealmost as much as i  m going to be enjoy fucking your silly ass up . i bet you think you  re like that guy from gran torino . you  re not , life isn  t like the movies oldster .
   (ID: 54271e4114265f638c8e4c59d7a3b35b6caa55bf)

19. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

20. i think i found it ! something called " captain blasto . this article says that one of his lines is " honey i ' m home "  here ' s a gameplay video , though it looks ps1 instead of n64 . but this is definitely your guy , in space with a blaster with the wisecracks very much like the gex game i remembered
