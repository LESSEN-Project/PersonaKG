1. i played an asoiaf campaign using gurps once unfortunately unfinished and one of the things that the gm did was making the combat very lethal . i don  t remember all the rules or homebrews used , but i remember we used the optional bleeding rules . in our game , set still in the targaryen ruling , we were all members of a minor northern house and were caught in the middle of the rising tensions between the bolton and the karstark . technically we were pledged to the karstark , but our lands were closer to dreadfort and the boltons decided to obligate us to serve them . as you can see our game was more political with very few adventuring , but maybe you could start with an episodic campaign , that behind the curtains is growing to became a conflict between houses and only too late the party will notice that they were dragged to the conflict too . like , they start doing random oddjobs for some house and later discover these tasks were actually pivotal to a coup or weakening another house  s economy or whatever .
