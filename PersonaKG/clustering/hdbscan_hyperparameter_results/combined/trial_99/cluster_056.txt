13. i qas born in ' digit and i think it was a good thing to grow up not having the electronic distractions . i think as adults when we say i want to give my kids what i never had they don ' t build that character trait you value in yourself .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

14. i think the division is really individual . i believe in a social democratic society which benefits everyone with some laissez  faire social spheres where there  s a general decorum . if a thoroughly studied , evidence based concept can  t be discussed or legislated without fist fights in the street , it  s not worth discussing at all ! but there are tonnes of people who want more autocratic , paternalistic state interventions on both sides of the aisle . i think all of them are crazy as individuals . face  with  tears  of  joy unlike what either extreme believes , becoming insular and being the loudest person in the room doesn  t make them the smartest or the most right .

15. believe whatever you want , i ' m clearly not going to change your mind . i don ' t think you understand the fact that people can be serious and humorous in one video . you do you . whatever .
   (ID: b6c3e540255084641f0e148a3992d9113c560f0b)

16. make the difference between what you really need and what you want . for the want , don ' t buy immediately , think about it , would that really make you happy ? often it ' s only a happy boost at buying time , an instant gratification and nothing else . many would think it ' s miserable life but it ' s all the opposite , the want i end up buying are things i really want .
