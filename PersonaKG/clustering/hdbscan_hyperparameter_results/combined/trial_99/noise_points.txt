1. she acted like you took up sooo much of her time whining about your poor baby . no . this woman is a cold lizard . she gave you the minimum and you are victim blaming yourself ! sorry . she sounds peeved that you are so sunk in your grief that you  ve forgotten the planets revolve around her ! well screw her . you are grieving your baby . what was her name ? where is he buried ? and what did she look like ? these are all such basic questions , for god  s sake that she could have asked ! because they mean something , and like any parent , you want to share your memories of your beloved infant . and you deserve to .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

4. but you  re insane to think that hitting your hand with a hammer the first , tenth , or even a hundred times will not hurt . it  s mental illness making you think there has to be a secret number of how many times you can hit your hand until it doesn  t hurt anymore
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

9. i had been at my job only a few weeks . the guy i worked closest with was a real jerk . he gave me one hershey kiss . just to act like i wasn  t embarrassed i said thanks and immediately ate it . everyone else in the office told him that was a dick move . he said ,  just kidding  and gave me the case of beer he carried around in the trunk of his car . he later got fired for being a total slacker and i got his job .
   (ID: c0c5a7c74c41387a99afab68d3e9fe0bfab4b8b9)

10. according to the tutorial your thumb stops the cards before making a digit and in the above video he moves his thumb until he riffles whole pack , with little more practice you can do it .

   (ID: 72155748e939f50a6f3bde77aee5ae7b7c499725)

14. the best suggestion i ' ve heard on the subject is , ask your pizza delivery guy . start with cheap chain places like dominos , because their drivers are more likely to not give a fuck . a driver for some local shop might be the son of the owner or something . so you order a small pizza in case you have to try this more than once in a night , and tell the pizza dude your situation . you are new to the area , and could use help finding bud .
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

15. that sounds rather tricky , because ultimatley i would think your not going to want lots of male muscle in the long run , you ' ll need a certain amount of fat to your shape . at the moment im 176lb ' s with a fairly feminine frame but im working out a lot . im trying very hard not to build too much muscle and just tone up . i dont want my biceps or calfs to get any bigger for example . i could be totally wrong but i would think you need to gain some fat , but keep working out while putting the weight on to keep it under control . if you suddenly put on 20ib worth of muscle you going to look far more masculine .
   (ID: 2e1439e8eb18b181a69a66cc4c1b2dc22ce774f0)

16. i don ' t feel like my perception of reality is very off it is that i am way more critical of myself than i would be months ago and some weeks are worse than others to the point i don ' t want to get out of bed . i also don ' t feel like anything triggered it really it just sort of stuck it ' s head out of the blue , i don ' t really know how else to discribe it .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

17. where do we start .  what does intelligence have to do with the right to live . pigs are smarter than dogs . which one is it ? does intelligence matter or not . if it doesn ' t , then why did you bother saying that ? yes , intelligence matters . human lives matter more than insect lives , to the general population at least .  dogs would be owned only by people who really need them who decides what really needing them means ? is it only for guide dogs ? no therapy dogs ? no comfort and stress relieving dogs ? if you ' re lonely as fuck and depressed , you can ' t get a companion , treat it well and love it , no you have to kill it because dog food is made of meat ?  in effect we would save some acres of rainforests that would have been used otherwise to feed the animals those dogs eat . so we shouldn ' t even feed them now ? we should just leave them to die of hunger or being killed by another animal anyways ? which will happen , because predators eat prey . simple as that . humans are the only animals with the capacity to choose otherwise , and it is a choice , not a requirement . also , you think they eat the fucking rainforest itself ? as in the trees ? or the plants , because if everyone was vegan , we would eat even more , right ?  one doesnt need a dog to survive i don ' t need a phone to survive . i don ' t need electricity . i don ' t need to wipe my ass after i take a shit , but i do it . why ? because life is not solely about survival , and if you think that , i don ' t know what you hope to do in your life .  would you slaughter a goat for your dog yourself ? if it were him or the goat , i should let my dog die for a goat ? a goat who will probably die anyway , being killed by one of countless predators as it is prey . dogs are predators . i care about him , he counts on me to live . i don ' t know the goat . it ' s just a goat , i ' m not going to die or have my dog die for it .  i bet many vegan pet owners would go sick from the sheer amount of death they caused . show me the argument . show me a movement saying that pets should be slaughtered . i don ' t care if the opinion is held by vegans , doctors , monks , or fucking talking trees , just show me that any collective group of people other than you has come up with this abomination .

18. One of my favorite things is luck.

19. jesus christ that is extremely hurtful and immature as hell from her . why doesn  t she date someone her own age ? that  s like right next to pedophile . i  m am so sorry you saw that . i can  t image the pain you have . does your bf know about this ? like if he does and that doesn  t make him cut her off then don  t date him anymore . and  chemistry  is such a bullshit word . the sex tape is probably from when they first started dating or something like that and that  s when the relationship and the sex is most fun . i  m not gonna tell you to just get over it bc what she did is extremely shitty and you have every right to be hurt . tell him and if he doesn  t do anything about it like cut her off completely then leave . and if she starts bugging you then send her ass y  alls sex tape lol . be strong girl . don  t let that tape get to you .

20. i ' ve had a close friend die via hanging and i ' ve always wondered  what does it feel like ? as a medic i ' ve had to cut plenty of people down so i know it ' s not pleasant , but do you remember what it actually felt like ? and in that digit seconds did you regret it ?
