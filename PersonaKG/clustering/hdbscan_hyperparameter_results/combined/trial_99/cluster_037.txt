1. i  m a big decepticon fan , and these guys are an inescapable purchase for me . even moreso because i  m in canada and the wait sucks , so i  ll go stateside for it online . one of the thing i think some people have overlooked is that since there are digit bots for devestator , in order to make the star math work , we see the firsts 4pt filler bots .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

2. expectations were also low for you in digit . you looked terrible in your friendlies , right before that world cup . we ' ll see what happens ! if you don ' t advance , i still think you ' ll do better than last time .
   (ID: 3fb1292a0bd26711d797fe1a61e6229794c21b68)

3. i think it ' s because half the time you keep talking to the wrong end . pick the side that ' s not blowing hot air , and you ' ll have a good conversation . if you do pick the wrong side , run , for it will soon be smelly .
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

4. do you think he supports negligent homicide investigations for miscarriages ? either a fetus is a person , or it isn ' t  if you push hard enough , i bet you ' ll find that ryan ' s beliefs have the same inconsistencies as most republicans . it ' s not about preserving life . it ' s about punishing sluts .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

5. another good strategy is to have foreknowledge of whether or not they say " shoot " at the end of the phrase , and then do the opposite of what they do to disrupt the round to give them more time to think , and generally they ' ll not choose rock since they had to think for a longer period of time , and will digit  of the time choose scissor , allowing you to choose rock and beat them .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

6. i never understand what people think will happen if lowe is gone . i ' ll answer that question , nothing . nothing will happen good or bad .
   (ID: e3a37ef234435ebde735894f98de2b3f90e3bbe9)

7. i think there ' s not a wildlife center in my city but i ' ll check . thanks
   (ID: 2834b254700cedfb96641229b712899b4d697418)

8. i mean you could try to have a long distance relationship even if you think it won ' work . and if it does work out , you ' ll be happy that you tried it .
   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

9. i don ' t think you should feel embarrassed . as far as i understand , you didn ' t really have a choice back then and your friend will probably understand this . i think he ' ll mainly be glad you ' re doing fine now .
   (ID: bfc2e9a6e5f84327293fa1a1fd0287066782bcec)

10. i think bethesda will react quicker as soon as they realize is atomic shop items being duped , and they losing revenue . as of now i don  t think they give a damn . never said anything bad about game or studio before . until today . i  ll upvote this  cause i agree to the degree .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

11. but those digit characters are unlikable and very annoying . i think it ' s gonna be jay . the guy is pretty old and they might end it with him on his deathbed . he ' ll say a few words to each of the family members , everyone cries , fade to black .
   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

12. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

13. glad we ' re on the same page in this technological age i think more people are looking into names and most people will check what they mean , but they ' ll always be some .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

14. jack handey v  o  if you ' re in a war , instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy , throw one of those small pumpkins . maybe it ' ll make everyone think how stupid war is , and while they are thinking , you can throw a real grenade at them .
   (ID: 2988ee1cd7a2bcf8e2d215c795ee2d06a985665a)

15. it ' s the equivalent of canned laughter  the reader is being prompted to laugh . i ' ll laugh if i think something is funny . in fact , if i read something funny but the writer includes a " lol " , i will stifle my laugh . principles .
   (ID: ed9fd9ff218602605c7fbdf8f02f658604680c61)

16. the book is pretty cool , some good tips and a good little side story , don  t think it  ll help you game any though but i think you  ll enjoy it
   (ID: a6171234e1a4ec65a39ad55aa0aa058eb98dff83)

17. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

18. if you think that way you  ll never make money .
