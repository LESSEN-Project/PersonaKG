1. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting

2. i think at this point your just upset that a little american boy has a different opinion then you and your trying to make me look like a dumb homophobic nazi

3. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .

4. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .

6. main character wise they are standalones , but world lore wise they are heavily linked , specially digit and inquistion . i would hold on playing dai and start with origins . i differ from the general consensus and actually like da2 a lot and think dai is just an ok game aside from the tresspasser dlc , which is phenomenal

7. alright kid if you think you can just insult alabama like that you got another thing coming
   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

8. i would actually like to play this scenario . but , the thing is , everyone would just camp their wool the whole game and there wouldn ' t be too much pvp . also , i think popular people ' s wool would get target too much . but overall , great scenario !

9. you should watch the videos before you criticize , otherwise you look dumb . i don  t doubt that you are , i just think you  d like to make a good impression here .
