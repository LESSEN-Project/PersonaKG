1. how are you supposed to know what you like if you don ' t try it ? so wait has the narrative shifted away from being born that way to trying it and liking it ? you guys make this shit so confusing it ' s impossible to keep track . half of me thinks the definitions keep getting changed because y ' all can ' t admit you don ' t even remember them .
   (ID: f39e591889b6331bd255039773030c1b50c7e201)

2. shmukatelli would do well to get to know someone with genuine gender dysphoria , and shmukatelli might learn some compassion for those with the condition . getting a sex change is not something one goes through on a whim . neither i , nor anyone in my family is like this that i know of but if my children ever came forward as such , i would support whatever decision they might make .

4. in australia we are paid wages  salary into our bank account . and we make payments to others via internet banking transfers . why are money orders and cheques still such a thing in the u . s ? i know my post isn ' t helpful and i feel for the op but it seems like these sorts of issues could be easily avoided .
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

5. well i always walk into a room with my head held high and with purpose so i start off looking like i belong  have confidence . really watch how you present yourself , use your body language to exude confidence . one thing i try to do but is so hard is to make eye contact when speaking with others . when interacting with people , i try to stand still and not fidget with random shit like my hair , phone or whatever because that comes across as being anxious . one thing i do which isn  t the greatest is i act cocky and borderline conceded . it makes me feel better and people who know me know that i  m not being serious . but sometimes you really do start becoming this person you  re channeling .

6. does anyone know where i can download this song for a ringtone ? the reds used to use this during rain delays , and i have a friend that is affiliated with the team and this song seems like the perfect ringtone for them .

7. no problem at all . as i said and as other people have said , you ' re probably going to find a lot of common qualities among most atheists , and can probably make a bunch of ' most atheists are . ' ' . skeptics . ' is a good one that ' s mentioned further down statements that we wouldn ' t argue much against . one thing i am , and i believe that many fellow atheists also are , is humanist . i don ' t know what else you ' d like to talk about . personally , i ' ve never been religious and had very little exposure to christianity or any other religion as a child , so i ' m still learning what parts of my world view would be interesting  novel  different from your own views or from those of religious people . what would you like to know ?
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

   (ID: 89e5ffcdc3b9c2cbc19f7274b7643ce26a8e2bbd)

10. doesn ' t the fee amount start with the team ? are they doing anything to lower the fee ? i haven ' t seen any info or feedback from them about it although i have not done much looking . i do know i am invested in xby and they were able to lower the withdraw fees by updating the wallet within the exchange . i dont know if this is anything like that but thats my other experience i have had with high withdraw fees .
   (ID: 6eb8259d7d6b7ae101dda44ceaaf3b9edaab4fad)

17. this sounds like a lack of training  impulse control issue and not the dog actually hating you . your friend should train her , it ' s not cute when an adult pitbull acts like that and is dangerous for the dog ! there ' s a guy in my area who brings his totally untrained   digit lb pitbull to dog parks . the dog regularly jumps on people and bites their hands  pulls on their clothes . the people involved have all been dog owners so they know to remain calm , but i don ' t see it going well if a dog  fearing stranger or child were the target .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

18. you know i have a question about oneplus . when the oneplus one first came out i knew one person that had one . i didn ' t see any other ones anywhere . recently i ' ve been seeing oneplus ones not op2 ' s op1 ' s everywhere . it ' s like everybody and their friends has one . what ' s up with that do any of you know ?
   (ID: 7026695d5469f9ac5987bd602ce0be29968523db)

20. i know lol . she really is great . shes like a blessing in my life that came upon me when i was very confused and didn ' t know where to go . whenever i feel sad i listen to litterally any of her songs and feel better . i am not a robot has such a special place in my  . so does happy . especially becuase i have anxiety and depression so it makes it even better .
