1. i didn ' t imply that , you inferred that very incorrectly i might add . all i said was they matter , and you twisted my statement around to make it something it ' s not . you really don ' t know how mental illness works , do you ? tell a suicidal person to just buck up and see what happens . most likely , it ' s not gonna do a damn thing for them .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

8. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .

11. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

   (ID: 5147e830e7cfa538d6990a8699ad6462b57cfb52)

16. ummm . wow ! it wasn ' t the nazis who built that wall . yikes ! i correct my previous statement , you should have just learned history ! that was not such a wall , that was to keep people in . much easier to do if the gov ' t kills anyone you know if you escape . kind of puts a damper on escapes and the ability to plan them with others .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

17. " secret " , just go through all people who can cursive and you know

   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

19. we all screw up and make mistakes . you will make more in your years of driving . just kind of put your hands up and shake them and that kind of acknowledges that you know that you were wrong . it ' s sort of a visual " sorry . he can ' t do anything with your license plate . even in the worst possible case that he could , it ' s his word against yours . it ' s not even worth his time . he probably just let the dust settle . if you ' re on the road , you have to deal with people who make mistakes and assholes alike .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

20. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else
