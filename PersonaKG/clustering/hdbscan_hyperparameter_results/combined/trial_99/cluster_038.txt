2. my jnmil ' s sister who is a way bad jnmil , once talked to me for an hour the night before my wedding about eating special k only until i started to see the " worms come out " , so like a special k cleanse . because it starves the worms . worms need meat !   . i will add this to my arsenal because god knows i ' ll have to use it .

3. there was a mom in michigan whos kids starved to death because she said they wouldnt eat what she made for them . the old adage " they ' ll eat when they ' re hungry " isn ' t true for all kids . it doesn ' t mean they jave autism , either . doesnt mean you have to give into junk , but they should at least have milk or vitamin shake . kids usually like those . sustenance is important for kids especially .

4. it came from me . here ' s what happened  my best friend ' s girlfriend was spraying water at another one of my friends , and i , as a joke , and i say " stop squirting on me , or i ' ll squirt on you " oh , and another one , this time a joke i made up  put the emphasis on bam in alabama , and you ' re like ala bam i ' m fucking my cousin because that ' s what happens there , i guess

5. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .

6. see it ' s hard to describe , but he ' s not one who likes to get embarrassed because he gets super upset and angry . he totally lashes out , so i figured with an instance such as this , maybe wait for him to come to me ? or is that the same as like we ' ll basically never talk about it ?
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

7. are you somewhere weed is not totally legal ? if so , i would say mailing joints would be an unnecessary risk . i suggest you give them to a stranger that looks like he smokes weed and maybe you ' ll make a new friend .
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

8. this seems like a show i need to watch because i ' ll laugh my ass of at how they always find the most stupid people to put on their shows .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

9. i ' ll do it later . maybe tommorow . eh it ' s not due for another day . oh , would you like at the time , i ' ll need to wait till next morning . oh crap i forgot about doing that .
   (ID: dc1fd340b3e0a603d715d06c129c512b8197c37b)

10. as a child , i suffered a lot from ear infections and as a result i had these drainage tubes which meant that water at the time was a big no . even though that ' s a thing of the past now , my ears are still quite sensitive when it comes to pressure and i would very much like to avoid experiencing what the girl from your scuba class had to go through . i guess i ' ll have to stick to snorkeling .
   (ID: 5fe12b36dc6d3370836c6683997c005efb656c99)

11. you  re right . if you look at what i said you  ll see i was trying to explain that chickens produce and expel eggs like humans , not that they were the same . obviously i didn  t do a very good job !
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

12. because as like everything else we don  t believe in hear say bullshit . if we believed every bullshit story someone from the past wrote down we would still be worshiping cats and cutting off virgins clits . so from all of us to your god i say this  all it takes is a two minute appearance and boom , we  ll all believe  .
