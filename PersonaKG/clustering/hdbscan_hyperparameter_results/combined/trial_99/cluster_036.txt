   (ID: 1921dc07cd609c210cb71a0176afa3dfa4fa3772)

13. i ' m not an atheist either but the more i learn about space , the more i can ' t believe that our earth was created the way the bible says . because w t f there are over digit billion galaxies in space that we know of . the bible has all these answers about how god created everything and our one planet and who even wrote those ? are they oc or were they added by one of the million people who have translated  rewritten a bible ? but has nothing to say about the massive expanse full of billions of other galaxies that stretches further than any one person could travel in their lifetime ? i wonder if i ' ll ever figure it out .

15. the bailout that has happened for all three of the " big digit ? what about it ? also jd power also gets their information from owners . now go look up what qualifies as a defect and you ' ll know why those reports are horse shit . you thinking a knob should be bigger or your ac should be colder is considered a defect . so anything , including properly functioning systems are therefore " defective .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

16. that our universe is limitless . it never ends . we ' re floating in a small piece of rock floating in a never ending space where time means little . but one day , all of this will be lost . our species will die off , and the universe won ' t care because we are nothing but a small glitch in a vast world full of cosmic wonders that makes our small piece land we call earth seem small . the universe will die off someday , and it ' ll come when we least expect it . maybe tomorrow , maybe next week , or maybe a few years from now , who knows . the universe and everything you know will disappear and you can ' t do anything to stop it .
