--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 30

   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

4. i think you mean more openly discussed . murder and violence should be discussed while at the same time nobody needs to know the details of someone ' s sex life .
   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

5. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

6. fuck , i think i know him ! well actually i know his mother . intimately .
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

7. kim kardashian . i dont think she has said or done anything to hate her . i think that her family have a succesfull business and know how to manage it and i never saw them make a scandal appart from kim ' s sextape . the only annoying thing is how much attention they get but thats thanks to media and people bitching for why are they famous every single day .
   (ID: 28b40f8090abf393e7d7a7cf1772fb2c16d434a1)

8. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

9. honestly that sounds pretty expensive to me . i dont know the prices of the parts off hand , but i really dont think it should be 2g to do such little work
   (ID: 46a39b1131e50f9cc061bbaf88e15686e5c9359d)

10. i don ' t know if i ' m ready for the next chapter . i don ' t think my heart can handle it .
   (ID: 8764a223ca1af7d1792e76a58bf3b1209bf73ad3)

11. yeah maybe with mammals and stuff but i don  t think snakes really understand the concept of help . from what i know they  re left on their own from the time they hatch and don  t receive any kind of assistance from mom . it  s possible but i doubt it
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

12. i think it  s hit reg . as far as i know there aren  t any hacks that make you invincible but in the wake of the hit reg bug it  s entirely possibly it could have been developed since everyone would put the blame on hitreg
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

13. shipping anything to china is incredibly cheap . you know how much stuff we get from china ? milliions and millions of storage containers come to the us and aus from china . how do you think they get those crates back to china ? might as well fill up the crates before sending them back .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

14. not to mention the weather instances i think you know of .
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

15. in what way ? wanting to know what specific thing you think makes it shitty .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

16. i think it  s all of the facts that are not fiction . it breaks the fourth wall and if you  re the inquisitive type it kind of sucks you in and involves you . the book has a life of its own , but the reel world facts and history are there to be pursued further . you get this all the time with nonfiction of course , but when fiction does it too , especially a real page  turner , it  s really cool . you know of any others ?
   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

17. you don ' t see the problem at all . you don ' t know any of the complexities or the implications of the issue , and that ' s why you think copy  pasting your own method would work . how offended would you get if the us told your own government  hey , our economy is the most successful in the world , you should copy it directly . of course you ' d be insulted . you should run your own country to your own circumstances , and we should do the same .  copy pasted from question digit mins ago
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

18. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

19. how cute , you think you know a thing about what people go through . try being bullied and shunned to an extent at digit different schools , 3rd grade until i went to college . oh , and you would all collectively call me a normie because i have an intimate relationship . don ' t assume you know a damn thing about any person who posts here because you simply dont .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

20. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !
