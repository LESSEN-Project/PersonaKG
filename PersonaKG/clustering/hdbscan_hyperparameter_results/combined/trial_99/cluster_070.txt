   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

2. i don  t like the spray bottle much myself and it hasn  t had too much positive effect . i  ve tried hissing for other kitty misbehavior and sometimes he seemed to take it as a challenge ! maybe if i tried it more consistently he  d get that i  m the big cat , haha .
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

   (ID: 7026695d5469f9ac5987bd602ce0be29968523db)

9. you  re not in the wrong . who wants to sleep around with a girl who might have stds ? even if she doesn  t , bragging about how many guys you  ve had sex with isn  t really impressive , it makes you look like a whore . he  s not slut shaming , he  s being smart .
   (ID: f72a72c8ffe94061edd962dd3f8293ca75595021)

   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

   (ID: 840f5d9bddf24e024b9a70f13cdde62d41604e77)

14. if you despise people so much , why are you in retail ? with an attitude like yours , you are worse than the customers you state you deal with . thus when you ' re off the clock you are probably nasty to others and will never be a customer like me . please show me where i ' ve stated anything derogatory towards a employee of staples .
   (ID: a61db1f2f0a3d15376fd168a1637c028f25100e1)

15. the only difference is you sound like your experience is from page digit while mine is from raising a daughter after many failed relationships as a teenager , hence my clumsy attempt at telling the young team how life works . i may not come across like it but i am the voice of experience . i  ve lived it
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

17. i will shine on you , like it was the only thing i ' ve ever wanted to do . shine by the smith street band
   (ID: f6b8978c4b660719e17dff38ba86c988b9bf86f5)

18. saying neither you ' ve affirmed their statement . should switch it off with something like ' well it ' s more natural than  insertrandomcharacteristic . plg '
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

19. nah man , even if you put the scenes in chronological order it still has no plot . i  ve tried to appreciate the movie , but nothing happens . compared to other tarantino movies , even ones light on story like kill bill , it doesn  t hold up .
