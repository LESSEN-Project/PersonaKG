1. digit things . while this is a good written theory , i see digit flaws . if in the game ' s 2nd act , you go down natsuki ' s path , her manga is brought up , in black text spoopy text she states " my dad would beat the sh  t out of me if he found out " saying she had some prior experiance with his ' abusive ' nature . next is the hidden random poem called ' things i like about papa ' in the end it states " i like it when papa is too tired to do anything " stating he is not a good father , making her happy when he wont do anything . it also says stuff like " i like when papa doesn ' t comment on my friends " and other things . maybe she ' s a good cook because her dad doesn ' t make food as quoted in the poem " i like when papa cooks for me " saying she likes when he cooks and she doesn ' t have to . can i also add that it states " for me " making it very possible that she has to cook for him .

2. whatever we end up making , i demand we include a user manual so people won ' t have to spend thousands of years trying to figure it out and still not understand things like why we get tired .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

3. anime is a genre no different than a type of music , and yes it may have many subcategories like most things do . you can keep trying to justify your point though .

4. customers that pick up an item from the shelf and then put it back in the wrong place . like , you can see that everything is in its place , is it really that hard to put things back where they are ?

5. seems like a wholesome , genuine bio and its good ! to maybe spur more interest , i would add what your favorite burger spot is as well as where you enjoy getting pizza from . someone may relate or have that in common with you and will give you a reason to ask her on a date , like if she enjoys , " digit guys " then maybe you could both grab a bite over some convo !

6. i personally fell out of an uber two night before my internship started and wrecked my face . had the scaries so bad i didn  t do anything for digit weeks . really was an eye opener to me . still get dumb like a normal college student but made me notice things can get out of hand , and that i am not the best drunk lol

7. we as humans like to apply black and white labels to everything . there is nothing wrong with emotions . there are things wrong with what people do with them or how we feed them
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

   (ID: a63ea1e6bf1e972229635648a0b3371aeddb4f3d)

13. it ' s a huge sore spot because people like you are exactly why so many abusive mothers are able to get by without any repercussions . yeah , seems more to me like you ' re one of those guys eager to put the blame on women for everything to prove they can do bad things too . i never gave a pussy pass to abusive mothers anywhere in my posts , so cut that victim bullshit right there . you sound like one of these sjws , " stop appropriating father ' s day "
