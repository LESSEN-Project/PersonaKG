5. hell yea lol . i bought some care for digit and it looked absolutely perfect but the check engine light was on and i asked the guy about it and he said it just needed spark plugs replaced . so of course i was like hell yea , that  s not too bad . and after a month the tranny went out digit dollar fix and then digit months later engine was shaking uncontrollably and i took it to the mechanic and they said it was a cracked head gasket . shit like this happens . there are so many scammers out there and i don  t even know how the hell they fix it up to last well for like a week lol . but it happens . i cried my eyes out cause i was struggling for money and i needed a car so badly i just jump on it . don  t beat yourself up to hard about it . sometimes unlucky stuff like this happens . next time remember to   ask for a car fax  bring a mechanic  bring an ob2 scanner  literally type into youtube  what to look out for when buying a used car  or something similar .  take your time looking . good luck op . and just remember to learn from this mistake .
