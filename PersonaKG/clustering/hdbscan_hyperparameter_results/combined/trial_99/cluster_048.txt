1. just when you think it can ' t get worse , she keeps typing .
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

2. amlo is just another stooge that protects and propagates the interests of transnational capital . he provides cover and a nice veneer while the capitalists go in and loot the natural resources , markets and labor of the country . much in the style of an obama or trudeau . i have no idea why you think anyone would care what time the asshole wakes up at and why you find this at all admirable . it ' s funny you would leave out the chavistas and maduro . why do you have such little political imagination ? why do you think your liberal tendencies are at all permissible in this sub ? are you another one of these white latin american men that has no problem stomping on the rights of indigenous peoples so long as capital accumulation processes can go on unabated ?
   (ID: 77d0324af3e030bb9fb9365a16e870bd522fd275)

3. i have one friend who knows but anytime i tell them they just go  oof  and if he comes round he buys loads of food and eats it and it ' s really triggering . also my other friend who i hang out with is going to latvia so i ' m kind of screwed . i think my plan of action is to get out of the house as much as possible so i can try and ignore my urges .
   (ID: 168d1161144e63a83a23f04ae4e64bd4b25684c0)

4. a few years ago , i was sitting in class doing my homework . the kid in front me , who at the time was my friend , turnt around and said " i think we should just nuke iran . this pissed me off , because im persian and i would prefer if my aunt wasn ' t turned into nuclear fallout . he then went on to say that the second amendment shouldn ' t apply to muslims  middle eastern people . a quick google search showed him that most of the post digit  digit terrorists were native born white people with more in common with him than me
   (ID: e7d4349520d7fd2b6b8d8e41558874e7ce55f7c3)

5. sorry if it comes out that way . i think talking is actually the right way to go for any issue . just my digit cents
   (ID: 96ea4e7f6c3452a58ef71fc7276006fdbf2ccb01)

6. god , i hate all of the rock fans . from the gatekeepers to the lewronggenerationhttps    type people . it makes me ashamed to be a rock fan . i can hardly wear a nirvana shirt without someone saying " oh i bet you don ' t even know that ' s a band and think it ' s just a brand " . bitch , you can fuck right off .
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

7. a sect ? or maybe just call it by the name of the group . i think namenerds is more about names for people or characters or pets , rather than words in general . you might have better luck on another subreddit .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

8. no problem . i think if you ' re doing a long term planning and you ' re not good with investments and finance , yeah they totally worth it . but in my own opinion i ' m no expert . if you just wanna deal with your saving , then nah just invest your money in a moderately safe portfolio and take it out when you ' re done .
   (ID: 9adb5fb6fb9aeeeb65afe41002460d73817044b0)

9. i think you ' re just bad at it , it ' s fun
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

10. losing partial  full control of myself is a scary concept that i don  t think is just limited to me . you do you tho
   (ID: 8ea8e4a00c3f2a64096e00bdbba0247e580cdb17)

11. it ' s not really shepard anymore , the shepard ai has much bigger priorities than talking to an old crew now . everyone would think he just died during the crucible firing .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

12. copy and paste made me laugh . can you not just type , what you think about the book and why will anyone read it ?
   (ID: 782311f0352356940fd2c1e77bc3cfa9f74b06fa)

13. of course my argument makes sense so long as you think about it properly . the effective skill of your team lowers when someone is simply feeding , or their focus blinded by anger . getting tilted and becoming unable to play your best handicaps you and your team , effectively lowering the skill of that player .  and you can ' t control soccer or football in that regard because people who throw in those games get permanently banned from the league yeah , and the exact same thing happens in professional dota digit . another similarity between dota digit and football  soccer is that you don ' t get permanently banned from throwing games just by playing casual matches with randoms .

14. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

15. yep ! i think we also see her mention it briefly in a season digit flashback to the red center just before she mentions the colonies and we see the picture of junes mom too .
   (ID: e387b7eddf8ab01e3dd767dc2f5ca52494fbe9b0)

16. if there ' s nothing i can do , i just think .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

17. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

18. cant remember what theyre called but i think you always see them , your brain just edits them out . it stops when on acid which contributes to visuals
   (ID: 37f1dd54cc7fbf9961db909e5dce33ca94dc5b82)

19. i never meant should have joined salem ' s side . saying " wrong side " was a poor choice of words on my part . i merely meant that cinder had to finish that fight , and had to succeed . it is a tragedy that the towns people were made into obstacles on this missing . it really is . but that isn ' t cinder ' s fault anymore then it is the townspeople ' s fault .  but , logically speaking , if given the options , which side do you think most people will choose ? safety . most people i think would be willing to give up almost anything in the name of safety . nothing wrong with that in fact . that doesn ' t mean those who aspire for something greater are evil just because they value some things above safety though .
   (ID: a22b82fe301caa42c89cbd71b2e3733753f695d9)

20. just when you think it ' s gone you hear the eeeeeee .
