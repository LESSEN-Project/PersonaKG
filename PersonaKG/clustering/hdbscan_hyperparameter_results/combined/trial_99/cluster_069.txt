1. scum ? idk i started a brand new map the first day i popped it up and i got digit bears to hit and run me lol best day of my life . but i think it  s a really good game , they constantly keep it updated , then again i think there  s a lot of steam games that are good and under the radar , i just feel like some people are d  ks at times because it  s starting up

2. this sounds a lot like my story . i appreciate all the people trying to make you feel better , and they might be right . but here ' s my two cents . yeah , you might be a narcissist . you might just have narcissistic behaviors . you might not have any . in my experience and research , i found there are a lot of misconceptions about the concept of narcissism . i began my research after thinking an ex was a narcissist . low and behold i eventually saw clearly that these behaviors were in my own actions . i highly recommend emdr therapy . changed my life . i definitely think that zealous religious cultures like mormonism breed narcissistic traits and tendencies because people have stunted emotional growth  emotional intelligence . it also cultivates codependency . people miss out on a lot of experiences that are key to growing into a health functioning adult . hang in there . no matter the situation , you have the desire to be self aware which means you will keep growing and getting happier . bravo and hang in there !

3. the other comments are kind of mean . you aren ' t obligated to be friends with anyone and it doesn ' t seem like you guys are being mean to him . as long as you continue to be polite you won ' t be an asshole . i also don ' t think its clique  y to have a group of friends you regularly hang out with . i would just continue to be polite , and maybe if he keeps signing up for your breaks say that " actually his name , we usually all eat lunch together . we aren ' t asking for you to switch the time you take your break at all ! but because only x amount of people are allowed break at once , could we coordinate a little better so that i can still eat with your friend ' s names ? "

4. stark  digit ? heck no . the character he was more based on , ultimate spider  man ? yes very much so , though neither wanted to be a sidekick but an avenger disney  i prefer it to the other two because people like you have ruined them for me but i in no way think it  s this godsend tom is kind of accurate just not really digit accurate

5. i don  t think it  s women that like you less , it  s just not the best women who are acting like this with you . i mostly have female friends i knew before and after transitioning and they were all really supportive , same with any male friends i had . they are good people , so they accepted me wholeheartedly . i suggest finding those types of people in your life , regardless of gender yknow ?

6. i feel like i need to say something here so i will . all three games are phenomenal . when i think of a souls game i think of challenging gameplay . dark souls digit was my first game and i loved the shit out of that game , still do and plan on getting the remastered when it comes out . tried demon souls but it would constantly break on me so i just quit . played through dark souls digit and due to the changes in combat was given the chance to better myself and git gud again . it had a beautiful world that made you question wtf was going on . it had a plot that was there only if you took the time to look . these things to me are what make a souls game a souls game . i just started playing three recently and i  d guess i  m about digit  digit of the way through the game from what i know about it . its fucking awesome starting out already knowing how the combat works . but because of this , i can  t git gud at it because i was already good at it when i started . i beat gundyr first try . dark souls digit took away what i wanted from a souls game , to be able to proudly say that i got good enough at the game to beat the everloving shit out of it . don  t get me wrong i  m absolutely having a blast playing it , and i definitely wouldn  t call it a bad game . digit and digit feel like adventures , while digit , much like its predecessor demon souls , feels like i  m just playing a game to get to the end , kinda like chores almost . finally , how in the actual fuck are you gonna say digit isn  t a souls game ? have you fucking played it ? have you beaten it ? it  s just as much a souls game as demon souls and bloodborne . in fact dark souls digit is more a demon souls remake than a dark souls digit sequel , they just threw in the same item descriptions and a couple characters from digit . if you think dark souls digit is the purest form of souls which it is than digit , being totally open with a vast array of ways to start is more like dark souls digit than digit is . there it is , my thoughts on the matter . downvotes welcome here smiling  face  with  sunglasses

7. do you really think that " getting really big " is a problem ? seriously ? what , ya think you lift a few reps , go to sleep , and wake up the next day built like a gorilla ? like it ' s that freaking easy ? do you have any clue what it takes to generate mass ? it required dedicated , disciplined work , and strict dieting . it doesn ' t just fucking happen . what i ' m saying is don ' t fucking worry about " getting really big . you aren ' t going to have that problem if the level of knowledge you have is so low that you even ask such a ridiculously silly question in the first place . go to the gym , work as hard as you freaking can , and you will be absolutely happy with the results .

8. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .

9. i imagine a good relationship , and i think about all of the happiness that will come from a relationship . i mainly feel like society doesn ' t accept me , based on how i look . it ' s frustrating how people don ' t look for personality in relationships , and i have a good personality . it just , sucks .

10. what ' s been going on inside of my head ? been staring at the ceiling , for hours on end can ' t really think of anything else that i can do  maybe i can go out , and find my way , or maybe i can chill out , stay in today they sound like fun , but maybe another day  sorry , not sorry ! i couldn ' t help it ! just ignore this post , wanted to vent out .

11. unless your arm is as long as your leg or you can dislocate your should on command i don ' t think the thing you ' re attempting to do is possible . if you ' re feeling a barrier , you might still have some hymen left , but really , your vagina stretches . it can likely accommodate anything a dude has to offer . listen , there ' s no right way to finger yourself . the whole point is just to feel good and it sounds like you ' re freaking yourself out . either get a toy or wait until you have a person you trust enough to talk about this with and let them put their fingers up in you .
