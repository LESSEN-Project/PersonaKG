1. we would grow indoors , and one of the main reasons i want to go is i ' m an addict and need to make a change . leaving family sucks but they act and look at me differently since they found out about the drug use . i love them but i need to get away from them as much as my dealers .

2. hell yeah , especially the digit always has that vibe . but they overhauled the whole building it ' s not that dark and damp place people used to love haha . but sucks man if you still want to go you can always hook up with me so you have a place to stay with some friends or what not ! have a nice day man !

5. the thing i ' d love to see that hasn ' t really been done right is a business manager game . i ' d prefer a restaurant sim , but instead of making it simple and have dexterity type controls , i want it to be a normal " manage " style gameplay , but you ' re dealing with buying food orders , hiring employees , creating a menu out of your food items , pricing your dishes , marketing  advertising , etc .
