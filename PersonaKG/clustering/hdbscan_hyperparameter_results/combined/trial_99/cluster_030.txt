2. did you not watch the seasons of her becoming an assassin . or the digit minutes she spent sneaking around the dead in this very episode . yeah i do remember the worst storyline in the show was her becoming assassin , i do remember the worst scene in this episode being arya playing hide and seek with zombies in a library , and none of it explains how she managed to get passed the wall of wights and white walkers . this show has become terrible , that final scene wasn ' t even suspenseful for me because you just knew that some stupid shit was gonna save bran at the last second , you knew jon wasn ' t gonna die , you knew dany wasn ' t gonna die , you knew sansa and tyrion weren ' t gonna die . this show lost its balls , it lost its quality , its practically just medieval superheroes now . it sucks , but what sucks even more is the fact that people like you have allowed it to be like this , constantly defending this shows awful writing is why we are getting the biggest disappointment since my birth . how the fuck does " the long night " get teased since the first scene of the first episode , all for it to last an hour and a half ? it just makes me sad how good this show could have been . at least i have the books to look forward to , but not even that will fill the shit show they made of season digit .

3. you have every good reason to be annoyed and uncomfortable . on the other hand people have their preferences and we are led to believe those shouldn ' t include overweight people . so it is possible they just didn ' t have enough self respect to ask you out before if they did like you . i once had someone relay a message about me " she ' s smart and funny , too bad she ' s fat . the great thing is that i won ' t always be fat but the dude who said it will always be an ugly block head

4. but then you would just get people complaining about " waaa why don ' t you tell us how you are fixing the tracker , what are you doing about rural areas , what did you have for lunch " like we do now . that simple tweet would not appease anyone .

5. you should like it , just giving you a warning about the place that did it . tattoos should look their best fresh , the lines will only get worse over time .

6. you got every single guy you shake hands with , reevaluating every piece of how the date went . guaranteed digit . digit  of the time the guy thinks immediately afterwards , " did she really just shake my hand " handshakes are more busniess  esque and not informal like first dates are . truly , dont cross boundaries by hugging . but givd them a kind , happy , warm smile tell them thay you enjoyed meeting them if its genuine and be on your way . they shouldnt expect a hug or anything more , but the demeanor of a handshake at our age 24m doesnt really fit the situation . in short , skip the handshake and just wait until you are comfortable with a hug !

7. don ' t appease her for risk of breaking your lens , shes just being uncanny . let her come around , , , dont fold my guy its not worth damaging your lens . let her be passive , but when she comes around hold to your strong points you have in why you refuse to use it . but you realllllly shit the bed by using the word psycho ahahaha i mean like , its like if the story of rosa parks went way south ? like if people didnt have none of that sitting down shit . well , you just did that . ahah she will show you psycho now that you called her out . best wishes on that part .

8. we must not be talking about the same deku . why does he like bakugo ? they are childhood friends . too unrealistic ? you can believe that a dude ' s sweat can cause explosion but having deku be too forgiving is unrealistic , yeah ok . risking his life to save other ' s ? bro did you not see episode digit , " my body just moved ? deku at his core puts others before himself , thats the reason why all might chose him .   x200b

9. yup . today my extremely smart and logical mom said that maybe comey isn ' t as clean as he looks . she sent me an article that talked about how he didn ' t take notes during a digit hour clinton interview or something . i told her so what ? he said he didn ' t take notes except for unusual situations and trump put him in an inappropriate situation . i ' m finding one of the problems is that she knows how to use snopes to see through fake news , but a lot of this stuff isn ' t fake , it ' s just biased so much that it ' s lost all sense in reality . did comey attend a digit hour clinton interview and not take notes ? probably . does that mean he ' s not clean ? i don ' t understand where an idea like that would even come from . they just say the magic word " clinton " and all of a sudden any kind of association becomes magically worse than trump . i don ' t even particularly like clinton but the amount of hatred for her is insane .

10. juul , the amount of kids im friends with who all regret it a month afterwards is just insane like you knew the risks why did you even start to begin with

11. i was just talking to my therapist about this . when you have the ability to do this and still get a ' s , it makes it hard to even be proud of the work you did . because it was so " easy " , and you receive high marks , it feels like false praise . it ' s a totally weird feeling . best of luck to you .
