1. chi brew is better for single target  with serenity , and eventually when you get digit  set and a higher ilvl and class trinket let ' s say average digit  you ' ll want to run chi explosion  ascension for multi and single , as it just gets easier to manage with very little difference in dps . i might be wrong about the last bit as its been a while since i ' ve gone and played ww , mostly brm at the moment . the most important thing to remember is that this is a game , and   you have to play it my way or not at all   personal preference takes precedence over min  maxing unless you prefer to min  max and like doing as well as you possibly can .

3. no , in normal  raids you have a lot more personal responsibility . you can ' t just afk through the fights . it is a helluva lot more fun than lfr . you should try playing each of those specs through lfr a few times . get a feel for how you ' d perform in a large group setting . lfr might not be " real " raiding but it ' s close enough to give you an idea . tanaan , lfr and mythic dungeons can get you into normal raids easily , then from there you ' ll go to heroic and mythic raids , ofc . race only matters if you ' re going for extreme feats like world first . play what you want to stare at for hours on end .

4. since what a fursona is has been explained to death here i ' ll just add to it first , you do not need a fursona to be a furry . in general " being furry " is a very loose term . the only thing in common between all of us is that we like anthropomorphic art . however if you do want to interact with the community outside of reddit having at least an oc as an avatar will help tremendously . second , hya reddit is the best place imo . stay here if you want amazing furry art regularly oand go to furry  irl some nsfw , not a lot for memes and shitposting .

5. i play online vs exclusively . i ' m not saying this to piss you off , but i can poke check and stick lift all day long and hardly ever get a penalty . my poke checking could arguably be considered poke spamming i do it so much . it ' s all about proper positioning and timing for those poke checks , and never poke from behind . as far as stick lifts , they work very well during puck battles , especially along the boards . if your opponent gets possession , lift that shit right away you have to be fast and it ' ll almost always come loose and back to you . i ' m not saying it ' s perfect far from it , but if you ' re getting penalties on poke checks and stick lifts either your timing or positioning is off . go ahead and downvote me if you want , but i hardly ever get penalties for pokes and lifts . almost all my penalties are checks into the boards that ea will randomly call boarding or charging .

6. oh great , now we ' ll have to go through scanners and get groped if we want to go through a tunnel or cross a bridge .
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

7. it happens to me all the time i ' ll have something i want to write down or search and it just leaves me it ' s very frustrating .

8. all you have to do is accept jesus christ as your personal savior and you ' ll make it into heaven no matter what you do in this life , so you can even stay in the gang if you want .

9. that is just too random . i mean , the caves themselves seem huge , no matter how far , i still see areas of darkness . so i ' ll try and fully explore the area , i guess . i don ' t want to die and respawn , since i mined up lots of ore .

10. i was raised hindu and was always interested in religion so i have a lot to speak of ! another one is that hindus in india will often put a lime and chilli peppers on a string  pin outside of a home or business . this is because lakshmi goddess of wealth and prosperity has an older sister alakshmi goddess of the opposite of those . lakshmi likes to eat sweets  milk  fruits , so if you keep them inside she ' ll come in and you ' ll have good luck . alakshmi likes to eat sour and spicy food , so keeping the lime and chili out there will keep her satisfied outside without coming into your life .   x200b  in a related story , when a sage was asked who is more beautiful between lakshmi and alakshmi , he said that lakshmi is more beautiful when walking towards you because you want good luck to come into your life and alakshmi is more beautiful when walking away from you because you want bad luck to leave your life .

11. look at the sun first . then look at the data of the other planets in the solar system . you may find that there might be something similar going on ? you may also want to look into nasa ' s current observations on sunspots and solar activity and the average temperatures since this sun cycle ended . either your suv is reaching and has changed the heat of pluto  or . well , maybe i ' ll let you be the observational scientist . meanwhile , all the climate projections have been wrong since mr . gore ' s power point presentation . why ? it deals mostly with carbon dioxide , not the sun   and not a single climate projection that i have reviewed has ever taken in account of the heat sync ability of the earth ' s oceans .

12. do you want cell service on it ? i bought a  digit tracphone at walmart for my toddler to watch netflix on during a trip . it has all the things you mentioned . it ' s locked to their network so you ' ll never be able to take it essential l elsewhere , but it seemed to handle what i required of it .

18. hrm , yeah i do want to do that for refining but the phase i ' m thinking of is concept writing   rehearsing . right now i ' ve been writing my bits like . so anybody here like joke set ups ? make some noise !  point to loud person  there ' s my people ! i ' ll tell you something about joke set ups ,  pause and grin  the best part is  snidely  the punchline ! then i practice till i don ' t need the notes , but i find if i let a bit of time go by between writing and rehearsing happens when bits come to me during a busy moment or in the middle of the night i often stumble over my clumsy notation . just wondering if anyone had a better way of putting the extra stuff on paper .
