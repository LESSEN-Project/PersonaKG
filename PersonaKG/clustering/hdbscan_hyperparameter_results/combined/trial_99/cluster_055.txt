10. yes , it  s not rape . i personally believe you should always disclose that you  re transgender , even in short term activities like hook ups , for your safety . what if someone outs you to them ? what if blah blah blah . a lot of things could go wrong . there  s plenty of stories online where they talk about how they almost got beat up or killed because they disclosed they  re trans or forgot to or something . personally , as a trans man myself , i want to know if my partner or hook up is a trans woman . i wouldn  t be mad or anything last minute , but i would want to know .
