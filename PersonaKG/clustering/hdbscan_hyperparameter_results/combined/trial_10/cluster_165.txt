1. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .

3. lol ! i liked it a lot , especially the sense of isolation and vulnerability you had playing as a regular soldier rather than a spartan . it also reminded me a bit of metroid prime , which is one of my all  time favorite games .
