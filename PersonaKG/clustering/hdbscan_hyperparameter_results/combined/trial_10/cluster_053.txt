1. just say you disagree , if they want your reason , they ' ll ask for it . then , they can decide whether to agree with you or not .

2. you ' re right . and i think the most important  and hardest  part is phrasing things so people know you ' re not attacking them , just trying to discuss an issue .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

3. my response was an honest question . someone wishing to advance should not be offended but take the criticism and do something constructive with it . that ' s all the honest advice i have for you . good day !

4. just one point of advice . i don ' t care if you take it or leave it . when you disagree with someone , keep the argument on  topic . if you are talking about latin american revolutions , just talk about that . resist the temptation to bring in things like mao , etc . you might feel justified , but it ' s not a productive way to interact , because  a the topic of latin american revolutions is complicated enough on its own , without bringing in the chinese . you ' re just opening a new can of worms , trust me . b the other person will take it as a personal attack , even if it wasn ' t . c it feels to the other person , anyway like you are deflecting . that is , it feels like you are trying to change the subject , and refocus the conversation on her shortcomings , rather than dealing with the topic at hand . she will see you as immature , like a school boy who gets caught cheating , and then screams , " but jimmy cheated last week , and got away with it ! " it does not matter if jimmy got away with it . we are talking about you cheating right now , and talking about jimmy is off  topic . again , this will only make you seem immature .

5. the only difference is you sound like your experience is from page digit while mine is from raising a daughter after many failed relationships as a teenager , hence my clumsy attempt at telling the young team how life works . i may not come across like it but i am the voice of experience . i  ve lived it
