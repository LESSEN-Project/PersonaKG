1. hey , you  re not a bad person  you were angry and people often say unkind things when angry . i get it , that  s why i asked why you commented that way . i like rust a lot and believe it will become more and more influential . thank you for your time to respond and apologize . it  s a sign of bravery when people do that . i appreciate you .

2. firstly because it was a long response , and it wasn  t angry , i thought u were offended . secondly was daily in capitals i now know it was a mistake and the fact that you told me to go and get the armour myself , which would be pointless as i don  t want it

3. apologies if my comment came across as uncivil and misunderstood . i wasn ' t insulting the op in the slightest  in both of our cultures what i said is deemed friendly banter and it is a difficult situation as the internet is globalised so certain cultures reading this would take what i said to be offensive however the person this was directed at would digit  understand where my intent lay . i do however understand that there may be people reading this who could find it offensive even if it wasn ' t directed at them so i can see why it was removed . i just wanted to clarify that there was zero malice in my statement . thanks .

4. i apologise then . i see this a lot from trolls so i had a knee jerk recation . i ' ll tell ya , being white doesn ' t affect my job , my social life , or my relationships . racism happens , that shit is real , but it ' s never had any serious impact in my life .
