11. i think what he  s saying is misinterpreted . the horde has always been a family with honor bringing them together . it  s their appreciation for honor and spirit which guides them in accepting each other and bringing them closer . they  ve each faced oppression and fought to restore it . it  s the economy and empathy that brought goblins into the pool as well . i think what he  s getting at though , is  because we see sylvanas becoming more and more unpredictable  volatile burning down teldrasil  killing innocentshonorless targets there is turmoil in the horde . everyone is essentially watching her delve into madness and thinking  whoa hey that  s not cool  . literally this entire expansion has been saurfang and baine trying to stop sylvanas from her actions . they don  t mess with her entirely though because the honor that comes with vol  jin  s decision in appointing her as warchief . it  s kinda reminiscent to seeing a family member go way overboard and the rest of the family being put in a difficult decision . do we make the effort to bring this individual back to earth or do we separate ourselves ?
   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

12. no , i never told anybody . it ' s hard to explain , but i just can ' t get it out of me . i was afraid for so long that i would be judged , or that people would " feel bad for me " . i know what happened was horrible , but i ' m in a good place now . i don ' t want unlock that part of my memory for someone else to see , if that makes sense .
