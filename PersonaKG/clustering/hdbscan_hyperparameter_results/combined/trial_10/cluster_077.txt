1. i agree . once the achievement hunters get their aps , everything will be back to somewhat normal .  the only real bad thing about leagues so far are the pve commanders . yeah , there ' s a ton of them  but on the flipside , they probably really want to help . it just so happens they get overwhelmed with all the things they need to do . they may have been used to running with their guild then decided to try it out on the server . i once commanded our guild run in wvw and it ' s really different when you ' re working with your guild and when you have pugs with you . with your guild , you know what they are capable of so you always know what to tell them . with pugs , there are a lot of probabilities with them  are they upleveled ? because they might not survive the first clash . are they here just for the karma  xp  loot ? then they won ' t follow instructions if you tell them to " stack " , " blast statics  might " , and so on and so forth because they would be like , " whatever man let ' s get this over with "

2. we all kind of rely on each other to be honest . i play all roles and i feel there should just be more respect , and more competency between them . healers keep everyone alive yes but a good tank stops everyone else taking damage . without the tank you would be equally screwed . likewise good dps will kill things so you ' re not fighting a war of mana . they should interrupt and stay out of danger . what i am trying to say is that everyone should work together , show some support and learn your class so you can adapt quickly . as soon as one of these digit roles thinks they are more valuable or don ' t have to try as hard the whole thing fails .

3. i think people should play for the enjoyment and not just to win another uhc  like if you want to play dirty there ' s a cutclean game in digit minutes .  it should be for the audience .

4. is it really that big a deal to ask to do that in a custom match or with a full party of digit ? i dont normally have much fun when we decided to all go one hero then proceed to get stomped . i don ' t think losing is all that fun and when a good digit  of my matches are that and i get penalized for leaving ? yeah it gets old .

5. pve upscaleds i ' m all for everyone wanting to try wvw but i really , really , really hope they are playing to win rather than playing for the achievement  loot  xp and karma train . i have seen people running back and leaving the zerg in the middle of a siege  clash just to pick  up a gaddam loot bag left behind .
