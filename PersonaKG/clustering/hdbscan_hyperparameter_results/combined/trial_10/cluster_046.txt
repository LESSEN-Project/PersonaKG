5. the company i work for pays us to go volunteer a few times a year with a food bank we work closely with and donate to and what not . the fuckin nerve of some people that come in there is unreal . you have the super nice and just down on their luck people that are super appreciative for anything you give them , and for helping load it into their cars and what not , then you get the giant pricks who make you put digit bags into their brand new car , then when you get there they open up the bags and start taking out vegetables and whatever else they dont want and demand you bring them back inside and give them extra cake or sweets , or whatever they choose then flip out when you tell them that ' s not really how it works .

6. my mom once went to a popeye ' s where the service was really slow and there was bulletproof glass separating the cashier from the customers . the service was so slow that a guy who was waiting in line was able to watch a few episodes of daredevil in the amount of time it took him to get his food . my brother wanted to leave , but my mom had already paid for our chicken and she didn ' t want to trust the dumb kid behind the counter with her credit card again . the moral of the story is that you shouldn ' t go to popeye ' s restaurants in the ghetto .

7. i was working a food line by myself , and we got a rush of like 9ish small groups , and in the middle of me running around trying to make everything , a woman came up to the counter complaining that i didn ' t cut the crusts off of her son ' s sandwich . if that had been instructed , i would have done so , but i wasn ' t informed that she wanted that , and i was busy as all hell . the dark part of me wanted to hurl a knife at her and yell " do it yourself bitch " but i just asked to wait a few minutes , and i would give her a free sandwich , without the crusts . thankfully she shut up after that , but fuck , i wanted to yell at her .

8. let ' s be honest though . we all know what would really happen you get to the ice cream freezer at the gas station , reach for the klondike bar , then go " holy shit ! they have choco tacos " then buy one of those instead .

9. oh my god that  s a nightmare for me . i  ve only recently went through a drive thru for the first time and that was hard af for me .
   (ID: 404d4f663681fcf738d043296148ae4de655b22b)

10. maybe not the worst but it ' s up there for me , taco bell .
   (ID: 2ea109772fcc0738f65030d7584f4ec864e785dd)

11. i don ' t like anyone bagging my groceries for me , just the way i am . so when i see someone coming to bag it for me at the self check out , i turn them away . many times it is someone who is mentally challenged , probably often times i didn ' t even notice . either way , i don ' t want to be rude . i don ' t want them to think because of their disability i don ' t want them handling my food . so i say , " oh , no thank you . it ' s going to two different places " so they figure i need to pack it a certain way .

12. i once had a guest completely lie  and i mean totally fabricated everything he said  and my boss bought every word of it . it applies to really any scenario in life but when you know for a fact someone is lying through their teeth and you can  t do anything about it , it has to be one of the most frustrating things ever
