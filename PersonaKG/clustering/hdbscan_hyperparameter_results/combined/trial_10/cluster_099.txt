2. reddit has some crazy idea that all lobbyists are just running around with briefcases full of bribe money and buying votes . while it is true that some corruption exists , there are tons of legitimate lobbyists out there doing good work . how do you expect all the senators , and representatives and other government officials to learn about issues ? lets say we want more solar power . we can all post on our representative ' s facebook page saying " yay solar " and linking to random websites with statistics that say solar power is great , but that will just get lost in the other pile of every other person ranting about what they want . now lets say that people pool their money and hire someone who has an intimate knowledge of the cost  benefit of solar power and can not only put together a persuasive and concise report , but can answer any questions on the spot that may come up . that person can do more in digit meeting to inform a representative on the issue than digit , digit people ranting online and writing letters could ever hope to do . lobbyists can do great work and i know multiple people who work as lobbyists in multiple fields , many for non  profit companies , and none of them are dropping off briefcases full of cash . if you want to ban every profession that has corrupt individuals in it , lets go ahead and ban all cops , teachers , doctors , accountants , realtors , nannies , waiters , and pretty much every profession , because there isn ' t a single profession out there that is free of corruption . how many people do you think would be cops , doctors , and teachers for free ? and do you really think that would increase the quality of work from that profession ? if lobbyists are really corrupt , do you think that having them not be officially paid is really going to stop them ? how about instead of making a crazy statement like banning a paid profession , we simply enforce the laws we have regarding government officials taking bribes ?

3. you don ' t see the problem at all . you don ' t know any of the complexities or the implications of the issue , and that ' s why you think copy  pasting your own method would work . how offended would you get if the us told your own government  hey , our economy is the most successful in the world , you should copy it directly . of course you ' d be insulted . you should run your own country to your own circumstances , and we should do the same .  copy pasted from question digit mins ago
