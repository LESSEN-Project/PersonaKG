SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 5

1. i think people should be able to like what they like whether it ' s elvis or iggy azalea . i personally like a lot of different kinds of music and there ' s some i just don ' t like but i don ' t care really what other people listen to . the only thing i have a problem with is blatant racism or things of that sort .

2. i don ' t mind a bit of rugby although i prefer league to union , but the thing annoys me about rugby fans is that they are incapable of not comparing everything that happens on the field to football . they love to talk about the superior moral code of rugby to football , but imagine if wayne rooney had been found guilty of eye  gouging , biting , punching , swearing at a referee , elbowing , headbutting and striking , and still not been sacked as england captain . it is absolutely not an exaggeration to say there would be questions in parliament and general moral outrage . but of course dylan hartley is a nice middle  class boy playing a nice middle  class sport , so it ' s all good .

3. well when you tell a group of people somethings not for them publicly i wouldn  t exactly be surprised when they don  t go see your movie . it  s not hate for the character or movie , it  s poor decisions to bring personal political stances to marketing your film .

4. i agree . even fighting should be done with respect . all fists no weapons and no kicking while the other guy is down . kicking someone in the head while they  re down is done pansyass bs . give them a chance to stand and fight like fights should be

5. if you can ' t countenance a person ' s art because the person is trash , that ' s totally your own personal choice . i just don ' t think that social pressure to boycott art like that is healthy . people should be allowed to choose for themselves if they want to consume that kind of culture or not .
