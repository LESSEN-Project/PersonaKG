1. no , but the stereotype is filled and this movie seems to be leaning very heavily in girl power bo peep not a soft woman any more . they didn  t do that with jesse , they just introduced a great character that was female . this is forceful feminism and it  s achieving the opposite affect . that  s what he  s saying . now stop being defensive .

2. why ? because all men must be manly ? again , it  s because you don  t like it that it is a problem . not a problem for the guy wearing the make up because he likes it . also , i don  t count restaurant staff as role models for my children . i am their role model , and i will explain to them time and time again that people can express who they are , even if we don  t find it  normal  or  cool  .

3. cause it ' s sexy . admittedly , i ' ve toned down a lot of elements due to my job , but its rare to see me without some goth stuff on me .

4. it  s not offensive , never said it was . and again , i  m not against sending a message , it  s how that message is sent . my concern is that they will overdo the strong independent female personality , just for the sake of it , robbing the characters depth and transforming them into a trope . it would be as boring and lifeless as a generic male power fantasy .

5. when a guy let  s a girl dress him up and put make up on him to impress a girl . if it  s who you are , ok more power to you . but if you let someone change who you are just to impress them , wack .

6. you are probably actually pretty attractive then . you want to control the controllable things haimakeup  outfit because you know you can be pretty if those things are working for you . for me it ' s more like there is nothing i can do to make me feel i look good . so better to think i look one way then to see myself and realize what i actually look like .
