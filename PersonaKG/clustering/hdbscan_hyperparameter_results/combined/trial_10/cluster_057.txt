1. to be fair this is what the community has complained heavily about since release . is this not what they wanted ? no sense in complaining about it how it is now if you were complaining about how it was before , as you  ve asked for these changes , specifically .

2. the post clearly says the point . 400ms lights , in response to consoles extra delay with frames and guard switch makes the lights unhealthy for the game , it promotes spamming and ' lucky ' interruptions of combos . i didn ' t go from " this to that " , it ' s all apart of the discussion , if you ' re not following it don ' t comment ? and as i said before the party for lights arent consitant enough to keep up with the dmg that lights do . i mentioned orochi because his lights are nasty , you can whiddle and opponent down in digit light combo strings , let alone if you mix anything in .

3. if it was easy op wouldn ' t ask for a quality of life change qol suggestions aren ' t limited to being difficult , in fact most of them i see are purely because the current version is annoying . stop trying to argue against qol suggestion with skill cap complaints , literally everything in the game can be considered part of the skill cap . e . g . why show a number for gold when you can just see if there ' s a gold rim around the item you want , why show health  mana numbers when you can just look at the bar , why show health  mana at all when you can just calculate how much health your hero has at each level with each item then calculate mathematically the damage after reductions of each enemy spells as they happen . my point is that skill complaints are nonconstructive criticism and just plainly bad arguments .
