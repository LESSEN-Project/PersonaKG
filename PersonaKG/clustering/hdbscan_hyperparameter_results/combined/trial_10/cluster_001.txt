1. perhaps she could be the snake of this game , a third party rep included largely because of the request of her game ' s developers , but i don ' t know how much platinum wants bayonetta in the game compared to how much kojima wanted snake in .

2. genjo  digit genjo had inquired on possible peaceful resolutions , and both paviche and dani scoffed at the idea . though , genjo had encountered the orks before , and he knew how difficult they could be . peace didn ' t always mean not fighting , it could also mean all fighting for a better cause . genjo would have to enlighten these orks . perhaps he couldn ' t stop them from fighting , but he could redirect that energy for a better purpose . that was an idea for another time . for now genjo would just listen on as dani and pastel both asked their own questions . dani ' s was more practical of a question . though genjo already knew the answer . having faced the orks before , he knew how destructive they could be . pastel , however , asked a question of oddity . it was almost as though she didn ' t want to help . perhaps she ' d need enlightenment too . all should do what they can to better the world , even if others are more qualified to do so . after a back and forth between pavi and a newcomer , lady ward , on whether or not to let pastel become a meat shield , a woman named delilah would enter the tent to further the debrief and speak of what the true job was . essentially it was a search and destroy mission . find daggartooth and end him . genjo wasn ' t too sure this type of plan was necessary , but he ' d keep an open mind . he didn ' t want to kill , but that didn ' t mean he wasn ' t prepared to fight . the team would also get a bonus for retrieving stolen goods from a group of pirates called the sororitas . this stolen tech intrigued genjo . what could it be ? how was it stolen ? what dangers did they pose ? and what happens should they remain lost ? however , genjo would ask the questions that meant most to him .  " i have but two questions . these items that you wish us to retrieve , what are they ? and what benefits do they have ? i merely wish to understand the importance of them . "

3. i sampled 1st chapter and part of the second . there are hints of effective altruism , but not much . also , this taylor is stupidly straightforward . one would think that utmost priority for a parahuman whose power stops working when she is seen would be ways to prevent being seen . the obvious idea is making a lot of smoke bombs , making suit out of them , igniting them all . if someone sees you , you turn into smoke  spewing teenager . as soon as smoke obscures you , you gain your powers back . once smoke dissipates , you turn into smoke machine again . that ' s the idea i got by thinking about cheats for a minute . taylor who lives this , whose life and death depends on it , would think of a hundred more cheats . she did not . i am disappointed . also , i feel compelled to ask the questions  spoilers about ending of worm  s " can taylor win ? if yes  why did simurgh choose this timeline ? why didn ' t contessa involve taylor in her path to victory right away "

4. i dont know about pudding because even if she becomes good she doesnt have any purpose in strawhat crew but saying that katakuri will be joining im thinking u are trolling otherwise he is the strongest after big mom and lets say her security guard and if u say about her realitonship with the kids i think is the same will all of them they fear her and they are tools for her acomplishments , so katakuri doesnt seem mistreated or anything .

5. so i just started watching the series to satisfy my endgame hunger . i recently ended with the episode " the well " and the end got me curious whether the two agents did it . so it got me to wiki of aos which is probably the worst thing to do . i discovered some things . specially about that agent .
