1. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .

2. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

3. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .

4. if i woke up and found out i was sustaining your life because it would be the right thing to do . people have many rights to do wrong things , but it doesn ' t change the fact that it is wrong . having a right does not morally justify every circumstance . and there is a difference between action and inaction . taking an action to end innocent human life is always murder .

5. fuck that . women who don  t let men have an opinion on abortions but expect child support are something else . it wasn  t the immaculate conception ladies , his sperm made the baby too . i don  t know how to make this situation work for both men and women . however , simply ignoring the fathers opinion is completely unfair .

6. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .

7. ok , i get the point of this and i  m sure it would help clear this up with some people but , if you force a man to get pregnant and carry the baby wouldn  t it be going against their consent thus making you the rapist in this scenario ? i  m not trying to put down somebody  s experiences with this but that sounds really morally wrong . not that any of the other stuff happening isn  t . i  m not trying to say something against this i  m just arguing morals .

8. i agree that hubris is one of our species ' flaws . i myself am a religious christian , and i while i do think we are special compared to animals , i believe in scientific proof , before dogma . accordingly , i believe in evolution and climate change , too . there is all the evidence in the world , that gays are normal , and not to be hated . the church says many things i disagree with , so i choose only to follow the stuff that lifts us as human creatures . you know what i mean , right ? don ' t steal . don ' t hump anyone else ' s wife , or your sister . do help people out whenever you can . be honest . be fair . call out liars . etc . basically , if it improves the quality of life , i ' m in . if it tells me to harm someone   like , " let ' s go hate gays ! "   i ' m out .
