1. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them
   (ID: 3e7b07ddd384cb288bc529e6aeb73f840aa5a294)

2. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

3. agree  don  t change yourself , but do open yourself up to make small talk with people throughout the day . grocery store , gym , anywhere you  re around people . good luck op ! don  t rush it !
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

4. sounds like a rough situation , if s is really obsessed i guess not doing anything don  t help , so you got to take action . i would suggest telling s you don  t like her , and hope for the best .
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

5. i am the first in my family to go to college . i did ok but should have done much better . my dad worked to pay off my school through a small business he started . he paid until junior year when he got cancer . at that point i got loans . i came out of school with about  19k in debt . not bad but not zero . that seems like a small amount of debt but i hustled for digit years throwing everything extra i had at it . then i got married . i hated that i brought that burden on my wife . you never know what may be coming . will your car break down ? will you get  keep a job ? will you have tremendous medical needs ? you can get hit by a bus like anyone else . my advice is this . go to community college and get an associates degree as cheaply as possible . then go to college for your bachelors degree in a field you like may not love and that has some demand . if you do that you  ll never worry about a job . good luck

6. i lost digit . digit stone  90lbs . then found 56lb of it again . am back on the losing it again . it ' s a war not a battle . don ' t give up if you start to slip . it didn ' t go on in a day and won ' t come off in a day . find your reason that motivates you and will help when what you want right now mmm . chocolate seems more important than what you want to achieve long term . but don ' t beat yourself up if you slip , you ' ve not failed . find like minded people for motivation . seek support from friends so they don ' t put temptation in your way . don ' t be surprised when resistance comes from the oddest places . people who ' re scared that you ' re changing or don ' t want to be the group ' s new ' fat one ' . just keep trying . you can do it .
   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

7. i believe the benefit you  re speaking of is a state benefit for your father having a disability rating from veterans affairs . here  s the criteria . go to school . nothing wrong with doing what you  re talking about with the music store but realize that  s a hard path . take a variety of classes . see what  s out there for you . you may end up going after something totally different . i always encourage people to look into nursing . is it glamorous ? no . but you can make  60k per year for digit  digit hours per week . you can even do it with a two year degree . that also gives you an income where you can start giving music lessons or working part  time at music store so you can learn the business . best of luck to you
   (ID: 5d0b750bf77c2c6e8b41ebf03caf4038a907b876)

8. thank you for understanding . i  m so sorry you have to go through this too and i truly hope it gets better for you . i don  t know your situation but i  m going through something like that too . i wish you the best .
   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

9. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

10. you can ' t really do anything . she has got to help herself . you can report her to your ra if you think she is a danger to herself , otherwise there isn ' t much you can do .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

11. once i fully realized i was an alcoholic and couldn  t control myself like i had been desperately trying to do , i was like  fuck it , what can i do to make this downward spiral faster !  . eventually , i had a moment of being willing to try something different , even though i didn  t know how or what to do . six years ago , i went to a crappy rehab , where we couldn  t even have coffee and i didn  t always want to be there , but , i  ve stayed sober every day since . i  m totally not extraordinary in any way , i just decided to give doing something different a chance and be open to not  knowing  what was gonna happen . i hope you find some comfort , regardless of your next move or circumstances .
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

12. i was a full blown alcoholic , who treated my friendships as transactional relationships and always had a reason why it wasn  t totally my fault some terrible thing had happened to me or that i had done something shitty to someone else . everyone , including me , was a victim of circumstance and anyone in my position would have done what i did . i got sober over digit years ago , sorted out a bunch of my shit , tried to make up my past transgressions to other people and barring the ability to take direct responsibility for those things , am just trying to live my life better . sometimes i get hung up on what i used to be like , but , can also step back enough to recognize that i can  t redo any of that time in my life and just try to be my best self now . i think past me did some shitty stuff , but , that doesn  t make me a shitty person through and through . i don  t think you can hate yourself into making or maintaining positive changes in your life . present me learned a lot through that experience and especially through getting sober . hopefully , i  ll continue to grow more , keep working on being the best version of myself and , if presented the opportunity , can help others who have similar life experiences .
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

13. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

14. every job will do , as long as you adjust your living standards . i don ' t want to argue that living coast are way to high in the last few years . and that mini jobbers don ' t get paid enough , is also true . but thats how things are at the moment , so you have to adjust . at most places your job you doing besides beeing in school won ' t pay you an own apartment . the higher the coasts of living are in a city , the more you have to find things to cut out . get a roommate , maybe even more . just buy cheap foods that are on discount and stock them . use a bike if possible instead of public transport quit your gym and start bodyweight training shorten your shower times buy everything possible used . sadly a lot of students have to work a lot , while also balancing school life , without a fair payment . so you will just need to be really lucky with your job or you have to really cut back in your living standarts for a few years . maybe even share a room and give up your privacy . i don ' t wanna get into finding somebody helping you out with money , you probably wouldn ' t have asked if this possibility exists . hopefully we students use this unfairness as motivation to make it possible for the next generation to have a healthy work school balance and getting a fair payment .

15. i know you guys are gonna tell not be with someone who i can ' t trust you ' re goddamn right .  but hear me out . maybe we ' re just doing something wrong ? mmmm nope . you shouldn ' t date someone you can ' t trust .  i just wanna fucking know who she ' s talking to lol . bit controlling but okay . ask her if its that big of a deal .
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

16. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

17. oof , as a woman i suggest you not to spoil women that much , some of us get used to get all we want and then it ' s really hard to get on track again . not my case , i made clear to my boyfriend we are equal and he can count on me as much as i can count on him . i suggest you to talk to her and give her an ultimatum , you should take care of her but she ' s abusing it and not thanking what you do for her . obviously you need to change this , and don ' t have any kids for now , neither more pets or expenses . that wouldn ' t be good for the kids or you .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

18. i can understand why you ' re uncomfortable but i think the term rape gets thrown around too much sometimes and this is one of the times . would this have been such an issue of he didn ' t cum in you this time and just did what he normally would do ? i think the issue is more of him just not being careful about pregnancy not about the sex itself right ?
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

19. you wont she ' ll most likely tell you she just wants to be friends and then if she was ever worth it at all will follow through with that .
   (ID: 0501bf1e5cd313190bb4590a1c677057b15a6e47)

20. if i were to stay with her , i would try my best to give her attention back and be the best boyfriend i could be . that  s not how i could see myself as an asshole . the way i could , would be me losing my patience and leaving in two months .
