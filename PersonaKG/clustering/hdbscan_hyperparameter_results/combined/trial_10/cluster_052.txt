1. as a guy , i don ' t know . i would never be in a romantic relationship because i like to do what i want , not what somebod else wants .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

2. maybe ? i mean most of say you want to feel loved , you want a relationship that includes sex , this would just make it meaningless .

3. people are seldom rational about their sexuality . the flip side is that being in a relationship is so socialized into people from an early age that they fail to recognize that it  s an active decision that you need to make with another person and then participate in , the latter involving a continuous renewal of  wanting it  . you can look at others and feel sexually charged ! that  s human , but failing to recognize the decision you  ve made to be in a relationship is an active process is something that a lot of people end up screwing up . it  s not to make it sound like a chore ! certainly too there are other configurations of and agreements to relationships , but the primary recognition , as far as i  m concerned , is that you have to be an adult and responsible for making a choice to be in it . otherwise , why bother ?

4. okay but what about men who sleep around ? it  s fine to think this as long as you hold men to the same standard

5. i think you really don ' t get it . we don ' t want a significant other , we do not want to find " someone to spend our lives with " your post and your opinion shows how little you actually know .

6. " one of my straight female friends said she likes hanging out with gay men , because she knows that the only thing they want from her is friendship . i thought that was a good point . " because wanting something beyond friendship is a bad thing ?
