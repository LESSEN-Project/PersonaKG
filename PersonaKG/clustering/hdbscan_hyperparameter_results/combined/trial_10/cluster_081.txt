1. because when i get asked if i read or like books , i always saw i do . because deep down i know i should read and it  s embarrassing to not know a book title or author . that  s why people get mad . dude , if you know you have a grammar problem and you dislike reading either accept your non existent interest to learn or start reading . it  s not hard . i hate when people say they love reading but can  t name a single novel or book .

2. if we are quiet in a group setting it does not mean we are having a bad time . although it ' s a nice gesture , you don ' t have to constantly check on us . it makes us feel insecure and like we ' re doing something wrong .

3. oh i do . i let people know right away that they are dumb for asking a question when we both know they already know the answer . why would you want to force a conversation with someone ? do you enjoy bothering people ?

4. so you ' re clearly letting it bother you and they notice that right ? people like that feed off of your response . you have to learn how to not let it bother you .

5. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?
