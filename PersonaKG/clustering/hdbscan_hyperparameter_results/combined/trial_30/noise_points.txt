9. and that  s your achievement today . you  ve made a healthier choice than millions of people around the world , people who would drink themselves to sleep . that  s something to be very proud of . even on my bad days , if i  ve brushed my teeth , i consider it not so bad . you  re achieving so much just be being able to speak to me , some random stranger from the internet . i know it feels like a stretch , but as i said , the littlest steps are often the biggest . getting started is the hardest part , but you  re already on that path by reaching out for help .

10. i got one for you , too  what about a god who created everything which includes sin , if he created everything , who had his own son killed to get forgiveness . he could  ve just forgiven us , because it  s him that is the forgiver . if you argued he didn  t create sin , he could actually do an innumerable list of things that would help more than killing your own kid .

   (ID: 6ea2719d7b2aba54e352b1f2b374bd6af6fd406d)

18. really , i have to thank you for the exchange we ' ve had . i intend to share it with as many people as i can . my friends all over the internet , my peers at work , and all the folks i have contact with on social media . i plan to share it with strangers at every opportunity . and you know what , those folks will share it with their friends and acquaintances . it will go far and wide . on and on . all over the country . look back at the lengths you ' ve stretched to bend reality because of your obsession with guns . the facts you ' ve attempted to dismiss because they don ' t square in a gun nuts head . the reality that americans kill eachother with guns more than any other developed nation . that america leads the world in mass shootings . keep hunting your hogs as the world looks back at you with disgust and pity . i should feel sorry for you but i don ' t . i have common sense and you do not . this is the last time i ' ll be responding to the nonsense you post . just know that you ' ve provided me with enough evidence to convince all those that have yet to be subjected to the garbage you and your ilk spew to reject it on a logical and factual basis . sleep on that . like i said earlier . thank you . your posts are nonsensical and increasingly bizarre . you have confirmed to me and to all that i intend to share this exchange with lol , which is a hell of a lot that gun nuts are real and are preposterous . so in love with the ability to create death that the essence of living is total lost to them . thank you . you have gone beyond proving any point i wished to make . once more . the gun control lobby have nothing to fear from you and will soon see their advocacy pay dividends because of crusading sophists like you leading the charge .
   (ID: 96ea4e7f6c3452a58ef71fc7276006fdbf2ccb01)

19. but you won ' t know you ' re not feeling it . your anxiety is all anticipatory , which in this case is just you completely screwing yourself because if your worst case scenario happens and there ' s nothing , then you ' ll never be aware of it . it reminds me of when people have a bad car accident and wake up and can ' t remember anything  i often wonder if it really happened . i mean , i know it really happened , but if you go through something horrible and can ' t remember it , does it count as going through it ? trees falling in woods , and all that . maybe too much pseudo  ephedrine too
   (ID: bb79791c3753a1fc8ece696b3835b0f59ddccc90)

20. we are literally destroying this world with consumerism . choosing quantity over quality . releasing carbon emissions into the air . and i wasn ' t talking about the u . s . i was refer to us human beings as a race . not everything is political .
