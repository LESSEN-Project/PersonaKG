2. absolutely speak to your therapist . you trust them . they will help you . you need to get yourself out of that relationship for your safety , physical and psychological . this is not a one  off occurrence .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

4. there are some foods that need to be cooked that are otherwise toxic , quinoa for example . the ' cooking destroys nutrients ' thesis , although often true is irrelevant . you can eat eat a greater quantity of steamed broccoli and recieve the same amount of micronutrients as a smaller quantity of raw brocolli

10. ah , so that  s the real problem . you  re probably a husband who  s had this same argument with his wife , so here you are to defend it . it would not be any different if the roles were reversed . you  re wife making the money does not excuse her from lifting a finger around the house . it  s not  helping  . it  s her house too . she would not need to  help her husband with the laundry  . she would need to do the damn laundry . every relationship is different but don  t deny the truth . just google search why most divorce happens . women feeling unappreciated and taken for granted is one of the highest reasons for divorce in america . this is for you
