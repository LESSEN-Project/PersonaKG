3. i ' d say kratom is mind altering . i ' ve taken it daily for so long and it has definitely altered my mind . it ' s psychoactive and gives a mood boost , euphoria , and much more . hard to not generalize all substances because where would you draw the line ? is weed okay ? is adderall okay because it makes you focus ? what about alcohol ? can you drink kava ? that ' s why they generalize and say any psychoactive substance . basically they want you sober and stone cold sober .
