16. is there a difference between transgender and transsexual ? is transsexual considered to be an insult ? i ' m genuinely curious . all this gender talk frustrates me sometimes , there ' s so many genders and no one talks about sex  what ' s in your pants , or whether its there naturally or artificially . that ' s the thing i care the most about when it comes to romance and sex as a gay guy .

20. maybe , but i was more suggesting a merger rather than a complete take over . he only had a few seconds to engage with the cybug , so he probably wasn ' t aware of the beacon thing . you can see this when he is attempting to fight against the urge to move toward the beacon . his personal code is unaffected thus he tries to resist , but the cybug code is still in equal control since the beacon thing is still in effect . probably even more in control since it won out in the end .
