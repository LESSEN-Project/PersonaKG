2. aside from obvious signs such as abuse , look for subtle psychological abusive things like how the family interacts together . if a lot of times they are together with an attitude of only because i have to be here is a flag to look for , especially if they don ' t enjoy each other ' s company . other things to look for is how they talk about each other when they ' re not with each other  if it ' s all bad  mouthing or lack of respect , concern , or true love that too is surely a bad sign .

   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

7. you ' re not ugly man . you seem like a slender guy and the shirt your wearing in your photos look a bit oversized so perhaps size down or just find better fitting clothing . otherwise you look good .
   (ID: 89e76efb1868896fe46bffbc2c10d965b53857d1)

   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

20. a brief look and i am guessing it is real . i can ' t take any more than a brief look as my liver is already in open rebellion and i think exposure to that site would probably prompt a few more organs to join it .
