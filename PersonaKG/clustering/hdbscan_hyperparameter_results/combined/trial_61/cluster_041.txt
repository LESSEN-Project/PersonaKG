1. awesome , i ' ll be sure to innerfidelity out . i doubt i ' ll end up buying new headphones now , i like the hd599s and ill see if listening to them as you said opens my eyes a little . but the explenation of akg and beyerdynamic will be super helpful when i inevitably do decide to buy another pair thanks for the help , once again

4. nice list though duplicating some of the requests earlier to the normal maps app . i  m sure if they bring them then they  ll bring it to both this one and the maps app . on another note , i recently submitted most of this feedback to not just the apple feedback site , but also to eddy cue as he  s the svp of maps among many other things . you might wanna do so too so it likely gets better prioritized as imho few from the teams read our postings here .
