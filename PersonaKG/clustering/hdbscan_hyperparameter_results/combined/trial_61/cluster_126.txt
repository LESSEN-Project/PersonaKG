1. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .

2. it will be ok and just imagine the relief when it ' s all over and in the past ! your doctor will not scold you for holding off on appointments , she will be happy you came in ! even if you have the worst case scenario , you will be in the right place , plus most cervical cancers are treatable when caught in time .

3. thanks . this actually makes sense to me . we actually leave ours out all the time and it just confused me why if we never wrap the chord up it gets messy
   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

4. every time i get used it ' s just another masturbatory story to me . who ' s next ?
   (ID: 917dfa16e92ce1db67ec3f88bc07b87b70a36c95)

5. i ' ld teach you how to spell " you . just kidding with you . i hit the wrong keys all the time too .
   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

6. they are not quite playmates since they are pretty much ignoring each other . i am just happy i can have them in the same room and can spend more time with each of them . condescending karens are everywhere lol
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

7. yes it sucks and having digit  learnings to complete is a bit much . they are there for a reason and if you just skip through without retaining any if the knowlage idk what kind of employee you would be . just take them one at a time .
   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

8. my gf and i tend to devolve common phrases and words over time to more just nonsense noises . we can have almost whole conversations with bizarre words and noises . we often ponder that to anyone on the outside it might seem we were both handicapped in some way
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

9. even in this sub . last time some dude stole a pic with the oops tag on it the entire sub ripped on that dude so bad . all memes should have a mark somewhere imo just to give credit where credit is due .
   (ID: 97f042c151ad751b2811d75ae69fd7feae42ed77)

10. wait , what ? you can only get it once ? i too lost it a long time ago . i was just waiting to find another prismatic shard .
   (ID: 32963b268f862205bfe0776470d7730e54b581ec)

11. at least you can play it . every time i join an ongoing match , my screen just stays black , i can hear everything , i can move , can shoot but i can ' t see anything . but yeah , the introduction is kind of " lagged " .
   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

12. is the stoning for adultery pertaining to both genders ? because every time that i do read or hear about it , it ' s always the punishment for women . what if the man commits adultery ? not trying to toss gender  equality into an already cans  of  worm belief . just genuinely curious .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

13. it  s true that it is kinda a waste of time anyway , the problem is that instead of having fun wasting my time i just get depressed
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

14. what if she ' s just trying to get comfortable because it ' s gonna take a long time to show u all those memes ? eh ?
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

15. i agree with this digit  . when i put my blinker on to get over , more than half the time , the person i ' m trying to get over in front of speeds up to stop me from getting over . so i just quit using them .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

16. sometimes when i type " just a sec " i mistyped and write " just a sex " awkward answers when there ' s time that passes until i realize what i said .
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

17. so what do i do next , do i just kinda ask again some other time ?
   (ID: 5ad91cf15026f9d604e90af77be91ab4f6b7289a)

18. they  re wrong and so are you , because there literally is not a correct answer . sorry if what i said stung , but i hear it all the time from fans who obsess over it instead of just enjoying the show .
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

19. mist raven also works if you time it right just when the snake attacks you .
