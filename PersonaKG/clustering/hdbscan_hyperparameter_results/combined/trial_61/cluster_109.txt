7. i take it that the crew are a comedy group ? is " crew funny " highlights of their " skits " or just some bonus behind the scenes of their creative process ? in any case , eating donuts purchased for someone else isn ' t funny or quirky , it just makes you look like a self  absorbed asshole especially in the jerk  like way amanda phrased it . p . s . i ' m also the last person to complain , but that is the wrong there in your sentence will .

18. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets
