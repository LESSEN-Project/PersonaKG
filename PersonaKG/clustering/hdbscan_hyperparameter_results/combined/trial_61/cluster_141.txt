2. sounds like a good plan . which pokemon are you playing ? is it any good ? how is it different from the last digit pokemon games ?

3. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .

4. i can somewhat understand this with subs like wpd , or cringeanarchy , but waterniggas ? seriously , what the fuck ? that sub is actually pretty wholesome . memes about staying hydrated can turn into good tips on living a healthy lifestyle .

5. good question . seems to me like they might be able to answer quite a few of the questions around this case by discreetly placing a camera to catch whoever is desecrating the grave .

6. with soccefootball there are so many players around the world , plus the transfeloan system , it makes it easy for the wealthy clubs to acquire good players . in the nba it ' s a lot more difficult , sometimes there is nothing they can do . teams like the lakers and knicks would have been relegated a few years ago , despite how big of fan bases and wealth they have .

7. that actually sounds like a good idea . the only problem i see possible is where do they go for work afterwards ?
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

8. omg u guys are so dumb obviously no one has ever said this to you so stop making  memes  and go get a real job like go on tumblr or something that  s a good website guys it  s obviously a joke . edit

9. they look like freesias . do they smell good ?
   (ID: d3491a90d756046acac8c3053e9e99c3e6c231f9)

10. she treated me like a good friend . that ' s it .
   (ID: 943cc5e526975c71d69ca1804666ab2f83b06a27)

11. yeah if the case cover is off i would suspect bad contact of the cooler to the cpu . with a good aftermarket cooler you shouldn  t be seeing temps like that .
   (ID: e7516540d2045135f43a4a7c61f0bd88856c8ff4)

12. try to get the point across with statements like , " i haven ' t had something as good as this is a while . " , see if a mutual dialogue opens ?
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

13. hmmmm . what would be a good place ? get everyone to head out to a wheeling spot like hot springs ? i ' m not coming up with a good one between me and you .
