1. yta you come off as an ungrateful leach and when they told you " hey this is how we do it here , its polite and shows respect , and we will still pay for it " you decide you ' re better than their culture and just refuse to be a part of anything they want to include you in . i can understand why they would be upset with you

2. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

4. so you pointing out that it ' s about race and gender implying that you want it to be true just because she is a woman and an african please provide a valid counter argument or fuck off with your faminazi sentimentality .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

10. for the most part , you have the freedom to go or do whatever you want . whereas , in a relationship , you have not just yourself but your so to consider . as far as what ' s the worst thing in relationships ? that ' s more or so subjective . everyone will tell you something different .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

11. no , not just free stuff . you want to force the wealthy to work for free for you .

   (ID: b29114e3d39ee1086f5eb2abbe6cbec33bc7749f)

14. your lie my dude . tell it how you want . over here in reality though this game needs a story to compliment the season or we  re just left with grinding weapons that will eventually get infused into something else .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

15. depends on what your needs are . if you just want a hole to dump cum in , then yeah , a sex doll will work okay . if you want anything else , then probably not .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

16. what do you want ? answer that first even just to yourself and then it will be clearer what you should do . i want hugh jackman to come over to my house and rub me with oil and roger me senseless . i can want all i want  nothing wrong with wanting . it is just that what we want is not always going to happen .
