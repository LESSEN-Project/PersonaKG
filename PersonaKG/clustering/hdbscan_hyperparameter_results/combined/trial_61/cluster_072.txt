1. customers that pick up an item from the shelf and then put it back in the wrong place . like , you can see that everything is in its place , is it really that hard to put things back where they are ?
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

2. really ? i would like to see that .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

3. my girlfriend loves indian and mediterranean eggplant dishes , but not most western ones . eastern dishes tend to break up the eggplant a lot more like baba ganoush , and if eggplant isn ' t cooked all the way through it does have a really woody  reedy taste and a fuzzy texture .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

4. when every single picture has any filter of any kind and you can ' t tell what they really look like it drives me crazy . i stopped looking for girls on tinder because of that .
   (ID: c6e395c03fa0151554baed67a84968066bfa9cf3)

5. i have a feeling you really like cat stevens though . one of the best that my generation produced .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

6. you should really be able to deflect bayonet charges like this with a well  timed melee attack . it doesn ' t have to kill the target like it does here , but it should stop the charge and prevent you from dying . it could even work differently across different melee weapons , or only be a feature for certain ones . example being that it ' s much harder to shove aside a bayonet charge with a knife than it is a large club or shovel .
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

7. it really do be like that sometimes
   (ID: 88279b92dca36b3b3c236d960135a2afe2e68b33)

8. i really like looking closely at my eyes in a mirror . i ' m terrified of eye contact but the mirror lets me see how beautiful eyes are .

9. not really what i like to do but something i find myself doing is self sabotage . working on that though
   (ID: d78765bdf49a3df577dd2523ce864393d4d0d2c9)

10. if it really bothers you , you could pretend like you ' re balancing a stack of books on your head while you walk .
   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

11. what is the worst thing about you ? how dirty is your bathroom , really ? where would you like to go on your next vacation ? how many monkeys can fit into a barrel ?
   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

12. yeah , that ' s a little unfair . although there would be false positives there too , like " you must really enjoy the elliptical "
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

13. i draw the line up to where someone tells another person to harm another . example   go out and cause x harm  or  go harass x  and the logical call to actions like saying there  s a fire in a movie theater when there really isn  t . other than that it  s fair game no matter how hateful the words are .
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

14. that sounds like you have some really tense fingers , no idea what would help with that . my best guess would be to pay attention to your hand while you play and see if it gets super tense , and if so relax a bit . otherwise visiting your doctor might help
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

20. a herobrine event quest with special equipment based on him would be really cool but like somebody else said , it  s not very likely . still a cool idea though !
