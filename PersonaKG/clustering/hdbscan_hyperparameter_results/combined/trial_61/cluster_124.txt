4. it is and it isn  t . virginity for women varies from person to person , is it only full penetration with a penis ? or what about a dildo ? being fingered ? inserting a tampon ? or is it if the hymen is still intact ? which can be broken without intercourse or even remain intact afterwards ? the general societal consensus is a woman is less pure after this very vague construct is  taken  . imagine how destructive this concept is when as a young girl you  re told that a huge factor of your worth is based on this notion . the current societal implications of losing your virginity , which originated from men determining how much a woman is worth for sale , dowry , sacrifice etc . read  patriarchy are damaging , where as the other examples you listed are not . if there are similar examples though i  d like to hear ! having sex for the first time should be celebrated as a mark into adult relationships , and nothing else . it matters to some and to others it doesn  t . but if you sit here and equate disregarding the importance of having a penis inside me for the first time to disregarding the death of a mother then that is fucked and is part of this issue . for me it didn  t matter so much , but i saw how negatively it affected my friends  especially those that were religious . i like discussing this because everyone has their own view .
