1. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !

2. that just leaves the rule of thirds , it may also help to do a quick google for photography rules and  or tips . honestly , i was just trying to find a suggestion for you because you asked , the picture looks good

3. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .

4. their eyes . you can see whether or not someone is good or bad just by making eye contact , or at least i can .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

5. ooh good point . just because something or someone has left you , there is still the emotional trauma left behind . i have no idea what that trauma would amount to when it comes to an extra sliver of someone else ' s evil soul inside another .

6. not an answer but atlas is not that good maybe just the puch , just team up and go farm him . i ' d suggest look in recruit for casuals every now and then to get it eventually . so you

7. quick question instead of posting a new thread  for you toy collectors , is there a particular set  line of sw toys that is sought after or preferred ? or do you guys just collect figures that looks good
   (ID: b4fb8e20516a28baa38075931e9715db2375a956)

8. just change your definition of ' instant ' and you are good to go !

9. good god , that sounds horrible , my respect for adcs just grew even more .

10. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .

11. there ' s a few good youtube videos on it . watch mark kermode revisit on the film , where he feels more warmer to it . take a look at ' the philosophy of cloud atlas , how beauty will save the world ' and the in  depth analysis by ' the angry hippo ' such a shame the film is so polarising . as jim broadbent ' s character says " if you extend your patience for just a moment , you will find there is a method to this tale of madness "
