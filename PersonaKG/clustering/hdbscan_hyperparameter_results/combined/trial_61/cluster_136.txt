1. i like the way you think thinking  face but i don  t think that  s how it works
   (ID: 1bb2b5ec27ad0397aea65ab5151bd4a19742f52a)

2. to be fair , i doubt most of us would be here if we didn ' t trust him , but i don ' t think any of us can make up your mind for you . read about him , watch videos of him and decide for yourself if he deserves your trust .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

3. well i for one don ' t have children , have gone further in formal education nor do i have a substance abuse history . so overall i think i ' m okay
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

4. yup sad hunh ? you can think it but if you don ' t type it then it ' s assumed you don ' t think therefore you are evil . and now i ruined it and we will both get burned at the stake sorry .
   (ID: 02cf76dae1fda8da1d2e5bbbaeb0da5a77cb6e3e)

5. i ' m not following . in op ' s scenario , they ' re getting referred for a procedure  service not covered by their insurance . what about the solve . care platform would lead to the payment responsibility being handled similar to a pcp visit ? i can understand solve . care handling the referral for an hmo . but unless i ' m misunderstanding op , don ' t think that was the scenario .

6. if you don ' t care for my ideas you could provide one of your own . why do you think a gender gap exists ?
   (ID: f3657f57aa348caf1c32ec21ef139ea41a45dc29)

7. yeah i was reading his post and was unable to even answer what the third perk on a shotgun was . he first said it was two shot and then anti armour and then digit  strength which i don  t think is even possible . he should be reported to mods but in my experience they dont do shit anyway
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

8. obviously you don ' t care if you ' re insulted . i ask this question for others . what do you think smells worse , that couch or the under boob sweat ?
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

9. i don ' t think the average gamer could even survive a week in the woods , let alone survive not being corrupted by the marker , or killed my necros
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

10. what is their to argue about ? it  s pretty opinion based . i don  t think any scientific arguments will change someone  s perspective who truly believes it is murder
   (ID: 4f1b65a581332b9d19507ccf0e921d0967e013e7)

11. unfortunately this sort of thing is already happening . i think that ' s why lots of american cops are pretty jumpy and don ' t hesitate when using a gun .
   (ID: a90f01f580b7cc08038958d5c1f659fd492b1f2c)

12. this actually sound like an issue with the pc  mac  s hardware . you could check your activity monitor and see if the interface is initiating some type of search for new software , but i don  t think that  s what it is . turning off the internet is recommended for optimizing your daw . but who are we kidding . i don  t think many prosumers do . this isn  t a very common issue which is another reason i think it  s the computer  s ports .

13. well lets don  t be defensive now im not fighting for if minecraft is bad or not but i think its a experience that every child needs to experience but there are better ones for us now . and no i have been playing the game for years and tried the last one too . but im a creative person for commands and buildings so idk about the survival part .
   (ID: a0849f7d6d0829c8bb5f820aa9bf63584c7471df)

14. considering that the atmosphere on pandora is carbon dioxide i don ' t think firebenders would be able to do much .
   (ID: 395865cc8932d0b3d13214bce052e8915f32835b)

15. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

16. who defines what ' hate speech ' is then ? you don ' t have to define yourself , i think the establishment sucks .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

17. why do you think i automatically support it because i don ' t smoke it ?
   (ID: fddeeaa11799939dfe96bc7fae74a22b474aaf20)

18. i don ' t care if you have black friends . i think it ' s wrong to only care how a person looks and not take anything else into account .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

19. i honestly don ' t think he needs any rework , if you are looking for a counter , hold still during the duration of his drone . it ' s that simple . if you get rushed and have to move then that was probably the point of the activation of the done .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

20. i ' m not trying to defend him but don ' t you think someone might have already redeemed it and you later decided to check it out only to find out it ' s gone ? it ' s happened to me many times for free steam keys in discussion tabs
