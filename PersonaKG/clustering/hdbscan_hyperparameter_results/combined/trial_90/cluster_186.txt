5. okay , but that  s not a valid sample . results will be purely anecdotal . you may want to point that out to your teach so they know you  re aware of the faults and limitations . also , the same study found that about digit percent of shower water is from the hot water source . and if your calculating enviro footprints , don  t forget about all the embedded energy in water , both hot and cold .

7. " hot tits " is a winner in most girls books . men don ' t understand that women want to be sexually spoken to and touched like a whore , but respected like their mother all in one . most of what we complain about would fall into one of these categories . guaranteed . in some way it will be either a you dont find me attractive or b you don ' t respect me enough summary  fuck like whore , respect like mother . p . s . clean dick is a must .

   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)
