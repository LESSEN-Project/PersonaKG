3. i ' d have to say ori and the blind forest . it ' s such a beautiful game with such a beautiful soundtrack . the story is told with few words and more visual story telling . that game never fails to make me shed a few tears , even on the 5th playthrough . it ' s not playing a platformer , its living the trials of ori and it just submerges you so well that i ' d have to say it ' s my all time favorite game .

10. go and be supportive . say nothing that would be upsetting to them . that ' s what friends do . a funeral is not the time or place for you to express your views . it ' s not about you in the least .

11. i have mixed feelings about this . i would say once a month would be fine  however , it  s not right that she treats your oldest child differently than the other child . this could possibly be because digit month olds are a little high maintenance but if it  s simply because the eldest child is the favorite child then that  s not okay and i would personally tell her no just because of that . it  s either spend time with both kids even if it is separately or spend time with none .

12. as someone who puts up walls like it  s my job and also someone who  s last relationship crumbled because of it , the best thing i can say is to try . also , be patient , it takes time and you have to let the person get comfortable with you
