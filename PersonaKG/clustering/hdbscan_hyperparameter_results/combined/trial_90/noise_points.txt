1. she is violating the child ' s body by having it torn up and sucked out of her . she is using the child ' s life as a sacrifice to her convenience . yes , slavery is always wrong . in a perfect world this wouldn ' t be a problem in the first place . but in the real world i choose the lesser of two evils . taking an innocent life to prevent your own suffering is wrong . please be intellectually honest and stop using the fringe cases as an excuse to justify the common occurrence . they are definitely worth considering , but even if they were justifiable , it doesn ' t mean the others are . i am pretty sure i have heard every reason that pro  choice advocates have for abortion . and so far , they don ' t change what i see as a very simple truth . it is always morally wrong to take an innocent human life . and , though you are free to disagree with my view on morality , i can ' t think of anything worse that one person could do to another . saving innocent life  saving bodily autonomy .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

2. it ' s just crazy rng . if it was a mode where it was bo2 round wise and you got all your health back after each game then it ' d be a lot more reasonable to beat . but asking players to fight digit  digit fighters that can pop off out of nowhere since they ' re a npc and can just decide when to tech every grab and aa any jump in is just ass . it doesn ' t help that you have to watch your character do his little dance every time you ko someone . you have to do digit fights and that ' s a solid digit minutes of just sitting there waiting for loading . hell , i ' d accept the game mode as is if they just made check points for hard and extreme . have it be a random drop like the current buffs and things but make it cost double the cost of a full restore or something like that and it can only be used once . i ' m thinking of this digit ways . one is where say you get to round digit  digit and you buy the check point . if you get to round digit and lose you just go back to round digit where you bought it , like you ' re setting down a marker . or when you buy one it just lets to do the fight again if you lose but you can ' t stack retries .

   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

6. i guess the question should be are they saying " nice work " on objectively average work as a compulsion to be nice , or are they saying " nice work " to everyone any time their work is objectively above average ? that ' s the difference . i give a lot of compliments , but i never give one i don ' t sincerely mean . you ' re welcome to your opinion , but i think you ' re wrong .
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

   (ID: b5f9b695867ef3b560a4fe7610f75e43b62809f6)

18. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

19. do you mean ' safe for work ' as apposed to nsfw ? if so does it have to be at work ? because i guess that would be this old guy john i used to work a sales counter with yelling " please stop ! " to an old lady walking into the show room that was about to walk over a piece of paper that had fallen on the floor , so he thought she would slip . she walked over it like it was nothing before looking up at him and starting to sign in sign language . because she was def . and therefor did not hear this old guy scream so loud his face turned beat red , and everyone that worked in that huge building heard and came over , but she didn ' t really pay attention so she didnt know what happened and no one told her lol . thats the sfw story i go to when talking to family or kids or whatever . idk if thats what your looking for .
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)
