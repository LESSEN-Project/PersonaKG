4. i have to agree with regenboog as you progress through your transition you will feel more comfortable with yourself and your femininity will come through nauturally . clothes are a different matter , if you are pre hrt , its really about how confident you are .

8. i don ' t feel like my perception of reality is very off it is that i am way more critical of myself than i would be months ago and some weeks are worse than others to the point i don ' t want to get out of bed . i also don ' t feel like anything triggered it really it just sort of stuck it ' s head out of the blue , i don ' t really know how else to discribe it .
