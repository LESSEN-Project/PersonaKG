5. darksouls was the most challenging game i ' ve played in past decade , and imo is one of the best games ever made , so hyped they might remaster it next year . as an emotional wreck of a human being and welding a heart so deep one could say it ' s . the dark , the game and stories of the npcs really hit me hard .

6. okay , then in answer to your question i would say that if you actually want to have sex then you might develop some kind of negative hang up about penis size but there are tonnes of ways to pleasure someone besides that so it shouldn ' t really have a negative affect .

7. male im not really friends with any girls , but i do know that a ton of stuff i say is a joke , and even sometimes ill give actual advice in a half joking way , its weird . something like " how about you dont please " cant think of any off the top of my head and also , yes , i hear tons of fucked up things but dont really get offended at any of it , confirming your point . . waait so are girls really that boring ?
