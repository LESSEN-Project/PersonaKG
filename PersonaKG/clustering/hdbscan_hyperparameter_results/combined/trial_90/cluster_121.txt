   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

3. this whole article is about one thing . censorship . there is also footage of the same maga hat kids harassing girls before to confrontation but let ' s just ignore that for now . this article doesn ' t care about any of that . they are just looking for a way to justify shutting up any opposing voice . the have picked up on a recent event and put a spotlight on it and are saying " look look ! the lefts are actively deceiving us ! " take away their internets !

6. i had a date once and the girl had no social skills . like she couldn ' t hold a conversation . i don ' t ever struggle to make conversation but this was a real shitter . in the end it was just me talking at her . the worst part is i would talk about things and she would never add to the conversation . just " yes " or " no " answers . eve now i wonder if it was me that was too talky ?

14. it would be overwhelming to articulate this subject , martin w ball does the best job at it look up your mate tom podcast with martin , one quote of martins there is just reality as it is  a unified being of infinite awareness that is playing with itself as an expression of itself . everything and everyone in all places and times is merely god interacting with itself , and it is you .
