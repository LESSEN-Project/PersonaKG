2. i ' m sorry for what you are going through . you say that you ' re tired , but i think that you are stronger than you admit . not many people can survive after going through all the trials that you ' ve mentioned , but you ' re still here and that ' s what counts .

3. lol what are you going to say ? just straight up ask  what are your views on feminism ?  you think a guy that wants to have sex with you is going to say  oh i hate women  ?

4. while i agree somewhat to the fact that hispanics like to fuck . i find it a bit distasteful to say that the problem is with hispanics . not with retarted white christians . who are too dumb to realize that their children are going to fuck regardless of what they ' re told . so hey lets get them to put on a jimmiehat

5. im diagnosed with anxiety and all i have to say is a couple things . i used to have panic attacks everyday . it was the worst years of my life . there is no way to get rid of anxiety . everytime i see someone ask " how do you get rid of anxiety " i just tell them my story and say there is no way . ive had it for so long that i get used to it . im aware its not going to go away . i listen to music , that helps . i meditate , hard but helps . i paint my nails and chill .

6. me too . it ' s something i ' m going to say to one of my kids in particular .
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

7. exactly , you ' re not here to entertain me , but this post was meant to entertain whether or not it ' s for easy karma is a different matter . this is the first time i saw this , and judging from all the up doots , i ' d say i ' m not the only one . nothing is original because someone is always going to say it first , all that matters is how and when you do it .

8. producing an average digit episode anime costs around  digit million , and if you want to provide animators with a liveable wage , especially in america , that ' s going to increase quite significantly . and that ' s when the studios are already established . so i ' d say start by building up some capital .

9. yeah , they could have swapped these amateur  oriented modes " effects " and " scene " for u3 and u4 . they messed this up on the d7100 by putting " effects " between u1  u2 and m  a  s  p and i still like the d7000 ' s approach on this for the same reason  on this type of camera , they could easily go with m  a  s  p , u1  u2  u3 and nothing more . if the d750 could go up to , say , digit fps with a grip and if it had an adequate buffer depth , it would be something of an upgrade from the d700 . i agree it could be named d650 , because the d6xx could have more serious af in the first place . if i was soon going for an fx body , i ' d gladly pay the price of the digit for a d750 without these things that are crippling it .
