1. i had never heard this until now . very nice . one of my favorites is ' feel the tide ' . but my all time favorite is ' the cave ' . dancing around my now wife ' s small college apartment listening to mumford and sons for the first time as she sings and we make cheap noodles and lemon pepper chicken is literally one of my favorite memories .

2. a nicotine craving only lasts for min at the time , after that you feel normal again . always remember that you just have to resist for digit min as soon as the craving beginns . and also try to avoid areas where you typically smoked or your friends do .

3. nta but you might regret missing out on that special time with your loved ones later on in the future when it may not be possible anymore  and avoiding a chewing noise might not feel worth it .

4. fucking up happens . its okay  if you learn something from it . why not try drawing on yourself instead any time you feel like that ? keep drawing even if it takes up a whole leg or arm . i recommend crayola .

6. i never feel like i was born in wrong time period . i feel like this was  is the best time to be born . coming decades are gonna be the turning point in human civilization , wither we are destined to become rulers of the universe or vanish without a trace . everything will depend on the decisions we make , as a species and some luck . we get front seat to witness it all . what better time to be alive ? who cares if no one liked your fb post . winking  face

7. pretty much all the time but it quickly turns to dysphoria and depression . i tend to find its more about who they are , how they carry themselves , what they wear , especially if its something i can identify with , rather then whether i feel there pretty .

8. on your third date , hump him awkwardly at a phish show . it ' s the only way .   x200b  raves are a special thing . i wouldn ' t bring someone around who made me feel awkward a third time . and there ' s nothing wrong with keeping looking for someone who has long term potential or at the very least is more compatible now !
