2. perhaps a better word is to love in a holy way . it  s like . when you love someone , but they are diabetic . they really want and love sugar . they crave it . it  s totally normal for most people to eat sugar , so why not them ? because it will kill them ie their soul is in danger . so if you love them , in a holy way , you don  t feed them sugar . you stay with them but abstain from going to the bakery , you work out together and live an active life .
