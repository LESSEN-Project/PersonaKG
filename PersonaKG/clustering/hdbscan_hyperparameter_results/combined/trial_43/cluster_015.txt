19. same here . my study of religion led me to conclude they were all manmade . the way that i see it we all have certain drives for meaning , for purpose , for morals and certain emotional needs getting over the fear of death , wanting to reconnect with dead loved ones , wanting a sense of meaning in life , etc . and religions each navigate a way in which they can fulfill these human desires . and i think that the religions out there today are still in existence because partially they tended to fulfill these the best .
