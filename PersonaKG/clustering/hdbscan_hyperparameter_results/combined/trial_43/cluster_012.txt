   (ID: df5213e759ef279850d575577da3967d8f71679c)

   (ID: c21f8d5819115eb61914aa55dbbc727a12117bef)

16. she probably doesn ' t have feelings for you , it was the drugs . that being said you still cheating on your boyfriend and that is uncool . you could keep quiet i guess , but the guilt will likely continue to eat at you . you should probably tell him the truth and not put yourself in a situation to cheat again .
