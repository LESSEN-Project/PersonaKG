1. you know . i ' m something of a scientist my self . and i wanna ask you  did you come to this conclusion after kowalski analysis ? no . you don ' t wanna tell me ? all right then keep your secrets to yourself . amen brothers . can i get digit likes . oops sorry , i guess we don ' t do that here .
   (ID: 4381fa1a63289663c5683187c0d07eadf81abfc2)

   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

3. when the hell did i say we shouldn  t ? i  m saying how they currently work is pointless . they frequently don  t know their cases and they  re incredibly overworked . it  s hurtful to everyone .
   (ID: 280643182527d573e119c7952a08fea10d62edd8)

4. if an intruder did it , they have to be about the dumbest criminal in the world . now , i ' m not a criminal but if i was and planned to kidnap a child from an occupied dwelling , i wouldn ' t be hanging around to write a long ransom note . i ' d bring a prewritten one with me so i could be in and out as fast as possible . secondly , if something did go wrong and my victim was injured or dead , i ' d take them with me anyway . the family isn ' t going to know that the child isn ' t alive or conscious anymore . i ' d take the kid , leave the note , get the ransom and dump the body . leaving the body behind means no payout . leaving the body behind and molesting it is even stupider . why run the risk of leaving dna or other evidence ? i can ' t think of a single reason for an intruder to leave jb and a ransom note that they had to know would be utterly useless since they ' d left their leverage behind .
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)

5. i know , but what did i say to offend th5 people that only sub to thus sub cause they play it occasionally ?

6. i have a few . what ' s the story behind giving you up ? how did you find about your siblings ? why did he decide to keep the othersif he did ? doe everyone else already know each other ? are y ' all gonna meet up ?
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

7. i ' m a go ahead and disagree with you on that one as many people have already said the kid is digit and should already know how to treat other people property regardless and the kid did offer to pay the whole digit so op let him of easily .
   (ID: 1df1bd07e28c0df73bd865f8cb447d7c8f1bd4d3)

8. shit . that ' s a terrible thing to happen to you so young . if it helps , you ' re getting internet bro hugs from me . you should know that you ' re an absolute hero for talking her out of it . even if she ended up doing it later , you still gave it your all to save her . most people go through their lives without ever saving someone else ' s . most adults wouldn ' t know how to do what you did . you are a legend .

14. chillin at home cuz i definitely dislike all these celebrations which are actually pr  actions of the government . i know , everyone is supposed to show their respect to the people who probably saved the world , but russian authorities did everything to make me hate this day .
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

   (ID: bd0712716940e41d4901cd77632c868dc43fa8f0)

16. delete the number , or block the number . make it extremely difficult to get in contact with him in anyway . know what he did to you and know how you felt when you found out . do you really wanna feel that way again ? you deserve to be happy and putting yourself in that situation is going to dig yourself into a deep hole . dont give him the satisfaction of cheating on a girl and then having her run back to him . it will make him a worse person and it will only hurt you in the end .
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

   (ID: a23935a11b1de288af939de6809066afab50fe71)

19. you did what you could . this is the only time i advocate getting a well bred puppy when you have children  it ' s the only way to ensure you know its temperament .
