1. the problem is that if you love someone , you really can ' t settle for just being friends with them . you really can ' t . it hurts . i ' ve been in this situation multiple times , and i can completely understand someone being frustrated by this , but you have to consider the possibility that it hurts to love someone who doesn ' t love you back . i hope that cleared something up !

3. fuck . it ' s very likely my dream girl will not mean with me from a personality standpoint . meaning there s no hope for a relationship , so there no point in putting in effort to make love

4. this comment has given my an absolutely sickening pit in my stomach . please please please do not do anything remotely close to trying to sway her sexuality . you seem like a fantastic parent for supporting your daughter already . she needs love , acceptance and reassurance that nothing is wrong with her  if that means siding with her over your wife then that  s what you have to do . you brought her into this world it is your life long duty to protect and cherish your children . i hope your wife can come around , perhaps take a few couples therapy sessions so you can talk through the underlying issue . i  m really sorry but you have two women that need your support on two opposing sides of a very messy coin . at the very end of the day , your wife is a grown woman and your daughter is a very vulnerable child you needs your trust and protection .

5. i hope you find the love you deserve . you ' re definitely more aware of the fact that fast moving relationships , are enticing at first but maybe not the most rewarding . here ' s to the opportunity for a better chance next time . everything happens for a reason
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

6. then you went to a bad range . i would love to tell you that does not happen but my experience has been it is more common than not . i hope your co worker took the time teach you basic safety and operations , and that you enjoyed your self .
