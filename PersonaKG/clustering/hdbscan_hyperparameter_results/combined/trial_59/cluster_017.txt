   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

4. correct me if i ' m wrong , but i thought that this sub was for ads on reddit , not on outside sites . especially not a financial site talking about the financial success of a company . which is their job . i mean , just look at this page
   (ID: 73a501f273781aa2c0deb878ecb02dcab3a9d4d3)

5. it was a very rainy day and me and my 4th grader friends decided playing blind man ' s buff inside . we had a mad teacher who had dwarfism . i thought he was one of my friends and pushed him he pushed me back gently and laughed . i slapped him very hard and he just waited for me take off the blindfold and left without saying anything . after i move on to the middle high i saw him on my to school i almost saw him everyday till 8th grade this year i ' m going to university and his disappointed face still enters my dreams

6. yeah , true . there are so many worse companies . just the first thing i thought of . it ' s great for talking to my friends and family all over the world as well as promoting myself , but i hate to see how people are addicted to it and over use it as well as whatever privacy stuff they violate .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

7. i play a lot . as interesting and well thought out as it is , i wouldn ' t buy one for my table . sorry dude , just giving my honest opinion .
   (ID: 725e5a3de682f359cfb87481ec457a2f78867ef3)

8. that ' s actually some great advice i just thought it might be a good idea but maybe i should just wait until i need to or have more money how much money would you say you need to start ?
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

9. lol and i thought my own outlook on people was pretty bleak . just comes down to trust in the end here . yes a lot of people suck but there are good ones out there . gotta take a risk now and then for the reward .
   (ID: 1cf567904675ac1ca7b5a90612e5479a5b6c9bef)

10. ah yes ! i knew it wasn ' t conan ' s show , i was just in between this gag and that one . thanks though , i was trying to figure out who ' s show it was and thought it was fallon ' s for some reason .

11. after a nasty change if leadership we believe you are just too close to the former director and our lawyer thought it would better if you resigned i broke no rules
   (ID: 7c3eb339580d281fcb54cb04dbb55f6921fceec5)

12. coming from a girl who everyone assumed my whole life as " rich " sometimes it ' s not actual individuals that hold money , it ' s the family . my family has money , but they don ' t pay my bills . the only expensive jewelry i ever have received family bought  gifts  which is just likes purses , scarfs , etc . so she may be struggling just as hard as you are , her struggle just may look a lot more stylish thanks to her family . just a thought ! btw  i dont date " rich guys " because digit  are jerks so she could also feel that way !
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

13. oh wow i  m dumb as fuck thank you for the correction . id heard about that case long time ago and always just thought it was here thats the one where the killer fed one of the victims fried chicken , yes ?
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

14. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .
   (ID: b3497f72ed4462f0414951db6d9ee7aa4004b515)

15. be aware that if you ' re caught and you probably will be , no matter which way you go about it , the consequences may be a bit more severe than them just saying " no , you can ' t do that " . you may well be ejected from the park , barred for life , or possibly have security involved . the only way for you to do it and feign ignorance and possibly get away with it and i am not condoning this at all would be to try going through hogwarts express or the main entrance and , if caught and chances are you will be , saying that you thought the parks were the same . but , if you try this , you ' re a bit of an idiot , and even more of a complete git .
   (ID: 2ac4d2cea574e655d7fdb1ab9b4886989929ca96)

16. seeing a lot of negative comments saying get help . guys , this is a game where you time and time again , without thought , shotgun blast mofos across the room . op was just descriptive and obviously has a unique play style . at some point we have all saved , committed crimes against humanity , then reloaded . to the op , optionally you can attempt to be a pickpocket expert and just take the gun maybe never actually have seen his inventory in that quest .
