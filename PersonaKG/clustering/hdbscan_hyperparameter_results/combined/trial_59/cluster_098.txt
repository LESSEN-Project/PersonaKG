1. seeing as i am a guy whenever i see some random person say that all men should die it makes my blood boil . i  m sitting over here living my own life of trying not to insult or annoy anyone around me and then here  s this lady that thinks that all men should die ? that includes almost half of the earths population a good chunk have luckily never come in contact with this woman but no , just because she feels like she  s owed to be desired and when she isn  t that means that people like me , my younger brothers and every male should just drop dead because she was too toxic for anyone to go after her

3. i take it that the crew are a comedy group ? is " crew funny " highlights of their " skits " or just some bonus behind the scenes of their creative process ? in any case , eating donuts purchased for someone else isn ' t funny or quirky , it just makes you look like a self  absorbed asshole especially in the jerk  like way amanda phrased it . p . s . i ' m also the last person to complain , but that is the wrong there in your sentence will .
