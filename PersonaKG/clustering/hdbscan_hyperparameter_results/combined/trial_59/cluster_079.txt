1. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted

2. i ' m anxious too and that would bring me super down . are those guys average looking or extra attractive ? it seems like a lot of work to have someone come over for sex and do an oh hell no rather than just getting off . not that that ' s a good thing per se but at least you wouldn ' t know . i ' d try and give you my honest opinion but i might be too nice to do so .

3. my brother found something and didn  t know what it was so i made a reddit account so i could post it on whatisthisthing and for the longest time i just checked that sub to see what random stuff people found lol . i use it more than any other social media now and i really enjoy reddit even though i still feel like a newb sometimes .

4. yeah it was very quick but this one was pretty painful . but once you start you have to keep going so just persisted with the pain . they told me they were putting the power up but that was it . nothing to say that there was a chance of burning or damage like i experienced . my brother was telling me to try and push for damages but i would be happy with just my money back . i don ' t know if i ' m looking at this the wrong way regarding the damage that has been done .

5. you might like bros4bros . com or gayxchange . com i can ' t say that these are digit  chat , because people just looking for a cheap hookup tend to infiltrate any site that will let them and i haven ' t found a site yet that blocks those kind of people . i wouldn ' t know how they could do it either .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

6. take me hime tonight  eddie money i used to like it but if your gonna play a song over and over again on classic pop rock radio . don  t pick that song pick songs like . oh i don  t know just hungry like the wolf beat it billie jean invisible touch another one bites the dust almost anything is better than that
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

7. not everyone is created equally , that includes the mind . it  s just very sad , above everything else . you never really know what it  s like to have another person  s experience of life .
   (ID: 76442d997e7f64c10223aeac0f4ff8af70ff9dde)

8. i can  t be the only one who wants to know who the hell they ate and also does anybody actually like this crap or is this just a huge troll
   (ID: 6b1a5069121a216d43b11b6d5c61b018eb668aaa)

9. dude i am super glad to hear your little dude is ok . i bet he ' s happy and healthy . sorry if this question bothered you , it just kinda hit me all the sudden that like in those movies where it ' s pulled off well , it would be devastating to a parent . then again i only have dogs , but i know i wouldn ' t even be able to stand seeing that in a movie
   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

10. hate is such a strong word . let ' s say i just don ' t know you well enough to say i like you .
   (ID: 3de4b885645ecd39fdcb6a1daf410341eb118d2c)

11. twas a joke my man seriously speaking , that ' s just the way the world is right now . i ' d say every human being that is breathing right know is depressed , but on different levels and degrees . teenagers are a fucking mess . it ' s not weird for thing like these to happen
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

12. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

13. luckily i haven ' t , and i pray that day never comes . just like my other " gun , " i don ' t pull it out unless i know i ' m gonna use it .
   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

14. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them

15. you know you can see a bum from a distance and just know he stinks ? you are like the vagina version of that .
   (ID: 6f13975ce6a8747ec3d0e2207b9ef86d80a28713)

16. lmfao it  s just like me . it  s like the  kakashi it  s already morning  meme if you know what i mean
   (ID: 84a0b9e5d9e0e37c98f992c96c029f6ec99fb1ca)

17. i completely understand . i just imagine my inner meaner as something ridiculous or someone i disrespect  don ' t like so i can tell it as sassily as possible to shut up . sometimes goals take time . its important to remember that no matter how smol the steps are , you are taking them one day at a time , and it should be celebrated . you will get there ! i know it ! just hug your stuffies and dream big lovely  digit

18. great question and i honestly dont have an answer for you . it can ' t be just feminity because the women i like , and the woman i married , are tall basketball player types . so . i dont know . just is what it is , i guess .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

19. don ' t be too hard on yourself my friend . you are aware of the fact that she might be too young for you . i don ' t know what the age of consent or how the legislation is in your country but well . you don ' t have to feel disgusted man , things like that happen . it is up to you how you act on these feelings , i would understand that the gap between digit and digit is quite large though , so your feelings might be somewhat justified . don ' t reject yourself by saying you shouldn ' t be attracted to her , just accept that it happened and move on . you ' re not a pedophile or a pervert mate , from the reads of it you ' re a pretty consious person . just accept the feeling and let it go . if there is anything that i could help you with feel free to respond or dm . don ' t judge yourself too hard , shit happens .

20. yeah i get what you ' re talking about that ' s just how it goes . theres actually a commendation if you can capture all the control points and hold them at the same time , you can also fast travel to main missions , i know it sucks and i get what you mean it ' s annoying to run ecerywhere . i dont remember if you can do it at wt2 , but theres usually little " activites " close to the control points like a propaganda broadcast , or a hostage situation or whatever and if you go do those before the control point it will raise the alert level of the control point which in turn gives you better stuff and gives you a chance to unlock other mods .
