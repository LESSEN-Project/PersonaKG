1. i get social anxiety too sometimes when i ' m in larges groups of people when i smoke . i don ' t know of a way to counter that , but alcohol makes me much more sociable , while when i get high i ' m just chill and spaced out . try smoking alone a few times to get used to the feeling of it , and try to smoke with people you know well i would suggest .

4. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

   (ID: a90f01f580b7cc08038958d5c1f659fd492b1f2c)

7. just play the game and focus on those viewers who are chatting . the truth is , you will never know why people leave , they just do , for a wide variety of reasons . you will never retain digit  of the viewers who join your stream . focus on what you do well . watch your vods . improve on things you feel need improvement . growth will come .
   (ID: a4cf7bd5112d789bb0b45477a071f936cf9b4ba7)

8. it ' s not a odd question at all . it ' s a legitimate question that everyone asks . you know i don ' t really remember honestly . lol so i ' m just gonna say it didn ' t hurt all that much .
   (ID: deb51648159c9d9d915a701d8f77ac885a29b9b4)

9. we all screw up and make mistakes . you will make more in your years of driving . just kind of put your hands up and shake them and that kind of acknowledges that you know that you were wrong . it ' s sort of a visual " sorry . he can ' t do anything with your license plate . even in the worst possible case that he could , it ' s his word against yours . it ' s not even worth his time . he probably just let the dust settle . if you ' re on the road , you have to deal with people who make mistakes and assholes alike .

   (ID: a778c9b10000a3e15377e87997ef5bea46cfe33f)

14. quietly letting customers know they can save some money by paying me cash in hand rather than paying me the full quoted amount and receive a pointless invoice on their email . just occasionally , of course !
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

15. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

16. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

17. ah i see , so the actual answer is nothing to do with circumcision , it ' s about hygiene . okay then . you should find yourself a hygienic male . i can confirm , having never had dick cheese myself because i know how to operate a shower , that it is just fine .
   (ID: b42bcbaed0ea1f011b4d8c42d4ad9df732ecc5d5)

18. do you know what happened ? why is just that one platform packed and none of the others , seems weird
   (ID: ced909c5cb6ff0568a08e4114fa46116da622fa1)

19. noobmaster , hey it  s thor again . you know , the god of thunder ? listen buddy , if you don  t log off this game immediately i will fly over to your house , and come down to that basement your hiding in and rip off your arms and shove them up your butt ! oh , that  s right , yea just go cry to your father you little weasel .
   (ID: 77a6bff8693a174b55d34fc32fdd8a87710fecb7)

20. everyone  s there to improve , most people who know this aren  t paying attention to anyone else and most likely enjoy seeing other people there to better themselves . imo anyone who shames other people for trying to do that is just an asshole
