1. so i asked him something similar he said that basically because most people disassociate themselves from the rest of the universe universe in it ' s common usage it ' s not a effective way of explaining it . he continued that in order for something to be all knowing and powerful like he asserts god is it would have to be all things . i personally am digit  with you on this but as i said guy had some odd perspectives .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

2. we as humans like to apply black and white labels to everything . there is nothing wrong with emotions . there are things wrong with what people do with them or how we feed them
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

3. anime is a genre no different than a type of music , and yes it may have many subcategories like most things do . you can keep trying to justify your point though .
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

4. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .
   (ID: 6f13975ce6a8747ec3d0e2207b9ef86d80a28713)

   (ID: 4167b7bc7d40ac86ca6b492ac0bbaefa992711f6)

6. if you  re on a break it means you  re not together at the moment , right ? if you  re expected to continue to be faithful then i feel like instead if a break it  s better to work through things as a couple . i guess i don  t really get the idea of a  break  that  s not a break  up in a relationship . anyway , be transparent with her if the time comes that you discuss getting back together .
   (ID: 3f4f5511095f668b3c84312b8bfeb87b30dd8f03)

7. i personally fell out of an uber two night before my internship started and wrecked my face . had the scaries so bad i didn  t do anything for digit weeks . really was an eye opener to me . still get dumb like a normal college student but made me notice things can get out of hand , and that i am not the best drunk lol
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

8. i find it ' s a irrelevant question . " favorite hands " so you over play them pre cuz you like it and lose equity with it ? and would you over fold your " hated " hands and lose future value because of it ?
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

9. i would go around sticking my penis in things . if i ehaculate in or near that thing , then that is what i like .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

10. nobody should ever feel this way . it hurts me that your  friends  would tell you things like that . i would take some time to find a new friend group . if there is a counselor or someone on campus , i would utilize that resource too . you don  t need to feel alone . you have a bright future . i  m sorry this is happening to you .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

11. cosmo and wanda would be of use to fuu for a few things . like the art thing . or the guys who were thirsty for her . or the digit times she ' s been kidnapped .
   (ID: a63ea1e6bf1e972229635648a0b3371aeddb4f3d)

12. i mean if they see you with a bunch of paper they will probably ask you for some , that ' s what happens in my music class whenever we need to write something . i also ask other people for things like pencils and stuff because i ' m bad and keep losing my own stuff .
   (ID: 8eba9c7d48a60bfbded2227dacd3275ae756fcce)

   (ID: 0163212450bac6366408ac8e1e025d32048839ec)

15. my favorite book series is the dresden files by jim butcher . the quality of the first couple books isn ' t great , so i recommend starting with dead beat book digit in the series . that will give you a feel for what the series as a whole is like , and if you like it , then go back and start from book digit .

   (ID: 03d15a94c7d0f2138a5e5c0cf7e503c341abbf78)

17. your dad sent his flying monkey when he saw you were slipping from his grasp . treat the flying monkey like you would a narc . even less , i  d say , because this is no way their business and between you and your dad . nothing requires you to even speak with this person . you don  t even have to acknowledge them . because of this was so important , shouldn  t your dad say these things himself ? stay strong .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)
