14. well the easy solution is for everyone to not be obsessed with having as much sex as they can get . to treat it with the proper care and attention it deserves . sex is designed by god or nature you pick to produce a child . if you cannot take care of a child or afford the mean to have sex without producing a child then you should not be having sex . an analogy would be like having a credit card . if you cannot purchase something with the card and have the money to pay it off then you should not be buying it . of course that would be impossible to implement because more and more people do whatever they want to do with little to no thought of the larger community
