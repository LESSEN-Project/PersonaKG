8. understanding you can laugh at dick jokes all you want while being mature in my opinion , but if dont understand something and your trying to argue it , you are highly immature . as well as knowing when a dick joke or anything else considered " immature " would be a very bad idea ex  any serious situation my point is , you can be immature , as long as you know when you should and shouldn ' t

10. the connections you make can be more important than the things you learn in the classroom . so if there are clubs and internships related to the job you want do them . look for jobs that have skills related to what you want to do , or can at least sell to your future employer . the worst ? you find out you hate what you are going into but can change to something else before you are too invested ! the best ? valuable connections that will help you get where you want to go . remember , its not what you know its who you know .
