5. we want to hear it so we can fix it or oh god not this again ! there ' s two types of managers and owners . sorry i don ' t have a better answer but that ' s just how it is ! i will say though that hilton holds a very high standard and that stuff will not fly for long . the next inspection they get will likely get those types of issues fixed . just always be kind when reporting issues like that . most times we would certainly want those things to not be issues but our hands are tied budget , staffing , time etc . trust me . our job is easiest and most fun when our guests are happy !

6. i typically find it easier to show them a picture if i want a new style . if i want a trim i just say something like " a digit fade on the sides and just the tips off the top "

8. also i am deleting this post now since it ' s just spamming up the sub and the mods don ' t want shit like this on here thanks for wasting more of everyone ' s time on here
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

9. its was my first one too , so i recommend you jojo ' s bizarre adventure , mob psycho digit and overlord . jojo ' s is a must have for anime fans . just watch it even if the first episodes are more or less bad . if you liked one punch man you will also like mob . that all i want to say to that . try overlord if you want something new .

10. honestly i could make the value whatever i want it to be since air is just floating out there and has no production cost . but i feel like i could single handedly crash the economy by charging people for every breath

11. no . none would even help me the day i left my debit card at home . i doubt they would help me out with anything else . i ' m just tired of living like this . i just want it to be over with already .

12. no offence taken , it ' s not just about the pvp , it ' s also about farming , which is fine if that ' s how others want to play . i was of the understanding that fw was about conflict and dominating the enemy , this can be pretty hard if the enemy just warps off when i turn up , if you ' re at ' war ' then be at ' war ' . i can understand why these ideas may not be for you in particular , but maybe , just maybe , a lot of others may be just as frustrated as me and actually want to have some gf ' s . i like different points of view as sometimes brilliant ideas can evolve , how  what would you like to see done to improve fw ?

13. i can ' t stand instagram however i don ' t like the people who use the site , you do you , if you want to use that cesspool of garbage , that ' s fine . the reasons i strongly dislike instagram , is particularly because it is made by the owners of facebook . i ' m not saying reddit is superior , or anything like that it is just because of the history of facebook , history of anti vax users . i

14. maybe try to subtly come off that you really want this job , but not like you just want the money , more like it ' s your dream to work there and that you ' re willing to do almost anything to work there .
   (ID: 661cbd631caa9db4ab702976879371243802e35e)

15. it is but it ' s better like that , plus if i really don ' t want to continue i just break up and appreciate my privacy again until the depression comes back .

16. they ' re just doodles i felt like sharing with the sub . there ' s plenty of great fan art out there , so go look at that if you want something more professional . don ' t gatekeep what other people can post .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

17. it was mostly just talk , and they acted like they were showing what the people want , even though a lot of people wanted pewdiepie to be in it , or the whole jake paul suicide forest ordeal .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

18. we don ' t want to stop killing each other , we just want to look like we care about people while killing them .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)
