2. as someone else said , you need to go with it . two ways to do it  have a comeback . you said you ' re not good at it , but keep trying to think of some even after the fact . if they ' re falling into patterns with what they ' re saying , you should be able to use one of those . build off one of their digs and take what they said one step further . part of this might all be part of being low man on the totem pole , but you want to show you have some edge so you ' re not always that guy . good luck op .

   (ID: 1df1bd07e28c0df73bd865f8cb447d7c8f1bd4d3)

   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

   (ID: 230ce64c825c9de0874b588b6d715819e39e5610)

12. make the difference between what you really need and what you want . for the want , don ' t buy immediately , think about it , would that really make you happy ? often it ' s only a happy boost at buying time , an instant gratification and nothing else . many would think it ' s miserable life but it ' s all the opposite , the want i end up buying are things i really want .
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

14. what is responsible for the existence of our universe . i  m not talking about the big bang , rather i want an answer beyond that . i also wouldn  t accept anything involving a god of some kind . sadly i think this question is deemed to never be answered .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

15. think about your network . can you build one quickly , can you survive without it ? if the answer is no , don ' t go . you are married . how does your husband feel about it ? is your relationship solid enough for long distance . if it works out , what will your husband do for work ? can he transfer ? its your decision , but you are also a team . if he doesn ' t want to leave or can ' t , you may not want to take the job . can your finances handle supporting two households ? if you move to establish the homebase across the country , your husband still needs to maintain the current home . this means a strain on the finances . can you afford it ? do you want to ?
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

16. believe whatever you want , i ' m clearly not going to change your mind . i don ' t think you understand the fact that people can be serious and humorous in one video . you do you . whatever .

   (ID: 6ea82786a74ccdc85dc1fddd809a575aa4e4efcf)

18. i think the division is really individual . i believe in a social democratic society which benefits everyone with some laissez  faire social spheres where there  s a general decorum . if a thoroughly studied , evidence based concept can  t be discussed or legislated without fist fights in the street , it  s not worth discussing at all ! but there are tonnes of people who want more autocratic , paternalistic state interventions on both sides of the aisle . i think all of them are crazy as individuals . face  with  tears  of  joy unlike what either extreme believes , becoming insular and being the loudest person in the room doesn  t make them the smartest or the most right .
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)
