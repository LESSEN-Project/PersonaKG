   (ID: 91fce15f80cee843edc2c92559e78e027c94f5d0)

4. you don ' t see the problem at all . you don ' t know any of the complexities or the implications of the issue , and that ' s why you think copy  pasting your own method would work . how offended would you get if the us told your own government  hey , our economy is the most successful in the world , you should copy it directly . of course you ' d be insulted . you should run your own country to your own circumstances , and we should do the same .  copy pasted from question digit mins ago
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

5. honestly that sounds pretty expensive to me . i dont know the prices of the parts off hand , but i really dont think it should be 2g to do such little work
   (ID: 46a39b1131e50f9cc061bbaf88e15686e5c9359d)

6. i would think that you don  t do it to a random person . maybe some you know .
   (ID: f031a6829326f9097d63f90ad77c7cac6d8319bb)

7. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

8. maybe school stress has added a little to it but i think it is mainly stuff that has been building up over the course of my life , i don ' t know what else it could be .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

10. wow i can  t even imagine . the only thing i can possibly think is to try and burn your loves faces  childhood room or home  any thing else nostalgic into your mind while you have time . i really don  t know what else i can say , that  s terrible .
   (ID: c787052a42459acc9cd2034c7531250ccd441795)

11. honestly i think you should go get a makeover and try focusing on your own beauty . i could see how that  s irritating and tbh i don  t even know how you would begin to deal with that but maybe ask her to tone it down with talking with you or maybe find another outlet for support ? idk if i felt this way i  d get my hair done and go shopping maybe get laser hair removal just feel good for yourself .
   (ID: c502154cdae9232a9351bdc0e55d2030d75a8094)

12. i know several people who think that is the funniest thing ever on family guy .
   (ID: 627809b826e1a364fb65664e0749e9e9eb90081d)

13. not to mention the weather instances i think you know of .
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

14. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

15. none . i think it ' s ridiculous to cry over the death of someone you don ' t know .
   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

16. i mean i ' m the only one who will , not because i ' m interested in you but because i know that i ' m driving you up the wall and if your efforts to get the last word and provide yourself with some small win in life , and because i think that you ' re bad and that you should be punished . and because i think you ' re impotent rage and lies are hilarious . you could easily prove to me your age and your body type yet you refuse because i ' m correct .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

17. in what way ? wanting to know what specific thing you think makes it shitty .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

18. god , i hate all of the rock fans . from the gatekeepers to the lewronggenerationhttps    type people . it makes me ashamed to be a rock fan . i can hardly wear a nirvana shirt without someone saying " oh i bet you don ' t even know that ' s a band and think it ' s just a brand " . bitch , you can fuck right off .
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

19. please calm down it ' s a trailer and the film has an emphasis on dancing , if you know his stuff then you should also know there ' s a lot of hideous shit that ' s gonna occur . i don ' t think anything on his resume warrants a mocking use of " dark "
   (ID: 1d327d2812dfee71bf8ef77d36ffd5eb70efd55b)

20. ability of judgment is not binary absent or present . your decision making procedure takes things into account using different weights for different factors when you are drunk than it normally does when you are sober . that can make you misjudge some situations and make undesirable decisions . i think you are just politically against people who use their drunkness to excuse their misbehaviour . yes they suck . but they may be telling the truth as well as lying and using it as an excuse , you never know .
