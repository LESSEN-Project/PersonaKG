5. my boyfriend of digit years and i made the incredibly painful decision of breaking up while still in love because our religious ideals didn  t line up . we are both college students and looking for someone to spend the rest of our lives with , so we knew that even though we were completely in love , that the religious differences between us would create problems down the road . making the choice to be adults and separate without any fights or someone  s wrongdoing was the hardest choice i  ve had to make .
