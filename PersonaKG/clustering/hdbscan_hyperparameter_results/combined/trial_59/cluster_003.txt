4. i wish i were joking too women dont tend to talk about how a loss feels or how it ' s not just a loss but more like the death of a dream . " be lucky for the kids you do have " is not a consolation in any way .

5. if i were her boyfriend and she was adamant about visiting an ex on another continent i would wish her a great trip and i would break up with her . this is terrible . she ' s not only visiting him , but sleeping in the same room as him ? and what if she gets cold ? can they cuddle " just as friends " too ? i couldn ' t handle this .
