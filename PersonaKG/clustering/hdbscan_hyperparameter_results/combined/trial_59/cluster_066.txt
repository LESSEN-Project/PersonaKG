   (ID: 7542c8a6be5a118bef67d9539deb69c131fb4fbc)

2. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

3. yta , sorry to burst your bubble , but you can ' t make someone do anything to you . if she doesn ' t want to have sex , she doesn ' t . and making her give you a bj just fucked it up even more .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

4. i agree with the fact local news dominates the subreddit . i also thank you for saying my opinion is well  worded good and bad aside , i just want one of the few subreddits i frequent to stay good  by " good " , i mean engaging in material , conversation and people . i genuinely don ' t mind the one or two puns that show up , but when it gets out of hand ? that ' s a different story .
   (ID: 9d1e879011bb23fa9a0cff4c99a536feb2705b86)

5. depends on what your needs are . if you just want a hole to dump cum in , then yeah , a sex doll will work okay . if you want anything else , then probably not .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

6. cfw2ofw v11h1 , why just why would you want to do that ?
   (ID: 0163212450bac6366408ac8e1e025d32048839ec)

7. digit , sick of life already , its so terrible , we work until we die and i just don  t want that .
   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

8. maybe ? i mean most of say you want to feel loved , you want a relationship that includes sex , this would just make it meaningless .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

9. as nice as you are holding them in case people want them , i would suggest just dropping them . that  s a whole digit pounds
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

10. welcome to life brother they want you to have digit years experience but your digit . just apply and always include a cover letter about what makes you a good candidate . why were your other jobs so short ? that could be why your not getting many call backs . maybe take the digit month job off your resume .
   (ID: 472de55a2855849453179c0ccb5234c4ea9d1192)

11. yta you come off as an ungrateful leach and when they told you " hey this is how we do it here , its polite and shows respect , and we will still pay for it " you decide you ' re better than their culture and just refuse to be a part of anything they want to include you in . i can understand why they would be upset with you
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

12. that whole  shoot your brains out  answer might have been the one you wanted but it  s still a answer , you won  t want to whip out your cock and beat it to death if your brains are all over the room it  s just an solution not saying he should i  m just saying that would stop the sex drive
   (ID: cd907372aff0871825a64e977822586e3bb0ecb7)

13. your flair made me chuckle . i want a note digit but just can ' t spend that right now .
   (ID: 6eec77fe98b9dc85ec1e5e7edc37cdb415794719)

14. your lie my dude . tell it how you want . over here in reality though this game needs a story to compliment the season or we  re just left with grinding weapons that will eventually get infused into something else .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

15. yes it use to help all but it no longer does . i don ' t want to call out any vendors but i wonder if i ' m just getting lower quality kratom . i just to get a nice rush of energy and non of my pain i could feel .
   (ID: a2ca7f9e05e83928ce894848f01290dbcd0f654e)

16. mosquitoes . they cause the most human deaths compared to any other living thing . seriously , whenever i see one flying around , whether it ' s minding its own business or looking for a midnight snack , i get my zapper and dart to the other side of the room . i ' m literally fine with a spider , i even held a jumping spider to put it outside , with my bare hands ! but i can ' t even look at a mosquito without trying to reach for my zapper . i just realized that i made this a confession . sorry to those who didn ' t want to hear that .
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

17. why are so many people telling this guy to get a lawyer ? no lawyer needed . just don ' t do it ! it ' s illegal as hell . also , stop paying for your brothers car . tell him it ' s transferred into your name or you stop making payments . also , also  move out ! i have to be brutally honest , your mom sounds shady as fuck . you don ' t want to be around when it all comes crashing down on her . stay at a friends place or rent a cheap room . just get out of there !
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

18. if it was easy op wouldn ' t ask for a quality of life change qol suggestions aren ' t limited to being difficult , in fact most of them i see are purely because the current version is annoying . stop trying to argue against qol suggestion with skill cap complaints , literally everything in the game can be considered part of the skill cap . e . g . why show a number for gold when you can just see if there ' s a gold rim around the item you want , why show health  mana numbers when you can just look at the bar , why show health  mana at all when you can just calculate how much health your hero has at each level with each item then calculate mathematically the damage after reductions of each enemy spells as they happen . my point is that skill complaints are nonconstructive criticism and just plainly bad arguments .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

19. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

20. " you can have whatever you want " , that means they ' re just buying friendship
   (ID: b29114e3d39ee1086f5eb2abbe6cbec33bc7749f)
