1. im waiting for kunimitsu and negan , and i know several pros and cons . pros are you know the most of the match up , move , what safe and what can be punish . cons are sometimes you do wrong input for example yoshi ender i always use with f3  digit but some times i mix that with miguel button input . also , having your brain expand the size of the entire roster , sometimes i found myself think of all the move i use when i fight those character , for example like if i fight yoshi , i would expect my opponent to only use what i also used but nope he use other tech so i find it difficult sometimes . sometime you you underestimate your opponent because you know most of the match up , and other than that , you can mix some move into other character for example yoshi didn ' t have savage but you think he has cause you play most of the roster . in short it can confuse you .

2. i do not know how it would ever comes it with out some sort of lame humble brag from the casual braile reader . then i ' d be like " either this weirdo is into blindies or they somehow think this will get them laid . either way this is the last christmas party i ' m inviting them to . " yeah , i ' m a bit of a hardass .

3. i drew this in about an hour . i drew a background as well , but didn  t shade it in or bold the lines because i didn  t know if i would even like the finished product . what do you think of it so far ?

4. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?

5. i think i ' m the only who is experiencing a situation where lately the servers which i play on i ' m from india btw have like digit or digit snipers and they alone obliterate my entire team landing perfect headshots or body shots . it ' s really discouraging to play tf2 lately when you know there ' s a sniper out there waiting for your head or body to pop up right out of the corner

6. btw , do you know any animes like nhk ? i mean , not necessarily it should be about hikikomori , but with similar psychological context that makes you think " wtf am i doing with my life " or something like that .  .

7. interesting . but i think the ' exposing to everyone ' sounds like kind of a mean threat that would cause more drama . but i wouldn ' t know .

8. what makes you think i might not already have ? the dt should not be compelled to post the images , fine , but you either do or do not . all it takes is a few seconds to unblur that ridiculous compromise they went for . it makes as much sense as censoring swear words with asterisks and grawlixes , we all know what they are , don ' t treat all of us like children .

9. i didn ' t know about the ice cap thing you mentioned , but i feel like governments should do what they can to try to minimize it , i think that we should work towards developing a way to harness fusion power and attempt to proliferate that around the world and that would solve nearly all of our energy problems and it wouldn ' t polute

10. i think you ' d be right if a person told their kid " you ' re a disappointment " or " you ' re an idiot who cheats " or something like that but saying " i ' m disappointed in you for cheating " allows that a parent has feelings about the child ' s behavior and lets the kid know that the parent has expectations for the child to not cheat . it is a fine line but i do think there is a big difference in saying " i feel this way about that thing " and " you are that thing " .

11. how do you deal with people like that ? i struggle with people already but when it ' s someone either not listening or think they know better i end up snapping at them

12. i do not believe in the anthropomorphic view of god . i think that everything has a reason and the reason that the universe exists is god , but that god is likely nothing like what we could imagine , that it doesn  t listen to our prayers , and that there is likely no afterlife . perhaps god resides within the universal constants or something completely whacky compared to established religions . so theres a lot i don  t know or have an answer to , but i do think there is a reason that everything exists and that is what i believe . although i am hopeful that i am wrong and that there is an afterlife and some spirit in the sky that cares about us simply because its a lot less bleak then simply dying and decaying . i also have a lot if respect for the culture and morals that religions establish

13. you are absolutely right . the question should not have been asked , but it was . it was asked to trump . you are not going to see questions like this one asked to hillary , bernie , or cruz . the media only targets trump with these questions because they know a lot of people after hearing the answer will get emotionally irrational and start hating trump even more . think about it for a second , if i hadn ' t commented to your post you might end up walking away from all this actually thinking that trump wants to throw into prison those who get abortions .
