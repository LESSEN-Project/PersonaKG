5. in the days where everyone wants access to free information , we have plenty of sites to provide that access . sites like documenting reality , liveleak , goregrish and best gore . they help preserve the legacy of what rotten was . it ' s not some sicko fetish like reddit seems to misinterpret . we want to be reminded of how bad the world can get , so we may appreciate our own lives and those of everyone else .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

   (ID: 3adf883c491ca030d52ee22ed62e166c87ed0d5e)

15. this isn ' t an answer , but i would like to have a time  machine so i could spectate any moment in history i would want . i said spectate because everything i would do in the past , even my presence , would influence the presentthe future . now , the answer is  battle of stalingrad or crucification of jesus .
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

18. this is a very unpopular opinion and for good reason . people do play video games to escape reality , like you might eat tasty foods because they taste good , and because you don ' t want a plain , boring meal . there is one gamer who gets paid 500k annually and is digit y  o .
   (ID: 818422b560c80f37eedf14f771cd2fcd3657589a)

19. i would definitely say for you to go for it , however i would try something other than minecraft at first . minecrafts popularity on yt has gone way down and it would be better off to start with something else that is a bit more popular . like beamng or something . but it is your call on what you want to start out with .
   (ID: 535c3113ba487b9152c4b0adbe8c36822bc45ca4)

20. it ' s yours so you can do what you want . like other ladies have said , you should get it appraised , then sell it or regift it . you ' re not obligated to keep a gift , no matter who gave it to you .
