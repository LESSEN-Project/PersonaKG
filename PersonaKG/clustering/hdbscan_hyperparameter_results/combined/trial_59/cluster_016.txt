1. i  m sorry i can  t offer some kind of fix all solution for you . it  s a tragic thing  years later and my mother  s still stuck in her old ways . the only thing you can do for them is try to be supportive . as i learned , though , some people . they really just don  t want to get better . it  s a sad life to live , and it hurts to see , but there truly isn  t much you can do . patience is key , and if they can truly find it in themselves to seek a better life , then they will  it may take days or it may take years . overall , it  s just a question of ,  is it worth it ?  do you truly want to stick around through thick and thin , then the answer is yes . unfortunately , i believe you  re already doing all you can by being a supportive friend . maybe he  s not quite as far gone as my mother was , and a family  friend intervention could at least get the wheels turning ? other than that , i regret to say that i have no advice . best of luck xx

2. hum , talk to him and tell him how you feel , your fears , what you want and what you expect of the future with him , that you live him if you do . and ask him if he ' s willing to be there and take the compromise with you to make it work . depending on the answer just do what it ' s best for you and the baby . it ' s better to leave on time than stay and get more hurt . good luck !

4. that i no longer believe in god , that jesus was the son of god , and everything i was taught in my mormon childhood . i still live with my parents and my family doesn ' t go to church anymore , but they still believe in all of that stuff . my dad tried going back to church and my mom hasn ' t because she said it was too boring . nothing makes sense to me the older and wiser i get , and i start to question the legitimacy of it all . it ' s my personal beliefs , and i do not want to spread the message that religion is bad . i have no problem with religion whatsoever . people can believe in whatever they want , but religion is not for me and will never again be .

5. thanks for your comments , no worries at all , i appreciate your question a lot . in many ways , yes i " thank " myself for my life , in the sense that i respect myself and want to live my best life . as such , i have made good decisions , chosen my friends well and am surrounded by good people because i chose that for myself . but my gratitude goes beyond myself and those around me .

7. if you honestly expect me to sit here and believe then you got another thing coming . what you just told me was some straight up mgtow shit . now building yourself is a good thing . it ' s always good to live your life and learn new experiences , but flaunting it in order to get women won ' t attract the right women . i don ' t have to look like guys on the media to get a girl . guess what ? i ' m not and i can accept that . i don ' t want to be that guy . girls have the right to choose who they want and so do we . i rather live my life how i want to , than live a lie to make a girl happy . stop going around and telling bullshit lies just because you ' ve been rejected .
