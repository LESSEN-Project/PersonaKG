1. people tend to confuse tilt  shift effect with miniature effect . we ' re talking the latter here . i ' ll try to explain it shortly  when you are photographing a large  scale landscape see the unmodified picture in the reply to the first post , everything tends to be in focus you have large , often infinite depth of field . as you get closer and your subjects  smaller , depth of field becomes smaller i . e . less of the scene is in focus . if the same scene is composed with toys , i . e . if the balloons were , say , coin  sized , the photo would look like the processed one , but for optical reasons . if you were to achieve the same thing , but in an optical way , you would need a very , very large camera sensor comparable in size to the balloon and a very , very long in focal length lens which would be proportional to you shooting the scene with the toys . in  camera software or the one that ' s used on a computer can somewhat succesfuly fake this effect , which is often the case .

2. it ' s sounds like my well executed life plan . we may not get there the same way as everyone else , but we ' ll have some interesting stories about the journey .
   (ID: f7713e4cd0a5245097f9f45a1194222bda369b48)

3. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .

4. see it ' s hard to describe , but he ' s not one who likes to get embarrassed because he gets super upset and angry . he totally lashes out , so i figured with an instance such as this , maybe wait for him to come to me ? or is that the same as like we ' ll basically never talk about it ?
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

5. i  m loving it but it  s not for everyone . d2 is really a game that you have to realize that if you get hooked you  ll be playing it until it either dies or d3 comes out . i  m having crazy amounts of fun on pc . my friends and i have created a clan and been running strikes and stuff like that . the entertainment is subjective but it  s much more fun with friends .

6. you need to find the right shampoo that ' s important . i generally liked aussie . a lotta girls like dove . invest in conditioner . now i ' ll tell you a secret . there ' s a bottle of anti static spray . its blue bottle with a women in a skirt spraying the skirt . i always use that before i brush . but i ' ll warn you , who knows what ' s in it , it ' s most likely flammable but your brush will have next to zero resistance

7. are you somewhere weed is not totally legal ? if so , i would say mailing joints would be an unnecessary risk . i suggest you give them to a stranger that looks like he smokes weed and maybe you ' ll make a new friend .

8. because as like everything else we don  t believe in hear say bullshit . if we believed every bullshit story someone from the past wrote down we would still be worshiping cats and cutting off virgins clits . so from all of us to your god i say this  all it takes is a two minute appearance and boom , we  ll all believe  .

9. you  re right . if you look at what i said you  ll see i was trying to explain that chickens produce and expel eggs like humans , not that they were the same . obviously i didn  t do a very good job !

10. as a child , i suffered a lot from ear infections and as a result i had these drainage tubes which meant that water at the time was a big no . even though that ' s a thing of the past now , my ears are still quite sensitive when it comes to pressure and i would very much like to avoid experiencing what the girl from your scuba class had to go through . i guess i ' ll have to stick to snorkeling .

12. it came from me . here ' s what happened  my best friend ' s girlfriend was spraying water at another one of my friends , and i , as a joke , and i say " stop squirting on me , or i ' ll squirt on you " oh , and another one , this time a joke i made up  put the emphasis on bam in alabama , and you ' re like ala bam i ' m fucking my cousin because that ' s what happens there , i guess
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

   (ID: f031a6829326f9097d63f90ad77c7cac6d8319bb)

14. but to act like by being born you ' re entitled to anything more than life is something i ' ll argue about all day . . unless you ' re rich .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

16. my jnmil ' s sister who is a way bad jnmil , once talked to me for an hour the night before my wedding about eating special k only until i started to see the " worms come out " , so like a special k cleanse . because it starves the worms . worms need meat !   . i will add this to my arsenal because god knows i ' ll have to use it .
   (ID: c28c39847d1ec88851aadf063f6e8baf4594b35c)

18. there was a mom in michigan whos kids starved to death because she said they wouldnt eat what she made for them . the old adage " they ' ll eat when they ' re hungry " isn ' t true for all kids . it doesn ' t mean they jave autism , either . doesnt mean you have to give into junk , but they should at least have milk or vitamin shake . kids usually like those . sustenance is important for kids especially .
   (ID: d8014467041b98317d9f1dec2b0dae4ff9405b91)

19. that  s kinda how i feel because we do joke around like when we play fight he  ll laugh and call me a bastard so i don  t get how he can say i don  t joke with him
