4. main character wise they are standalones , but world lore wise they are heavily linked , specially digit and inquistion . i would hold on playing dai and start with origins . i differ from the general consensus and actually like da2 a lot and think dai is just an ok game aside from the tresspasser dlc , which is phenomenal

5. i would actually like to play this scenario . but , the thing is , everyone would just camp their wool the whole game and there wouldn ' t be too much pvp . also , i think popular people ' s wool would get target too much . but overall , great scenario !

6. i think the guy just look like him , not much more to it .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

7. this sounds a lot like my story . i appreciate all the people trying to make you feel better , and they might be right . but here ' s my two cents . yeah , you might be a narcissist . you might just have narcissistic behaviors . you might not have any . in my experience and research , i found there are a lot of misconceptions about the concept of narcissism . i began my research after thinking an ex was a narcissist . low and behold i eventually saw clearly that these behaviors were in my own actions . i highly recommend emdr therapy . changed my life . i definitely think that zealous religious cultures like mormonism breed narcissistic traits and tendencies because people have stunted emotional growth  emotional intelligence . it also cultivates codependency . people miss out on a lot of experiences that are key to growing into a health functioning adult . hang in there . no matter the situation , you have the desire to be self aware which means you will keep growing and getting happier . bravo and hang in there !

8. i don ' t think that ' s what i said , getting a perfect on someone doesn ' t make them lose more points , it makes you lose less . so say you ' re ultra silver and get tap ' d by a bronze rog , and it kills you meaning he takes the game . you ' d lose digit  digit points for that . but if you perfected him once then you ' d only lose like digit or something . in terms of closer ranked matches like ultra silver vs silver , you ' d lose digit  digit or so . so if you perfect them once then you only lose digit  digit or something . in this game where one good hit can lead to a crazy snowball , i feel like there should be some point buffer for getting cheesed out . so , again . i was not saying if you land a perfect on someone that they lose more . you just lose less should they win and they still gain the same amount .

9. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting

10. kinda of an asshole ? i can see being concerned that your film might not qualify for the lgbt festival but if it  s just about you being straight  chill . no one is going to think you  re gay and it  s not like your gay colleagues don  t attend straight festivals you would feel more comfortable at . if you  re not experienced with the lgbt community , that  s cool , but keep in mind straight people are usually welcome to any event so long as they  re nice ! you might even have fun .

11. i imagine a good relationship , and i think about all of the happiness that will come from a relationship . i mainly feel like society doesn ' t accept me , based on how i look . it ' s frustrating how people don ' t look for personality in relationships , and i have a good personality . it just , sucks .

12. unless your arm is as long as your leg or you can dislocate your should on command i don ' t think the thing you ' re attempting to do is possible . if you ' re feeling a barrier , you might still have some hymen left , but really , your vagina stretches . it can likely accommodate anything a dude has to offer . listen , there ' s no right way to finger yourself . the whole point is just to feel good and it sounds like you ' re freaking yourself out . either get a toy or wait until you have a person you trust enough to talk about this with and let them put their fingers up in you .

13. the other comments are kind of mean . you aren ' t obligated to be friends with anyone and it doesn ' t seem like you guys are being mean to him . as long as you continue to be polite you won ' t be an asshole . i also don ' t think its clique  y to have a group of friends you regularly hang out with . i would just continue to be polite , and maybe if he keeps signing up for your breaks say that " actually his name , we usually all eat lunch together . we aren ' t asking for you to switch the time you take your break at all ! but because only x amount of people are allowed break at once , could we coordinate a little better so that i can still eat with your friend ' s names ? "

14. it just adds to the badass effect , i like to think of it as having my gun out passively but always ready for shit to hit the fan .
   (ID: 23394798067974e95a922a95c6609d16ca1b11dd)

15. stark  digit ? heck no . the character he was more based on , ultimate spider  man ? yes very much so , though neither wanted to be a sidekick but an avenger disney  i prefer it to the other two because people like you have ruined them for me but i in no way think it  s this godsend tom is kind of accurate just not really digit accurate

16. there are a few good ones on here like this , but for freshness , this would be best done as mf4a , just saying . my favourite twist , would be the wife on the phone , teasing the husband about what ifs , but it sounds like she ' s alone . she then hangs up , or at least think she does , and you get to ' accidentally overheard ' how amazing it is .

17. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .

18. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

19. " you can just speak plain language to yourself " if you speak words in your head , like think whole sentences , you can change your mindset .
   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

20. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .
