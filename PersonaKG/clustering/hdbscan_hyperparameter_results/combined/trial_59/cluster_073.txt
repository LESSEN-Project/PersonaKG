   (ID: 7ed1ff576cc7dc77750ed5f15461eb3ccdb52a7a)

6. god , a joke is a fucking joke . more recently i got my comment deleted because of downvotes asking what item should never be a rental . i said tampons . once again i  m a sexist monster apparently . i  m honestly a hardcore feminist is the irony . i just happen to see tampons on par with toilet paper . both are used for regular bodily functions and excuse me if i don  t find either even remotely beautiful . just because one sex has it , and i do sympathize with how much it sucks , i can  t see it as anything more than a shitty bodily malfunction .

7. i havent experienced this myself purely , but i got lectured by my mom ' s colleague about it . apparently robbers just hand a sticky note to the bank teller sayain , " i have a gun . give me money " and if the teller tries to resist , they will be fired because if they get hurt , that hurts the bank ' s image . usually , the teller would just give the robber  digit or so and the police would find the criminal later . so no . it is absolutely nothing like how the media portrays it .

8. i had just got into college and knew the absolute difficulty of paying . i knew the process and knew how excited those little tots would be . also it  s just so damn drawn out . mad respect to bj novak for directing it .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

9. i was working a food line by myself , and we got a rush of like 9ish small groups , and in the middle of me running around trying to make everything , a woman came up to the counter complaining that i didn ' t cut the crusts off of her son ' s sandwich . if that had been instructed , i would have done so , but i wasn ' t informed that she wanted that , and i was busy as all hell . the dark part of me wanted to hurl a knife at her and yell " do it yourself bitch " but i just asked to wait a few minutes , and i would give her a free sandwich , without the crusts . thankfully she shut up after that , but fuck , i wanted to yell at her .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

10. i had a problem with that too . and it just got boring for me , so i don  t do it anymore . finding a girl could help .
   (ID: f491028c794855d1611365b07d4525f7b98173ae)

11. i had another interesting lady come through drivethrough today , she also got coffees i also asked her to park and she dead goes " why there ' s no cars behind me why can ' t i just wait here " and im just standing there looking at the digit cars behind her . i go " umm " and she just says ohh and parks . what are mirrors right .

12. people " bitch " about it because of situations like in this clip . that guy was in a charge for less than a half  second , was sprinting a different direction than the one he was charging , and still got the instant kill . fundamentally , he should be doing no more damage than shanking a guy with a knife under these circumstances  his bayonet charge is missing the " charge " portion . the main balancing mechanic behind the charge is the windup time and the sound of someone charging , but both of those are obsolete in a situation where you can just enter the charge state at the last possible moment and instantly kill someone .

13. hybrdfast . ca , i literally just got my first order .  digit ounces that are decent but it looks like the strains change week to week so if you ' re look for consistency maybe not for you .
   (ID: c21f8d5819115eb61914aa55dbbc727a12117bef)

14. yeah i checked his post history . kinda a attention whore but sometimes attention attracts people who will help . i had the same thing happen , depression is not fun . but i eventually got help and here i am . i can see your point but sometimes getting people upset just adds fuel to the fire .
