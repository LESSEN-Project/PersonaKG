1. we would grow indoors , and one of the main reasons i want to go is i ' m an addict and need to make a change . leaving family sucks but they act and look at me differently since they found out about the drug use . i love them but i need to get away from them as much as my dealers .

2. i  m a nanny and honestly you pay for what you get . if you want someone to take care of your kids with love and care then you need to pay them happily . the family i nanny right now don  t need me for many hours but they don  t want to lose me so they still pay me my normal pay . if you want someone who you will trust and will take good care of your kids , you pay a considerable amount .

4. the thing i ' d love to see that hasn ' t really been done right is a business manager game . i ' d prefer a restaurant sim , but instead of making it simple and have dexterity type controls , i want it to be a normal " manage " style gameplay , but you ' re dealing with buying food orders , hiring employees , creating a menu out of your food items , pricing your dishes , marketing  advertising , etc .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

5. no one claimed it was ' good ' marketing . you seemed confused as to why a company would want to portray their game in a positive light . personally i would love to see all ads simply read  " here is our product , check it out . if you want "

6. i love how this assumes there ' s a significantly large amount of people who want to dress up as prince . what happens if i want to go as michael jackson ? how does that work ?

7. hell yeah , especially the digit always has that vibe . but they overhauled the whole building it ' s not that dark and damp place people used to love haha . but sucks man if you still want to go you can always hook up with me so you have a place to stay with some friends or what not ! have a nice day man !
