1. sure you have , just more in the sense of them having to be asleep  what do you think wet dreams are ?
   (ID: bd723644638296cdfc92c932fca8a0e0d4cc9f7f)

2. you think you have a brain damage , then you kinda realize that you are asleep and try to start a self induced dream about pornography and it does not work , so you just hang back until you wake up
   (ID: 53aa6c267ff5eccf891e178786d41ca5df80a5de)

3. i think so but just my opinion .
   (ID: 3e906e06d59fb5c2993270f0b4efed5b9ab122f7)

4. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

5. wow well look at you being all happy . how dare you ? you think the rest of us are gonna be as lucky as you with our crushes ? no need to rub it in , christ ! nah just kidding , congrats man
   (ID: 1cd062f77c729b2cea6d91996a2f94b1f5226415)

6. a sect ? or maybe just call it by the name of the group . i think namenerds is more about names for people or characters or pets , rather than words in general . you might have better luck on another subreddit .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

7. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

8. a few years ago , i was sitting in class doing my homework . the kid in front me , who at the time was my friend , turnt around and said " i think we should just nuke iran . this pissed me off , because im persian and i would prefer if my aunt wasn ' t turned into nuclear fallout . he then went on to say that the second amendment shouldn ' t apply to muslims  middle eastern people . a quick google search showed him that most of the post digit  digit terrorists were native born white people with more in common with him than me
   (ID: e7d4349520d7fd2b6b8d8e41558874e7ce55f7c3)

9. oh hell yes . just the problem was that i was bad at swimming so i didn ' t really think about participating there not that i had a possibility tho
   (ID: 8487a8406f04273c554e2e578c3a667648916790)

10. i never meant should have joined salem ' s side . saying " wrong side " was a poor choice of words on my part . i merely meant that cinder had to finish that fight , and had to succeed . it is a tragedy that the towns people were made into obstacles on this missing . it really is . but that isn ' t cinder ' s fault anymore then it is the townspeople ' s fault .  but , logically speaking , if given the options , which side do you think most people will choose ? safety . most people i think would be willing to give up almost anything in the name of safety . nothing wrong with that in fact . that doesn ' t mean those who aspire for something greater are evil just because they value some things above safety though .
   (ID: a22b82fe301caa42c89cbd71b2e3733753f695d9)

11. it ' s not really shepard anymore , the shepard ai has much bigger priorities than talking to an old crew now . everyone would think he just died during the crucible firing .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

12. yeah , that ' s a good point . i didn ' t think about the implications of that , which is why i ' m glad i have you here ! would that trait be balanced if i just removed that last sentence ?
   (ID: e09cddf2452184c83537d2d4e8a36f0ba7c3fae9)

13. hmm . good point . my argument seemed to be a bit flawed . i guess it  s just down to the amount people use and nothing else . or is it . i guess imma have to come back to this topic at a later date and think about it a bit more
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

14. i don ' t think others are wrong , per se , mine just works for me . the whole " faith " thing .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

15. i get that i ' m just saying in this specific case i don ' t think he has anything to worry about legally . but yes good points . edit it would still be a good idea to get command consent though could get njp .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

16. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

17. i work in a hotel currently , and deal with very similar people . the digit things that annoy me are the lack of  patience , understanding , and common sense . some think that everything has to be to their liking immediately or else it infringes on their lives on a personal level and they make it your problem . if something is wrong they don ' t ever think of the fact that nothing is perfect . and when you tell people something , most of the time they ask you the exact same question multiple times because they don ' t listen . it just gets annoying when it happens so commonly .
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

18. if there ' s nothing i can do , i just think .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

19. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

20. just when you think it can ' t get worse , she keeps typing .
