   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

2. i don  t mean morally , i mean for safety . they could easily be mistaken for a walker and killed . i know the point is they look like walkers but it  s not like everyone else knows that . not to mention the whisperers are not friendly
   (ID: d8492ac2e05f869f3bd79bafc9f32c603a615e59)

3. that can ' t be healthy . yeah my friends are literally the reason i even know of furries because their the ones that told me about them in the first place . now of course it wasn ' t good stuff but i gradually started to like them from my one sided mind .
   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

4. you can get the back embroidered to say " proud dad " or " best father " or something like that to avoid anyone getting butthurt on him having it . the nex can do it or a shop in town . if you know any prs they may be okay with doing the embroidery for you .
   (ID: 7632dd7ebcb664bfada5fff420a436f42e3721d5)

   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

6. leaves party gets gunned down by the rogue for leaving lmao but really , yeah they should have the feature to give someone like digit seconds to leave before also being marked . i enjoy going rogue but i know some of my friends are like you and dont so i won ' t go rogue if i ' m with them , but you never know when you squad up with a rando .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

7. you can  t prove that the soul resides in your body . when you  re dreaming even if you know you  re dreaming you  re there in that body . when you  re in  real life  you  re here . you , aren  t what you look like , you is somewhere else .
   (ID: b5511d022d9aa43868b3f1a7ca2e4368d861570c)

8. so many of my women friends fall into this totally consciously saying shit like " well ya i don ' t like her but you know keep your enemies closer . " no thats if they are planning to assassinate you in the shadows  not if they judge every aspect of your life to your face
   (ID: 5f43a3019d69696064ac659bf6dd25b51f1e5bb6)

9. so it looks like you know what you ' re doing with your life but actually have no idea but who knows
   (ID: 8b409a812bfe5e21e6e8924b5c822fc50d0d2c9a)

10. you know you ' re not a bad or dumb person for not getting every cultural or artistic reference in everything you read . hell , the simpsons and family guy are full of references to art , pop culture , literature and more . many people miss some of the references but still enjoy the surface story . having said that , i do like to look  stuff  up when i come across something that seems to be fact based in a piece of fiction . i read a lot on an ipad and highlight something , and use the web  search feature . it takes a little longer but hey , it ' s not a race . take it easy .

11. no problem at all . as i said and as other people have said , you ' re probably going to find a lot of common qualities among most atheists , and can probably make a bunch of ' most atheists are . ' ' . skeptics . ' is a good one that ' s mentioned further down statements that we wouldn ' t argue much against . one thing i am , and i believe that many fellow atheists also are , is humanist . i don ' t know what else you ' d like to talk about . personally , i ' ve never been religious and had very little exposure to christianity or any other religion as a child , so i ' m still learning what parts of my world view would be interesting  novel  different from your own views or from those of religious people . what would you like to know ?
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

12. it ' s less about the frito pie and more about the discovering of it . i ' d had most of the others you mention well before moving here . that one i hadn ' t even heard of , didn ' t know it existed . you ' re right , there are southern foods i like better , and a lot of em . but frito pie was somehow a secret

13. timesplitters digit some y ' all don ' t actually realise  know what a perfect fps multiplayer looks like . it ' s this .

14. i feel like a lot people don ' t know what a neutron star is let alone how dense they can be . it ' s not common knowledge .
   (ID: 89e5ffcdc3b9c2cbc19f7274b7643ce26a8e2bbd)

15. ehh no that  s not quite what i  m getting at , i know what you  re talking about . like someone looking off in the distance or distracted while talking , that  s not what i  m referring to . i  ve seen several people who talk with their eyes closed , like speak full sentences with their eyes closed . or they look up while their face is facing you . it sounds bizarre but if you know what i mean then i bet you agree it  s annoying . idk why people do it . some strange social phobia maybe
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

16. shit that doesn ' t apply to me . like i know that there are other people in the world that the question applies to , but why the fuck are you asking a question to tow truckers only !
   (ID: 661cbd631caa9db4ab702976879371243802e35e)

17. touch would be different than emotion . i wouldn ' t really like to know what is behind the dead eyed look .

   (ID: 6f13975ce6a8747ec3d0e2207b9ef86d80a28713)

19. pulp fiction . interesting directing but the plot as a whole was awful and the witty dialogue couldn  t make up for a lack of a sense of purpose . an issue i have with many nonlinear stories is that it detracts from the tension in certain scenes . it  s like when you  re reading a book and see that there  s still digit pages left , so you know nothing bad is going to happen to the main character .
   (ID: c418fa452eafbca022ce1c49b521d4574aa77cd1)

20. i always wondered why people like you feel the need to be dicks on the internet . is it because in real life you  re pushovers who don  t know how to earn respect or stand up for your selves ? is this your outlet ?
