1. you might have seen this thing where people link theydidthemonstermath after someone links theydidthemath , as in , " they did the mash  they did the monster mash " the song idk why everyone ' s downvoting , maybe they just dont have a sense of humor
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

2. i ' m really sorry if this actually did occur , but it ' s just too thathappened for me to believe this . this reminds me too much of the stuff deviantarters with mary  sues post about their characters . maybe it ' s the format . maybe it ' s the fact their dialogue is just so basic this it pretty farfetched
   (ID: 28e24cb71e2c0068fef35890d39022b686e4215d)

3. well . did i ever mention it had to be something out of sci  fi ? kaijus ? zerg leviathan ? maybe , just maybe , a superhero ?
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

4. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

5. those " weird looks " are just how wizards look at each other , jackass , which you would have known if you were a real wizard ! the important science question here is how did a fake wizard ever end up with a real princess ?
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

6. saw dogs getting killed for food . it wasn ' t even an ethical kind of kill , they just beat the dogs until they stopped whining . the dogs did even fight back btw , it ' s also on youtube
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

7. well you just did it , how does it feel ?
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

8. did you read what you just typed ? if something has low odds and it happens it is generally considered lucky . doesn ' t always have to be , for example , two digit stars to be lucky . edit  yes i ' m aware that you could also be unlucky in this same manner . but i would not consider this to be unlucky .
   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

9. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

10. " alex what the fuck are you doing " " did you just cum in your sister  " " tiffany is not on birth control " " lexi do you ever shut the fuck up " " they ' re just kids "
   (ID: db1ffea2a957f19bfc0fffdbd89a6d65be91fd5c)

11. why did you delete your post ? why are you doing the exact same thing you just called the op out for ?
   (ID: a4eb94a9fe8ebabb780c319cc7d3f552eb79625e)

12. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

13. i nearly did this to a player , not out of spite but by mistake . two accounts would go around our area , take all of the gyms and golden razz spam anyone who tried to retake them . they ' d just monopolize the area twice a week . asked around , no one knew who they were , so based on the behavior i figured it was a multi  account spoofer with a bot set up to berry feed . nearly reported it , but then i found out from someone at a raid that it was actually just a couple from the next town over who drove around and played super aggressively . would have felt really bad if i ' d reported then although niantic doesn ' t do anything about those reports anyway .
   (ID: fc70415de2435c629ec792dbd90c954786c0bd16)

14. merch is not a fanbase , but again my point about the underlying story has to make some sense to you . also america is obsessed with junk media , not all but the majority pushes this fanbase towards fringe . i apologise to those who didn ' t get that . if you have ever looked at tik tok or whatever for more than digit minutes you are probably going to still be offended . also just being extra anal , those two stores do nothing but by merch for new games so i would be curious how well kh sells compared to something for scale . i ' m not doubting it did well , just curious .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

15. i just had three days off ! i visited my grandparents , met with a friend for coffee , did some baking , cleaned the house and played an unreasonable amount of stardew valley
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

16. makes sense . just funny how all ' s i did was make an observation which is most likely correct and instead of either acknowledging it , or moving on , they have to be so salty for some reason .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

17. why did you take the time to question it ? were you genuinely curious or were you just complaining  either to degrade me or for the attention of strangers ?
   (ID: eab4b13c25e8e05018f7cb7159b0e36614341438)

18. depends how fresh . if it just happened , you say sorry and then might wanna give them space to process whatever it is you did .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

19. what the hell did i just watch ?
   (ID: f4588f2a476206e602fe5b84647a1e777eaae604)

20. most of the time the  sass  is unintentional and  talking back  is often just asking for clarification about what i actually did wrong and trying to explain my point of view .
   (ID: fa9acab3fbd86b1f64e6380ef31b49912dae0c74)
