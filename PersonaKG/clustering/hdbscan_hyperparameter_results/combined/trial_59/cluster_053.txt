--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 82

1. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

2. thats cool . it does really depend on the girl . i think we all probably have little things we like  dislike about women . its not that one is right or wrong . for example i like it when i can see the impression of a girls ribs some people would say the idol os anorexic or too skinny but i like it for some reason
   (ID: 4679181760b739d302b80a7e08480575bf4d30bc)

3. do girls think of boys the way we think of them ? like if a girl hears someone on reddit is boy checks for photo posts or tried to imagine  what they look like .
   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

4. died from cutting ? ummm isn ' t that like little ticks or scratches ? i don ' t think they normally go that deep . if even part of this is true this is pretty sad but
   (ID: 02cf76dae1fda8da1d2e5bbbaeb0da5a77cb6e3e)

5. spoiler this makes me think of jason segel at the end of episode digit , season digit , of how i met your mother . what was he going through to produce a scene like that .
   (ID: ccc20fb024de820a5ad1bfc4117d69d6b7c3a6c9)

6. no way ! i grew up on the prequels so i have the nostalgia goggles going on . that being said , i rewatched them last year after years of not seeing them and view them differently now . i like the phantom menace , but still think jar jar and anakin significantly make the movie worse . i do hate that the actors suffered immensely after the film but that doesn  t change that their movie parts sucked .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

7. im not hating but every time i see a pic of a joint like this it makes me think how much is being wasted or perhaps being offered to the gods
   (ID: e3f34e146ce06ba2b5fc5a249c73494f93f56e86)

8. it looks like a rose , i can see how some people would like this . because they think that they are special little flowers .
   (ID: 3b45915d58b20f0e2abb6b26d4534980a5d3aa68)

9. i think it was like digit days when i was around the age of digit or digit in the summer . i really didn  t care lol
   (ID: d9e6e1ecc09dc9affbcc8ccb0191ff241370a782)

10. people can see mine . the reactions are usually something like wtf , how and why ? i think we have different things .
   (ID: b29114e3d39ee1086f5eb2abbe6cbec33bc7749f)

11. it cost you  digit to build the whole thing from start to finish ? or is that not including the case and wires and all that ? if it was digit bucks total that ' s pretty good . it cost me i think like  digit  digit or so to buy my te2 chun stick although it is an amazing stick all ways around so i like it a lot .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)

12. that ' s actually really aesthetically please . especially those flowers , almost like real life gardens . i think the simplicity is the best part .
   (ID: 419b67e0e2cdcb7bd8ea9a89d34d0747a1f5f620)

13. i like the way you think thinking  face but i don  t think that  s how it works
   (ID: 1bb2b5ec27ad0397aea65ab5151bd4a19742f52a)

14. i like that . i think the origin of " god bless you " was the belief that when you sneeze some of your soul escapes .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

15. i think it was the first time i played the last of us , i absolutely loved ellie  s character and wanted to raise a badass kid like her . also , i felt the same way when playing god of war . so i guess if i ever have kids i  m naming them ellie and atreus
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

16. i think like most of them because they wouldn ' t lie to me if it wouldn ' t be the best for me
   (ID: 02e801249875692d61023bbfbc79d7ff34c9eddf)

17. well then . i could explain where i think it may come from , but no matter what i come up with , i feel like i would have to join  imgoingtohellforthis permanently .
   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

18. yeah the whole politically correct culture is pissing me off . and i think it ' s really a small group of people claiming to be offended . seems like outrage is like a currency these days .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

19. then you really are as stupid as i suggested at the outset . they are completely accurate and they are about digit times more useful than your nonsense because they ' re the meat and potatoes and nobody gives a shit if you could add digit tomes of ands , ifs , or buts to them . " meat " is not a complete description of steak and " vegetables " is not a complete description of salad but those are the main points you think of when you see steak or salad on a menu and an adequate description of the difference between them for you to decide you feel like having one a lot more than the other . and all i asked you , was the difference between autism steak and retard salad .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

20. i think damage should be the number one criteria . that ' s the whole point of fighting , right ? i feel like aggression is a terrible way to score if you ain ' t hurting no one . i mean , i can follow someone , make a mean face , growl , and point at them angrily . that ' s not fighting though .
