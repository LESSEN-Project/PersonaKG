1. kind of interesting that rather than show the entire twitter discussion , the writer cherry picks quotes to prove that carole thinks she  s superior . you know how even one thread on this subgroup can lead to several discussions and responses . i could cherry pick any thread to prove a point . this is exactly the same as bethenny  s  harassment  by jason . she presents him as an unbalanced dangerous stalker . when you read the actual court transcript it  s completely different . so  show the entire twitter feed including what prompted carole  s responses or assume it  s bethenny  s pr people trying to protect her by questioning other castmates behavior . another article from the poor bethenny minions .

2. i add comments instead of editing , because i doubt people will re  read my comment . worried , maybe not , but you were the one who wouldn ' t take my word for it . sources dont usually help people that already have their minds made up .
