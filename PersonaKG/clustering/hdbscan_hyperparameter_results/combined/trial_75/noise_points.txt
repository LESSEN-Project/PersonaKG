1. doesn ' t the fee amount start with the team ? are they doing anything to lower the fee ? i haven ' t seen any info or feedback from them about it although i have not done much looking . i do know i am invested in xby and they were able to lower the withdraw fees by updating the wallet within the exchange . i dont know if this is anything like that but thats my other experience i have had with high withdraw fees .
   (ID: 6eb8259d7d6b7ae101dda44ceaaf3b9edaab4fad)

   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

5. in my playthrough where i was doing the story you are doing i didn ' t let solas put any points into rift mage . this is simply because solas can ' t actually manipulates rifts . so my inquisitor covers that because that at least makes sense . solas is my hybrid mage of the main schools .

7. wim hof breathing method to release stress .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

8. life is cruel to men in ways women just won ' t understand . oh fucking get over yourself . when you have to deal with  periods , pregnancy , sexual assault , harassment , constantly being afraid around men , not knowing whether you ' re going to get taken seriously by the police or if they ' re going to rape you too , constantly being maligned for being not sexually active enough or to sexually active , or being told you ' re not pretty enough , or being told you ' re too fat or too skinny or too literally anything , and constantly being told to " smile sweetie " these people have no fucking clue what they ' re talking about . pathetic scum .

10. if it  s really bad you should try to find a tutor or a study group to keep you motivated to complete your assignments on time . it  s easier when other people expect something from you rather than just yourself
   (ID: 238316960c030f561912bd63e9f572a4170f991b)

11. i don ' t think this is lying . i think this is something personal to you that you didn ' t feel like sharing , and that is ok because it is no one else ' s business . if you wish to tell them in the future you can say you didn ' t want to tell them before . but you don ' t need to explain yourself , like i said it ' s your business . not a lie .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

16. came here to say this . i watched the first episode on netflix wondering what the big hullaballo was about this was back when the series ended and it was on the news everywhere , and it hooked me faster than amything else .
   (ID: c378ee827fb7d26c7ea685ec1dc451bf264b0151)

17. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

18. ' god ' already has a meaning . do you want me to start calling keyboards ' christmas ' and my car ' the virgin mary ' ? you ' re not saying anything with any meaning whatsoever . the scientific method isn ' t about ' fitting in ' baseless preconceptions . i ' m sorry if you ' ve heard my response before ? i ' m not sure what you mean by it being a ' standard ' response . it ' s how i think , not how i was told to think .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

19. i have the mentality of " well i don ' t like myself so why would other people like me . this just makes me push people away . the few people that i feel comfortable talking to always remain aquaintances .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

20. wow ! i was going to offer some advice , but that last part got me all like . fucking entitled man child right here . not worth the time of day .
