2. i dont know about pudding because even if she becomes good she doesnt have any purpose in strawhat crew but saying that katakuri will be joining im thinking u are trolling otherwise he is the strongest after big mom and lets say her security guard and if u say about her realitonship with the kids i think is the same will all of them they fear her and they are tools for her acomplishments , so katakuri doesnt seem mistreated or anything .
