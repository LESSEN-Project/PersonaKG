1. no , because i like the game just enough to keep playing at least until there  s more dragon ball super or something and even then i might just stop playing for awhile . i won  t quit until i stop having fun and so long as i have battles with people where the timer is at digit , we  re both down to one character and everything is gonna come down to the next move , i  ll keep playing . when things get too easy or hard for me to do , i  ll stop
