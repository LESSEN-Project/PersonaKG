4. i ' m a buddhist . the thing i admire about atheists is their sense of responsibility . there is no divine push that guides them to do right , nor is there an evil corruptor that guides them to do bad . there are no excuses for their actions beyond their own intuition . if you do good , it ' s because you wanted to . if you do bad , it ' s because you chose to acct poorly .

5. i assume it does take a toll . perhaps that is why we forget them , your brain probably can ' t handle too much unnecessary information . so it ' s probably a good thing that i forget them .
