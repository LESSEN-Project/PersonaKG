1. i arrived at this conclusion when i was about digit  i was in a health class at school and they showed us a video of a woman going through pregnancy , labor , and the aftermath . and that was enough for me to nope out entirely . up until that point i was on the fence about the whole thing , i figured i ' d probably have kids someday but not anytime soon  but the video showed me how invasive for lack of a better word the whole process of giving birth is , and i already dislike going to the doctor  so nope . not for me . oh btw  i was married digit years he died a few years back and he was completely fine with us not having any kids . secondly , the old folks home is full of people who either outlived their kids or whose kids abandoned them there  so much for them taking care of you in your old age .

2. i ' m going to assume that you , as a police force , have limited resources , and you can ' t possibly investigate every reference to some crazy thing in art . so , if that ' s the case , how do you choose what to investigate ? are you investigating rappers because you think they ' re more likely to be involved in crime ? that could be racist and prejudiced . if you ' re investigating rappers why haven ' t you investigated carrie underwood for " before he cheats " ? start to see why it might be a civil liberties issue ?
