3. rock climbing . absolutely terrified me as a kid . i was too afraid to climb more than 15ft up the wall at an indoor gym . a couple years a go my friends got started doing it and i forced myself to climb to the top of the wall . after making it to the top a few times , and being safely lowered i found that i loved it ! i still get scared lead climbing , but it ' s a good fear if that makes sense .
