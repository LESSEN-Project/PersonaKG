Total from this dataset: 2

1. a brief look and i am guessing it is real . i can ' t take any more than a brief look as my liver is already in open rebellion and i think exposure to that site would probably prompt a few more organs to join it .

2. i think the idea is to hide the piercing so you look more presentable at a job interview . that said , this would probably be more questionable than the earrings .
