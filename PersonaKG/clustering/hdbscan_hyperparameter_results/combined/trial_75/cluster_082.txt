1. just take time talking with him . as a male , performance anxiety can certainly be tough . however , with the right support , it can be a great dynamic . tell him and show him that finishing early one of the main fears is perfectly normal and will take practice to control . nobody is born to be a pornstar in terms of performance right away ! for example , if he finishes early , i found the greatest confidence booster wasn  t necessarily my partner saying  it  s perfectly fine  rather showing me and reassuring me that she viewed it as me being so attracted to her that i couldn  t hold back . after we both took time to learn each other  s sexual preferences and finding the balance , the sex is great and i don  t have to worry about performance anymore the nervousness was simply caused by me thinking about societal  norms  and their implied notion of me having to perform perfectly or my woman would get bored and be unimpressed .
