2. that would be me ! the first one i ever read was ' it ' in middle school . couldn ' t sleep without the covers over my head for weeks , was afraid of all drains in my house but read everything i could of his after that . just finished rereading ' the dark tower ' series again . love his books ! edit  did anyone ever read anything by his pseudonym , richard bachman ? ' the regulators ' scared me and disturbed me more than any of his other work i ' ve read . i actually didn ' t keep the book and i keep almost every book i ' ve read .

4. it ' s been implied that the infertility problems are due to pollution and bad farming practices . during the visit by the mexican delegates i remember either fred or serena talking about the improved pollution problem . also in flashbacks to the red center we see aunt lydia talking about pollution lowering the birthrate and she also pins some blame on women who can give birth but refuse by taking birth control or aborting . edit to add  i ' ve read the book too and know it was much more nuanced than that . my comment is based off what information they ' ve given us in the show so far .
