4. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else
