1. . so ? i don ' t recycle . why should i conserve the planet for a bunch of assholes making billions exploiting it ? just give them more time to do what they please ? what ' s my " contribution " gonna do , compared to an oil spill ? what ' s my carbon footprint compared to a multinational ' s empire ? fiat iustitia , et pereat mundus .

2. yeah it ' s annoying but over time it does get better . it will always be there but you get used to it . i don ' t worry about it much nowadays . if i ever get a flare up or more pain than usual i do the exercises over a week or two and it settles down again .

4. if you know anything about ceo ' s we have plenty of time to kill and this is more fun than playing golf . i don ' t care about helping your numbers . any complaints you get are your fault for hiding the merchandise while it devalues so you can buy it below cost and resell it on ebay . you are the reseller . i am just the advisor .

6. try to waste their time as much as possible by pretending you don ' t understand what they are talking  asking about

7. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .
