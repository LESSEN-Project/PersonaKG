2. if it was easy op wouldn ' t ask for a quality of life change qol suggestions aren ' t limited to being difficult , in fact most of them i see are purely because the current version is annoying . stop trying to argue against qol suggestion with skill cap complaints , literally everything in the game can be considered part of the skill cap . e . g . why show a number for gold when you can just see if there ' s a gold rim around the item you want , why show health  mana numbers when you can just look at the bar , why show health  mana at all when you can just calculate how much health your hero has at each level with each item then calculate mathematically the damage after reductions of each enemy spells as they happen . my point is that skill complaints are nonconstructive criticism and just plainly bad arguments .
