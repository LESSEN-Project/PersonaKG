1. well that just sounds lazy to me . is that the only reason people want illegals is so we don  t have to do the jobs nobody wants to do ? what job could be so terrible that somebody wouldn  t take it ?

2. i always assume they are not chasing but getting caught in the air currents of people running away . when you move fast there is a tiny area of low pressure behind you and they sort of get caught up in that . walk away slowly and they don ' t appear to follow unless you ' re eating something they want

3. why are so many people telling this guy to get a lawyer ? no lawyer needed . just don ' t do it ! it ' s illegal as hell . also , stop paying for your brothers car . tell him it ' s transferred into your name or you stop making payments . also , also  move out ! i have to be brutally honest , your mom sounds shady as fuck . you don ' t want to be around when it all comes crashing down on her . stay at a friends place or rent a cheap room . just get out of there !

5. doing something reasonable ? you ' re on a rant subreddit , if you don ' t want people whining perhaps you should unsub
