4. yeah i would definitely go to diagon alley if i could .  and once your kid starts writing you letters about the amazing experience they ' re having at school , i imagine you would relax a bit . that ' s true , but i would still keep in mind that kids are kids , they will ooh ' s and aah ' s at probably everything they ' re showed but they aren ' t necessarily aware of the danger surrounding them . take the basilisk or the dementors as examples , were muggle parents even informed about that kind of stuff ? because if so there ' s digit chance they would allow their kids to go back at that school , dumbledore or not really .
