1. i absolutely hated vegans . would constantly mock them , make fun of a girl at school for it although i didn ' t realise how bad i was being until i realised all my mockery or " questions " she had genuine answers to . now i still think some vegans are insane , but you get that with literally every group out there including non vegans . it was the best change i ever made . i love the food , the community everything about it .
