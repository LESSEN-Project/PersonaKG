2. it ' s quite possible that your friends are assholes . but it might be useful to take an objective look at yourself . is there any aspect of your personality or behavior that could be off putting ? when things calm down , perhaps you could talk with one of your friends  try  understand why they did what they did . or speak to someone else entirely who knows all of you .

3. those " weird looks " are just how wizards look at each other , jackass , which you would have known if you were a real wizard ! the important science question here is how did a fake wizard ever end up with a real princess ?
