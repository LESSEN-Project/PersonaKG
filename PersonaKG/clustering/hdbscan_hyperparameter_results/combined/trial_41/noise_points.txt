2. lol you masturbate digit  digit times a day and came to reddit ask for some sort of solution to your attraction towards women ? nah bro you need help  even though you don  t wanna hear it . there  s no magic solution  you  re gonna have to put in the work to learn why you feel this way with a therapist and that  s the only way to solve your problems .
   (ID: 238316960c030f561912bd63e9f572a4170f991b)

   (ID: 2ab410cb3dc233b072c65fa9acc3c6323d05914e)

4. this is a very unpopular opinion and for good reason . people do play video games to escape reality , like you might eat tasty foods because they taste good , and because you don ' t want a plain , boring meal . there is one gamer who gets paid 500k annually and is digit y  o .
   (ID: 818422b560c80f37eedf14f771cd2fcd3657589a)

5. this is strong logic to me . even if a gun  toting robber invades my home at night , he ' s going to shoot at me as soon as he sees my gun . i don ' t need to bet on my gun skills beating his gun skills . i ' d rather just live , you know ? i ' ll take my chances on my night stick .

   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

9. no private sc is worth it . you  re better than that . don  t let some dumb slut take advantage of you . she  s not unique . there  s tons of free porn out there . she  s not doing anything for you that you can  t go out and get all by yourself .

   (ID: cd907372aff0871825a64e977822586e3bb0ecb7)

14. well , i have studied but am not proficient with japanese candlestick patterns , chart patterns , i am starting with tape reading , i am trying to learn market cycles , applying the news , correlation between forex  stocks , i would like to learn options and the mathematics behind it . ah , i know what you mean . so , i actually don ' t really know all of that other stuff either . i know the basics , not the terminology . once you understand what the candles actually " mean " then the names and specific " patterns " mean very little . i feel just a basic knowledge of the candles will suffice  but i know concepts nothing i can actual trade with on my own . i really work hard and i put forth the effort  work . i am doing this full time and have some savings to weather the storm while i learn to trade on my own . i would start by finding a basic strategy and then working to improve it . i would say half the battle is just getting " into the zone " or as close to it as possible . there ' s a great book ironically named trading in the zone , by mark douglas . if you ' ve been working this for a bit it would probably be a perfect read ! a lot of the topics went over my head the very first time i read it , after re  reading it though it was completely different to me !  i am willing to switch to one software like e  signal which will do both . i would love some help ! i also want to continue onto python  algo trading afterwards . that ' s the direction i took , i really enjoy it ! i ' m currently trying to focus on scalping , having a go at bitcoin ! this is my progress for the past few months . feel free to dig through the twitter if you want to verify those trades , digit  of them i try to post on twitter to avoid appearing fake lol . cause that was the other thing i was going to say . i would say digit  of " classes " out there are useless . the most important things i ' ve learned are probably things i ' ve picked up from the more legitimate books out there and just digging around online , doing my own research . fooled by randomness is another great book , also algorithms to live by . more concerned with algos i ' m also trying to get a discord going that focuses on productive discussion , not just useless news and fluff . if you want a link just lemme know ! i love to help answer questions , i love all ideas , you never know where good ones can come from ! if you asked me where to start , i would say start with a digit ma , see if you can trade off just using that . then find out where and " why " some trades are good and bad , just build up from there
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

15. keep rei and kill asuka . i never really got why that bitch backstory apeared , like , she lost her mom so shes a bitch to everyone for no reason . and they thought it would be understandable . if you want to make a backstory to some jerk , then you should make the character with a frustrating backstory involving violence towards them , so it would be easyer to understand why they want to treat the world like shit . but nooo they make the worst character the less understandable backstory . tldr  asuka  bitch with no understandable backstory . rei best girl .
   (ID: de0709ad19c458ffff0b96aab8fcfa9c40b24603)

16. i just chose the movie i like . and i am not being racist . i dont find the race appeal for bploved it as a ' marvel ' movie as racism is not part of my upbringing . also , i am brown .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

17. my laptop is very capable of gaming i run many new games at 1080p 60fps or above reliably and some at the max settings like rainbow six siege . recently i  ve been hitting 80fps  in pubg as well so i don  t know where you got that from . and many youtubers are sources say it  s a great gaming laptop for the price
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

18. i let my players choose how they do it . digit  of the time they roll

19. from experience i can say that its having to rely on others for everything . its humiliating
   (ID: 3ad18913fe75fd4a63c4ae0d0255c37d90fd7144)

20. surely there are other avenues to take this information . you reported it to the police department of which luke murray is assigned ? nothing seems to have been done ? take it to another department , go get legal advice , take it to a lawyer , any of these options are better than posting it on reddit , and if this turns out to be a false report then you are committing an act of defamation . i ' m not doubting your honesty , just think you should find another means of having the law look at this accusation .
