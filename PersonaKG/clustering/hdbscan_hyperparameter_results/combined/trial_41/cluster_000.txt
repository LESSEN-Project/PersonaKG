2. unless you have risk factors for hiv i ' d say you might be freaking out for no reason . as someone who was a hypochondriac for a long time   and i ' m not claiming that you are   i have experience with freaking out over symptoms . for now , accept the fact that you ' re having some symptoms of " something " but also accept the fact that you are a not a medical professional and b that the symptoms you ' ve described could be a million things , digit  of which are harmless , will go away on their own , or if not are easily treatable . wait until your checkup . no use worrying about something that may be nothing . as always if you have life threatening symptoms go see a doctor right away .
   (ID: eb338cca8f5e87e4b6e5d369997ab6dbebf241c5)

   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

4. it sounds like you are already maintaining healthy behaviors . continue to be loving and pleasant to your mom but maintain your own life . do not allow yourself to feel guilty . identify what you are willing to do fowith your mom as a minimum each week , communicate that , and maintain at least that . talk to her about her wants and needs , and try to give as much as you can . maybe she just wants a phone call if you are out late to say you ' re ok . are you pulling your weight at home cooking and cleaning ? and remember , she is the only person aside from god who will ever love you unconditionally . she is going through a life change and needs to find more things in her life that makes her happy . maybe you can introduce her to some of those things , like an art class or genealogy research . good luck !

6. I own a junk.

7. thanks for the detailed response back i  m really the same way a lot of the time  i really only talk when it  s important to me and try to stay comfortable wherever i am with a calm attitude . i would rather observe than participate . it  s hard for others to  read  a person who acts so chill i don  t think being late would really affect someone else feeling uneasy around you  it  s not necessarily a  flaw  but could be misconstrued as being confident you  ll be okay if you  re late . i would definitely try to stop being late . you wanna be seen as putting in as much effort as everyone else . also , help out your coworkers ! especially the new ones  being the big kid on the block is intimidating especially if they don  t feel like they  re meeting your standards . ask someone who seems to be nervous around you for help to figure out nyc mass transit and see what happens  they might start to feel more comfortable . try to be a little less chill  most people are uncomfortable around others who seem to be confident in their silence because it kinda makes you seem like a stranger . try to observe others around you  are they asking questions often ? are they talking amongst themselves while you just observe ? what can you do to relate to them ? incorporate yourself into other peoples  lives and i think you  ll see a big change . in regards to meeting a girl  you should remember that women want to feel calm with their man  don  t try to throw out how chill you are  instead just show them a different side to you . as a first date do something really actively fun and faster paced like roller skating or an adult jump house . if they have strong opinions on something you kinda feel indifferent about , join along in their fury if it  s not that big of a deal . just little things to make you more relatable . relatable is the key word here for sure ! good luck

   (ID: fca46720f9aa154a0559b1e4d2d28cb0df46b00a)

13. you need to be assertive about this . the template for an assertive statement is " i feel  when you do   , and i wish you would    " in this situation you could say " i feel sad or maybe uncherished , neglected , abandoned , or lonely ? when you don ' t get to know my family , and i would like you to come to thanksgiving dinner and talk to them " please learn this and use it . it must be said calmly and conversationally without expectation of changing his behavior . you are clearly stating your emotions and the behaviour of your ideal mate . if he still refuses to change his behavior , then you should decide if you can visit your family without him for the rest of your life .
