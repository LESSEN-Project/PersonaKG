4. i was thinking plasma bursts from the sun . it would cause the burning without the radiation . i was originally thinking it could be gamma ray bursts  but there ' d be so much radiation there ' s no way anyone would have lived . but i also find that it ' s a trick question  it doesn ' t matter . that ' s all in the past . all that matters is surviving right now .

7. the thing is   i ' m an artist , and not bringing in much money right now . he wanted to support me so i could work on my art , so there ' s no real way i could be picking up the tab . he certainly doesn ' t expect me to . all the money we have coming in comes from his job . it ' s just a matter of how we ' re choosing to spend it and whether i enable the refi . if it will ultimately save us money , i see a way of arranging this to our eventual benefit .
