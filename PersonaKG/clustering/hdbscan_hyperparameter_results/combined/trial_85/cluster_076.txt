4. oh , we ' re talking about cops ? once in high school , this convenience store owner called the police because my friend and i were smoking weed behind his store out of the way , out by a tree , not even on his pavement . cops show up , we toss the joint , and they want to get us in trouble but can ' t really do much without evidence of actual weed . so they start looking for the joint and my stoned friend bends over to help and one of the cops literally pushes him away . never forgot that for some reason . it was such a hard shove and the friend was really just trying to find the joint to help these cops get him in trouble , lol .

5. it bothers me so much when cops in shows are willing to plant evidence to catch someone , and they don ' t really get called out for it , at least not in a meaningful way . that ' s so illegal .

6. what really annoys me is the way she reacts after snatching the ball . ' ' yay ! i catched the ball with my bare hands ! ' ' looks so . immature

7. my girlfriend loves indian and mediterranean eggplant dishes , but not most western ones . eastern dishes tend to break up the eggplant a lot more like baba ganoush , and if eggplant isn ' t cooked all the way through it does have a really woody  reedy taste and a fuzzy texture .
