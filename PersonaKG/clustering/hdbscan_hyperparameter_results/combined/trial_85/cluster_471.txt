7. why would you want to hide your personality ? i see it as expressing your true self to people , because i have been liying to people for too long . on the other hand there is the argument that , well accourse it ' s just a hobby and that people shouldn ' t care what hobbies you have , but lets be honest , who ' s personality hasn ' t changed because of the fandom ?
   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

8. literally this . like do you want it to get to the point where people are detained for four years ? or sent to hard labor ? or killed by the thousands ? no . that ' s why we gotta call this what it is and put a stop to it for fuck ' s sake .

   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)
