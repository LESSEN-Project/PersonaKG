1. i suggest offering to do it for him with a sock , and setting aside a  special sock drawer  . people have weird sex things , and you learn them as you get to know them better and better . if you  re honest , you probably have a few of your own weird  things  . a . m . i right ?

2. for the most part . the problem as i see is that the investgation was long and publicised . its been at the forefront of the news cycle for almost two years . people are burnt out on it and tired of the far left and far right . its like listening to two children argue and fight with each other . at some point everyone just wants the politicians and judiciary to shut up and run the country .

3. no there are plenty of checks in place . you know most serial killers never break any other laws and are otherwise normal people right ? every legal gun owner has to go through a background check .

4. but reddit is a place where people care more about being morally right than factually correct . how dare you prove them wrong !

5. oh i do . i let people know right away that they are dumb for asking a question when we both know they already know the answer . why would you want to force a conversation with someone ? do you enjoy bothering people ?

6. like i said i never went on vacation by myself , so i dont know if x country is cheaper than y . so if the kind people of reddit can point me in right direction , that would be great

7. are you just downvoting people not conforming to your sensitivities ! we are the people you asked for " help . i was right

8. probably because they can . some countries you dont get the right of freedom of religion , so in the us people can express themselves with it .

9. hell yeah ! preach ! just one correction tho  transgenderism isn ' t the right word . it ' s just " being transgender " . the term has a lot of baggage from people using it as a slur so for the most part we avoid using it unless joking about people being dick .
