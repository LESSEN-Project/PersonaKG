6. i think immortality is coming in about digit so good luck living that far . or if singularity comes , it might come halfway in digit ' s , immortality could be sooner . so i think your digit  is for the rich who will keep it to themselves for digit years or so until it becomes cheap or all governments everywhere will be surveilled against cheap immortality  not likely .

14. why is money required to date ? do some free activity . go for a walk , watch a movie at home , cook dinner together , play a board  card game . do free stuff . also if you only have digit dollars with no means of making more , dating shouldn ' t be your highest priority . good luck op .

15. seems like a wholesome , genuine bio and its good ! to maybe spur more interest , i would add what your favorite burger spot is as well as where you enjoy getting pizza from . someone may relate or have that in common with you and will give you a reason to ask her on a date , like if she enjoys , " digit guys " then maybe you could both grab a bite over some convo !
