1. i live in an apartment building where the fire alarm gets pulled at least once a month . the firefighters always thank me for coming out of the building most people don ' t at this point and i always thank them for coming . how much does it annoy you when people don ' t get out when there ' s a fire alarm ? and . are you annoyed as i am about people pulling fire alarms when there ' s not an actual fire ?

3. while you are correct that i lack empathy , i am not a  nice guy  at all . just courteous . i don  t understand people who aren  t . and aren  t you a dude ? didn  t you just ask me if i smile at dudes in public too ? i give basically anyone who makes eye contact with me a quick smile . if they don  t return it , fine . if they actively attempt to be nasty back , i think they have some kind of problem . regardless of gender .

   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

7. i just don ' t see how you are allowing yourself to go through the torture of bible camp . maybe you don ' t think it so bad , but i cringe of the even thinking about being forced to go to a place where i ' m surrounded by people who have completely different ideologies as i .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

8. what the fuck ? i wonder if these kinds of people ever take a step back to question their insanity and then go ahead and do the crazy shit anyway . or if they do question themselves , what sort of stuff do they think is too crazy and don ' t follow through .
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

9. i have nothing against people studying what interests them , but i don  t have much sympathy for people with these degrees who complain about how hard it is to find a job in their field or how nobody wants to pay a lot of money for someone with a liberal arts degree .
   (ID: 4654e3a9a75835f9ff28170ddf31d5d3cf296ea2)

10. some dogs don  t like people with hats on . might just be something they aren  t used to . or a bad experience .

   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

13. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?

   (ID: fddeeaa11799939dfe96bc7fae74a22b474aaf20)

16. i get hormonal acne on my chest too and it  s never been a deterrent . come to think of it , i don  t think anyone  s ever even mentioned it . they  re generally too distracted by naked boobs to worry about a few pimples . i  ve been with partners with body acne too and it  s never bothered me in the slightest . it  s just a part of being human . remember  the people that mind don  t matter , and the ones that matter won  t mind .
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

17. how about you stop calling people that you don ' t trust your " friends "
   (ID: b073b7138186ccb7fa807af1158cb23d6b7c113f)

18. why don ' t you do something about the rampant amount of censorship on the platform where mods can censor you , insult you and ban you for no reason with no recourse all the while manipulating what news millions of people do and don ' t see
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

19. i think they ' re just not putting up with people ' s shit anymore . at this point it ' s like " i am who i am some fuck you if you don ' t like it ! " they just people to stop treating them like shit for it .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

20. insurance should be and used to be based on risk . legislation has taken that out of the equation in many ways . younger people rightfully don ' t recognize it as their responsibility to pay into a system when their risk is lower
