1. just our silly gift exchange . we pick a theme for the year . it has been  something from a truck stop , something blue , something homemade , your favorite song on a cdhad to explain what those were to the kids and then a quiz to guess whose was whose . things like that . usually we all pick a gift , open them , then have a dice rolling game where everyone gets one chance to steal another ' s present ! we have a large family , so getting one present is way easier and just so much more fun and it takes the commercial aspect out of the holiday and makes it more about our family being together and doing the usual silly shit we do together .

3. i get stuck in a place with no dimensions , it  s just darkness around me . i can see things , but can  t tell how far away they are because i have no frame of reference for their size . it  s really hard to explain . it  s almost like floating , but i have a feeling of being heavy , almost weighed down by something . i guess the best way to explain it would be emptiness , with an occasional object in the distance ?

4. i guess it was truly about the friends we made along the way

5. aaah . you killed the elves ? i guess that ' s one way to do it .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

6. it ' s not just that . this used to be a major spoiler , but since the recent update had a comic depicting it , i guess it ' s safe to just talk about it . during the process of creating a cephalon out of an individual , the orokin had a way of " leaving out " certain emotions or traits . usually this missing piece imbalances the cephalon ' s personality , resulting in the flaws we see now .
