12. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting

13. so he is name  calling and spreading gossip ? that tells you a lot about the person he is . it doesn ' t say anything about you . just be honest about what happened .

14. i can answer this despite being an english speaker . it ' s because you haven ' t been taught that cuss words in other languages are just as bad . we never snuck around our parents to say " mierda " , unless of course you ' re spanish , so yeah . it ' s just that it wasn ' t drilled into your head like it is with your own version of the word . like americans using bollocks
