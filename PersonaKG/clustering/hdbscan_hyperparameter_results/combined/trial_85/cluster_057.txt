3. why do you need to tell her he is trans ? just say they are your boyfriend . you don ' t need to " out " him to her , even with permission . its unnecessary in this circumstance additional information , and if you want your grandmother to fund your education , it seems like you should just either not say anything or just not disclose that unnecessary detail .
