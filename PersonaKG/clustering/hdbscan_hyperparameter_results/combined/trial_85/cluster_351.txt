1. well , it ' s still embarassing . i was a very skinny little kid , and once climbed a tall sapling until it bent over and slowly lowered me to the ground . i had an audience , so i kept holding on and jumped . that sapling catapulted me over and behind my audience , and i was no longer the superboy of the neighborhood , but just a very sore little boy .
