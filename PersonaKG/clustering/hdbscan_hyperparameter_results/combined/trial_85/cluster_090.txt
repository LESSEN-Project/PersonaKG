1. if that was my sister i would do the good old " listen here you little shit . " talk . i broke many people ' s bubbles this way . i would tell her off , break everything into her face about how embarassing she actually is . you do everything she says and ignore her tantrums , try to not accidentally push her buttons etc and expect change . it ' s not happening and you ' re giving her more control over you . iron fist for people like your sister !

2. you can be on your way of hitting rock bottom and nobody will warn you . people will view you as human filth , but nobody will say anything . in their eyes you are past redemption . ask yourself if your life is on a good course .

4. choose your poison that ' s a nice test to give to people that are literally incapable of telling good from evil , because you made them in such a way . doesn ' t sound very flattering about god ' s character , is it ?  christianity at least imho is a soothing white lie i prefer calling it opiate of the masses . it helps one notice both great utility as a painkiller and horrible side effects .   x200b

5. i failed to see an argument for why rancid is good . while people can like what they like , there is some objective measure to what is good and bad . simply put , rancid is just not special in any way . rubyrubyrubyrubysoho

6. i felt the same way in the past . but maybe the fact there is no objective point is a good think ! you can choose to do something or absolutely nothing .
