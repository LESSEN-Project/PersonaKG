6. do all the volunteering  internships you can , i suggest thesca . org in the us totally worth their one  time application fee , it ' s super easy to apply for things once you have your profile . be willing to travel wherever you get offered a position . alaska doesn ' t get too many applicants , so it ' s a good starting point  just be willing to go without internet or cell service for a long time . it can get lonely .
