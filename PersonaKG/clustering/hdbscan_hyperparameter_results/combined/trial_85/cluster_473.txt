4. i ' m going to assume that you , as a police force , have limited resources , and you can ' t possibly investigate every reference to some crazy thing in art . so , if that ' s the case , how do you choose what to investigate ? are you investigating rappers because you think they ' re more likely to be involved in crime ? that could be racist and prejudiced . if you ' re investigating rappers why haven ' t you investigated carrie underwood for " before he cheats " ? start to see why it might be a civil liberties issue ?
