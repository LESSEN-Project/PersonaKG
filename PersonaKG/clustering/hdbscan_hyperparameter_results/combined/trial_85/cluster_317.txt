1. a clear  cut answer to that would be great . i don ' t think one exists . the correct information has been out a long time .

3. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .

4. you can ' t be around your child all the time , you don ' t know who is around your child and what they could be doing . i was abused by my dad ' s family . move across the country and move in with my step dad and mom and my sister was abused by one his relatives . i ' ve decided for that reason that i don ' t want a child

5. if you know anything about ceo ' s we have plenty of time to kill and this is more fun than playing golf . i don ' t care about helping your numbers . any complaints you get are your fault for hiding the merchandise while it devalues so you can buy it below cost and resell it on ebay . you are the reseller . i am just the advisor .

   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

7. . so ? i don ' t recycle . why should i conserve the planet for a bunch of assholes making billions exploiting it ? just give them more time to do what they please ? what ' s my " contribution " gonna do , compared to an oil spill ? what ' s my carbon footprint compared to a multinational ' s empire ? fiat iustitia , et pereat mundus .

10. i ' m ready to fucking die as well . i ' m completely alone . my family thinks i ' m a piece of shit because they don ' t get depression , and i have no friends because i move around a lot . it ' s my 16th birthday tomorrow , and tonight would be the perfect time to do it , i just know i don ' t have the balls for it . at least you ' re not alone in feeling alone .

11. yeah it ' s annoying but over time it does get better . it will always be there but you get used to it . i don ' t worry about it much nowadays . if i ever get a flare up or more pain than usual i do the exercises over a week or two and it settles down again .
   (ID: 2ad50e702ea7ef4cc62a34ca116f658d564c0474)

12. my mom says ,  it  s because you  re on that game all the time .  while that  s partially a factor , i  m on the game so i don  t go into mental breakdowns every night
