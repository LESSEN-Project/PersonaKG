13. someone has really turned another dudes story from reddit into something ? yooo ok if that ' s true that ' s really sad and yea i ' m defensiv because i didn ' t want to do anything with that and i don ' t want people to think that
   (ID: 02e801249875692d61023bbfbc79d7ff34c9eddf)

14. i see your point in a sense . it ' s not that they ' re being confrontational , it ' s that people come up to the camera . there are plenty of   boring   videos where nothing happens . there are also videos where people learn their rights . there are auditors i disagree with and auditors who react well to the public better than others . suspicious activity is only suspicious to the person who doesn ' t understand what ' s going on . i suggest watching a bunch of different auditors and see which ones you like best , or none at all . i really like the boring ones where nothing happens because it shows that they ' re not out there to harass people .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

17. for me to really enjoy sex i have to care about the person , so emotions are a big part of it for me . i think it ' s important for both people to enjoy themselves , and enjoy pleasing the other . unemotional sex just isn ' t fun to me .
   (ID: 28ecb35c880034ee5298d0c4abb71cabdafd1e4f)

18. if you ' re really worried you can phone them and ask . these places are generally pretty used to being asked about people with special dietary requirements .
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

19. yeah the whole politically correct culture is pissing me off . and i think it ' s really a small group of people claiming to be offended . seems like outrage is like a currency these days .
