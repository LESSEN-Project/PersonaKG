1. sir , you just mentioned something which i ' m going through . whenever i have enjoyed doing things in my life , i became good at it . when i looked back i see that whenever it matters the most , fear of failure cripples me down . when things were not significant to me , i turned up doing good . pressure of performing when it matters the most gives birth to my fear of failure . i know that without pain there will be no gain . thank you for your words .
