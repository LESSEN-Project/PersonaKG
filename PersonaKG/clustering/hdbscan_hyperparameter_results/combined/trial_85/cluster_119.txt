2. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .

3. i started posting pics because i was bored , lonely and horny . i ' ve kept on posting i guess out of semi  exhibitionism . turns me on knowing people see my pics and might get off to them .

5. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .

6. are these people and their one sided twitter beefs a joke or something ? this phd person has to be satire . then there  s the troll who keeps trying to stir up stuff with rackets for attention i guess ? maddox needs better foot soldiers on social media , the cringe is unreal .

7. depending on how many died of the catriona , it might turn out that ciri killed more innocent people than anyone else in the books or games . i guess she kind of balanced that out by saving the world , but still .
