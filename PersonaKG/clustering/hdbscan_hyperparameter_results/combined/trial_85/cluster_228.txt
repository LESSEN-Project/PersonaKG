1. nah man , she ruined the entire story for me . what started off as the best liara  mshep fanfic , the rarely written and only ship i really care about , and i can ' t even read it anymore because the anticipation of her very existence irritates me to no end .

2. it ' s a free english lesson for the person whose comment is flawed and for anyone else reading . anyone doing it is basically a volunteer teacher , willing to educate anywhere in the world . kind of a hero , really . certainly much more of one than a soldier read  hired killer or a firefighter read  attention whore . but you keep on hating .
