2. if someone is gonna drink and drive , they  ll do it whether it  s in the daytime or the night time . same goes for all the other things in that long ass post of yours . as for the weather . yeah that changes during the day too . there  s poor visibility during the day and night sometimes . i  m not replying to you again , you  re clearly looking for an argument . maybe if you stuck to the topic , you wouldn  t have gotten your knickers in a twist !
