2. why are so many people telling this guy to get a lawyer ? no lawyer needed . just don ' t do it ! it ' s illegal as hell . also , stop paying for your brothers car . tell him it ' s transferred into your name or you stop making payments . also , also  move out ! i have to be brutally honest , your mom sounds shady as fuck . you don ' t want to be around when it all comes crashing down on her . stay at a friends place or rent a cheap room . just get out of there !

3. well that just sounds lazy to me . is that the only reason people want illegals is so we don  t have to do the jobs nobody wants to do ? what job could be so terrible that somebody wouldn  t take it ?

   (ID: 726c36ce13fa631676ed5053f62b0f5f7b61eb5e)

6. if you can ' t countenance a person ' s art because the person is trash , that ' s totally your own personal choice . i just don ' t think that social pressure to boycott art like that is healthy . people should be allowed to choose for themselves if they want to consume that kind of culture or not .
