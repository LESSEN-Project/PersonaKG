1. you do need to take steps to improve your life , but a big part of cbt is just thinking positively . recognizing the way you ' re thinking now is irrational , that your problems aren ' t insurmountable , and that you have reason to be hopeful for the future . it ' s annoying that people expect you to be better instantly , but thinking positively is the cure .

2. i still have traumatic flashbacks about trying to learn my way around the esq  digit ' s sequencer . i need to get it out and see if it the battery is dead or not . i feel the need for some 80s cheese !

3. what am i suppose to say ? what ' s done is done , no need to keep feeling guilty and letting it eat me up for months messing with my mind and shit . just letting go now and not letting it bother me sounds way better then letting stuff fuck me up like most people do .
