1. yeah , he knows there ' s no point in doing the therapy if he doesn ' t follow the protocols . i can ' t think past the ect right now . obviously , this is a huge strain on my marriage . i can ' t let him think about it either , because i need him to get there first .

2. not too many . you just need to hit the right spots . for example , one explosion would probably set off yellowstone , which could cause a fair bit of trouble .

4. thank you so much for your thoughts . i would never infringe on his social life , as i am usually working weekends and such anyway but am currently in between jobs . but you are absolutely right in addressing how him paying for me is affecting my self  esteem . it ' s absolutely not a deal breaker for either of us , but is a stressor for me that i definitely need to address . thank you for your support and advice !

5. hard core ! what a shame it wasn ' t a dream that you remember so vividly of something awesome happening or being a lovely cause of dream hangover that involved you and some mysterious lover that seems like everything you need or want right now . a solid regime of masturbation and netflix , coupled with unnecessary consumption of foods that your body doesn ' t need but your brain may release dopamine will get you over this hump ! i ' m not sex focused as such but i do know what soothes the soul !
