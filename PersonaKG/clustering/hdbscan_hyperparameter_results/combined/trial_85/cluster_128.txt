1. i do not believe in the anthropomorphic view of god . i think that everything has a reason and the reason that the universe exists is god , but that god is likely nothing like what we could imagine , that it doesn  t listen to our prayers , and that there is likely no afterlife . perhaps god resides within the universal constants or something completely whacky compared to established religions . so theres a lot i don  t know or have an answer to , but i do think there is a reason that everything exists and that is what i believe . although i am hopeful that i am wrong and that there is an afterlife and some spirit in the sky that cares about us simply because its a lot less bleak then simply dying and decaying . i also have a lot if respect for the culture and morals that religions establish

2. i stand by my assessment . you gave the server money you otherwise wouldn ' t have , and your intent was to convince them to vote for a particular candidate . i understand your position that it was a symbolic gesture , but i don ' t believe you can separate that out from the fact that you did give them money . fortunately , it seems i ' m in the minority on this not unusual for me , so you should have nothing to worry about .

4. you don ' t have to ask for legal advice but you can ask if you have a case and that if you do have a case ask them if they have a lawyer in mind that handles that sort of shit . believe me if you were an electrician , a plumber or contractor a lawyer would ask you for advice too .
