4. it sounds to me like you should be talking to a lawyer instead of asking the internet . you make one google about a cough and before you know it google says you have aids . don  t expect any different . at least i gave you ideal advice .

5. wouldn  t the accounts receivable of banks be completely thrown off though ? the banks would simply be wrecked financially and the federal reserve requirement eventually . someone would make money off of the hedging the risk but i would think that ultimately banks would lose millions if not billions in accounts receivable . hell if it actually happened i don  t think the us would have serious consequences . i think it could happen if everyone started to default on there loans alone .

8. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .

9. i apreciate that you think my art is worth stealing but i really don ' t mind . i don ' t make art for the clout , i do it to practice and get better . it ' s only one drawing , i can easily make another .
