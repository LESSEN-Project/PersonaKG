8. god , a joke is a fucking joke . more recently i got my comment deleted because of downvotes asking what item should never be a rental . i said tampons . once again i  m a sexist monster apparently . i  m honestly a hardcore feminist is the irony . i just happen to see tampons on par with toilet paper . both are used for regular bodily functions and excuse me if i don  t find either even remotely beautiful . just because one sex has it , and i do sympathize with how much it sucks , i can  t see it as anything more than a shitty bodily malfunction .

9. how are you expected to play knowing that you got traded ? i don  t think it has to do with deliberately underperforming and more to do with just being generally out of it .
