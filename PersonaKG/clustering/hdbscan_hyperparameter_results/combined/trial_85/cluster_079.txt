2. i ' m not really comfortable telling too much . i hope that ' s understandable . privacy means a lot to me and it ' s really going to be his story to tell someday , if he decides to do so .

3. lol i didn  t really ask , but it is cute you think it  s worth flaunting over a teenager assuming you  re pathetically in your 30s as your name indicates . but i  m really not even a bad student at all which makes this hilarious . keep going , you can find more i know you can

4. didn ' t  pics used to have a rule along the lines of " the picture has to be interesting independent of its title " or something like that ? even then , there was no moderation of the sob stories , but now i don ' t even see that rule on the sidebar anymore . this sub is really going to shit

5. i ' m afraid that i really know nothing about the industry , except as a watcher . it seems like netflix is growing and is vastly expanding its home  grown content , so going that route would certainly be a valid one . best of luck !
