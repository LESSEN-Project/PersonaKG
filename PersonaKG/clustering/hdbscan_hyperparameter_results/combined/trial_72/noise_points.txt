15. eh kinda yta ? you ' re digit , and i feel like it ' s unfair for your mom to shut you out from what sounds like your only connection to your dad . but i think the preferable option is to be really vulnerable and honest with her about how you wish you had something around your father . if she ' s still unreasonable , consider the possibility that those photos might be precious to her , and she doesn ' t want to risk losing or damaging them . maybe there ' s a scanner you could borrow and use in the house so you don ' t have to steal and take the photos anywhere else .
