1. while i respect your opinion , i like it . but i can ' t really find the words to explain why .
   (ID: f9d3bf7ce779e854aa865f12a7dfaaee14a65cfa)

2. you should really be able to deflect bayonet charges like this with a well  timed melee attack . it doesn ' t have to kill the target like it does here , but it should stop the charge and prevent you from dying . it could even work differently across different melee weapons , or only be a feature for certain ones . example being that it ' s much harder to shove aside a bayonet charge with a knife than it is a large club or shovel .
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

   (ID: d78765bdf49a3df577dd2523ce864393d4d0d2c9)

   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

10. i draw the line up to where someone tells another person to harm another . example   go out and cause x harm  or  go harass x  and the logical call to actions like saying there  s a fire in a movie theater when there really isn  t . other than that it  s fair game no matter how hateful the words are .
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

15. a herobrine event quest with special equipment based on him would be really cool but like somebody else said , it  s not very likely . still a cool idea though !
   (ID: 6f88a57b804dffb05f07ee78e02223947d9055aa)

16. that sounds like you have some really tense fingers , no idea what would help with that . my best guess would be to pay attention to your hand while you play and see if it gets super tense , and if so relax a bit . otherwise visiting your doctor might help
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

17. really ? i would like to see that .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

18. no  one really knows for certain . you can speculate all you like but no  one definitively knows .
   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

19. yeah , that ' s a little unfair . although there would be false positives there too , like " you must really enjoy the elliptical "
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

20. my girlfriend loves indian and mediterranean eggplant dishes , but not most western ones . eastern dishes tend to break up the eggplant a lot more like baba ganoush , and if eggplant isn ' t cooked all the way through it does have a really woody  reedy taste and a fuzzy texture .
