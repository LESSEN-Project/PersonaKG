1. take a look at this spreadsheet . it shows the completion of my living dex so far . if you can get me two pokemon from gen digit that i don ' t already have that would be great ! note  if there is writing in the " caught " column like " white " , or " reddit trade " that means that i have them already , and have to transfer them to my version of y still .
   (ID: 89c3606d2dfc5d2a2da97fb49ddc1894f8bf330f)

2. it ' s always a thought . like  what would happen ? what would people think ?

   (ID: eca32d278abf2524af02edbb3cc3041ed8b0b880)

4. it ' s definitely him . he ' s an alcoholic . looks like he ' s struggling with trying to control it , but he should probably not drink at all anymore . probably a hard thing for you to do , but you should tell him to get help or you ' re going to leave . it ' s only going to get worse if he continues to drink
   (ID: 73c241755308e15ea272f3060f9c0a430c541f1a)

5. yeah . i dont get that . even as someone who likes trump , this is something i think is okay to make fun of . he even makes fun of his own typos like when he typed covfefe
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

6. what does " building     " mean ? obviously they mean they evacuated people from the building , not the building itself . or is it a digit  year  old ' s sex joke ?
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

7. well if it works for you , go for it . my list is what i personally do
   (ID: 8889ee4547e570f04696e9cc7b50124dca69b82e)

8. a  draw some still life b  download mediocre normie art and pray they don ' t ask you to show how you draw . i ' ve done a combination of both when i was living with my parents , worked well enough .
   (ID: 96167969642339382f3b9c4eeee4ea73aec3823c)

9. well i mean that  s your choice but . i think you should just have one round of jerking . just find a simple caption and stroke . get that last round out of your system and then you can stop . if you really want to .
   (ID: ac0e0bfdedf04bf5199d4337ba10a43f13e1e49c)

10. were you with your boyfriend when this happened ? i mean with these sorts of things it ' s probably always going to be better if he heard it from you vs someone else , irrelevant of the when or what . your ' friend ' seems toxic af and removing her and ignoring her is probably your best bet . stick to your guns and stay true to yourself . she will most likely continue to spout shit and your shared friends will make a choice for themselves and if you just stick to the facts and don ' t get involved with her shit throwing then the friends who matter won ' t care and the ones who care about her shit don ' t matter .
   (ID: 06080b0d1273cc2321b21dde5865b5c1c5180e56)

11. when you feel like you are living with a roommate versus someone you are in love with .
   (ID: 13773c5692e9c83c78b055c57cb682df4ef2654b)

12. you  re not in the wrong . who wants to sleep around with a girl who might have stds ? even if she doesn  t , bragging about how many guys you  ve had sex with isn  t really impressive , it makes you look like a whore . he  s not slut shaming , he  s being smart .
   (ID: f72a72c8ffe94061edd962dd3f8293ca75595021)

13. ahh fuck it , humanity ' s had a good run . argue your point till she says whatever , at that point you ' ve won , . but you ' ll never have sex with her or any of her friends again
   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

14. i don ' t have any truck with porn . my question would be , if you have a girlfriend why are you looking at porn ?
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

15. even though the case was dismissed , chances are the arrest record will still stand . in oregon you normally have to wait digit years for an expungement , however , since the case was dropped , you can do it immediately . the record will be gone . you don ' t need a lawyer , you can do this yourself google expungement oregon and check your government office for the forms and procedures
   (ID: 20ee46767f4f96df6795d9b93f6c4c7be9a56261)

16. zerg herder i assume that means i run in large groups of players ? i did for a few weeks oh about a year and some change ago when i first set foot in cyrodil . i don ' t think i have been in a group larger than digit in about digit months or so . i prefer to stay away from large scale conflict , not because that ' s the cool thing to do , but because i like being able to swap bars . and since you know me so well i ' m sure that you have checked my alliance kills vs my time played very little time in comparison to most , you know wife , baby , job . those can be time consuming . i don ' t want to have a dick measuring contest over a game , so i ' ll walk away from this . brandonbadass you are an amazing and skilled player , i am trash and i use the best armor sets currently available because they make me competitive .
   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

   (ID: 1b99508b414040c0a77716b8287dc8d53ceeed67)

19. well , you proved me wrong . the more you know right ?
   (ID: 2971f819c4d7400b9fa7806434e9037b6af4dfae)

20. of course i don ' t fucking think that . i ' m just trying to point out that the whole " he could ' ve just got an illegal gun on the black  market " argument is bullshit . if in the future there is a gang driven black  market for semi  autos in nz the gangs will need to be very careful about who they sell them too , and a some neck beard 4chan weirdo would almost certainly be told to fuck off .
