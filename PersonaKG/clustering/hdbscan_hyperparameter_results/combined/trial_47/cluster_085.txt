3. do you have any friends that are on the soccer team ? maybe they can help you practice outside of the tryouts ? i  m assuming this is high school so just give it your best shot ! good luck !

4. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !

5. that just leaves the rule of thirds , it may also help to do a quick google for photography rules and  or tips . honestly , i was just trying to find a suggestion for you because you asked , the picture looks good
   (ID: 80d504f68f5028edc4d8e5926e3a2a93b0c84d8f)

6. just sit with good posture ! i have some friends who game with their feet up on the desk . one of them already has back issues and he still does it !
   (ID: 5d6cecafd26473d96b39b973965364f09d4d41f1)

7. that ' s good you seem to be pretty open and receptive to your players and it never hurts to throw a challenge at them they can ' t overcome just to show them they are mortal . good luck !
   (ID: ca6f75f7c2f9d1175fa6abae36369351bda1afb8)

8. good explanation , thanks . i agree . manhood can  t be measured , as that plays into the concept toxic masculinity . then the belief of manhood being measured should instead be just considered how macho someone is ? not in a negative sense for example , if you see a strong , burly man with a beard and place him next to george constanza , considered the former with higher manhood is wrong , but instead maybe more macho  stereotypically masculine characteristics ?

9. ooh good point . just because something or someone has left you , there is still the emotional trauma left behind . i have no idea what that trauma would amount to when it comes to an extra sliver of someone else ' s evil soul inside another .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

10. if you send me pc vods i can still analyze them and give you coaching tips or just discuss strategy via discord , but i cant join games on pc . good luck finding a coach though !

11. just change your definition of ' instant ' and you are good to go !
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

12. i should of known that the prices for these pokemon ones were too good to be true . they are quite hard to get hold of here in the uk , so fraudsters have filled the gap in the market by flogging these fake ones . ebay will be on your side to and help you and get you a refund if you receive a fake , it is just a lot of hassle that is probably best avoided !
