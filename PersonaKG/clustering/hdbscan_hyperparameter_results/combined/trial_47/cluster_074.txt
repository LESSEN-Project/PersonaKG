7. this . making it from york hall in revelle to warren lecture hall in digit mins is difficult . that being said , i still did it a few times a week , even in reverse , which totally sucks even more . parts of the campus are far enough apart to have totally different weather . for classes that seem worlds apart , it might be a good idea to take an hour in between .
