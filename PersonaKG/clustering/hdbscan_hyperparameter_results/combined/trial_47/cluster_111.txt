1. should have drank some of that booze before cold copping if you ' re scared about it . it ' s weird and awkward at first , it ' s a threshold you gotta push yourself over cause asking for drugs is not a normal conversation . once you ' re used to it you know exactly who and how to ask . find some hookers , taxi drivers , go to the needle exchange or find some other homeless guy . they will know , if everything else fails i even approach random people on the street . i always had dope in my hand in less than an hour of cold copping , in some cases in less than digit minutes .
