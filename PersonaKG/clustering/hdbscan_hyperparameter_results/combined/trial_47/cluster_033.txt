2. yeah i  m aware how english works  i mean , i am english after all . my point is that it seems odd to us how american english appears to jump between plural and singular and i  m giving an example where the distinction seems to me ambiguous . if radiohead is nominated for an award do they win the award or does it win the award ? i know the answer to this , but again this is an example of the inconsistency which seems odd to english people .

9. i ' m not the retard who said " all it comes down to which set of genitals are functional . " you argued functionality , not me . i tried to poke holes in your awful arguement . do you know what playing devils advocate is ? so many fallacies i can barely count them all . ad populum , ad hominem , false attribution , appeal to " common sense " , ad ignoratium . i could go on , but i doubt you ' d understand what any of them mean , or even why they are bad .
   (ID: 0be93b714cd5f5999c7ff30ac3a245ba907b2d81)

10. what do you mean ? are you implying that i didn ' t " work " to find this smoke ? i made it myself . even if it was already established , at least it wasn ' t mainstream enough for me to know that particular smoke . i made it myself . however , i will back down if you can give me a link to a post or youtube video timestamp which is the exact same smoke , which was posted before mine .

18. i mean , in the show punisher was plastered all over the news . so tony would know he exists . considering he came to peter with with a suit already made especially for him  it ' s not outside the realm of possibility . the biggest question is if tony thinks frank could be trusted with that kind of metal . part of me thinks he wouldn ' t , but you ' re right that if the stakes were high enough .
