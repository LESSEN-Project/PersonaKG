9. no , it ' s quite normal to be sedated for it . you generally have to ask for them to keep you awake . it sounds like a failure of the anesthesiologist if they were unable to keep you sedated , and it ' s battery unless you told them you want to be awake plus you described it as what sounds like battery to me .

20. in the days where everyone wants access to free information , we have plenty of sites to provide that access . sites like documenting reality , liveleak , goregrish and best gore . they help preserve the legacy of what rotten was . it ' s not some sicko fetish like reddit seems to misinterpret . we want to be reminded of how bad the world can get , so we may appreciate our own lives and those of everyone else .
