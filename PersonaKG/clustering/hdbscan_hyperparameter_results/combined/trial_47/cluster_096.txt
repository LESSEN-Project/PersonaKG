   (ID: 064b68f55fd83de76c3cbc4f130670e6435e42a4)

2. have to be honest , if i saw you in passing i ' d assume you are a " queen " who has all her stuff together and plenty of suitors . i guess this is a reminder to me that i can ' t assume anything , even if someone looks perfect to me  i just never know how they are feeling inside . thank you for sharing !
   (ID: 13a80daa16b50a35515cc7dd9a2f892770b9695a)

   (ID: 535c3113ba487b9152c4b0adbe8c36822bc45ca4)

4. i know they are different , i just didn ' t know if they are different versions of the flash or something . for example you can buy ' the flash ' pops from the tv show . you know this because the logo at the top of the box reflects this . i didn ' t know if one of these flash pops in the picture are from dc universe online or something . i cannot find any info on the reason for the change in logo to just release the same pop , with a slightly different costume .
   (ID: 03bd0b4bb3465eba83e1c9a00af15f7b35f1ec6d)

5. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

6. them ? i have no idea . i didn ' t know them well enough . me ? kinda ? mostly just the times recovering from the partying and work .
   (ID: 7e67f2109db2f138225338a090de78cfd116cfca)

7. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

8. i often play hide  seek with my maturity . at times , i ' m the most mature person alive  other times i ' m the clown . do you know what is the funny thing ? i cannot control . it just happens .
