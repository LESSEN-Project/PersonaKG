   (ID: 47697a08dc01689d8119bf9bd578194eb66d157c)

   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

5. every break has to be done where both parties can see each others faces , next time youre on skype or something where you see his face , show him he ment something to you and just rip the bandaid . never ever text im breaking up with you . that will destroy a person . also make sure hes fully aware of whats going on , and explain why youre breaking up with him

8. maximum carnage  this is no different , as i play this game every single week . it ' s my favorite game on the console . it ' s usually at least a once a week game for me , or as a filler or pickup game if i have some time to kill after work or before supper .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

9. as a guy , i can tell you , he  s not stopping . it  s not a matter of you or the other girls , it  s a change . i agree that the pictures over video is probably i  m the minority but to each their own . unless you  re always there to have sex when he  s horny , probably nothing you can do about it . the best thing to do is just what you have , express your discomfort and how you feel and leave it alone . let him work through and compromise for you , or not . its not worth starting a fight , not for either party . i hope your bf calms down on it though so you feel more comfy , good luck .

11. underrated in the sense that you never hear people talking about onion actors specifically ? they can be just as funny as people on let ' s say , silicon valley  yet very few people can name an onion actor where tons of people know the name thomas middledtich , zach woods , kumail nanjani or tj miller . i ' m taking an extreme example with arguable the most popular tv comedy  but my main point here is when people think comedy actors , they won ' t think the onion actors , they ' ll think tv actors . hence , underrated in the larger societal sense . i find it interesting though that there seems to be a standing army of people here on reddit armed to take shots at anyone using the word underrated as if it ' s a federal crime to misuse it . i still think my use of it stands , but either way . who cares ?
   (ID: fbb82e5b963aa1cda25276df6c0968b4b03a3aa0)

12. restaurant workers  cuss you out as you walk up to the front doors if its within digit minutes of closing make fun of you to the kitchen when you make ridiculous requests like cutting every single elbow macaroni noodle in half for your digit year old half the time i a server say  no  to a request and you ask me to ask a manager , i don  t because i  ve already been told to say no . the house policy is the house policy because it makes business run faster . we  re not assholes for not splitting your digit bill into digit bills by seat number some days bartenders work digit  hours without eating , and their job is bringing delicious smelling food to people , don  t bitch them out for forgetting your 4th extra ranch ranch doesn  t go on anything  everything like calamari , ahi tuna , or omelets my most important notes as a somm   the wine list is there for the informed and uninformed alike , please don  t be discouraged by length  information provided . just let your server know what you like , or what your dinner will be , and someone in the building will be more than happy to pair something for you .  if you assume that because someone is you g they don  t know anything about beewine  liquor , you  re an asshole
   (ID: e9bd2e5a75b03c2a8d39168be58f6bed5ed6ff39)

13. you ' re an idiot who clearly hasn ' t lived in very many countries . welfare is not what builds the nice parts of town or the transport channels to get a coke into the hand of any person in earth . rich people do , for their own benefit and the benefit of those who work for them . just because a few assholes kill the farm and pocket a tax break instead of giving you personally a job on a micro level doesn ' t mean trickle down economics doesn ' t elevate everyone on a macro level . i repeat , go live somewhere not built by the rich if you disagree .

17. i had another interesting lady come through drivethrough today , she also got coffees i also asked her to park and she dead goes " why there ' s no cars behind me why can ' t i just wait here " and im just standing there looking at the digit cars behind her . i go " umm " and she just says ohh and parks . what are mirrors right .
   (ID: ced909c5cb6ff0568a08e4114fa46116da622fa1)

18. yeah true , seeing as that isn ' t even a question i definitely wouldn ' t ask credit the question  this
   (ID: 787f4a3fe31691883105c973a6b8e3df9df1436e)

19. does anyone , anyone , know the back story of this ? had he jumped over that fence before ? or did he land like that before and tried to do it again which would definitely be a dumb move , or was it just a first time thing ? i did dumb stuff to be funny or cool and so did my friends , but . this ? i ' m just trying to figure out what the thought was here .
   (ID: 4c696d3f1d19d74a8b9e25c3dddb75deefc97a4b)
