1. i used meditation about a year ago to help cope with stress and my night terrors , i stopped over the summer , and now that classes have started up again , my night terrors have come with them . i don ' t think meditation is bullshit , but i can understand why you would .

2. yeah , everyone knows you don ' t wear a donald trump inside . come to think of it , i wouldn ' t wear that big asshat anywhere .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

3. yeah . i see why some women don ' t but i think it ' s an important thing to at least attempt . lets print of cards and be weird together !
   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

4. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

5. unfortunately this sort of thing is already happening . i think that ' s why lots of american cops are pretty jumpy and don ' t hesitate when using a gun .
   (ID: a90f01f580b7cc08038958d5c1f659fd492b1f2c)

6. i don ' t think they believed i would go anywhere in life . i was never told exactly why but she lost interest and wasn ' t " attracted " to me anymore . not for looks but perhaps out of boredom or fear that there could be someone better .
   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

7. yup sad hunh ? you can think it but if you don ' t type it then it ' s assumed you don ' t think therefore you are evil . and now i ruined it and we will both get burned at the stake sorry .
   (ID: 02cf76dae1fda8da1d2e5bbbaeb0da5a77cb6e3e)

8. why does it only apply to the 2nd amendment and not any other ? the founding fathers only knew printing press , do you think freedom of speech should apply to the internet ? i don ' t think so . there were also automatic weapons when the 2nd amendment was written .
   (ID: 0be93b714cd5f5999c7ff30ac3a245ba907b2d81)

9. i don ' t think it ' s worth the effort but ok
   (ID: 4e2fa6f27a1d1e593b4d7f007fea784cb7cbfc65)

10. who defines what ' hate speech ' is then ? you don ' t have to define yourself , i think the establishment sucks .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

11. i don ' t think that is laughter . it is probably saying " get your friggin ' grubby man hands off my body "
   (ID: 60767c0b3f4fbb31bad0bee921528b0976287f68)

12. yeah i was reading his post and was unable to even answer what the third perk on a shotgun was . he first said it was two shot and then anti armour and then digit  strength which i don  t think is even possible . he should be reported to mods but in my experience they dont do shit anyway
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

13. i honestly don ' t think he needs any rework , if you are looking for a counter , hold still during the duration of his drone . it ' s that simple . if you get rushed and have to move then that was probably the point of the activation of the done .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

14. obviously you don ' t care if you ' re insulted . i ask this question for others . what do you think smells worse , that couch or the under boob sweat ?
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

15. considering that the atmosphere on pandora is carbon dioxide i don ' t think firebenders would be able to do much .
   (ID: 395865cc8932d0b3d13214bce052e8915f32835b)

16. hmm . i don ' t think it can see its own reflection from there .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

17. well lets don  t be defensive now im not fighting for if minecraft is bad or not but i think its a experience that every child needs to experience but there are better ones for us now . and no i have been playing the game for years and tried the last one too . but im a creative person for commands and buildings so idk about the survival part .
   (ID: a0849f7d6d0829c8bb5f820aa9bf63584c7471df)

18. the lyrics are literally " this one ' s a contradiction because of how happy it sounds , but the lyrics are so down " i don ' t think it counts , it ' s too obvious . some other twenty one pilots songs would probably fit better .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

19. i ' m not trying to defend him but don ' t you think someone might have already redeemed it and you later decided to check it out only to find out it ' s gone ? it ' s happened to me many times for free steam keys in discussion tabs
   (ID: 43361d3d352286328dcb058ec017ca0e2d364601)

20. if you don ' t care for my ideas you could provide one of your own . why do you think a gender gap exists ?
