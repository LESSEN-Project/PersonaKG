1. ooh good point . just because something or someone has left you , there is still the emotional trauma left behind . i have no idea what that trauma would amount to when it comes to an extra sliver of someone else ' s evil soul inside another .

10. good explanation , thanks . i agree . manhood can  t be measured , as that plays into the concept toxic masculinity . then the belief of manhood being measured should instead be just considered how macho someone is ? not in a negative sense for example , if you see a strong , burly man with a beard and place him next to george constanza , considered the former with higher manhood is wrong , but instead maybe more macho  stereotypically masculine characteristics ?

11. quick question instead of posting a new thread  for you toy collectors , is there a particular set  line of sw toys that is sought after or preferred ? or do you guys just collect figures that looks good

13. do you have any friends that are on the soccer team ? maybe they can help you practice outside of the tryouts ? i  m assuming this is high school so just give it your best shot ! good luck !

14. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !

15. there ' s a few good youtube videos on it . watch mark kermode revisit on the film , where he feels more warmer to it . take a look at ' the philosophy of cloud atlas , how beauty will save the world ' and the in  depth analysis by ' the angry hippo ' such a shame the film is so polarising . as jim broadbent ' s character says " if you extend your patience for just a moment , you will find there is a method to this tale of madness "

16. i should of known that the prices for these pokemon ones were too good to be true . they are quite hard to get hold of here in the uk , so fraudsters have filled the gap in the market by flogging these fake ones . ebay will be on your side to and help you and get you a refund if you receive a fake , it is just a lot of hassle that is probably best avoided !
