14. nah bro . i was interpreting the question to be " what would you do if for one day " as opposed to the " your mom is refusing to allow you to ever return to school ever again " my mom almost never let me stay home which is why i would have jumped at the opportunity for one day at home . if i weren ' t running a fever nor vomiting , she made me go . now , given that i now understand the intent of the question  i would probably use youtube and the internet to learn on my own . depending on the circumstances , i might give the local dpp a call . depending on the district they can usually show up personally with a school resource officer in tow to " gently " persuade my mother to allow my return .
