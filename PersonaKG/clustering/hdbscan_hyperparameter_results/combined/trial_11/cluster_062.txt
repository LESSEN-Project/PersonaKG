   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

7. learning the sign language alphabet . i know it for bsl and asl , it takes digit minutes and is a useful skill to have in general . often when i bring up that i know it , people ask me to teach them how to introduce themselves , which is fun . i once had a short conversation with a deaf woman and it was amazing . she was excited to see me trying , and helped me learn a few phrases
   (ID: c1af2a10f968ba6f52d825dbf8fc9b8210db72ba)

   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

10. should have drank some of that booze before cold copping if you ' re scared about it . it ' s weird and awkward at first , it ' s a threshold you gotta push yourself over cause asking for drugs is not a normal conversation . once you ' re used to it you know exactly who and how to ask . find some hookers , taxi drivers , go to the needle exchange or find some other homeless guy . they will know , if everything else fails i even approach random people on the street . i always had dope in my hand in less than an hour of cold copping , in some cases in less than digit minutes .
   (ID: b25bdf3935142c93d642393810cba283ec3b801f)

   (ID: 4dbd3fd527caa93836f895d72dfef9276ea4809f)

17. kind of interesting that rather than show the entire twitter discussion , the writer cherry picks quotes to prove that carole thinks she  s superior . you know how even one thread on this subgroup can lead to several discussions and responses . i could cherry pick any thread to prove a point . this is exactly the same as bethenny  s  harassment  by jason . she presents him as an unbalanced dangerous stalker . when you read the actual court transcript it  s completely different . so  show the entire twitter feed including what prompted carole  s responses or assume it  s bethenny  s pr people trying to protect her by questioning other castmates behavior . another article from the poor bethenny minions .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

19. if it  s a photo with their spouse or children then that  s perfectly normal . but i do have friends  know of people whose lock screen is a photo of their selfie or body pic . all these people i know are extremely arrogant and quite narcissistic . most of them have cheated on their spouses . your call op .
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)
