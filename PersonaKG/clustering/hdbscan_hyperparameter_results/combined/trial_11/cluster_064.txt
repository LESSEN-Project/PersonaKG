8. i think it was more that his character evolved the most . he started out as a date rapist and eventually ended up a monogamist who openly loves blair . he still makes mistakes of course , but he is actually remorseful and doesn ' t continue to repeat bad habits like all the other characters . also , his character has a lot of dimension , which makes him more interesting than someone like nate .

9. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

10. i think a lot of this comes down to the definitions of coercion and seduction . yes , in seduction the idea is to do your best to be enticing to someone . however , this should not be confused with a bending of their will or a manipulation . coercion is doing whatever is necessary to achieve a desired response from someone else , including putting extra pressures on them , which can be easily done if the coercing party is in a position of power , whether that is physical strength , employment , or status . seduction is like giving someone all green lights , coercion is like trying to take the steering wheel .

11. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .

14. do girls think of boys the way we think of them ? like if a girl hears someone on reddit is boy checks for photo posts or tried to imagine  what they look like .
