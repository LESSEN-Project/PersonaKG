   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

3. hmmmm . what would be a good place ? get everyone to head out to a wheeling spot like hot springs ? i ' m not coming up with a good one between me and you .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

4. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .

5. good question . seems to me like they might be able to answer quite a few of the questions around this case by discreetly placing a camera to catch whoever is desecrating the grave .
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)

6. i can somewhat understand this with subs like wpd , or cringeanarchy , but waterniggas ? seriously , what the fuck ? that sub is actually pretty wholesome . memes about staying hydrated can turn into good tips on living a healthy lifestyle .
   (ID: 419b67e0e2cdcb7bd8ea9a89d34d0747a1f5f620)

7. try to get the point across with statements like , " i haven ' t had something as good as this is a while . " , see if a mutual dialogue opens ?
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

8. with soccefootball there are so many players around the world , plus the transfeloan system , it makes it easy for the wealthy clubs to acquire good players . in the nba it ' s a lot more difficult , sometimes there is nothing they can do . teams like the lakers and knicks would have been relegated a few years ago , despite how big of fan bases and wealth they have .

9. are continents large enough scale for you , retard ? if not , good news  you could be only a day and airfare away from living like a king in africa .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

10. yeah if the case cover is off i would suspect bad contact of the cooler to the cpu . with a good aftermarket cooler you shouldn  t be seeing temps like that .
   (ID: e7516540d2045135f43a4a7c61f0bd88856c8ff4)

11. this life by denzel is pretty good . i can suggest more if you like it . you should check out his  imperial  album
   (ID: d1e6050d6d7638f6662249831925c3a9185f210b)

12. looks like a good phone . why do you have both lite apps ? i guess you might not be using them so much .
   (ID: 4dd03f320502247ea725348e21fe67168d7cf5f1)

13. they look like freesias . do they smell good ?
   (ID: d3491a90d756046acac8c3053e9e99c3e6c231f9)

14. sounds like a good plan . which pokemon are you playing ? is it any good ? how is it different from the last digit pokemon games ?
   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

15. omg u guys are so dumb obviously no one has ever said this to you so stop making  memes  and go get a real job like go on tumblr or something that  s a good website guys it  s obviously a joke . edit
   (ID: 4136a1b6da64b3c5f49dfe23761d1a0ec8925dba)
