18. my suggestion is that you should jusrify the desicions she makes based on beauty . for instances the more beautiful they are the healthier . there are uncountable ways to justify it like magic , culture , sport , economic competitiveness etc . you can make your character ' s perspective more poetic or funny . example  instead of saying " your nose is too large . you can say something like " you can ' t beyond your own nose .
