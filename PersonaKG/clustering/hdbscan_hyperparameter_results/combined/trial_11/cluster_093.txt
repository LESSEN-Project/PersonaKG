   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

4. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

9. that ' s where breath comes from . what else would people think ?
   (ID: 5218a6fd3b7d990775fbaa39249c20beea16f741)

14. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .
