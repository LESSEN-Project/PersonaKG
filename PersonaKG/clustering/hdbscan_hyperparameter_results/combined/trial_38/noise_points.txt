1. One of my favorite things is reading peoples rants.

   (ID: 6b55ac21377298601038ad44ea0f65b18e7c5b51)

3. not sure , honestly . although i ' m not sure it needs to be changed . a big theme on reddit is the idea that people should learn to recognize when they can just google something , instead of filling comment sections with those simple  answer questions . otherwise , there are subreddits like askscience that can take care of some of the more specific question types . i think askreddit could certainly benefit from linking to those alternate subreddits in the third rule though .
   (ID: ecce6e894db30f245f1073ca0e270a3bb87eaa71)

4. i ' ll agree i have read that this is a problem . i wasn ' t as aware about this . seems silly to tax the people trying to give a child a home .
   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

5. i took a year off after high school to decide what to do and make some money full time and i did , but i never properly took time to do enough research and i just jumped into a program that i  m not completely enjoying . im two years deep in this program now , and it  s a shame that now i know what i want to do and i wish i took the time during my break to find out that i should have done this other program instead of the one i  m doing now . if you  re gonna take a break , please pick wisely . i  m too deep in to turn back , and if i could go back i would do things different . you don  t want to be the guy who wishes he went another route
   (ID: cdfe8425c4239c926bbc69037b1e955de45be4ba)

6. to be fair that was a fucking fluke . wasn ' t skill , was luck i was amongst the top rated when the sub exploded 2k subs in digit day and the new guys upvoted the top stories by about digit points each . if i was digit  digit positions lower by now i ' d be somewhere around the 6th page .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

   (ID: a46a927d1c00d0b3c6ef6c26916584373e7bc5d8)

12. well that ' s actually a problem . i go incognito to watch porn and when i close i lose the page , and forget the name if it was a good one . its sad and i need to find a new one every time . if i bookmark i feel weird when i go over over it
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

13. i went to scis pd , graduated digit . if you played basketball or volleyball , we would have met . i went to the us and studied information systems , graduated in digit . i did opt for a year before realizing i couldn ' t stay long term . now i ' m in canada doing a graduate diploma . i really want to go back to the us , and honestly , my best chance now is marriage . once i ' m done with my studies in canada , i ' m hoping to get another student visa back to the us , and marry an american . work visas are a nightmare , and even if you get sponsored , there ' s no guarantee you ' ll be issued one . i ' m sure you know about the process . i was like you , i had no idea how difficult the process was until i started my opt . i was so naive , all i did was go to school and went about my business , but i had no idea the consequences of my actions or inaction . hope you find what you ' re looking for . i want to settle in the us permanently , and i ' m hoping everything will work out fine .

15. pull out your uno reverse card .
   (ID: 990ad26ccc25b114c7f512fc1c83b02e54b79e2a)

16. yeah it ' s generally a good rule . but my little brother takes it too far . you to one tiny thing to him , he says treat people how you want to be treated then drops bombs on you .
   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

17. your brother beat him and he was in the hospital for a month over cheating ? that ' s sad . i understand it was messed up but to take it that far is absurd .
   (ID: 33483b17911ec063ef4562ae3263fe478eba6a2c)

18. well i suppose that ' s probably how a lot of the great stand  up comedians and voice actors started . i ' ll admit , doing it in front of strangers is probably going to be more nerve  wracking . i do some voices and crack jokes around people i know but i already know where i stand with them . doing it to get strangers to like me or to put food on the table would make me more nervous .
   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

19. more like why a queen ? how do you people still have kings and queens like it ' s the middle ages ? it ' s ridiculous .
   (ID: 54182f6e08cc212d89e66f7640449d6fa9717bd9)

20. that ' s . fuckin gross . op , i ' m so sorry . if it helps any , i empathize . i ' m nb with significant reproductive dysphoria as in don ' t want anything to do with any of it , and my mom ' s been hounding me about grandkids since i was your age . saying it feels gross is an understatement  any serious suggestion of it makes me feel physically ill . no one has any right to determine what happens with your body except for you . if you need a proper binder , you can get them for    digit from gc2b , and they come in tank top styles that can throw off suspicion of their purpose i just recommend not letting your mom get a hold of it just in case  they are stretchy . take your measurements accurately before ordering  they ' re tight . don ' t wear it digit  digit  you need to breathe , and you can damage your body with prolonged unnecessary use . it ' ll take time probably a decade or so as per your current age for her to realize you ' re serious . all you have to do is stick to your guns . in the meantime , trans is a good community , if you ' re not there already .  digit
