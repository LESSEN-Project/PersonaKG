1. one of the biggest errors our little human brains make is assuming people we know are the same from day to day . many people do not understand the episodic nature of depression . i strongly encourage you to mention to a friend of parent something like " this may be out of left field , but between you and me , i ' ve been feeling kind of blue lately . i know i don ' t show it , but i guess i could use a little extra support at the moment " say it in a way that feels like your voice . saying it out loud is scary , but surprisingly therapeutic in and of itself .

2. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

3. yea , i don ' t support it . you just can ' t change their mind by telling them these things , the only reason they are homophobic or racist it because they ' re ignorant , impossible to change their minds .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

4. you know what would solve this type of shit ? eliminate riders that have nothing to deal with the proposed bill it is attached to . riders should have been eliminated a long time ago . when i was a little kid i was wise enough to see the stupidity in riders and now i am in my digit ' s and this bullshit is still going on . i once read a defense budget bill that included removing certain animals from the endangered species list . why the hell would something like that be attached to a defense budget bill ?
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

5. posting something that i as a muslim support doesn ' t make me a cunt . you using a generalising term clearly shows the upbringing you ' ve got . wow . shows where you stand ? oh wait . nowhere !
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

6. this post is actually a pretty good start . whether you realize it or not , you ' re reaching out . now you need to go to a doctor , or a therapist , or whoever you feel comfortable with , and tell them all of the things that you have told us here . i ' m no doctor , so i can ' t say one way or the other whether or not you actually need medicine . but that ' s all the more reason to go talk to a real one . if you really do have depression , you might need meds . you wouldn ' t leave any other disease untreated , right ? as for the girl in the pic , i ' m guessing you look nothing like her . the hard reality is that you probably never will . everyone is different . you need to stop comparing yourself to other people , because you ' re only hurting yourself more . chances are , that girl has insecurities of her own . everyone does . but you can ' t let it control your life .

7. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path

8. it sound that those people in your life are holding you back and that isn  t good for mental health . i  m not saying you should get rid of them but certainly make them aware that your life is more than chores or work and everyone needs a hobby and shouldn  t have to hide it .
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

9. i mean tell him you feel like you ' re going back to the person you was . tell him your side of the story ! how you believe the fight was unnecessary . that you feel such a similar pain . who knows , maybe he understands and talking about it will grow the two of you closer together . perhaps there is a good friend who is willing to give you another perspective ?
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

10. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

11. i experience this even now . i think it ' s fine to think every now and then about your situation . it would be impossible to never think about it , but don ' t stay focused on it for a lengthy period , it ' s unhealthy . when i had a job in retail i caught the train home every night . friday and saturday nights were almost unbearable . watching groups of people your age socialize and have fun hurt bad because it would remind me how i ' ll never be able to experience it for myself . you can still find some people to hang around with , maybe from work or education . but i think we should agree that looking forward is the best thing to do

12. it is not a petty reason at all to be angry at this . you said it yourself you guys had a rough childhood and you still have struggles . you are allowed to feel like this no emotion is invalid . im sorry you are going through this , you seem like a really strong person . focus on your school . i believe in you .
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

13. sounds to me like you ' ve been screwed over a lot and are making the best of your situation . sure , the person you live with is your mom but you ' re paying your share . you ' ve got a roommate you just happen to be related to . you ' re doing what you have to do to take care of your kid , no shame in it .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

14. i don ' t really see how you weren ' t supportive of her . she seemed to make her mind up on plenty of issues without you and you ' ve tried to approach them all in a logical way . also she purposeful tries to do things that hurt you ? that ' s unsupportive . you might have to let her go . i think it ' ll be better for both of you .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

15. does she want to be with you ? if not , then she is not the right one for you . obviously i don  t know the details of your relationship so i can  t really say but my rule is that i want someone to be with me , not because i convince them , but because i didn  t need to .
   (ID: d95d3548a9506e48c5310c85f3b2994820405e0d)

16. i feel like you invite this kind of opposition view to your thoughts when you post them unasked for in a sub called unpopular opinion . we ' re not talking about laws here , were talking about your unpopular opinion .
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

17. who defines what ' hate speech ' is then ? you don ' t have to define yourself , i think the establishment sucks .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

18. calling me a fool for giving you advice ? if that ' s how you treat your daughter no wonder she talks back to you and treats you badly . you literally described your own child as a " fucking ass  hole " your digit year old daughter . jesus christ . the stuff you have described makes you look awful . and your ex  husband never shaped her like that especially when your the one " looking after " her for the majority of the week .

19. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !

20. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers
