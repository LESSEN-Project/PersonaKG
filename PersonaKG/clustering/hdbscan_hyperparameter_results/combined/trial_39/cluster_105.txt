2. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !

6. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .

9. i think being loving first and getting to know them can permit the conversation about jesus to go more smoothly . they may even come to see god through through tour loving relating as the candle shown for all to see . if we don  t tell our co workers at our jobs about hell digit  digit why should we do it to homosexuals ?
   (ID: 2a3f07a52e2fc5e79fd2ed52f4f601fa39ebe2e4)
