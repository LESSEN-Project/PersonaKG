1. all of them are as weird as each other to be honest . it ' s just the newer ones that seem weirder because nobody grew up with that particular set of myths .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

2. main character wise they are standalones , but world lore wise they are heavily linked , specially digit and inquistion . i would hold on playing dai and start with origins . i differ from the general consensus and actually like da2 a lot and think dai is just an ok game aside from the tresspasser dlc , which is phenomenal
   (ID: 127d601df381c9f971eae1e3fd42953571015813)

3. so it wasn ' t really a sex scandal , but just the year of the pedos . not digit , but digit teachers at my school were arrested for some kind of sex with children . so the first was just some coach touching up on some girl , and that was the first month or so . this happened twice with different teachers . then the theatre teacher who had been with the school for many years , and someone who i was pretty close to , was having sex with child prostitutes and would handcuff them and pay them extra to be quiet . we found handcuffs in his van once , we were on a road trip , but didn ' t think anything of it . lastly , and this might be the worst , but there was a teacher who not only won teacher of the year , but was having sex parties . okay , so i bet you ' re wondering how he was able to got kids to go to his house . well they weren ' t exactly his students , but members of his church . he would invite young boys from his church over so he could play games with them and get them naked . this is just from the teachers . that ' s even all of the weird shit that ' s been happening at this school . i ' ve seen and heard so much and it still surprises me . i ' m just glad this is my last year here . if you want to hear more that happened just let me know . i ' d love to tell more that happens here .
   (ID: 74d9c413c2cf59d223d7510b599edf6b6b1df3a2)

4. One of my favorite things is high low skirts.

5. iirc , icf it says that doing too many taxes your nervous system . you can do more but you ' re over exerting your body beyond your muscles . i could be remembering that wrong .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

6. then you really are as stupid as i suggested at the outset . they are completely accurate and they are about digit times more useful than your nonsense because they ' re the meat and potatoes and nobody gives a shit if you could add digit tomes of ands , ifs , or buts to them . " meat " is not a complete description of steak and " vegetables " is not a complete description of salad but those are the main points you think of when you see steak or salad on a menu and an adequate description of the difference between them for you to decide you feel like having one a lot more than the other . and all i asked you , was the difference between autism steak and retard salad .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

7. it ' s not really shepard anymore , the shepard ai has much bigger priorities than talking to an old crew now . everyone would think he just died during the crucible firing .

13. agreed , i think this list shows how far reddit has its head up its ass . people joke about the hivemind but this list really shows it
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

14. yes , it can . please don ' t misunderstand me , i ' m not putting you down in any way , or being negative . consider that more than digit  of the people on the face of the earth have never cut themselves on purpose , even once , in their whole lives . we don ' t have something wrong with our minds that drives us to cut ourselves to be able to feel something . i can only hope that you get yourself some psychiatric help to figure out why you do this to yourself , and learn how to feel something that isn ' t pain . i can ' t imagine what put you in that place . i hope you can find a way out of it .
   (ID: 514a3ecd0d04716c9225352c4a3a5d5424dd8056)

15. i watched one of his eps the other night . the one with the kramer painting . still find it interesting to watch larry david actually write stuff out for a scene after years of him improvising his way through curb . his dialogue for the art collectors was really good . one thing , though , and it ' s not particular to this ep , but it ' s so weird how we never even see the outcome to jerry calling out his girlfriend on his lie . there are a few storylines in the show that just sort of evaporate like that and yet you never end up caring much about it as a viewer . it doesn ' t decrease the quality . i wonder why that is . they don ' t really resolve the story , and yet you still feel full at the end of the ep .
   (ID: a3c37892d1eb5776c9a4299ce29fc6200c20dd34)

16. that ' s what i ' ve discovered . i ' m very new to this sort of thing so i ' m hoping i get through it alright . thank you !

18. i  ve just got this horrible feeling that we  ll end up back tracking on the due to international pressure . international law stipulates that we cannot leave someone stateless but what for the islamic state , the one that she left for ?
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

19. my vote for actress would be andrea . prison relationship is true . mormon affiliation appears quite recent  those women at her shower saying they  d always wanted a black friend . you wouldn  t say that about someone you had fellowshipped and worshipped with for years . but she  s been on reality tv before , she obviously is a black hole of attention needs . i can see her , and people like her scouring the reality tv adverts looking for one they might qualify for . with her , the mormonism would have been further bait for the producers . she  d have a good sense of what is needed to catch their interest . i think the more of these reality shows we see , the more manipulation we will see by participants . god help their friends , family or partners who are no longer useful . gives new meaning to  collateral damage  .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

20. it happened about a year and a half ago . i am unsure if i could still do so . looking back on it now i wish i had right away . then again i didn ' t quite know what was happening . you hear about it and know the stories . outside it seems so simple but inside it is just a cluster of confusion . i definitely did not feel black and white about it . i was in shock about it and actually just didnt let my mind process it . not to mention the extreme victim shaming and drama that was ensued by my ex over it . the prioritizing of his own feelings . he callrd it " what you did " and how could i have done this " to him " . it distracted me from really ever doing anything about it . and yeah , it was a big thing in my life . still is . i ' m still dealing with it . i found out recently that this guy has another case against him apparently . if i speak out it would help the case . but i am trying to heal . and i ' m currently unsure if i pursue going to the authorities what will happen . will it reopen everything . make it worse . will everyone turn against me again . will i lose the little friends i have left . will i feel worse ? will i find closure ? i will have to tell my parents . now that will just open up more wounds and i am already swimming in lacerations . i am just unsure if i have the strength to survive all of those factors . and until i find that strength i have kept quiet . but then on the other hand i am beginning to feel that if speak up i will find more strength and maybe more closure than i thought i needed . i don ' t even want to face or him or ever see him again . because this guy made me believe that he really cared about me . the lies he told me . if i ever see him again i don ' t know how i would react and i fear that as well . part of me still cares for the part of him that he pretended to be . so it still scares me that i might feel those feelings if i ser him again . for me its hard to let go of that person because i really needed the person he was with that mask on . and i fell for it . ah i dont know . but i do know that hes young . and capable of getting better at being that way . so something needs to be done so he doesn ' t do what he did to me to anyone else , or worse .
