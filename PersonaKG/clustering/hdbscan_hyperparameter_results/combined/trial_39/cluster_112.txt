3. i don ' t think the average gamer could even survive a week in the woods , let alone survive not being corrupted by the marker , or killed my necros

4. these people are the definition of selfish . they don ' t think anything about their grandchildren , because they don ' t give a shit about them . they care purely for themselves .

5. i used meditation about a year ago to help cope with stress and my night terrors , i stopped over the summer , and now that classes have started up again , my night terrors have come with them . i don ' t think meditation is bullshit , but i can understand why you would .

6. yeah i was reading his post and was unable to even answer what the third perk on a shotgun was . he first said it was two shot and then anti armour and then digit  strength which i don  t think is even possible . he should be reported to mods but in my experience they dont do shit anyway

7. obviously you don ' t care if you ' re insulted . i ask this question for others . what do you think smells worse , that couch or the under boob sweat ?

8. jumping in front of trains , doing double  backflips off of buildings , and other not  so  fun demises . the stuff i keep to myself is way worse , and i don ' t think the medication is working  but they tell me it does .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

9. i don ' t care if you have black friends . i think it ' s wrong to only care how a person looks and not take anything else into account .

10. well lets don  t be defensive now im not fighting for if minecraft is bad or not but i think its a experience that every child needs to experience but there are better ones for us now . and no i have been playing the game for years and tried the last one too . but im a creative person for commands and buildings so idk about the survival part .

11. it ' s a fun little demo to show people your watch , but i don ' t think it will improve the way you play at all . the ui is a little confusing , and the data updates a too slow for my liking . the only other thing you can do besides find portals is normal hack them , which can help you get gear easily , but is useless in the long run .

12. i don ' t think they believed i would go anywhere in life . i was never told exactly why but she lost interest and wasn ' t " attracted " to me anymore . not for looks but perhaps out of boredom or fear that there could be someone better .

13. yup sad hunh ? you can think it but if you don ' t type it then it ' s assumed you don ' t think therefore you are evil . and now i ruined it and we will both get burned at the stake sorry .
   (ID: 02cf76dae1fda8da1d2e5bbbaeb0da5a77cb6e3e)

14. i ' m not following . in op ' s scenario , they ' re getting referred for a procedure  service not covered by their insurance . what about the solve . care platform would lead to the payment responsibility being handled similar to a pcp visit ? i can understand solve . care handling the referral for an hmo . but unless i ' m misunderstanding op , don ' t think that was the scenario .
