8. from the epilogue of the book , professor pieixoto says they narrowed the commander of the handmaid on the tapes down to either waterford or judd , and they went on to say " judd devised the particicution , realizing that it would release the pent  up anger of the handmaids . pieixoto says that particicutions became so popular that in gilead ' s " middle period " they occurred four times a year . judd also came up with the notion that women should control other women . pieixoto says that no empire lacks this " control of the indigenous by members of their own group " so yes , the women are living under the control of the men  but the men were pitting the women against each other .

11. is an extremely thorough examination of free will . a short summary of the link above would be   we have the intuitions that   the sensation of the primitive of actions , is incompatible with their physical determinism  a decision can only have a single " true " source  what is by the past cannot be determined by the present  if no single psychological factor you can see is perfectly responsible , then there must be an additional something that is perfectly responsible  when you reflect upon any single factor of your decision , you see that you could override it , and this " you " is the extra additional something that is perfectly responsible but these intuitions are mistaken , and make our intuitive idea of free will incoherent . however , the feeling of free will corresponds to a real thing , and there is a meaningful distinction between a man having free will say , choosing to eat chicken or pork for dinner and a man lacking free will say , choosing to eat chicken or pork for dinner while in presence of religious fanatics that would kill him if he dared to eat chicken .
