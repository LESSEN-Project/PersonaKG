   (ID: 6f88a57b804dffb05f07ee78e02223947d9055aa)

   (ID: c6e395c03fa0151554baed67a84968066bfa9cf3)

   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

6. i personally fell out of an uber two night before my internship started and wrecked my face . had the scaries so bad i didn  t do anything for digit weeks . really was an eye opener to me . still get dumb like a normal college student but made me notice things can get out of hand , and that i am not the best drunk lol
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

8. my girlfriend loves indian and mediterranean eggplant dishes , but not most western ones . eastern dishes tend to break up the eggplant a lot more like baba ganoush , and if eggplant isn ' t cooked all the way through it does have a really woody  reedy taste and a fuzzy texture .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

13. are you serious ? edit  i ' d be glad to help you and all , but that ' s really not a lot to go on . sorry for sounding like an ass , though .
   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

14. it ' s not really faking it though . you ' re just putting the diagnosis out of your mind . you ' re temporarily living your life as a regular person that just does stuff differently . it ' s just a mindset change to help you better become aware of your actions that are excusable by your asperger ' s and those that are not .
   (ID: df5213e759ef279850d575577da3967d8f71679c)

18. i dont have the subox but i do have some kanger tanks and i really like these  digit delrin tips from . i have bought several and they are all great . the tapered long black one might be just the ticket for you .
   (ID: 6778aa4e3cf401044823c475db231fc0b1d0ff4b)

19. yeah , that ' s a little unfair . although there would be false positives there too , like " you must really enjoy the elliptical "
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

20. if you found them because you were also using the app , then you can ' t really be mad , but you should definitely talk , discuss being open , or just break up . if someone else found them and showed you , just break up .
