1. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .

2. it  s true that it is kinda a waste of time anyway , the problem is that instead of having fun wasting my time i just get depressed

3. it will be ok and just imagine the relief when it ' s all over and in the past ! your doctor will not scold you for holding off on appointments , she will be happy you came in ! even if you have the worst case scenario , you will be in the right place , plus most cervical cancers are treatable when caught in time .

4. the thing is , phoenix aren ' t meta . they just help a lot early in the game as their tags allow you to unlock ep , thrawn and chimaera . it saves you time and makes you pretty competitive early on in arena .

5. they  re wrong and so are you , because there literally is not a correct answer . sorry if what i said stung , but i hear it all the time from fans who obsess over it instead of just enjoying the show .

6. my gf and i tend to devolve common phrases and words over time to more just nonsense noises . we can have almost whole conversations with bizarre words and noises . we often ponder that to anyone on the outside it might seem we were both handicapped in some way

7. yes it sucks and having digit  learnings to complete is a bit much . they are there for a reason and if you just skip through without retaining any if the knowlage idk what kind of employee you would be . just take them one at a time .
   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

8. sometimes when i type " just a sec " i mistyped and write " just a sex " awkward answers when there ' s time that passes until i realize what i said .

9. even in this sub . last time some dude stole a pic with the oops tag on it the entire sub ripped on that dude so bad . all memes should have a mark somewhere imo just to give credit where credit is due .

10. hi ! i ' m from the year digit , just build a time machine  travel to digit to answer this post !

11. they are not quite playmates since they are pretty much ignoring each other . i am just happy i can have them in the same room and can spend more time with each of them . condescending karens are everywhere lol
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

12. wow ! that ' s a lot lol thank you . i own a aspire breeze and it says on the packaging that i should not go over 70vg or 6mg . so after reading this i could go past digit but it would just take more time to wick ?
   (ID: 114e3678c6af9d322985bb4656e33b19c03a0479)

13. i agree with this digit  . when i put my blinker on to get over , more than half the time , the person i ' m trying to get over in front of speeds up to stop me from getting over . so i just quit using them .
