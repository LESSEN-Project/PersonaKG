   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

   (ID: 535c3113ba487b9152c4b0adbe8c36822bc45ca4)

8. i dont know if this is cheating since the official album version has vocals , but the anthology version of " eleanor rigby " with just the orchestra is amazing . better than revolver ' s version imo
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

   (ID: e3a37ef234435ebde735894f98de2b3f90e3bbe9)

11. well , thank you ! at least now i know . just one more question  the bag they gave you already , just not the right size for the helmet ?
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

12. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

13. probably not , but just wondering if someone will know lol .
   (ID: 6938adfadf158e773c1a81f3c3b4f7ef1aed3881)

14. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !
   (ID: 44477e54e9e15675b9ad5c3be02b0440724c674b)

15. the main flaw i see with many answers is threefold . negotiating will be difficult when you don  t know the language . even shakespearean english could be a rough adjustment . depending on whom you are negotiating with , they may just take it . and , if you bring back something that appears too shocking , threatening or evil , you might meet your maker rather quickly .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

16. ah i see , so the actual answer is nothing to do with circumcision , it ' s about hygiene . okay then . you should find yourself a hygienic male . i can confirm , having never had dick cheese myself because i know how to operate a shower , that it is just fine .
   (ID: b42bcbaed0ea1f011b4d8c42d4ad9df732ecc5d5)

17. could also be related to the kind of food you eat , the lack of exercice , the lack of sleep . i don ' t know you so these are just possibilities .
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

18. i know you guys are gonna tell not be with someone who i can ' t trust you ' re goddamn right .  but hear me out . maybe we ' re just doing something wrong ? mmmm nope . you shouldn ' t date someone you can ' t trust .  i just wanna fucking know who she ' s talking to lol . bit controlling but okay . ask her if its that big of a deal .
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

19. oh no problem just letting you know
   (ID: 2264050ea82d909575d6593daf8246fa8655751e)

20. quietly letting customers know they can save some money by paying me cash in hand rather than paying me the full quoted amount and receive a pointless invoice on their email . just occasionally , of course !
