4. what medium ? their website , that they own ? or the internet as a whole ? if it ' s the latter , then you grossly overestimate the reach of facebook . if it ' s the former , then you grossly misunderstand the meaning of private property . as for banning bernie sanders posts , they would have every right to do so . and if they banned trump , the same . or if they banned discussions about nascar or bob ross or apollo digit or star wars or anything else . facebook is not yours . you do not own it , nor do your opinions much matter to them . why ? because you are not the customer . the advertisers and shareholders are the customers . you and i ? we are an item on a shelf . our value ? the information we freely provide them that they then sell . why did they ban gun sales ? liability . if a madman buys a gun over facebook and shoots up a building , then the government will crawl so far up facebook ' s collective anus that they will be poking mark zuckerberg ' s brain stem . that is the last thing they want , so they are covering their asses preemptively .
