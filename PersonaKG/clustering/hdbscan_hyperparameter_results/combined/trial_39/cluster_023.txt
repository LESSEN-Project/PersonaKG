1. i had been at my job only a few weeks . the guy i worked closest with was a real jerk . he gave me one hershey kiss . just to act like i wasn  t embarrassed i said thanks and immediately ate it . everyone else in the office told him that was a dick move . he said ,  just kidding  and gave me the case of beer he carried around in the trunk of his car . he later got fired for being a total slacker and i got his job .

4. i havent experienced this myself purely , but i got lectured by my mom ' s colleague about it . apparently robbers just hand a sticky note to the bank teller sayain , " i have a gun . give me money " and if the teller tries to resist , they will be fired because if they get hurt , that hurts the bank ' s image . usually , the teller would just give the robber  digit or so and the police would find the criminal later . so no . it is absolutely nothing like how the media portrays it .
