4. what i personally am afraid of are the open statements that mail won ' t be integrated any more . i ' ve never been a heavy e  mailer , but found out about the integrated mail and feed client around version digit and began using it just for the sake of convenience . it has been just fine as an integrated client , but as a stand  alone one is a big joke compared to thunderbird , for example .
