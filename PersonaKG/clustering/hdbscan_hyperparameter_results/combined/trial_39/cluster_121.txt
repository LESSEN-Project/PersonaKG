2. learndota2 though this is very old , some of them are still relevant purgegamers youtube , he has digit playlists dedicated to teaching dota digit and a series where he teaches day9 everything about dota digit . just ignore all the idiots who go out of their way to shittalk lol , most people from dota days are still butthurt that pendragon took a few ideas . drow is similar to ashe and pudge is similar to blitzcrank , frost marksman and fat hooker respectively . teemo is apparently similar to techies ? at least in the sense that they plant mines and you get reported for playing them if i ' m remembering teemo correctly . there ' s loads of thematic similarities between heroes as well if your keen on some of those . e . g . shyvana reminds me strongly of dragon knight .

3. hell yeah ! preach ! just one correction tho  transgenderism isn ' t the right word . it ' s just " being transgender " . the term has a lot of baggage from people using it as a slur so for the most part we avoid using it unless joking about people being dick .

4. you ' re not wrong . the hike to get there isn ' t all that easy though takes just under digit hours and covers about 600m in altitude . it was pretty dangerous at times due to the rain , yet you see people walking up there in flipflops . are they the real  life equivalent of someone driving around in winter without snow tyres on their car and putting themselves and others in danger ?

5. apologies if my comment came across as uncivil and misunderstood . i wasn ' t insulting the op in the slightest  in both of our cultures what i said is deemed friendly banter and it is a difficult situation as the internet is globalised so certain cultures reading this would take what i said to be offensive however the person this was directed at would digit  understand where my intent lay . i do however understand that there may be people reading this who could find it offensive even if it wasn ' t directed at them so i can see why it was removed . i just wanted to clarify that there was zero malice in my statement . thanks .

6. men are just mad that they  re being asked to be better people . if the ad doesn  t apply to you , there  s no reason to get mad at it . if you  re getting angry at it , you  re probably a part of the population gillette has asked to be better .
   (ID: 12803a9aad224d0537b68ab83a6cdc6a45d3160f)

7. yes . some people just put off this great sexual energy . can be spotted in the eyes .
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

8. people complain about how capcom makes this game too casual friendly and that it ' s just too easy . here they are making it so you can dp after the opponents cock is down your throat and it doesn ' t even trade but digit  just hits them even though you were slow as balls . now that you can ' t be punished for being slow but are actually rewarded for it , making this game that much easier and now everyone is happy about it . what ' s gonna be next ? digit button supers ? an option to pause online because you have to finish painting your nails ? pathetic .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)

9. when people touch your stuff . it happens too often that people just pick up my backpack and throw it on my lab instead of asking to free the seat next to me . and for some reason its always women who do that , guys always ask
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

10. people that hate others for the way they are , are just sad individuals , and nothing else .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

11. it probably is fake . there  s thousands of people on this app . he  s claiming something that is pretty extraordinary . if e can  t provide even a piece of evidence or a hint then i won  t give him the benefit of the doubt . that  s just me though
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

12. harassment is indeed illegal . just wanted to point out that we shouldn ' t hate on people who simply states their dislike of the lgbtq community , as that is what homophobes wants us to do so they can have an excuse to harass us .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

13. no one is getting what i ' m saying tbh lol . people are just saying things without even reading descriptions on the game .
   (ID: 7c96bac704435347f721cc9a3056b8d7be16cc06)

14. i might just be more used to being around people of my own , not that i specifically dislike another
   (ID: dc000fb877b86a0bbd3d65fe6040b512b4f5b042)

15. is the mail pre sorted for you or do you have to sort it ? our complex has digit mailboxes all in a row and our mail man just throws it all in and we have to sort it ourselves . almost daily i get other people  s mail . is this common ?
   (ID: 472de55a2855849453179c0ccb5234c4ea9d1192)

16. people are curious creatures , just as you enjoy looking thing ' s , so do other people . your probably just thinking about it to much .
   (ID: e871625874733300de2a83384cee8c72546d3ec6)

17. just leave a picture . people will understand .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

18. misophonia is a serious disorder . if you file for divorce , you might be on the wrong end though . seeing a psychologist might be more beneficial . what about all the other people you hear eating ? or maybe she was just absurdly loud ? who knows .
