1. im waiting for kunimitsu and negan , and i know several pros and cons . pros are you know the most of the match up , move , what safe and what can be punish . cons are sometimes you do wrong input for example yoshi ender i always use with f3  digit but some times i mix that with miguel button input . also , having your brain expand the size of the entire roster , sometimes i found myself think of all the move i use when i fight those character , for example like if i fight yoshi , i would expect my opponent to only use what i also used but nope he use other tech so i find it difficult sometimes . sometime you you underestimate your opponent because you know most of the match up , and other than that , you can mix some move into other character for example yoshi didn ' t have savage but you think he has cause you play most of the roster . in short it can confuse you .
