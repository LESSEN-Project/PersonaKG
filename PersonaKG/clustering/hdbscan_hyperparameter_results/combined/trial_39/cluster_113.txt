Total from this dataset: 9

1. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

2. people often hide names in screenshots , i think it is  was against the rules to include them .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

3. being happy and being usefull for other people . for me if you think you shouldn ' t be happy you are living wrong and if you think it ' s fine being a useless piece of shit you are living wrong as well .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

4. i think that people shouldn  t have to lie about their beliefs . i think their religious beliefs shouldn  t be mentioned at all
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

5. i think most men over digit before that most males would do a pig if it had big boobs prefer the natural look and the covers of these magazines are what women think what men like . the porn industry never realised this and tries to blame its fall in profits on piracy but the reality is that people would rather watch the videos of real people unenhanced by surgery that are widley available online for free .
   (ID: 3f0409a6efb16c26d2f9f7a14f5e75b8945ba427)

6. i think it ' s more of a celebration than a " get people back into the game " sort of deal .
   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

7. think long and and about the history of black and white people in this country . now tell me . why do you think it ' s not considered racist ?
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

8. it was a whole group . digit people and we were great . but we grew apart and i try not to think about it
   (ID: 41ecb08cd807b953da29a82cba9ddfcf32745fc3)

9. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .
