2. yeah , they could have swapped these amateur  oriented modes " effects " and " scene " for u3 and u4 . they messed this up on the d7100 by putting " effects " between u1  u2 and m  a  s  p and i still like the d7000 ' s approach on this for the same reason  on this type of camera , they could easily go with m  a  s  p , u1  u2  u3 and nothing more . if the d750 could go up to , say , digit fps with a grip and if it had an adequate buffer depth , it would be something of an upgrade from the d700 . i agree it could be named d650 , because the d6xx could have more serious af in the first place . if i was soon going for an fx body , i ' d gladly pay the price of the digit for a d750 without these things that are crippling it .

3. while i agree somewhat to the fact that hispanics like to fuck . i find it a bit distasteful to say that the problem is with hispanics . not with retarted white christians . who are too dumb to realize that their children are going to fuck regardless of what they ' re told . so hey lets get them to put on a jimmiehat

4. lol what are you going to say ? just straight up ask  what are your views on feminism ?  you think a guy that wants to have sex with you is going to say  oh i hate women  ?

5. exactly , you ' re not here to entertain me , but this post was meant to entertain whether or not it ' s for easy karma is a different matter . this is the first time i saw this , and judging from all the up doots , i ' d say i ' m not the only one . nothing is original because someone is always going to say it first , all that matters is how and when you do it .
   (ID: 2168250be01c43791f88e7c8ad875c0396307047)

6. me too . it ' s something i ' m going to say to one of my kids in particular .
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

7. dont take this the wrong way because im not trying to sound like a dick here . it was a dream man , dont read too much into it . granted some psychologists say you can discern alot about people from interpreting their dreams dont put too much faith into interpreting them . your grandfather obviously had some minomajor impact in your life . are you single ? going through a rough patch in a relationship ? or perhaps life is shitting on you pretty hard right now . so perhaps your brain created this dream to ease the hard times your going through . or maybe your girlfriend  wife  whatever is pregnant or expecting or whathaveyou so your sub  conscience is trying to tell you something . anyway whatever the case may be dont read too much into a relative who has been relegated to the past tense coming to visit you in your dreams
