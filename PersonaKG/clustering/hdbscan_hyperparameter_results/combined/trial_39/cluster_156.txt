1. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .

2. good question . seems to me like they might be able to answer quite a few of the questions around this case by discreetly placing a camera to catch whoever is desecrating the grave .

3. hmmmm . what would be a good place ? get everyone to head out to a wheeling spot like hot springs ? i ' m not coming up with a good one between me and you .

4. yeah if the case cover is off i would suspect bad contact of the cooler to the cpu . with a good aftermarket cooler you shouldn  t be seeing temps like that .

5. with soccefootball there are so many players around the world , plus the transfeloan system , it makes it easy for the wealthy clubs to acquire good players . in the nba it ' s a lot more difficult , sometimes there is nothing they can do . teams like the lakers and knicks would have been relegated a few years ago , despite how big of fan bases and wealth they have .

6. does that include someone shooting heroin ? correct , i would not report someone to the police for shooting heroin .  you wouldn  t report that person for their own well being ? sending them to prison is not good for their well being . so again , i would not report them .  what do you define as a victimless crime ? a legal offense to which all parties consent and no party is injured .  instead of getting all defensive like a little soyboy you could have answered my sincere question . um . okay ?

7. sounds like a good plan . which pokemon are you playing ? is it any good ? how is it different from the last digit pokemon games ?
   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

8. i like how the stars on the boats represents how many seasons they played . good job !
   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

9. if we ' re being technical , digit minutes . we agreed on dating then i changed my mind because i felt like i wasn ' t in a good mental state .
