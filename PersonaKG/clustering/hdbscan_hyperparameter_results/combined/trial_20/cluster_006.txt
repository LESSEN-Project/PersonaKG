1. how to make small talk with people you don ' t like
   (ID: 2b53241b2b7d7e4ce58f4e39589b18bda4d0d5d2)

2. you sound classy and intelligent . don  t let people make you feel bad for being passionate about anything . are you mixed race ? i  ve read this book and really i think everyone should read it but i feel like it would especially benefit you . it  s called  born a crime  by trevor noah . i think you would really enjoy it and maybe it could bring you some understanding as to why you  re facing these problems and another way of looking at it and having someone to relate to .

3. when they get super angry at you over something very trivial , and decide to swear at yoinsult you .
   (ID: d1e274dbfcf8ed1af55bb50c57e00046b961b6fd)

4. we are particularly good listeners by nature so that ' s why people tend to dump their problems on us . also , i feel we tend to understand and put ourselves in their position thus being able to say what we might do to help improve the situation . personally speaking , if a friend asks me how i ' m doing i just say i ' m fine since i feel my problems are mine and i don ' t like unwanted advice . so , if i were you i ' d learn how to tune out when people start wittering on about their problems or make yourself unavailable for a while . hope it gets better for you .

5. i don ' t have much problems with friends but have had issues with sos . don ' t make me feel bad about it . needing alone time is how i recharge myself . it doesn ' t mean that i don ' t like someone . it doesn ' t mean that there is a " special someone " out there that i would want to spend all of my time with . no , you sitting quietly in the same room as me playing on your phone  tablet  computeetc . doesn ' t count for alone time . frankly , i ' d be happy if i had the whole house to myself but i can deal with just a room . alone time is my time . don ' t ask me what i ' m doing . don ' t ask what i ' m thinking about . most likely i ' m reading a book , listening to music , watching tv , or playing video games . it ' s nothing secret , but making me talk about it feels like you ' re invading that time .
   (ID: 238107f17ccd21a5cb87efbd00d55a861389ba26)

6. i talk to people every once and a while they hate me at first then get used to me and friend me out of pity . i don ' t know why they do that they could just stop talking to me if they hate me but it ' s just what happens .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

7. i usually am that weird guy . i make inappropriate jokes , i whistle , i stamp my feet when i work , i talk loud . and still people don ' t seem to hate me .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

8. so what if they actually don ' t like you ? does that make you worth any less as a person ? i don ' t think so . opinions are not real and this is why  if some stranger walked up to you and said  " you are such a shoelace " you ' d probably be indifferent and you wouldn ' t care that much because it just doesn ' t make sense , right ? so if you swap the word " shoelace " for " asshole " and you swap the word " stranger " with " friend " does that make any difference ? probably not because it ' s just a word . you are not obnoxious . somebody may think you are while somebody else thinks you ' re not . you may even be your own worst enemy because you call yourself obnoxious ! it ' s just in your head though , don ' t believe the demon that exists inside there solely to give you a hard time . it ' s not real .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

9. never assume how someone is feeling . it really hurts when people say " you look happy " " you dont seem depressed " " stop trying to seek attention " . you can never know how someone is feeling and always assume people are telling the truth when they tell you they have problems . people have different ways of dealing with their problems around people .
   (ID: e87275c4c3cfea671e40cbeff9a12d5fc1372f97)

10. how do you deal with people like that ? i struggle with people already but when it ' s someone either not listening or think they know better i end up snapping at them
   (ID: f8771fc63bc4c52bb04b2e71d4aefe7bf406c65c)

11. i  ve learned its about matching energy . if they  re upset and boisterous about it , match it . if it  s more of a somber rant , be quieter in your response ex her   i just can  t even believe she  d do that ! it  s crazy !  you   yea thats super fucked up !  her   im just really down right now you know ?  you   yea , it do be like that sometimes .  if you constantly try to fix the issues they come at you with it makes it seem like you  re trivializing their problems because , in their eyes , you  re saying the answer is obvious . everyone wants to just vent now and then and having someone reciprocate your feelings feels better than answers sometimes .
   (ID: e9bd2e5a75b03c2a8d39168be58f6bed5ed6ff39)

12. not everyone can like you , so there is always someone who is sick of anyones shit .
   (ID: 4a03851d25b2526583af78261bff2af13796094e)

13. i tend to say fuck you to anyone who say ' s hello to me , i think i need to get a handle on that
   (ID: 3bc536069edd6aa052ced5b6ea5f69eefae07cb7)

14. with indifference . nothing gets them going better than when they realize you don ' t care what they do . they interpret it as snobbery and often spout the old , " you think you ' re better than me "
