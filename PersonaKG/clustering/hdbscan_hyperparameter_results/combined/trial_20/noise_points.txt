2. there are some secrets that have to be kept for people  s well  being . the idea you  re proposing would make it so lgbt  members are outed to their families . that  s just a breach of privacy . you could also say that masturbating is a secret , since you don  t really tell anyone about that . how would that benefit anyone , really ?

   (ID: 69878cc2cc3e4fe974feb7f6bf5a69bf75cd4951)

11. kind of specific but i  ve felt most comfortable when it  s a guy that  s sitting next to me . esp when i was sitting first and then they sit next to me . i know it sounds weird but it makes me feel kind of . special ? anyway i  ve never actually had even a friendship come from the conversations but as long as they  re being nice i like talking to people . i may seem like i don  t wanna talk but i  m just shy . i just wish they  d seem like they talked to me bc they wanna get to know me . it always seems like it  s out of boredom or being polite .
   (ID: 821feb57a838ce1b3e5f4aeb9b8e118113a7b57c)

12. you know to much .
   (ID: d42f47f147cdc8e97117f0e4963e2c1309d1dcd8)

13. if it isn ' t on your contract , you ' re not getting it . this is the most important thing to remember . if your recruiter promised ranger school and you don ' t have " option digit " on your contract , you won ' t get it . if you haven ' t shipped out yet , its not too late to back out . even after you get to basic , you can still get out . i know people who figured out that they weren ' t cut out for military service , talked to the drill sergeants , and got an entry level separation . they don ' t make it pleasant , but it happens . tell people not to send packages . you ' ll have to open them in front of the drill sergeants , and you ' ll be punished for any contraband don ' t try to sneak a cell phone in . it ' s not worth it . for the love of god , keep your weapon with you at all times . if you ' re sitting down , make sure the strap is wrapped around your arm . drill sergeants will try to take it from you , and you ' ll be punished if they can . you ' re all going to fuck up . even if you do everything absolutely perfectly , you ' ll still all get punished for whatever the drill sergeant can think of . they ' ll find the smallest thing wrong and punish all of you for it . physical fitness is very important . if you can ' t pass the apft , don ' t even try to join until you get in shape learn the ranks before you go in
   (ID: 4f65e5402391c052d2d3e7a2a4d73b01ea1db203)

14. it should be legalised everywhere . let ' s say a woman gets raped and suddenly is pregnant . she doesn ' t have money for having the baby because it would live a rough life and putting in on adoption isn ' t a good idea too . if you cannot take care of the child because of the situation no money , place to live etc it should be allowed . i don ' t think it ' s a good idea to let the child suffer in life if it doesn ' t deserve it . it ' s just my opinion and it ' s probably wrong .
   (ID: be642743472cdef9445edc6dd55beb3c2a8a1258)
