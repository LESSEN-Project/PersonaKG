1. honestly be i  d not say anything , ignorance is bliss but nta tbh if you told him although i  d rather live in bliss and not know it  s over all better to be told hurt and move on just be direct about it but be kind if you get me
   (ID: 77ab4860c32a7084ca81fd91302df6690ce56731)

2. you sound a lot like me , it ' s borderline creepy . i don ' t have dyslexia though , but i have a lot of other stuff so it ' s all good . my sister is even four year older than me . it sounds like it ' s your parents fault for having an impact like this on your upbringing , it ' s definitely affected your life . you should focus on your writing if that ' s what makes you happy and keeps you occupied . one of the best ways to help with depression is to find a hobby , it could be anything from skydiving to working out to writing , anything that distracts you and keeps you entertained is great . as for the girl thing , maybe just keep trying to get her to speak to you . i ' m not exactly an expert on relationships so i don ' t know . and you speak better english than digit  of english people , so well done there .
   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

3. oh man what a prison scenerio , you got punked in front of everyone , now everyone will punk you . you gotta beat his ass down 5x harder than he hit you to get back with a little extra . even if you get beat up at least you dont look like a coward . or  its just highschool and no one will remember in a few days . he was obviously trying to impress someone so it has nothing to do with you personally so you can be the bigger man and walk away , dont give him the satisfaction of retaliating . if it occurs again i would ask him why he did that . if he has a reason , try to deescalate the situation and find common ground . if hes just a dick and doesnt stop , resort to the first plan .
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

4. it ' s clear you ' ve never had depression . my mind wants to do something but my body just won ' t move no matter how motivated i am . i try convicing myself to do something but subconsciously my body knows i hate my life and dont want to do it . it ' s like falling into a deep hole you can ' t climb out of without someone getting you out .
   (ID: 1921dc07cd609c210cb71a0176afa3dfa4fa3772)

5. you aren ' t alone . at least in here . and i thought i was alone in my thoughts . you almost were talking about me . i ' ve never found anyone either . i wish i had a better answer . i ' ve been looking for years and i find no one really . i had one therapist who kept telling me my problems were mine and it ' s because i don ' t love enough . how do you love when you don ' t know what that is . other ' s have said to put others first . how do you do that when others don ' t even see you . so i feel for you in i ' ve never felt i could let go of everything except online and that ' s still behind a mask . if you need to vent , i ' ll listen . good luck my friend .
   (ID: 298dd327349771a27c9a14437b3b5a53d0bd9e35)

6. i  ve been in the same kind of situation , a couple of times . you did the right thing ignore him for a few weeks or even months until you feel like he  s learned from it . then unblock him and message him
   (ID: 0328413fb9fd5eff68cef63593bfc5537e85c2e8)

7. the relationships i ' ve valued most came from the women i didn ' t initially think were the most beautiful . life has nothing to do with looks . if you don ' t have a real relationship until you ' re digit , consider yourself lucky  it ' s all a waste of time . bullshit this , bullshit that . most dudes just want a hole to stick their cock in and are willing to lie to you every word they say to get that . some women have figured that out gonewild exists for a reason . don ' t feel dependent on a relationship for happiness or validation . that ' s only going to be a let down . once you feel happy with yourself , love will come naturally . ask anyone over digit thats been through a few divorces  you have to love yourself to love another . anything else is lying to yourself to pretend to feel happy .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

8. hey , first off , i wanna thank you for being real with how you feel . and congrats to losing 90lbs , that ' s absolutley insane ! the first thing i thought of was the concept of " stinkin thinkin " and how our mind sometimes plays sick games on us by saying we are " not good enough " in reference to tinder , , , anyone can make a profile so why would you deny yourself the opportunity to have one if you want one and try it . you may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome . but it starts with you making one and knowing that if others can have it , you can too . also youre so young that you can bounce outta this mindset . first i would take your chance on the girl you want . ask her to the gym or something , and if that doesnt work , go in on the tinder and try what have you got to lose ? nothin , but a mindset that needs updated . im sorry if thats harsh because i do empathize feeling that way , because ive been there but ive found the way out too by putting one foot in front of the other and takin that chance with a girl . i believe in you bruddah

9. try a psychiatrist . there ' s antidepressants for that .  source ?  chronic depression sufferer
   (ID: 8583c2f8118c4b3f3d00c452df3ca410a605ac45)

10. that is completely normal . if you take away social constructs from humans , we are animals that use sex to reproduce and animals have many partners to spread their genes pool . deep down our animal brains still have that need . it has nothing to do with love , it ' s just a simple need that comes not from thinking mind , but simply the way our bodies work . there are things that will do more harm than good . you tell her that you find one of her friends sexy and she will start looking for hints of you looking at said friend once you all are around . in the end it will damage their friendship . being transparent doesn ' t mean you have to tell everything without being asked . if she asks , you can tell her how you feel . but don ' t tell her that out of blue .
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

11. there ' s nothing you can realistically do about this apart from get a hold of yourself and learnt to move past it . remind yourself that you have no reason to be angry about it and make sure you never treat your girlfriend poorly because of it
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

12. thank you so much . it means so much to me .
   (ID: 870d9d198f856764296262192823c935f1daf781)

13. i can think you should be honest with your feelings . i say with experience and to ignore or overlook it can be more destructive than anything else . if she genuinely likes you , she ' ll come back . if it ' s just the physical stuff the friendship will fizzle out . that ' s the worst part though . fwbs ruin good friendships most of the time .
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

14. what do you think he  d do ? it  s it  s hurting you that much then you need to act before your emotions start consuming you . i wouldn  t take any of it personally though . some guys just like sleeping around for fun , and don  t realise how much it can hurt others . there  s millions of good guys in the world that are just around the corner . write this chapter in your life off and start a new one tomorrow .
   (ID: 0b40e1731a58e377af57361e27d4264ac065a5b8)

15. okay he is being a little unfair by saying that it won ' t work , if you haven ' t tried it , neither of you will know . and also , if it doesn ' t work , just go back i know there are financial complications with that , but mental health is always first . you can always make more money , you can be un  sad if you know what i mean . sometimes it ' s jot about physically being away , but mentally being away . one great thing i have with my current partner we ' ve lived together and apart several times  very unreliable with money haha we can sit with each other in silence and it ' s okay , or just say " i ' m not feeling talking or doing anything " i know it ' s hard because when you love someone you want to be with them , and it feels like you ' re being mean if you don ' t want to be there all the time . but it ' s normal . try and give yourself some more attention , when you look after yourself , many things in life fall into place . your whole brain restructures , certain things become unimportant etc etc
   (ID: 87d1924873eb8926aac7c71d1a563d7d2d1cabbd)

16. you do need to suck it up eventually . at the end of the day you ' re the only one in control of your own happiness . this seems mean but it ' s the truth .
   (ID: a5abb0fc49ef940b208bd33b46b6b669a13fc83f)

17. i don ' t know what i can say that will help you because i don ' t know your situation . but i am here if you need me . if you are tired , exercising can help you get more energy
   (ID: 09ceeb62f2a165a9c38283d43984e8e6f6f5580e)

18. if you can ' t let it go and move on , you ' re not honourable . just grow up and move on . seriously , it ' s pathetic that you ' re even putting any of this . be it a joke or not .
   (ID: 6ea2719d7b2aba54e352b1f2b374bd6af6fd406d)

19. well you are setting yourself up for a fall . you said she  s super religious , this will not end well for you . she will either make you go to some other crazy jesus freak that will attempt to rid these devils from you , lol , or she will blow a nut just like you said she does and call you a fag and want you to get out . now sit back and take all that in because you are heading down a path that has no positive outcome for you . sorry . you already said who she is . good luck dude .
   (ID: 3cd64a42c43aaba8bcfe70482cd19250f58de2f0)

20. i think the best thing to do here is communication with all the parties involved . make sure everyone knows what happened and they don  t see the story from one side . when shit goes down and i need to just talk to them to make sure they don  t hate me or something i usually start it off with ,  now you don  t have to talk or respond but all i need you to do is listen , then you can make your own judgment , insert story here .  i think it  s important to let the other person know hat they have control of what they think and know that you feel bad . explain fully that you were drunk and have no recollection of the event . apologize profoundly and shit . but i don  t know if you want to take my advice fully . i  m just some shit 15yo white boy . i don  t drink or do drugs or anything but my father is an alcoholic so i know a thing or two about drinking . just apologize and explain your side , of they still hate you well tough shit .
