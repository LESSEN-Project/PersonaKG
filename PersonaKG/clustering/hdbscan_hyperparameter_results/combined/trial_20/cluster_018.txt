1. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

2. idk , i  m able to relate to nearly every message and character in the book . halliday  s created the most immersive  video game  in the universe and yet it  s so much more than that . people get lost in it .  the missing millions .  all just because he wanted people to like what he liked . and that somebody like wade who had quite literally nothing but passion and skill for the same things was able to beat his game . i think cline wrote every character perfectly , being able to understand their plights , i mean even sorrentos character was compelling , somebody you really wanted to hate . the references were insane . i didn  t even grow up with the old school games but the attention to detail was incredible . in an era where aaa titles don  t even come with enough content for digit month , cline was able to imagine up a place where everything was under digit platform , the whole world shared halliday  s creation , gunter or not . free learning , unlimited content , whatever your hobby was , it was in the oasis . i  ve never wanted something to be as real as i do the oasis . but the themes hit home too . the problems with being overly connected , letting the real world pass you by . the want and need to not let corporations rule the world . i just think it  s amazing start to finish . i understand liking something and later feeling differently but man , this book , i don  t think i  ll ever get tired of .

3. demons of the punjab . the story was compelling , it looked great , it put a spotlight on an often forgotten piece of history , and it didn ' t feel quite like anything the show ' s done before . it takes you away . i thought the antizone was cool or at least my inner digit  year  old did and it made me cry over a talking frog , which is more or less exactly what i want from this show . rosa . pulled off a somewhat questionable premise for a show like this , started some conversations , and i actually did like that the villain was just some random alt  right coded dipshit . the witchfinders . it was . pretty fun . i ' m not sure if the beginning deliberately called back to the line in beast below about the doctor not interfering with other peoples or planets unless there ' s children crying , but kudos if it did . the woman who fell to earth . i was excited when i first watched this because jodie was good . the ghost monument . it was bad in a different way from when doctor who was the last time it was bad , and for a moment that can feel similar to being good . resolution . just like dalek except without everything that made that good and a clunky joke about those damn millennials and an uncompelling subplot about ryan ' s dad . the tsuranga conumdrum . boring . it pretended it had a big theme about hope and stuff but it didn ' t . seeing gifsets and stuff i thought that the pting would appear near the end , and before that it would seem to everyone like all the problems were caused by some hostile force instead of a little animal just trying to survive , but that would ' ve put a theme in the actual story and we can ' t have that now can we ? arachnids in the uk . also boring . maybe if they ' d given the appearance of biggest spider an actual buildup and had had the team have to think to come up with a nicer way to kill the spiders that actually made sense it would ' ve at least been memorable . the battle of ranskoor av kolos . i had fun watching it , but that was because i was making fun of it and was also drunk . kerblam ! man , you ' re really going to use this show to tell a story about corporate exploitation being good actually . i kinda want to vomit . what happened to not just giving up and making a stand and saying no ? i get that not everything i watch is going to have the same political opinions as me , but there ' s that and then there ' s like , basic morality .

4. i liked the books , but they ' re not great , i agree . they ' re easy to read , which is part of their appeal . i do like the large number of characters and how they keep crossing paths , often times without realizing it . i do find the plotting and backstabbing interesting , and the mystery of some of the schemes so you don ' t quite know who ' s is telling the truth or lying or is simply being an ass , it ' s more obvious in the show , so it takes away some of the mystery and guessing . i do like fantasy . i read the lord of the rings trilogy as a kid , and another couple series that i absolutely adore redwall , and the wheel of time but i consider those truer fantasy than got , but maybe that is the appeal of the show . it ' s fantasy , but also somehow more relatable , more realistic , in a way , so it ' s not as " hardcore " fantasy , if that makes sense .

5. no man ' s sky . all of it , but most importantly the ending . i haven ' t even played no man ' s sky and i feel offended by it .

6. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .

7. black panther . i ' m not saying it ' s bad , it was just way over  hyped .
   (ID: 78a7be65b9d2e7cebf18280c07d4f44e6f2b3417)

8. i may be one of the few here who liked pnd3 . i honestly like it more than pnd2

9. strong story and a solid world is all i want , took a chance to play battlefront digit recently and while it plays well and everyone is dressed up like they ' re in star wars , it doesn ' t feel like star wars

10. ok so for me origins story really disappointed me the combat was great and what not but the levels and and story killed it for me . the story was good at first but as soon as the order of the ancients came into play it just got repetitive , find info track them down kill them repeat . i would do a mission and it would say be one level and then the engines would be digit levels higher sometimes . in odyssey the story doesn  t feel like that to me , it feels different . i prefer kassandra over bayek just better character in my opinion . and i can really appreciate how much variety it gives me in options to level up . oh and i like the new kind of abilities you get instead of what was in origins . just ask if you would me to elaborate on this more .

11. tbh there are a lot of 2d games that are better than hzd , such as super mario bros digit and digit . i ' m not saying this game doesn ' t have its niche fanbase that will replay it people such as yourself , i ' m saying it wont be the sort of timeless game that continues getting new players into it years and years after release . it will instead fade into obscurity . the reason it wont age well is , as i mentioned , the fact that it ' s a copied and pasted open world format in an already overrsaturated genre . and it ' s boring .
