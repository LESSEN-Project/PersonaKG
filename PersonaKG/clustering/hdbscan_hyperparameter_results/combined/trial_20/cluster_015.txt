2. it ' s obvious that posters targetted at the soldiers themselves exist  it doesn ' t need mentioning , we see these on this sub every day . it does not change the fact that the poster does have a major focus on women as a major source of dangerous gossip . i am not judging it  in the 1940s i suppose women did have a reputation , whether deserved or not , as " especially prone to talking too much " . but the facts remain . also , there is no need to downvote someone you disagree with  remember guideline  digit   digit don ' t vote on whether you agree with the message of a post . we both are contributing to the discussion .

   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

9. well you see since the white male has been the majority for most of history it is now somehow acceptable to discriminate against him . because the idea of everyone being equal doesn ' t apply to " everybody .
   (ID: 90779ea1e5aa2ec3ed3a1fa6b99a8207c0d66d3e)

   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

   (ID: 0092767d04168a05a983237480637793d5458cba)

16. how can you speak for someone else regarding their own intentions ? for arguments sake , let ' s say that i thought the two bombs were a step too far , does that make me anti  western ?
   (ID: f8771fc63bc4c52bb04b2e71d4aefe7bf406c65c)

17. you know what , you ' re absolutely right , it ' s mean for me to point out your errors  especially on a forum like idle heroes . i don ' t intend to discourage you or make you feel like you need to justify yourself . you ' ve taught me a lesson today and in the future , i ' ll know that pointing out someones minor mistakes , is not worth the effort and only upsets people . thank you for taking the time for the back and forth . peace .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

18. i get what you mean . i  d say it  s the general misconception that if you  re jewish you support israel and that if your anti  israel you  re an anti  semite . it just that the two are paired together unsurprising very often . i know plenty of jews who are anti  israel at least in its current state , it  s just the misconception that makes it seem the way you describe .
   (ID: 137d64f4a858b21d0854639ebc037d0bd1dc557f)

19. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)
