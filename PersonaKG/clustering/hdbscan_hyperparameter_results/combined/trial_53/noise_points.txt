19. i can see flak jacket and camouflage being crutch picks a crutch is a choice that is not the most efficient one , but makes things easier for the user . something is a crutch when there ' s a more powerful , harder  to  use solution  think low risk low reward versus high risk high reward . " crutch " is not a synonym for " overpowered . camouflage is not a crutch as there is no other option concerning hiding within spot flares besides smoke , and those defeat the purpose of hiding . flak  juggernaut is not a crutch because the only other way to reduce explosive damage on the fly going prone is stack  able with said specs . my advice is to get better at locating enemies without the use of flares and minimap . even a walking enemy makes a fuckton of noise in this game , as does the sound of somebody spawning . the moment that hidden enemy gets an ally is the moment where you can easily figure out where the enemy is hiding  the new spawn is almost guaranteed to start running away from their ally .

20. doesn ' t the fee amount start with the team ? are they doing anything to lower the fee ? i haven ' t seen any info or feedback from them about it although i have not done much looking . i do know i am invested in xby and they were able to lower the withdraw fees by updating the wallet within the exchange . i dont know if this is anything like that but thats my other experience i have had with high withdraw fees .
