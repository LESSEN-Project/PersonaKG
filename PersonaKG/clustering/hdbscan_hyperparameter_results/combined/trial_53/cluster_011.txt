1. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .

2. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .

3. no need for the s
   (ID: 41d66f92509db20d202cca3f348509c6cd25586b)

4. nobody should ever feel this way . it hurts me that your  friends  would tell you things like that . i would take some time to find a new friend group . if there is a counselor or someone on campus , i would utilize that resource too . you don  t need to feel alone . you have a bright future . i  m sorry this is happening to you .
