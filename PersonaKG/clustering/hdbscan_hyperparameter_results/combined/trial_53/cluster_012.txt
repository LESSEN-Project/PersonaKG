1. i can relate , when i was dating this ome girl earlier this year id rather hang out with her than do anything else , she just made me happy . heres the thing if you hang out with them too much there eventually gets to the point where you get bored of them , lose your interest in hanging out with them . i know i know you might be saying that you wont and some people can be like that and never get bored of them but incase you do take a step back but not to far back , they ' ll think something is up when in reality you jusy want to create distance to rekindle the flame of loving their company . thats my opinion atleast

2. thanks for the detailed response back i  m really the same way a lot of the time  i really only talk when it  s important to me and try to stay comfortable wherever i am with a calm attitude . i would rather observe than participate . it  s hard for others to  read  a person who acts so chill i don  t think being late would really affect someone else feeling uneasy around you  it  s not necessarily a  flaw  but could be misconstrued as being confident you  ll be okay if you  re late . i would definitely try to stop being late . you wanna be seen as putting in as much effort as everyone else . also , help out your coworkers ! especially the new ones  being the big kid on the block is intimidating especially if they don  t feel like they  re meeting your standards . ask someone who seems to be nervous around you for help to figure out nyc mass transit and see what happens  they might start to feel more comfortable . try to be a little less chill  most people are uncomfortable around others who seem to be confident in their silence because it kinda makes you seem like a stranger . try to observe others around you  are they asking questions often ? are they talking amongst themselves while you just observe ? what can you do to relate to them ? incorporate yourself into other peoples  lives and i think you  ll see a big change . in regards to meeting a girl  you should remember that women want to feel calm with their man  don  t try to throw out how chill you are  instead just show them a different side to you . as a first date do something really actively fun and faster paced like roller skating or an adult jump house . if they have strong opinions on something you kinda feel indifferent about , join along in their fury if it  s not that big of a deal . just little things to make you more relatable . relatable is the key word here for sure ! good luck

3. am i missing something here ? you love your boyfriend but hard hanging out alone in your room with a drunk guy who tried to kiss you . you stop him and clarify that this is a no go and you love your bf . perfect . but then you have him spoon with you all night as a comfort to you ? that makes no sense . but whatever . if it is eating you up inside and you really truly did not do anything , you should tell him . i mean why not  particularly since there is no longer contact with the mf .

4. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .

5. being single does suck . i ' ve been single my entire life m16 . i usually cope by hanging out with friends . i know i ain ' t the best looking , nor am i fit . but yeah . i get how you feel . life does suck that way . whenever i feel down about being alone , i usually think " i ' ll find that person eventually " some day you will . just continue doing what you like , and hang out with your friends

6. you know , i  ve been at that point in my life where i wondered why i had so many failed relationships . but then i realized all of them had one thing in common . me . there  s a reason why we pick the partners we do . go to counseling because you want to be the best you that you can be , not because she made the call . go for you . i hope you do it .

7. talk to him about it . if he seems to dislike it as much as you do then i  m sure you can find a common ground of when in the hectic schedules it  s more likely to happen if either of you initiate .  dry  spells happen in every relationship at some point and it  s important to talk about it and reassure him it  s not a guilt trip rather seeking open feedback because you feel so strongly about it .

8. hum , talk to him and tell him how you feel , your fears , what you want and what you expect of the future with him , that you live him if you do . and ask him if he ' s willing to be there and take the compromise with you to make it work . depending on the answer just do what it ' s best for you and the baby . it ' s better to leave on time than stay and get more hurt . good luck !

9. admitting there is a problem is hard . fixing it even harder . your kids are likely in school full time . perhaps there is a way that you can find an after school program instead of a daycare . or , a dayhome . an hour or two in the afternoons probably won ' t affect your children negatively as a they are more connected to you by this age and can identify right from wrong and tell you , and b an after school program is guided by professional people and c less costly than full time care . i am a mom to a half day kindergartener digit and a digit mornings a week preschooler digit . i would need to find evening or weekend work to save myself from childcare costs being enormous , so i choose to wait until they are schooled full time . do you have any flexibility with your job ? perhaps you could drop off and pick up and return to work if necessary when she returns home . i ' m getting off track . i can ' t think of anything you ' re doing that isn ' t gentle , kind or thoughtful and coming from a place of love . i know my husband works long hours for our benefit and i appreciate the hell out of him for it . you are a good person and it sounds like she does need help in the form of a doctor or counselling for ppd . just keep coming from a place of love when you tell her you miss your partner in crime and that you want her to be happy , and all that growing old together stuff . i would beg and plead with my husband to come to counselling with me if i thought he needed it , but if that ' s likely to make her angry i just don ' t know . maybe if you guys are close with her family you can discreetly discuss with a trusted family member that you are worried . maybe they are worried too .

10. first and foremost you ' re doing great already . to some extent a stubborn stressed woman in the third tri is going to require you to roll with a lot of punches no matter what . it ' s entirely possible that what she needs most sometimes , fair or not , is a punching bag to let off some of the steam she has to keep repressed with nearly everyone in her life . my best advice otherwise , try proving to her you ' re doing what you can by getting her to expound on her feelings rather than trying to refute them . she says you ' re not stepping up to the plate ? fine , instead of arguing , ask what you could do better . write the list down , check the items off or at least make progress on them and report back within a couple weeks and ask the same question after . it ' s not a contest or a way to show her up , it ' s an exercise to show in an enumerable way that you ' re doing the best you can not just to be a dad in general , but to address her specific stress points . it ' s important that it not become a contest of any sort . you may have to do it over and over , or different variants for different issues but if you can show her that you ' re addressing her specific concerns instead of just doing what you believe to be responsible which is great , again i applaud your efforts and preparedness it can go a long way to relieving some of her stress on that specific issue , proving commitment to her and validating her feelings .

11. he is trying to pimp you out . i suggest you tell him that his friend can ' t come over anymore . you need to put your foot down because if you don ' t , your going to be sleeping with all of his buddies and whomever else .

12. i can think you should be honest with your feelings . i say with experience and to ignore or overlook it can be more destructive than anything else . if she genuinely likes you , she ' ll come back . if it ' s just the physical stuff the friendship will fizzle out . that ' s the worst part though . fwbs ruin good friendships most of the time .

13. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .

14. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .

15. i would recommend advice for this , but i ' ll try to help as well anyway i think you ' re just friends by convenience . you ' re on the same team , you live near each other and give each other lifts , but beyond that , he has better friends and you don ' t . i ' ve been in that situation , there ' s not much you can do except to to find other , better friends , and accept that that ' s where your relationship is at . if you ' re scared to do things around him , find other friends and don ' t value his opinion of you so highly , that way if he does judge you , who cares ? as a rule , if a friend makes you feel uncomfortable in some way when you ' re around them , get out , find a better person to spend your time with   x200b    x200b

16. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .

17. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .

18. oh my god if his fetish has this much of a hold on his love life you don  t need to be with this person . have you told him everything you mentioned here ? about how uncomfortable and skin crawling hes being ? it  s cruel of him to expect you to change your body for his fetishy desires .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

19. knock that bish off the pedestal . really , if you keep her there you  ll never be able to appreciate anyone else . including yourself ! ex is an ex for a reason .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

20. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .
