1. imo when you say you believe in something , you stand up for it even when it doesn ' t benefit you . if you believe in freedom , then you have to protect people ' s freedom to do things you don ' t want to do . otherwise you were lying about valuing freedom .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

2. ahh , now you ' re playing stupid , huh ? way to show intellectual honesty . really . well done . thanks again for displaying what fucking liars you all are . way to show , again , that you have to lie through your teeth just to feel like you aren ' t a bunch of fucking rats . seriously . thank you .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

3. all good , manicstoner . so what about you ? you said you ' re having trouble answering the question ?
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

4. maybe think more about how you title your posts next time . your title was misleading whether you think so or not
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

5. but that ' s not actually what ' s happening , you are writing hypothetical fiction at this point . suppose in your hatred of trump supporters you become a murdering psuedo  vigilante who kills trump supporters . you should be banned from reddit you murderer ! you should be in prison ! see , anyone can do it . and my point with that example is that you are really going to say that a good father and successful mechanical engineer is " piece of garbage " just because of who he voted for ? give me a break . to be fair , though , washington dc is just a corrupt city in general , it ' s not just trump , although he is probably among the worse . nonetheless , the whole city is owned by corporate donors , e . g . the koch brothers . at least it ' s not as corrupt as it used to be in the gilded age , boss tweed era .
   (ID: 0264eec5f9f9a43d83f3a82c46341e90961fa3b8)

6. you could have said " oh yeah , cool " . instead you got defensive and downvoted me . a fucktard says what ?
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

7. but reddit is a place where people care more about being morally right than factually correct . how dare you prove them wrong !
   (ID: d048a45810866f7b853972f50c2c2746bc339a21)

8. you have got to be kidding . how in the hell do you classify this as racism ?
   (ID: 7928bd3c3e727c94ff476240a27ed7199d92d666)

9. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

10. i ' m not going to downvote anything you say because i ' m open to anything you have to say . the question wasn ' t asking for evidence . the question was asking about what makes each individual believe in god . and you don ' t , so you kinda wasted your time by coming in here and generally just trying to start an argument . when you say there is no evidence , you are only approaching reality through what you see and feel from your own perspective , which is all any of us can really do . thing is , everyone has a different view of reality . that in itself is mind boggling . we are a collective consciousness trying to make sense of this whole thing . even me and you right now are like synapses firing in a huge brain right now trying to imagine two sides of this coin . but yeah whatever man , blow jobs and garbage , everything is nothing , and we may as well just fuck the earth to death because it ' s gonna happen eventually , right ?
   (ID: cb830ff94bb369e5db655e15ee074f392a52c14f)

11. my initial reaction to this was anger and confusion which means i can learn from it if i try to understand you calmly . please expand on why you feel wealth inequality to not be bad .
   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

12. so tell me child . how much joy do you get out of this ? and it seems as though you ' ve forgotten there is a world outside of america . where left and right wings protest peacefully , intellectually an through many generations . you seem , perspectively through your comments on this thread alone . like nothing more than an imbecile , a child , an idiot . i hope you come to learn one day that there are benefits to all sides of the political compass . and if your narrow . you ' ll only lead to a narrow mid which in all cases . is simply , useless . good day
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

13. really ? you feel the need for personal attacks because i disagree with you ? well , how about you try understanding the sentence before you attack someone . let me help you " it ' s exactly why i oppose tax hikes right now "
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

14. then what is the joke
   (ID: 4ae54d4dcad6354406284af9bc07ffc708ce92a2)

15. i mean if the government told me it was to help stop a world wide war and you weren  t going to get hurt and you believed them ? bull crap jumping on a bus hurts you and other things don  t and are debatable whether it  s a bad thing . that  s why i always hated that compassion that parents like to do . theres a difference between hitting someone because they told you to and jumping in front of a buss . for example in middle school once we were allowed to walk around by a teacher in the classroom this is important and a guy was pinching me and was chasing me so i kept walking away and he kept walking faster and so i ran and got in trouble . but would you really say did i deserve to take the blame for running ? look at it from the women  s point of view . if all of society and every authority figure told you your life and that of everyone you care about is in danger and the only thing you can do to help is hand out a feather . you would do it ! you gotta understand the whole context and the thing being done and the relative morality of it . individuals are not always responsible for there actions . there are always factors involved that take away the choice .
   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

16. never asked for your pity fuck face nor did i ever suggest i was a good guy you did suggest however that i was a bad guy . blindly follow orders ? really guy are you for real ? there is a fucking huge difference between blindly following orders and doing a fucking job without bitching like a pampered millennial cum dumpster . i ' m sick of asshats like you making assumptions about the intentions of a fucking soldiers enlistment . my job pointless i ' m pretty sure quite a few families would be proud to know their lives are pointless . maybe we shouldn ' t be there but people are being killed but that doesn ' t matter to you because they are not americans right ? so me stopping tali from murdering husbands raping wives and kidnaping children and turning them into sex slaves is pointless ? irregardless of why i was sent there in the first place it ' s still pointless because it ' s not your family . ok thanks for the clarification .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

17. i ' m confused on your stance on racism . in another comment you claim you were denied into a committee of sorts based on you being white . so you understand what racism is . yet you make a statement like only asians and jews are good at math . sounds to me like you ' re delusional . a stereotype is formed from ignorance and ignorance comes from not understanding or not wanting to understand  which fuels racism . so unless there was a misunderstanding , i think you and i have different definitions of what racism actually is .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

18. except for my very first post where i said lgbtqwhatever , because that  s what those napoleons like to be called , please , show another one of my post , where i was arguing ? i simply stated what i strongly and firmly believe . now back to people , who like to suck dicks , being fuk in the ass , licking each other  i don  t care what they like to be called and what they think they are . they are mentally ill people to me . i could make myself more clear .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

19. if the worst thing a person can do is kill another person , there is something inherently wrong in our government doing that same thing .
   (ID: fa9acab3fbd86b1f64e6380ef31b49912dae0c74)

20. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
