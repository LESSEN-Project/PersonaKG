2. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .

3. sounds a lot like my story , honestly . your best bet is to talk to her about it . don ' t do what i did and hide it , it ' ll probably come back . digit divorces , digit years old , a ton of self esteem issues later and i ' m just starting the transition process now .

4. what she is doing does not seem particularly troublesome . i mean it just seems like she is changing in ways that are really freaking you out . from what you have said i would let it slide as long as he isn ' t violent , extorting money or raping her . i mean as long as she is happy and not getting hurt right ?

5. wow ! y  all need to calm the fuck down sunshine . your old man obviously just wants the best for you and for you to do your best . that comes from love . not hate . recognise that and be thankful you still have a father . there are a lot of people that don  t .

6. move out . do you know how many people have problems like this because they live together first ? he has no incentive to marry you . you ' re probably sleeping together and living exactly like you ' re married . so either you need to take all those privileges and perks away to motivate him or let go of being sensitive . not trying to be harsh . but you got yourself in a pickle here . honestly ask yourself if you ' re in his shoes , why should you go through the risk and trouble of getting married when you can have what you want ? why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free ? old saying

7. i suppose i have some perspective in a way from your girlfriends point of view as i think my girlfriend has similer feelings as i ' m still close friends with a guy i slept with the guy and i where friends long before i should add and it was a one time thing i know it kinda makes her uncomfortable so i try to take in to consideration her feelings about hanging out with him such as i would be with him alone but shes okayish with it because she trusts me .   x200b  so i guess what im saying in your gf case she must feel pressured by her ex into keeping contact and feels terrible about it , i say just try and support her as dealing with abusive ex partners can be a rough experience
   (ID: 77ab4860c32a7084ca81fd91302df6690ce56731)

8. nta  i mean it is a dick move to break up over text that way especially while someone  s deployed . however , i don  t think that matters given that he was an abuser and a deployment would give you a chance to leave him without him reacting violently , not letting you , etc . his reaction of threatening to hunt you down says everything about him , what  s he going to do ? beat you ? kill you ? you don  t need such a horrible man in your life . maybe it  d have been more respectful to do it over video or phone i guess but that also just would have opened you to more abusive traumatizing behavior from him , probably would have been worse to hear it in those ways rather than text anyway . i  m sorry for what you  ve gone thru and the decisions you  ve had to make here . as for your friend , does she know how he  s treated you ?
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

9. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .

10. admitting there is a problem is hard . fixing it even harder . your kids are likely in school full time . perhaps there is a way that you can find an after school program instead of a daycare . or , a dayhome . an hour or two in the afternoons probably won ' t affect your children negatively as a they are more connected to you by this age and can identify right from wrong and tell you , and b an after school program is guided by professional people and c less costly than full time care . i am a mom to a half day kindergartener digit and a digit mornings a week preschooler digit . i would need to find evening or weekend work to save myself from childcare costs being enormous , so i choose to wait until they are schooled full time . do you have any flexibility with your job ? perhaps you could drop off and pick up and return to work if necessary when she returns home . i ' m getting off track . i can ' t think of anything you ' re doing that isn ' t gentle , kind or thoughtful and coming from a place of love . i know my husband works long hours for our benefit and i appreciate the hell out of him for it . you are a good person and it sounds like she does need help in the form of a doctor or counselling for ppd . just keep coming from a place of love when you tell her you miss your partner in crime and that you want her to be happy , and all that growing old together stuff . i would beg and plead with my husband to come to counselling with me if i thought he needed it , but if that ' s likely to make her angry i just don ' t know . maybe if you guys are close with her family you can discreetly discuss with a trusted family member that you are worried . maybe they are worried too .

11. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers

12. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart

13. i understand this so much . i ' ve still got attachment disorder , and when i was younger i was always sort of happy that i didn ' t trust anyone . it made me feel like i had a superpower . never trusted anyone , and never expected anything beyond the worst possible reality from any situation or outcome . i built this huge protective wall around myself . now , at digit  something , i miss the human interaction of plain ol ' friendship . i even hold my husband at arm ' s length because there ' s still this part of me that refuses all attempts at real intimacy . and therapy is ok  i can at least tell my therapist about my ' trust issues ' , but i don ' t think i ' m capable of being ' cured ' .

14. i would recommend advice for this , but i ' ll try to help as well anyway i think you ' re just friends by convenience . you ' re on the same team , you live near each other and give each other lifts , but beyond that , he has better friends and you don ' t . i ' ve been in that situation , there ' s not much you can do except to to find other , better friends , and accept that that ' s where your relationship is at . if you ' re scared to do things around him , find other friends and don ' t value his opinion of you so highly , that way if he does judge you , who cares ? as a rule , if a friend makes you feel uncomfortable in some way when you ' re around them , get out , find a better person to spend your time with   x200b    x200b

15. hey , first off , i wanna thank you for being real with how you feel . and congrats to losing 90lbs , that ' s absolutley insane ! the first thing i thought of was the concept of " stinkin thinkin " and how our mind sometimes plays sick games on us by saying we are " not good enough " in reference to tinder , , , anyone can make a profile so why would you deny yourself the opportunity to have one if you want one and try it . you may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome . but it starts with you making one and knowing that if others can have it , you can too . also youre so young that you can bounce outta this mindset . first i would take your chance on the girl you want . ask her to the gym or something , and if that doesnt work , go in on the tinder and try what have you got to lose ? nothin , but a mindset that needs updated . im sorry if thats harsh because i do empathize feeling that way , because ive been there but ive found the way out too by putting one foot in front of the other and takin that chance with a girl . i believe in you bruddah

16. feels like a one side of the story . i could see how you weren ' t one that missed an opportunity to point out in the last digit . digit years to tell john he ' s a loser as often as he said you ' re a drone . i can ' t imagine someone would constantly harass you like that without anything coming back . but if he ' s truly the only " bad guy " in your stories , which i kinda doubt , then your reaction would be more justifiable . however , it was still incredibly childish and a dick move . just talk about the issue you have with him like an adult ffs . you guys are 27yo  is it so hard to talk about how you don ' t think it ' s productive to constantly harass each other ? what ' s the point ? and if he continues to be a child about then talk to your friends about it in a way  " look , i respect and want to support john in what he ' s doing and wish him all the success in the world  however he can ' t stop harassing me for what i am doing and is very insultive about my way of life  i don ' t see any other option than not interact with him anymore because he can ' t be an adult about the situation  then see what they have to say  might suggest . do that than rather making a fool out of yourself and completely escalate the situation in a childish way in front of your whole social circle .

17. the first thing you do is sop pestering her about how she feels . yes , you didn ' t tell her . yes , she found out and is pissed off . but this is a forgivable offense . as long as you stopped sleeping with your roommate before you entered the relationship with your current girlfriend you have nothing to worry about . trust me , the more you apologize the madder and more distant she is going to become . i have learned this the hard way because i ' ve been in your place with a similar situation . you already apologized profusely . do not contact her until she has dealt with her emotions and is ready to talk to you about this . patience is what you need now , not another angle on how to apologize even more profusely .

18. i just don ' t understand those women who absolutely want to keep a child without informing the father , want to be an alone and independant moment and then change their mind . that ' s a hard situation for you . does your ex have a bf ? i think you should take your time to swallow the pill , now you ' re a father and you have to accept that . then maybe learn to know ben , what he likes , spend some time with him . does your ex live near from you ?

19. thank you for your comment , you  ve made a lot of sense to me . it  s like a switch gets flipped whenever i begin to think about doing something for me . study , art , meditation , even my last therapy session i struggled to keep myself present and awake . having been in therapy for a year now , my therapist has only recently begun talking about dealing with my cptsd so i  ve got a long way to go . hopefully i can begin unpacking my terrible coping mechanisms soon because they really are disabling in so many ways .

20. " sucking it up " is a bad phrase to use imo . idk your life , but " accept " is a word that works for me . i am me , the world is the world . if you ' ve been sheltered , use every experience as a lesson that helps guide you in your journey exploring the world . going back to your bad trip , personally i think it ' s your body trying to tell you something . we have amazing , intuitive instincts that are buried within us but we ' re afraid when they try to tell us something . even if it ' s scary , you have to embrace what you feel so that you can get to know yourself a little better . baby steps are absolutely ok for this process .
