2. oh , wow . my spouse has so many little weird things that drive him over the edge that i wish he would stop . for example , if i want to go to a restaurant later in the evening and that restaurant is going to close in less than digit minutes , he will not go in . he will freak out , he ' ll get angry , he ' ll do anything but set foot into a place that won ' t be open for another hour . he also insists on being early  " on time " for things that we don ' t need to be early to and things that no one is on time for like , the party starts at digit , he wants to be there at digit , even though we know there will be no one there til digit and we ' ll have to spend digit hours sitting there making awkward small talk with the host and their best friend and who didn ' t expect anyone to show up so early . the really big one right now is that he ' s developed all these weird anxieties around sex and would prefer for me to have it with other people rather than freak him out about it . that ' s the biggest thing that i wish we could just do naturally .

   (ID: 7008f149db59fea91167255eafa8bc84beab0f01)

4. i think it  s pretty obvious that they have grown to a point that they need to follow the money . you can  t blame them but for every single feature that doesn  t drive revenue requires capital . with plex pad not being essential for all users , they literally have a zero rmr driving product that said , you can  t expect endless resources to come from nowhere . the options are   people pay more for what they get to allow them to ease up on other methods of generating revenue  let them get some revenue driving streams so they can soon offer the features they likely need money to develop .  or digit , find something better . right now , they are not as customer hungry as they are capital hungry so they gotta do what they gotta do this is all simply my opinion on all the recent whining about not getting what people want . it  s still leaps and bounds ahead of anything out there
   (ID: 237175707a16a7382ac8130de85ed85b63dc9442)
