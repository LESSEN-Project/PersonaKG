1. you know you don  t have to follow a guide right ? one thing about majority of the players playing this game is that they don  t bother to adapt , they just mindlessly play and when something kills them , they think it  s bullshit or the build is trash .

3. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better
