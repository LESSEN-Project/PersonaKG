1. no problem . i think if you ' re doing a long term planning and you ' re not good with investments and finance , yeah they totally worth it . but in my own opinion i ' m no expert . if you just wanna deal with your saving , then nah just invest your money in a moderately safe portfolio and take it out when you ' re done .

2. ooh good point . just because something or someone has left you , there is still the emotional trauma left behind . i have no idea what that trauma would amount to when it comes to an extra sliver of someone else ' s evil soul inside another .

3. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !
