2. also , most people in the states are apolitical  depoliticized and best praxis would probably be to date them and radicalize them . we all have long and winding political developments and it ' s good to meet people where they ' re at and engage with them . this could also be applied to liberals  conservatives , but probably not with reactionaries . although you never know ! i wonder if any communists have converted a reactionary
