5. as a kid , hell . i was the youngest , so i was constantly picked on , and my parents would tell me " don ' t provoke them " even when i hadn ' t done anything . they also acted like if one of us knew something , we should all know it , even though some of us had way less experience  education than the others . and yes , parents have favorites , and it makes the others feel inferior as shit . as an adult , we stopped fighting and now it ' s like we ' re friends that will never grow distant , even if we don ' t see each other for ages .
