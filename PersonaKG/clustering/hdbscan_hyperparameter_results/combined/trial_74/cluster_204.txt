1. your knowledge or lack of knowledge is irrelevant to the question of you being an atheist . if you don ' t hold a belief in a god then you are an atheist by default . it ' s like having a car . either you have a car or you don ' t . the fact that you haven ' t decided if you want a car is irrelevant to the question of whether or not you have a car at this moment . it doesn ' t matter if you can ' t decide to get a car or not . if somebody asks you " do you have a car now ? " you dont answer " i haven ' t made up my mind " . you say yes or no . if you don ' t have a car then you just say . no because you are a non  car owner . ndgt doesn ' t have a belief in god therefore he is a non  theist , otherwise known as an atheist .
