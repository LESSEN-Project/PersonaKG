1. woodworking man . go pick up a stack of free pallets , and you can tear them down with an hour and a hammer . after that , you know you have free wood , so even if what you make is crap , it didn ' t cost a dime . make a shelf , box , whatever . if it ' s something you ' re into , it ' ll grow to making cool stuff . and if you ' re not into it , no harm no foul , didn ' t cost anything but a few basic tools if you don ' t have them hammer , drill and circular saw will handle most everything , and are cheap online  craigslist . good luck man ! hope it works out
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

2. the fear of spiders is not something humans are born with , it is something you learn . if your parents always start screaming and crying when they see spiders , you ' ll learn to think spiders are scary . dogs also don ' t have an instinctual fear of spiders , so they would have to be taught to fear them too . most dogs aren ' t afraid of spiders , so they don ' t have a born fear of them either . but i ' ve seen dogs that are afraid of spiders , and their owners are always afraid of them too , so it seems they can learn it too .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

3. watching what is happening , while they reply to our comments on here and their forum . i can ' t help but think that the money activision is forcing their hand on a lot of this . its like getting mad at a f1 driver for letting his teammate pass him on the last lap . it seems ridiculous when you ' re watching , but we don ' t hear the owner of the race team in his ear saying " if you ever want to race again , let him pass " .
   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

4. moai is the best emoji . it ' s beautiful . i love it . the point of emojis is to show emotions , but what emotion does this show ? do you just wake up in the morning and think " wow , i really feel like a massive stone today " ? yes , thats how i feel and it ' s useful . i love it . it just provokes a deep joy within me whenever i see it . i want to drive on over to the fucking emoji headquarters and create a new moai emoji just to spam it . if this was the emoji movie i ' d go watch it infinitly . people just comment moyai as if it ' s funny . it is . moai deserves to be immortal . he deserves to have his smug little stone rested forever in a sculpture . oh wow , it ' s a stone head , how hilarious , please , continue to say it , it gets my day way better . dont stop it . it deserves to get in the gate of heavens . why is it so goddamn sexy . you ' re a fucking stone , you cant be sexy they said , but it gets an erection deep in my heart and soul . i hope you live forever

6. i  ve had a friend for three years that i met online . they  re my best friend because they  ve stuck with me through my bullshit . i suck at making friends in real life though .
   (ID: 404d4f663681fcf738d043296148ae4de655b22b)

7. " riley " i ' m sorry your day turned to shit . the crappy thing about fear is that it isn ' t always rational and when caught off guard it is difficult to act rationally anyway . i had a similar experience a few years ago which helped me decide i was buying a car so i didn ' t have to wait at bus stops and i have the guy half of my land line number and the other half of my cell . to this day i wonder why i didn ' t just say no . or maybe i did and he insisted . i cast it as a lesson learned for the future . sadly he got on the same bus as me and i got got off and doubled back to another route .
   (ID: 7911b1d92de80b0e1abd4e2a29e4f762a8a2908f)

14. kid , expand your thinking . what would happen if everyone thought like you ? if banging chicks is the ultimate measure of success , we ' d probably go back to the time when sultans kept harems . women are humans , not trophies for you to ejaculate in .
   (ID: dfcca9c384a4fff7bbeb3cd1fb2f40aacb47fd7e)

16. when you got to the end of book digit , when you  know  what happens , don ' t you remember that whisper of a breath behind your shoulder and you were too scared to turn around and look ? yeah , that was them .
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

17. that sounds like it could be a feminization kink . if these fantasies are just about the bedroom then it sounds like you just have a kink . but for some people they find out they want to live full time as a woman through fetish crossdressing . i guess what i ' m saying is  it ' s totally possible you have a feminization fetish but it ' s also possible you could have other factors that lean you more towards being trans . being trans is more about the day to day life and how you and the world around you perceives you .
   (ID: 77e0b8c51dfb89ff57bd838b86ee4d78a9fe856f)

18. i ' ve been waiting for this . i love you
