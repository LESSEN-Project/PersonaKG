1. because people can sit behind a screen and not get punched in the face which is an unethical thing to do to someone who doesn  t agree with you .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

2. that still sounds like you are condrodicting yourself , someone can not be smoking hot and also be unattractive . but whatever , agree to disagree ?
   (ID: ba841e2486d1df5b5baefde5ead0636c7c03c79c)

3. i don ' t understand your point ? are you ok with having someone kick your ass for jaywalking ? if not then we can agree that vigilantism isn ' t permitted .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

4. while i agree somewhat to the fact that hispanics like to fuck . i find it a bit distasteful to say that the problem is with hispanics . not with retarted white christians . who are too dumb to realize that their children are going to fuck regardless of what they ' re told . so hey lets get them to put on a jimmiehat
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

5. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

6. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

7. i digit  agree , confidence is everything ! many times people didn  t realize how short i actually am hell , some didn  t realize i was shorter than them sometimes because i did the same made it a non  issue and where i lacked  i made up as well . the more you don  t care or act like you don  t care , the more other people will take the same attitude . i admire your attitude bro !
   (ID: 3510b342268f3bc4c3f1e402201d7c565dfb7648)

8. here is a upvote . i don ' t say you have to agree . its an opinion . i might b wrong . but unless i experience it 1st hand , i can ' t say for sure .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

9. yeah i agree with you . life is about balance . besides smoking and heavy drugs i do all those things . it ' s just objectively a bad idea .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

10. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

11. i ' m not sure where that stuff about lies propaganda and bullying came from i do agree with it tho but reason isn ' t inherently tied into things being fun or interesting , in fact fun is one of those things that we refer to as subjective , thing that may be fun to some people may be not be others there doesn ' t need to be any particular reason to enjoy anything
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

12. to be fair i used to think this . i agree that some women are not funny . however some men aren  t funny either . usually if you don  t like vagina jokes don  t watch amy schumer . she is the female equivalent to louis c . k . i do recommend you watch catherine ryan  s special on netflix for you to change your mind .
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

13. i don  t agree with this at all i  ve never struggled in skyrim . oblivion enemy scaling could be a bit annoying , but in skyrim ? what exactly do you have problems with ?
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

14. i get that , and agree with the bit about wasting police resources . what are you up to these days ? i remember your company let you go in the wake of that shitstorm .
   (ID: 6eec77fe98b9dc85ec1e5e7edc37cdb415794719)

15. i agree . even fighting should be done with respect . all fists no weapons and no kicking while the other guy is down . kicking someone in the head while they  re down is done pansyass bs . give them a chance to stand and fight like fights should be
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

16. i think bethesda will react quicker as soon as they realize is atomic shop items being duped , and they losing revenue . as of now i don  t think they give a damn . never said anything bad about game or studio before . until today . i  ll upvote this  cause i agree to the degree .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

17. could not agree more ! both yelp and tripadvisor are driving me nuts with this photos and reviews thing . maybe apple can implement a system where it controls and presents its own photos  reviews whereby third parties then fill in for missing data and countries not served ? i suspect these things will come in time , including the ones you mentioned , though apple  s methodically iterative approach sometimes does take more than a while .
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

18. i completely agree with you . the only reason i went on nofap was because i was also addicted to porn lmao . i remember seeing research on it possibly shrinking the amygdala somewhere so i looked a bit more into it and shrinking of the amygdala is correlated with brain fog  laziness  poor cognitive function  short attention span . those were all symptoms i was experiencing so that ' s why i started . though for all i know it might been have been placebo lol .
   (ID: fc02053133b0aa8d444b95ed56c24999ae82879b)

19. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

20. yta let people be the people they are and for the times they do things that you don ' t agree with let that shit go and just have fun with them .
