3. i always notice the people that say this either have a 4x4 truck or youve just been lucky on the road . i drive a semi and dont blame anyone for going slower in snow  ice conditions . if youre unsure its better to take it slow rather than making a mistake and sliding through an intersection or causing a pile up . i do understand everyone has to be somewhere but not everyone is as experienced so just take your time or leave enough time in the mornings .
