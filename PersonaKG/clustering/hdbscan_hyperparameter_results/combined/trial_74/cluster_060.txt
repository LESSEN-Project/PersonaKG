5. i think it ' s because half the time you keep talking to the wrong end . pick the side that ' s not blowing hot air , and you ' ll have a good conversation . if you do pick the wrong side , run , for it will soon be smelly .
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

6. another good strategy is to have foreknowledge of whether or not they say " shoot " at the end of the phrase , and then do the opposite of what they do to disrupt the round to give them more time to think , and generally they ' ll not choose rock since they had to think for a longer period of time , and will digit  of the time choose scissor , allowing you to choose rock and beat them .

7. i can think you should be honest with your feelings . i say with experience and to ignore or overlook it can be more destructive than anything else . if she genuinely likes you , she ' ll come back . if it ' s just the physical stuff the friendship will fizzle out . that ' s the worst part though . fwbs ruin good friendships most of the time .
