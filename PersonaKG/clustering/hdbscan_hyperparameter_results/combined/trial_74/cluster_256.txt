3. people might say , he couldve saved that money . but who actually does that ? save for 17years ? only rich people . for average people , its almost impossible to save for years and not touch that money over those years . just take that guy above as a person who smoke cigarettes for years . at least his chance with his money is to become a millionaire and not cancer .
