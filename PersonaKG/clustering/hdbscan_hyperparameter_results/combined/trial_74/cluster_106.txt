4. if you are trying to make witty comments , wear shirts that look nice , and make eye contact with other people at work , that is called socializing . if you are intimately touching , kissing , or attempting to see this person outside of work or work related functions then you are crossing a line . reassure your boyfriend about your attraction to him by telling and showing him . tell him gently and lovingly that he has no reason not to trust you , and you hope he can figure out a way to do that . then let him work on his trust issues . you are not in charge of his emotions . if he can ' t learn to trust you , a relationship evaluation is in order .
