7. mine are trash now . i ' d have to pay a ton for braces just to get them aligned properly . since teeth are finite i feel like since no matter how well i take care of them now they ' ll never be back in perfect shape , so i tend to not care as much . think how if the doctor told you your preferred arm will never have as good strength  motion as before your accident it ' s a terrible place to be .

8. although i love clannad and code geass with all of my heart . they arent flawless . and i dont think its good to keep saying to yourself that nothing will beat this anime . because then you ' re making it harder for yourself to find a really good anime . i recommend going in every anime with the thought that this could be you ' re digit  anime . this way you can enjoy more anime .
