3. i believe it . i sometimes think about spirits as the human part of the deceased that didn  t want to leave . they want to stay , for some reason . and they aren  t necessarily hostile or scary , they just have unfinished business and are hanging out until they can complete it . it appears he may have cared about you so much that he wanted to meet you before he left .

   (ID: 6eec77fe98b9dc85ec1e5e7edc37cdb415794719)

5. well i believe in god but like you , i can ' t stand fundamentalists like the woman you describe . they tell me i ' m going to hell too , and i laugh . just can ' t win . on the other hand , if you are an atheist , then you don ' t believe in either heaven or hell . so her telling you you ' re going to hell is like someone telling you canada is never going to win the super bowl . i wouldn ' t let it worry you . if want to get snarky , then remind her , hell is for atheists , and for people who fail to convince atheists to believe in god . guess i ' ll be seeing you there !

   (ID: 45768598053a5b3cdf1e6e286b99114b7acf5f3c)

7. after reading a lot of mmo forums and seeing a lot of crazy things yes , i do believe he was serious . if you think people don ' t have that viewpoint , you should put aside your own bias .
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

8. i like how you have nothing to do in your life except type insanely long answers to a random persons question . does it honestly matter to you what i think and believe in ?
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

   (ID: 2e2a44cdfc726423ec202a2fe420543af441d1ad)

10. not a great living but definitely a lot better . you do realize that mose of europe believes in a livable wage , not a minimum at least in the uk i know they do . i believe you are the one with a skewed perception . you grow up hearing " america number digit " so much that you believe it . since you like to throw your own heat , allow me to retort . from your post history i ' d assume you lack a level of empathy considering you told one person they are in america because nobody else would hire them , and your first comment ever is able not being able to love your own child because it ' s disabled . if you want to continue to sling mud at my heritage and mentality go ahead . i ' m not the one who got offended about a simple joke .
   (ID: 7008f149db59fea91167255eafa8bc84beab0f01)

11. i absolutely agree . i can ' t believe we as the people simply allow ourselves to be taken advantage of like this

   (ID: 840f5d9bddf24e024b9a70f13cdde62d41604e77)

13. my uncle said all pot smokers smoke menthol cigarettes . he also blames poor modern family dynamics are because of pot . my grandma said pot smokers are bad people , lazy , and can  t believe we  re all able to vote about it now . so i asked them what went wrong when they tried it . neither of them have ever tried it so i told them anything they think is invalid and it started this huge fiasco
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

14. imo when you say you believe in something , you stand up for it even when it doesn ' t benefit you . if you believe in freedom , then you have to protect people ' s freedom to do things you don ' t want to do . otherwise you were lying about valuing freedom .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

15. you don ' t have to ask for legal advice but you can ask if you have a case and that if you do have a case ask them if they have a lawyer in mind that handles that sort of shit . believe me if you were an electrician , a plumber or contractor a lawyer would ask you for advice too .
   (ID: 35eb47890f8874bbb988ec8308ba762f8377b3b8)

16. i don  t believe he would want me to feel guilty at all , but it doesn  t stop me feeling it .
   (ID: c391065478603a686531cbdd50568136a5e14508)

17. my mom explained it to me this way . santa is the spirit of the season . everyone is everyone else ' s santa . if you don ' t believe in the spirit of the holiday then you ' re killing the holiday .

   (ID: bd42a28607025a98ff2c7df361f815aea9ee3ea9)

19. how the hell is a thin cloth supposed to save you from oc spray and tear gas ? like i ain ' t trying to take sides here , but this argument is dumb , do you genuinely believe that will work ? these kids cover their faces out of the sheer edginess of larping as revolutionaries in the street , like antifa and the like , let ' s not bullshit ourselves here .
   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)

20. yeah , show people blackadder or a bit of fry and laurie and they can ' t believe it ' s the same guy .
