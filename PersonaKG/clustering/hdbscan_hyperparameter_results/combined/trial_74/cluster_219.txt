3. then you really are as stupid as i suggested at the outset . they are completely accurate and they are about digit times more useful than your nonsense because they ' re the meat and potatoes and nobody gives a shit if you could add digit tomes of ands , ifs , or buts to them . " meat " is not a complete description of steak and " vegetables " is not a complete description of salad but those are the main points you think of when you see steak or salad on a menu and an adequate description of the difference between them for you to decide you feel like having one a lot more than the other . and all i asked you , was the difference between autism steak and retard salad .

4. is there one of these for the extra deck ? sometimes i feel like digit cards is just one to few , and theres so much nuance in deciding how many copies to run in the extra .

5. strong story and a solid world is all i want , took a chance to play battlefront digit recently and while it plays well and everyone is dressed up like they ' re in star wars , it doesn ' t feel like star wars

6. was just looking at shaw ' s performance in the under digit if that ' s any indicator . of course they are wholly different levels but still i feel he deserves a chance
