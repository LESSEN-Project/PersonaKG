1. honestly this was the first avengers movie i have seen ive seen some marvel movies like black panther and ant man but i still loved it . the plot was easy to follow if you had a general idea of what happened in infinity war and i guess it helps that i knew the ending of ant man and the wasp . i feel like the time travel was a bit far fetched but it made for an interesting story anyway . i was surprised that one of the first things that happened was them killing thanos , i thought they would be chasing him the whole film to find the stones . and despite minor things unrelated to the movie like people dropping shit constantly and a phone goimg off i liked it .

2. you can try . but engineering is hard , it can be really frustrating when you don ' t understand something . i ' d tell you to get a teacher , but you can certainly try to do that on your own . who knows , it might work . you ' re doing something really challenging . be prepared to be frustrated , but be patient and persistent .

9. i ' m not arguing over whether or not it ' s started  i ' m saying that people who have had the dignity of hard work taken away from them represent a powder keg . is that inevitable ? i don ' t know . there are plenty of well  connected individuals with good ideas  bill gates said something about taxing robots , others say universal basic income . my dad says we teach people to become technicians . but i can guess it won ' t be a digit  digit ratio of human technician to robot anyways .

18. my wife and i began this morning and though we know it will get tough , we were so happy with this breakfast ! i ' ve been a sugar addict all of my adult life and indulge in way too much fast food . my wife said she would do it with me to make it easier and i ' m determined to see this through . just made the spaghetti squash with the tomato sauce and some ground turkey for dinner . if we can keep making food this good it will certainly ease the pain of not indulging my bad habits .

19. i think maybe he ' s referring to the fact that in the rpg rules , sponsored magic is something you choose whether or not to use , and you take debt every time you do . in the novels , pretty much all of harry ' s spells were enhanced with hellfire involuntarily the whole time lash was in his head .
