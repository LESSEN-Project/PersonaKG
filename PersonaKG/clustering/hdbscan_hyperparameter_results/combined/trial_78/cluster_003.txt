1. you  re so strong for making the decision you did though , just remember that . you  re worth so much more than the way he was treating you and you knew that  i hope you realise how amazing that is . so many people haven  t got as far as you have face  blowing  a  kiss
   (ID: 726d5aaac9472ccdcb64345cd6d082bee4eae6fa)

2. life ain ' t what you think it is . find an older person you trust and listen .
   (ID: ae0b5b35ef79984eec810d26abc05e9a757ae0ca)

3. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

4. you need to be assertive about this . the template for an assertive statement is " i feel  when you do   , and i wish you would    " in this situation you could say " i feel sad or maybe uncherished , neglected , abandoned , or lonely ? when you don ' t get to know my family , and i would like you to come to thanksgiving dinner and talk to them " please learn this and use it . it must be said calmly and conversationally without expectation of changing his behavior . you are clearly stating your emotions and the behaviour of your ideal mate . if he still refuses to change his behavior , then you should decide if you can visit your family without him for the rest of your life .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

5. i feel your pain . i was told a week ago that my wife has wanted a divorce for over a year . it hurts like hell when one minute you think your life and relationship are going well then the next minute you find out your partner does not want you anymore . it no doubt crushes your world . and i know what you are thinking and feeling . everyone keeps telling you the same things , and they are the right things but you don  t want to hear . you believe that there has to be someway to stop this and correct , but we can  t . the heart loves , hurts , grows and loves again . we just can  t control it . so good luck with your situation , we both know our lives will get better in time . take care .
   (ID: 3cd64a42c43aaba8bcfe70482cd19250f58de2f0)

6. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

7. i feel like you don  t really have a right to be angry at her in that regard since as you even said you cheated on her digit times due to bad friends so why would she not be concerned about you going out doing certain things ? in this case i think it  d be healthier to break up so that you can use the lessons you learned in a new relationship where there  s not so much trauma to undo . you  re a better man now , you won  t do the shitty things you did in this relationship again , but getting your gf to trust you completely again will be at best a monumental task , at worst impossible . if you don  t wanna go through with all that entails , then i  d really recommend breaking up .
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

8. tell him and see his reaction . if he is such a great man that wants to be with you , he should have no problem sticking up for you and making sure his family understands that that behavior will cease . if he reacts in their defense and does nothing , you know it  s not worth pursuing . mommas boys are a serious no  no for me , good luck .
   (ID: f18b19a52bbf1505af84d01563a51626d4ae363f)

9. i know you guys are gonna tell not be with someone who i can ' t trust you ' re goddamn right .  but hear me out . maybe we ' re just doing something wrong ? mmmm nope . you shouldn ' t date someone you can ' t trust .  i just wanna fucking know who she ' s talking to lol . bit controlling but okay . ask her if its that big of a deal .
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

10. a few things . clean your room . exercise every day . eat a non inflammatory diet . lots of veggies , legumes , lean meats , nuts with few carbs and no bread . take adaptogens like ashwaganda and rhodiola rosea to combat depression , anxiety and enhance cognition . meditate digit  digit minutes a day take a lot of initiative to contact people . work hard on yourself to be better groomed , behaved , mindful , successful or generous . fix your inner dialogue so your inner voice is more friendly and affirming and guides you to do things that you benefit from and allows you to move on from your mistakes .
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

11. honestly yeah i think you ' re kind of an asshole . men are always much more likely to leave their significant others due to illness  here we go , another example of it . like the girl you ' re meant to love could have something terribly wrong with her and you ' re out here just thinking about yourself and any future  key word future  kids ? come on dude . if you do break up with her because of this , i want you to look her dead in the eye and say " i can ' t deal with you being sick , and that ' s why i ' m leaving you "
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

12. you should never look at sex as something that needs to be done just to say you did it . ask anyone that ' s been married to the love of their life , they ' ll tell you they wish they waited . its not that you can ' t because of anxiety , its just that it isn ' t the right time . there are no such things as missed opportunities because when you meet the person of your dreams , you will never let then go and vise versa with or without anxiety . those aren ' t friends , they are just cliche douche bags and it probably burns when they piss . fuck em , because the kind of anxiety you get from meeting someone new is something you learn to cope with . the anxiety you get induced from people you already know , you are stuck with .

13. i know this sounds like a standard answer giving to everyone , but i know that its the best way . i know that because i also was in that position when you have lost so many of your friends , that there is no place to start , to regain them . put yourself out there , and with out there i mean really into the world of the people you want to befriend . when i needed a friend to go to parties with , i needed to go out alone , to find those with similar interest . and is definitely not so hard when you start building up confidence to go up ro people . most people don ' t have a reason to approach you when already having their social circle , so there is no was around for you to just start randomly talking with people that think may be symphatic . nearly all of the people i started talking to reacted super positve on that behavior . some may find it strange at first , same stick to that attitude and evem some of them will become your friensy

14. death is never the answer . i am so sorry you are feeling this way . the best of us know exactly what your feeling . but look at it this way alot of the greatest people in the world make huge mistake in there life and it makes them the great person they are . you can be a great happy person you just have to fight through the sorrow and find things that make you happy . i wish you well ! you are never truly alonered  heart

15. i don ' t know about the falling in love and all that . but if you ' re looking for advice take it from someone digit years older than you . forget about her . don ' t even think about it anymore . you ' re young as fuck and there ' s plenty of women out there . and don ' t fall in love .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

16. i thank you for you share , if you don  t mind , my opinion is that you hop off the medication . you did what you had to do for the greatest good . everything that happens has positive and negative outcomes and there  s always going to be someone that cause them , if it was you or anyone else it would  ve still happened . gladly here , the good heavily outweighed the bad . don  t blame yourself . things had to be done and time will pass , i wish you the best .
   (ID: a77a8bcaa391d8b6584d32e6ad243e71297d7258)

17. i was a full blown alcoholic , who treated my friendships as transactional relationships and always had a reason why it wasn  t totally my fault some terrible thing had happened to me or that i had done something shitty to someone else . everyone , including me , was a victim of circumstance and anyone in my position would have done what i did . i got sober over digit years ago , sorted out a bunch of my shit , tried to make up my past transgressions to other people and barring the ability to take direct responsibility for those things , am just trying to live my life better . sometimes i get hung up on what i used to be like , but , can also step back enough to recognize that i can  t redo any of that time in my life and just try to be my best self now . i think past me did some shitty stuff , but , that doesn  t make me a shitty person through and through . i don  t think you can hate yourself into making or maintaining positive changes in your life . present me learned a lot through that experience and especially through getting sober . hopefully , i  ll continue to grow more , keep working on being the best version of myself and , if presented the opportunity , can help others who have similar life experiences .
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

18. i think the best thing to do here is communication with all the parties involved . make sure everyone knows what happened and they don  t see the story from one side . when shit goes down and i need to just talk to them to make sure they don  t hate me or something i usually start it off with ,  now you don  t have to talk or respond but all i need you to do is listen , then you can make your own judgment , insert story here .  i think it  s important to let the other person know hat they have control of what they think and know that you feel bad . explain fully that you were drunk and have no recollection of the event . apologize profoundly and shit . but i don  t know if you want to take my advice fully . i  m just some shit 15yo white boy . i don  t drink or do drugs or anything but my father is an alcoholic so i know a thing or two about drinking . just apologize and explain your side , of they still hate you well tough shit .
   (ID: f270f54ee5a501d23ceae23084513e682d0cfd32)

19. just do what i do , keep telling yourself you can  t live forever .
   (ID: a6171234e1a4ec65a39ad55aa0aa058eb98dff83)

20. if you can ' t let it go and move on , you ' re not honourable . just grow up and move on . seriously , it ' s pathetic that you ' re even putting any of this . be it a joke or not .
