--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 173

1. i add comments instead of editing , because i doubt people will re  read my comment . worried , maybe not , but you were the one who wouldn ' t take my word for it . sources dont usually help people that already have their minds made up .
   (ID: d8014467041b98317d9f1dec2b0dae4ff9405b91)

2. lmao how pretentious are you ? you write like a child found a thesaurus and thought it would make him cool . i understand the historical context . slavery wasn  t ok , slavery doesn  t justify genocide . white people were awful  brutalized slaves , doesn  t mean you should go and murder everyone with a drop of european blood . but sure , go ahead pretending you  re smarter than everyone else  justifying genocide , bud .
   (ID: 280643182527d573e119c7952a08fea10d62edd8)

3. you proved my point . you have no reason to hate america  americans . we have good terms with nz and you haven  t lived here , meaning you have no clue what it is like .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

4. i ' ve heard some stupid quotes , but that one is particularly bad . wtf do you think laws do , other than trade liberty for safety ? also you ' re making claims about about the science of vaccines and herd immunity , but you don ' t even attempt to explain anything , let alone back your points up with evidence .
   (ID: f114f40c03e5812464be61882b264a0abe2a545e)

5. going to get a lot of shit for this , but i think this is the same type of argument you would have with your son  daughter about getting transgender reassignment surgery . the " i feel " argument is so crushing that you just want to shake the person and say " no , you are wrong . that is not who you are ! " she doesn ' t have cancer and you cannot have babies just because you turn your penis outside  in .
   (ID: 306fcce176e83db604dac17838eed1e669cd5a90)

6. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

7. i use this subreddit for fun . this topic wasn ' t marked serious . if people want to overanalyze a comment , that ' s up to them .
   (ID: 68698bd86019a86cb34a8b2e28c6324727011b28)

8. how can you speak for someone else regarding their own intentions ? for arguments sake , let ' s say that i thought the two bombs were a step too far , does that make me anti  western ?
   (ID: f8771fc63bc4c52bb04b2e71d4aefe7bf406c65c)

9. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

10. i  m arguing because you say stupid things and can  t accept the fact that your post is not fun , smart , or helpful . you argue like a child and need to learn that not everything you say matters . you don  t want to argue , don  t respond . your the one who posted a garbage post with moron comments . you get off reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

11. and you ' re the type of person who thinks so highly of themselves they can ' t even understand a simple joke . get your head out of your ass .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

12. but that ' s not actually what ' s happening , you are writing hypothetical fiction at this point . suppose in your hatred of trump supporters you become a murdering psuedo  vigilante who kills trump supporters . you should be banned from reddit you murderer ! you should be in prison ! see , anyone can do it . and my point with that example is that you are really going to say that a good father and successful mechanical engineer is " piece of garbage " just because of who he voted for ? give me a break . to be fair , though , washington dc is just a corrupt city in general , it ' s not just trump , although he is probably among the worse . nonetheless , the whole city is owned by corporate donors , e . g . the koch brothers . at least it ' s not as corrupt as it used to be in the gilded age , boss tweed era .

13. i haven ' t told what you can and can ' t find funny , i ' ve told you what is innapropriate to say , there ' s a difference . when i said it was a joke , you said this  " no , it ' s not . jokes are meant to be funny to more people than just you . " sure you might not be saying that i didn ' t find it funny , but you were saying that no one else finds it funny . which is wrong . you are wrong .  my actions here were mostlt for the benefit of the op . you ' re words most likely bothered them in a big way , and as well as wanting to stand up to someone behaving like you did , i also wanted to show the op that someone would stand up for them and hopefully counter how you made them feel . a person on the internet who is mature enough will understand that most people will be sarcastic when given the chance . especially since he didn ' t put a " serious " tag on his post . my comment was very much clearly a joke , made obvious by the exclamation point . the fact that you got so triggered by it just highlights your immaturity and inability to recognise jokes on the internet . you might find that this flaw , this cluelessness to social cues , is one of the reasons you were bullied .  think what you want of my actions , i feel like i did the right thing . you didn ' t do anything wrong . you are just acting like a stuck up bitch . you ' re like that one person that always takes a joke seriously , gets offended because it isn ' t a " clean joke " and complains about it while other people just laugh .  and well done for admitting you made a dick move , most people don ' t have the balls to go back and admit a mistake . no need to congratulate me on something everyone like me will do , this is just showing how naive you are . there is no mistake , there never was a single mistake . i am a dick . people like me will always admit to acting like a dick . why do you think i do the things i do ? i ' m not oblivious like you .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

14. i see your point . i think it is safe to say that for the most part " they don ' t even know any better . ' they ' meaning everyone  rich , poor , middle .
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

15. i should have written my comment more carefully . that ' s not what i meant at all . i don ' t think my point came across . i hate microtransactions just as much as anyone else . and i ' m sure game devs do too . my point is game designers don ' t deserve to be harassed on social media when it ' s the suits at the top who make these business decisions . game designers are employees just like anyone else and it ' s not their fault that the game has microtransactions .
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

16. fuck sakes of course i ' m generalizing . if the shoe fits , wear it . if it doesn ' t then move along , it doesn ' t apply to you . jesus christ , you can ' t say i ' m wrong . you just don ' t like the tone i used . this sub got an inflow of tone police lately . sorry my vocabulary isn ' t up to your standards but don ' t take it personally . i ' m not some women hater , i made a joke to the wrong audience apparently . take it easy .
   (ID: dceaf5128ce079240dc5048df74d704163edc3a5)

17. are you trolling me ? this is the second of my post that you  ve said something negative and shitty .
   (ID: 05bc4f6f6f6bb573d85181292f88efbd50c59547)

18. this is an obvious joke
   (ID: c418fa452eafbca022ce1c49b521d4574aa77cd1)

19. lol ad hominems are a sign that you ' re triggered . calm down and see it for what it is , humor . if you cannot i certainly can ' t help you . i ' m not going to respond to you after this reply you ' ll just have to stew in your misguided anger . have a great day smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

20. i mean if the government told me it was to help stop a world wide war and you weren  t going to get hurt and you believed them ? bull crap jumping on a bus hurts you and other things don  t and are debatable whether it  s a bad thing . that  s why i always hated that compassion that parents like to do . theres a difference between hitting someone because they told you to and jumping in front of a buss . for example in middle school once we were allowed to walk around by a teacher in the classroom this is important and a guy was pinching me and was chasing me so i kept walking away and he kept walking faster and so i ran and got in trouble . but would you really say did i deserve to take the blame for running ? look at it from the women  s point of view . if all of society and every authority figure told you your life and that of everyone you care about is in danger and the only thing you can do to help is hand out a feather . you would do it ! you gotta understand the whole context and the thing being done and the relative morality of it . individuals are not always responsible for there actions . there are always factors involved that take away the choice .
