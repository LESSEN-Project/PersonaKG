8. you  re making it seem that everyone who plays video games or anything like that is a lowlife piece of shit , my dad  s an avid gamer , is about 240lbs and could probably bench press about 250lbs , i  m not that far behind him and i play video games as well . maybe don  t generalize when you say that every gamer is lazy or is weak . and the reason that men don  t think that women should get it into their minds that hitting a man is okay is because , what if that man retaliates ? the woman could die , and it  s hard sometimes not to fight back , especially if it  s really bothering you . men don  t like to feel pain , neither do women , so why benefit one at the other  s expense ? double standards are bullshit .

   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

19. i ' ve thought about it a lot and i can only think of a few situations where i could be totally sure i wouldn ' t get caught , and they ' re pretty far fetched , so i control myself because i don ' t want to risk it .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)
