10. but my point wasn ' t that . this is literally not a part of islam . yes a woman has to dress modestly but dressing like that is for horny men that cannot control themselves . personally i respect all women decided covering their hair but this . sorry but this is not islam . this is straight up misogyny . you can dress modest without turning into a fuckin ninja . and you ' d be surprised how many " muslim " women take advantage of dressing like that . i can link a lot of articles from turkey where a woman dressed like that committed a crime

14. sorry for your loss . are you of the same height as the other carriers ? could be a practical reason why not . i know it ' s meant to be an honour but if you can ' t face it , then might be worth having a word with the person organising the funeral . what is it that ' s worrying you about it ? too emotional , worried you might mess up , or something else ?
