2. different people react in different ways , dude . not everyone goes right to fight mode , and that ' s probably a good thing for humanity . the only bad thing in the video is the people doing this to her .
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

3. so my cat , franki , recently came down with a pretty severe stomach virus . the vet gave me some anti biotic drops to put in his food but when i  d do that franki wouldn  t touch it . so , the vet suggested using a small dropper tube to insert the medicine directly into his anus . the first time was absolute hell , my cat fought me the whole time but once the tube was in and the medicine pushed out he seemed to calm quite a bit . well the next day he was acting strange , he has always been an independent cat , rarely coming around , never wanting to be held , but as i sat on the couch he started walking back and forth meowing and rubbing my leg . he then went and jumped up on the table where we  d done the application the night before and meowed louder and louder until i decided i guess we will go ahead and do the medicine treatment . this time he didn  t fight me though , and when i inserted the tube he closed his eyes , stretched his neck , and let out a noise that can only be described as a moan of pure ecstasy . maybe the medicine made him feel better , i supposed . that night he slept on my bed curled up right next to me , which he had never done before . for the next week he  d do the same thing every day , meow on the table until he got his  fix  . but then the medicine ran out . even though i had no medicine he  d still cry and beg for it , i thought maybe if i insert it without medicine he will realize it doesn  t make him feel better anymore and forget about it . well that was digit weeks ago and he is only getting worse . he walks around me all day with his tail up presenting his rectum and trying to entice me . he is demanding insertions more and more often . yesterday i caught him looking longingly at the turkey baster . when i sit he jumps in my lap purring and rubbing me affectionately . it was then in horror i realized my cat thinks i  m his gay lover , and that i  ve been sexually pleasing him for weeks now . needless to say the sexual tension between us is palpable . how do i let my cat know that i  m not gay , but still like him as a friend ?

4. kim kardashian . i dont think she has said or done anything to hate her . i think that her family have a succesfull business and know how to manage it and i never saw them make a scandal appart from kim ' s sextape . the only annoying thing is how much attention they get but thats thanks to media and people bitching for why are they famous every single day .

5. doesn ' t the poop emoji exist because the japanese word poop is similar to the word for luck ? like the emoji is for good luck ? it started out as a joke because people thought it was random to have an emoji for poop , but i think people have taken it too far . also , i hate how prevalent gross out humor is , it ' s honestly really annoying .

9. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him

   (ID: cc15a2c089fadf84b135f1f61f9666baac04a6e3)

17. there are a lot of people against anti  gun laws , and as long as there ' s a big population of those people , many of whom are senators and representatives in the government , gun referendums will be very hard to pass . gun laws are very historically significant in america as well . think tradition . people are adamant that our country began , and is based on , things like freedom of speech , freedom of religion , etc . , and for some reason freedom to bear arms is included in people ' s opinions of what the united states is founded on too . but perhaps the main reason is that many people in america have very strong arguments for guns . some of which are the strength of the illegal gun trade , the inability to protect oneself , the rights to hunting , and the big one  that we are a different country than europe with different cultural environments that necessitate the right to bear arms . whether agreed with or not , and whether or not they can be debated against , these arguments are still valid and strong , and as long as there are strong arguments there will be strong opposition to a referendum  even if the arguments opposing it are just as strong if not stronger .
   (ID: ecce6e894db30f245f1073ca0e270a3bb87eaa71)

18. ehh no that  s not quite what i  m getting at , i know what you  re talking about . like someone looking off in the distance or distracted while talking , that  s not what i  m referring to . i  ve seen several people who talk with their eyes closed , like speak full sentences with their eyes closed . or they look up while their face is facing you . it sounds bizarre but if you know what i mean then i bet you agree it  s annoying . idk why people do it . some strange social phobia maybe
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

19. for sure , it ' s always much easier said than done . it ' s the same for every person in the world that has an insecurity that can be seen by people . it ' s tough has hell , but trying to think " i ' ll never see that person again anyway " , really can help . as long as you have close friends and family who love and care for you , regardless of how you look or feel , that ' s all that really matters

20. man , this post is really convenient , i got kisuke yesterdayin only three singles and got really happy about it , i was thinking about not spending anymore until tybw3 , but then i ended up leveling up a digit star and thought  why the fuck not  and just did a random single and got freaking stark , i literally can  t explain how happy i am right now , two hours before the banner is gone and i get the only two i wanted , now i just hope this wasn  t all of my luck for the month cat  face  with  tears  of  joy
