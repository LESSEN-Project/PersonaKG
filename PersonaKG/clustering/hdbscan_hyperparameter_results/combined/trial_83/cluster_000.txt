6. how do i tell a guy who thinks things are going well that i just want to be friends without hurting their feelings or making them hate me ? " hey , x , i ' m only interested in being friends " that ' s all you have to do . if a dude doesn ' t respect that and back off , or if they start resenting you , they were never your friend to begin with and you ' re better off without them . " leading them on " implies you ' re doing that intentionally to get something out of it . obviously that ' s not the case , so you really aren ' t doing anything wrong here . you ' re not obligated to give people a chance romantically , and if you aren ' t into them , it ' s arguably worse to tell them you ' re interested in them romantically when you aren ' t . if you aren ' t compatible and you know you ' re not interested , don ' t go down that path . however they react is on them , and if they get shitty with you for saying that you ' d rather be friends , they were a shit friend because they never actually intended to be your friend .   x200b

   (ID: 98df62eadd0a0c80a6084d5e352985209b46cce9)

8. i mean i ' m the only one who will , not because i ' m interested in you but because i know that i ' m driving you up the wall and if your efforts to get the last word and provide yourself with some small win in life , and because i think that you ' re bad and that you should be punished . and because i think you ' re impotent rage and lies are hilarious . you could easily prove to me your age and your body type yet you refuse because i ' m correct .
