3. they don ' t fit my points at all . you shoehorned them in there which i suspect you ' ve done in previous arguments about this . they are not designed to cause harm , they are not so ridiculously easy to do it with that any child or animal or improper cleaning procedure can set them off on me , and it is a lot easier to react to a giant red tank approaching roaring at you at 150mph than a tiny spec flying at 1700mph which is literally impossible .

4. generally they don ' t notice . i stopped completely shaving because of the amount of ingrown hair so now i trim . i ' ve even been known to not bother for a while and go natural and again no problems with partners .
