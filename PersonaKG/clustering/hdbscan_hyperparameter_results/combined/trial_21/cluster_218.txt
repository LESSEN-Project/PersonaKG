1. because the heat of the sun , and the amount of water and salt and all the time that it ' s been there . there is more water and more area affected by that than in your glass of water . although maybe it ' s an interesting experiment if you put lot of salt in a small container , you heat it up and when you ' re gonna smell it , you cover you head and the container with a towel . if you try it , let me know what happens .
