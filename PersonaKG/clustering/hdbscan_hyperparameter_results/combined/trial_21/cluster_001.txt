1. this post is actually a pretty good start . whether you realize it or not , you ' re reaching out . now you need to go to a doctor , or a therapist , or whoever you feel comfortable with , and tell them all of the things that you have told us here . i ' m no doctor , so i can ' t say one way or the other whether or not you actually need medicine . but that ' s all the more reason to go talk to a real one . if you really do have depression , you might need meds . you wouldn ' t leave any other disease untreated , right ? as for the girl in the pic , i ' m guessing you look nothing like her . the hard reality is that you probably never will . everyone is different . you need to stop comparing yourself to other people , because you ' re only hurting yourself more . chances are , that girl has insecurities of her own . everyone does . but you can ' t let it control your life .

2. please don ' t do this or consider it . life i has more than what pre adulthood has to offer . your questioning of the world at a young age shows great wisdom . i do not mean this in a bad way , but the world kinda isn ' t real , at least not in the material sense . its not just a ball of gas with us random creatures on it . it is that , but it is also a space where our energetic spirits and souls gets to live in a physical body and interact with other physical bodies . everyone plays the same game every morning , at least in what our souls will allow . we may not be able to choose our material things completely but in every moment , inside our brains and souls we have a choice over how we fe in the moment . you may be an earth angel . they often question whether they feel totally at home on this plant , like home is actually far away . they often feel uncomfortable in social situations . especially because they are aware of the energy they are putting onto other people , which most people are not used to so they shy away but in actual truth its you that has the strong energy and that is what they feel . there is much more , they are often diagnosed with behaviour problems at a young age , they often feel some greater purpose calls them . maybe you might not live a super fantastic material life , but your soul path may be to help others . help others in your situation , study the spiritual arts . i do this for a living , and i can feel that you know you have a deeper side that you feel no one can relate to . it ' s not true , it ' s just that you haven ' t found other like minded people . practical advice  exercise , good diet , reading books , being in nature . don ' t do it man , who knows what your life will be like tomorrow , next week , in a year ' s time , in digit years time . your not permanently doomed because your state of mind is how it is right now . xxxx

3. it ' s a big mix of stuff but time is just one component . youtube is full of really socially intelligent folks that know how to help you navigate heartbreak . finding the right advice along with finding healthy distractions is key . you have to acknowledge your feelings , while at the same time giving yourself liberty to feel different emotions through other activities and diversion . you have to delve into healing while at other times work on suppressing certain emotions since they are not all constructive and sometimes even accurate . stay social . don ' t be afraid to hook with folks . i personally recommend tripping on molly , mushrooms or lsd to create an experience that could heighten your sense of how beautiful consciousness is . it sucks to say , but pain is a very helpful tool for progress . some people use it masochistically to self sabotage and wallow in a cycle of victimhood , self pity and depression . you could instead use pain to turn around and help other people , perhaps hold yourself to higher standards in important ways and above all use this opportunity to learn more about yourself and how to become the best friend to yourself you could possibly be .

4. so i don ' t have personal experience with this yet , but i have wanted to change my name for about digit years now . i ' m about to finish college and might be moving away soon , so now seems like a pretty good time to go through with it . anyway , to answer your questions  1a as far as i can tell , most places that require a formal change e . g . your job , bank accounts , ect . are able to easily change people ' s names in their system probably because of people changing their name when they get married so that should be fairly straightforward . some places  like banks  may require proof that the name change is legal , but just show them a copy of the deed poll . please note  i live in the uk  the rules might be different where you live . 1b i ' ve found it really helpful to talk to a friend about changing my name . i told a couple of friends , but we ' ve only spoken about it on skype , never face  to  face , but recently i ' ve been talking to one of my friends about it in real life , not online , and it ' s so affirming , if that makes sense . before , i felt like it was all in my head , but having someone to talk to about it and again i emphasise a face  to  face discussion makes it feel not  weird . she ' s even offered suggestions for me . digit as far as explaining it to people goes , i haven ' t really had to fully explain my reasons to anyone . none of my friends really asked why , or if they did , they were satisfied with the ' i just hate my name and i am able to change it , so why shouldn ' t i ? ' explanation . i plan on having different ' levels ' of explanation , depending on who asks . so the first level would be ' because i want to ' which would be for acquaintances and people i don ' t know very well . then ' growing up , i really didn ' t like my name . it caused me a lot of grief , and i decided to move away from that , ' for the next level , for people i know better , and then for people i know really well and trust , the last level would be the full story , which is quite long and this message is long enough as it is but i ' m happy to share if you ' re interested . digit in the dating world , if you ' ve never met them before , just introduce yourself with your new name . they won ' t know that you were ever called anything else . you can tell them about your name change in time , but there ' s no need to do it right away . digit i mean , there ' s no limit on the number of times you can change your name that i know of anyway but if you change it too often , i think people will stop taking it seriously , or just get mixed up with which name you have at any given time . once you have a good idea of the name you want to use , try introducing yourself with it online . if your username doesn ' t have any actual names in it like mine here then you can introduce yourself with a different name to each person if you want , and just see if one feels right . when you ' re comfortable with that , try using it as a username . i ' d recommend getting people to call you the new name socially before you legally change it , so you can get used to it , and it won ' t be too much of a hassle if you change your mind . lastly , i would like to add that you ' re not a fraud . it feels weird at first and lots of people who change their name feel as if they ' re lying when they use their new name . you ' re not . you ' re used to being called one thing and now you ' re answering to something different , and that takes time to get used to . don ' t let anyone make you feel bad about it .

5. so , let  s break this down , folks .  i beg the principle by which you derive the conclusion that he is in debt owing to his donators . the very nature of donation implies no need for reimbursement . if a refund were a reasonable expectation , then that implies something had been purchased . in fact , no such trade was agreed upon . people willingly donated to support the arts they appreciated specifically spoony ' s . this was not a loan situation . why must so many people die on this indefensible hill ? from the patreon community guidelines page   patreon is for artists , creators , and people who bring ideas . don  t put up fake pages or collect money for things you  re not actually doing . you also can  t use patreon as a prank or to fund non  activity .  that seems very clearly what spoony is doing . collecting money for things he is not actually doing .  giving out of love or support , even if it is for a person ' s product and not just for themselves , comes with no strings attached . if you give , or if another gives , and then demand return on the investment , that is a false gift , and you are reneging , or in other words cheating on your gift children call it indian giving , but that is offensive for obvious reasons . it is an extremely bad sign of character . it is not presented by spoony as  no strings attached  . he attached them when he put rewards up . rewards he is not delivering on . it is a gift exchange , agreed upon by both parties . i give him something , he gives me something . so far , he has gotten a lot of somethings and given barely any back out .  everyone keeps calling him a scammer , but the very nature of his supposed promises on patreon is that they are supposed to be projects that he would attempt , and or things and activities that he would try to give back to show appreciation for the support of those donating fans . correct . and he has seemingly failed to even attempt many of these activities .  it is ridiculous to inflate his lack of production into some kind of premeditated , draconic , dastardly , mustache curling scam to gain money , and then screw himself out of the money that he so cleverly thieved away by very cleverly destroying his source of income . does anyone really take this premise seriously ? do you think he is a scheming thief or a bungling failure ? he ' s either good at robbing , or bad at making a living . which one is it ? premeditated ? probably not . bungling failure is probably the closest to the truth . the dude is fucking himself over , which is sad .  there ' s one very simple answer to anyone who claims that spoony orchestrated a planned scheme to steal from his fans and is thus guilty of theft  why would you steal from people who are already paying you for next to no work ? why in the name of reason would anyone choose to fuck over their main support in favor of . essentially nothing positive ? it makes no sense . indeed , it does make no sense . which is why i  m surprised he  s doing it . he really either needs to just throw in the towel and call it quits or start producing again . this limbo state his patreon and site are in is just a sign of what many perceive as apathy at best and wholly dishonest at worst .  just let it go . you ' re angry at the guy because you ' re either a millennial that feels like they deserve to be treated as more of a priority , or you ' re from generation x and you grew up thinking life was business and money , and any kind of moving of money is necessarily a purchase of goods or services and must be rewarded in some way . i  m not angry at noah . i  m really not . i  m actually sad that i get no content from him , because i really enjoyed it . and your strawmen arguments hold no sway here . it is very simple  by putting up rewards , he agreed to provide them in return for money . he has consistently failed to do so . no more , no less .  if the case is the former , then please try to remember that the man is only a flawed human , who happens to be unfortunately not so good at sustaining his own productivity for reasons that really aren ' t your concern . if the case is the latter , then you need to catch up with the world , or you ' re going to have some serious issues in the future as we continue to progress as a technological and information based society . they say generals always fight the last war . well , things are moving at the pace of progress right now , and it is observably mathematically evident that society is evolving at an exponential rate . your childhood does not represent even the world of twenty years later at this point , and you need to adapt . be flexible and try to understand that those acts of donation on the internet in no way come with a bill of sale , contract of reimbursement , or value estimation . yes , he is flawed . and he is not owning up to those flaws and admitting defeat or conquering them to become a better creator . he is just ignoring his patrons . now , the middle of that is a bunch of meaningless platitudes that have no bearing on the conversation , so i  ll skip to the end  these donations did come with an expectation of reimbursement . by spoony . himself . he said that if you give him x amount of money , he would give you y content . that . is . a . business . transaction .
