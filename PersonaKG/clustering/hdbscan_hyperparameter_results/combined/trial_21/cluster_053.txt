2. can ' t use price tho . what would you do when a card swings up over the threshold ? everyone has to check prices every time they want to play ? what if it goes over  digit between rounds ? you get my drift there .

4. i like how it shows me what i want to see . i follow subreddits and most of the time that is all i see stuff from no weird or annoying crap also political discussions on reddit are better it seems .

5. this isn ' t an answer , but i would like to have a time  machine so i could spectate any moment in history i would want . i said spectate because everything i would do in the past , even my presence , would influence the presentthe future . now , the answer is  battle of stalingrad or crucification of jesus .

6. yeah , i know it ' s the hardest and worst but i simply want it . the why ? i already played a dozen worlds to where i was starting to mine iron , and this stupid black bronze has always eluded me . the most i ever managed to make were digit tools at any one given time . i refuse to progress further until i get this .
