4. hahaha no , i ' m sorry ! i think i know what ' s happening . i didn ' t object to you using the term pseudoscience , but to you defining as science with shaky bases . it ' s just flat out not science of any kind , only posing as such . that ' s the distinction i was trying to make you understand . i think i might have been a bit clearer , but i ' m on the phone , so i was perhaps too curt . sorry again .

5. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

7. i dont know if this is cheating since the official album version has vocals , but the anthology version of " eleanor rigby " with just the orchestra is amazing . better than revolver ' s version imo
