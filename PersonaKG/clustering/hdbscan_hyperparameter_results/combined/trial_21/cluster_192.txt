   (ID: 8764a223ca1af7d1792e76a58bf3b1209bf73ad3)

   (ID: 0b52265db13bf8bc27ad36aad94e870706eb6689)

12. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .

16. if a rubber ball filled with helium is placed on the incline , it will not roll . if a ball of glue is placed on the incline , it will not roll . almost nothing ever has a single cause . most things have their entire light as their cause , and it ' s usually nonsensical to consider something to be a one true cause of an event . this is the first flaw i see in your definition of " cause . another flaw i see is  nowhere in the naive definition does it say everything must have a cause . yet your argument hinges on this .
   (ID: fae28587bce17296589bf92d656ad68ee32601d6)
