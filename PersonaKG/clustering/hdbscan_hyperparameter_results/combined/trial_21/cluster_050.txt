1. crap , i like playing support characters because i am not too great at gw2 when it comes to playing against people as it is my first mmo and i don ' t even know if my builds are any good . the server i play on is henge of denravi , when i play , there is hardly ever anybody on because of the time difference . over the past month i have not been playing gw2 as much because i have hit a wall . i do love jumping into a zerg as a sup gaurd or just tailing a small group i don ' t enjoy pve much since i have run all the dungeon paths multiple times , farmed the crap out of world bosses and getting my ass handed to me in pvp over and over isn ' t appealing . the only thing that has got me coming back is my guildies and doing living world because my so likes living world stuff so we do that together . i have the nbn where i am so latency is not an issue for me tbh , but i spent most of my time playing on an adsl1 connection with an average digit . 5mb speed , latency was a killer . but now the only issue i have with being able to play the game is the constant drops in connection , it ' s not my pc or internet connection either , if my so is playing at the same time she usually drops a few seconds after me . have run a tracert on the hod ip address , it always seems to time out around the 40th  43rd hop so there is nothing i can do about it . because of the drops i can hardly play let alone compete lol .

4. maybe i am just bad at using them but my experience has been they don ' t help a lot with deer while bow hunting . if you can ' t get close with out one they are not a silver bullet for fixing bad sneaking , add to that they get caught on everything until you get used to moving in them and they get warm . that being said they are uncomfortably good for hiding from people . we had a rather large fellow bring his double xl curvy lady out to the woods for some public private time . they started getting undressed about digit feet from where my buddy and i where sitting in on a hill . they freaked out when we got up to walk away because , neither of us wanted to watch what was about to go down .

5. nope , never wondered . my dad installed a pair which i think he acquired when working for ge , designing train engines . i don ' t kinow whether he put them in earlier cars but i know he put them in his digit new yorker , soon as he got it . i was digit at the time so i don ' t know too many details . until he got around to getting a compressor and building an engine mount for it , he just had a good size air tank under the hood . oh , the horns were also mounted in the engine bay  those old chryslers were huge . it was fun to stop for gas on vacation trips and dad would ask for air . after giving the " what is this screwball doing " look as dad lifted the hood , the attendant invariably said " holy shit " then , of course , had to hear them .
