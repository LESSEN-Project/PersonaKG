2. i couldn ' t tell from your post if you had tried this or not , but spanking is a good way to start . start slowly and get him aroused , then increase the intensity . it ' s a good way to learn together the proper balance between pain and arousal . it takes practice . start with your bare hand , then introduce a brush , etc as your comfort level increases . done properly it can be incredibly erotic . when you ' re comfortable , introduce verbal dominance as well  tell him he ' s been a bad boy and you ' re going to punish him , that sort of thing . i ' ve found it most effective when my wife whispers these things  it sets a very intense mood .
