1. it ' s not just you . i ' ve been here about as long as you have and have noticed the same things . when i first got here i used to look at b  as and try to test myself to see if i could guess what the cc would be in the thread . now the opportunities to do that are very sparse . the highly  voted ones almost always look amazing , and the ones that need help disappear .

2. if you ' ve got everything you need in town , why not ? and nowadays with the internet , you can get anything delivered that you can ' t get in person .

3. hey guys , great place you ' ve got here . something struck me , and i decided i need to go ahead and grow out what i can and see where it goes . most times i ' ve had some degree of facial hair , but anything of beard caliber seemed a far off dream . then i figured , " why not " any tips ? also , and this may be an odd question . based on what you guys see here , could you link me to a picture of a beard that looks similar to how you ' d anticipate mine coming in ? just figuring since you ' ve guys seen many beards start off here , you can kind of read where it may go to a degree . edit  my plan is to let it grow at least one month , sept . 1st .
