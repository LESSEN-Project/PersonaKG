5. chit chat , ask him how he feels about the election next year and what he  ll do if he doesn  t win , ask him about aliens space , not illegal and shit like that . i wouldn  t try and lecture him or change his opinions on anything because we all know how futile that would be , so honestly i think i would just listen to him . our politics are very different but i wouldn  t scream or argue or ridicule him because what  s the point ? he  s still a human being and despite what people say he actually does have a good sense of humour and is apparently an extremely good conversationist .
