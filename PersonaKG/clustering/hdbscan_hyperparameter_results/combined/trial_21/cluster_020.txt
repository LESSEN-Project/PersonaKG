4. i think we got way of topic here anyway . the original question was well kinda why does gaming industry now day feels obligated to satisfy all those  pissy dickweeds  , can  t we have just  he , she , they  characters , maybe even white ones too ?

5. i have the gamecube gameboy advance player somewhere , but i can ' t find it to save my life . if i could just find the disc , i could probably find the device itself on ebay pretty easily . i just miss the ability to play pokemon emerald on the big screen . maybe one day i ' ll get emerald on the switch . until then i ' ve got a modded mini snes , but it ' s just not the same !

6. " riley " i ' m sorry your day turned to shit . the crappy thing about fear is that it isn ' t always rational and when caught off guard it is difficult to act rationally anyway . i had a similar experience a few years ago which helped me decide i was buying a car so i didn ' t have to wait at bus stops and i have the guy half of my land line number and the other half of my cell . to this day i wonder why i didn ' t just say no . or maybe i did and he insisted . i cast it as a lesson learned for the future . sadly he got on the same bus as me and i got got off and doubled back to another route .
