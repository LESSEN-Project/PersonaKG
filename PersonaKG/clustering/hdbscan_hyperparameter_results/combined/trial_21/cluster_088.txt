1. i saw a comment on a post recently imagine your lonely dying breaths , ending with you feeling comforted by what you feared most your entire life . get out there and face your fears , because behind all of them is a chance to gain new perspective and expand it and really grow and learn . our fears force us into our  comfort  zones , es little stimulation in comfort . anyways i  m rambling good night victory  hand  dark  skin  tone

5. hi , i can see that you  re really talented and you played really good if i would change one thing though i would play the original music clip in the corner so everyone who is not an guitar expert and doesn  t know what everything does can look at the original clip and the rest can ignore it because the clip is in the corner

7. although i love clannad and code geass with all of my heart . they arent flawless . and i dont think its good to keep saying to yourself that nothing will beat this anime . because then you ' re making it harder for yourself to find a really good anime . i recommend going in every anime with the thought that this could be you ' re digit  anime . this way you can enjoy more anime .

8. oh man . that actually sounds really good right now .

9. that ' s really interesting thank you ! in my mind i always believe that businesses would seek vc but it ' s really interesting that they proactively seek you out , which kind of makes sense because if i had a shed load of cash to invest i wouldn ' t be sat around waiting for the golden goose . good luck in your business , it ' s a fantastic idea !
