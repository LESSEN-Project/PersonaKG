1. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .

3. interesting question , actually have given this much thought . first off , this time will be known as the english speaking era . british empire , usa , all that rot  and well into india and china doing things on the world stage   but it ' ll be by the english speakers . depending on how things go right about now , our abuse of abundance will probably be our greatest shame .

4. in daft punk ' s " get lucky " there ' s a part where the robot voice repeat ' s the line " we ' re up all night to get lucky " but i thought they said " we ' ll rub a mexican monkey . " i knew it couldn ' t be right but i couldn ' t unhear it and convinced my wife that it was actually the lyrics because " there aren ' t any wild mexican monkeys and it would be awe fully lucky to rub them "
