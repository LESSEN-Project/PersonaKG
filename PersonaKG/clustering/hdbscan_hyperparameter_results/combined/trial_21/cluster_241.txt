1. choose your poison that ' s a nice test to give to people that are literally incapable of telling good from evil , because you made them in such a way . doesn ' t sound very flattering about god ' s character , is it ?  christianity at least imho is a soothing white lie i prefer calling it opiate of the masses . it helps one notice both great utility as a painkiller and horrible side effects .   x200b

2. also , most people in the states are apolitical  depoliticized and best praxis would probably be to date them and radicalize them . we all have long and winding political developments and it ' s good to meet people where they ' re at and engage with them . this could also be applied to liberals  conservatives , but probably not with reactionaries . although you never know ! i wonder if any communists have converted a reactionary

4. if that was my sister i would do the good old " listen here you little shit . " talk . i broke many people ' s bubbles this way . i would tell her off , break everything into her face about how embarassing she actually is . you do everything she says and ignore her tantrums , try to not accidentally push her buttons etc and expect change . it ' s not happening and you ' re giving her more control over you . iron fist for people like your sister !

5. that ' s what i wonder . it seems that so many people in power are bad people , and i wonder if that was their end game from the beginning or if they started with good intentions
