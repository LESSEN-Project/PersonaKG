1. hmm . good point . my argument seemed to be a bit flawed . i guess it  s just down to the amount people use and nothing else . or is it . i guess imma have to come back to this topic at a later date and think about it a bit more

2. i mean if the location is good , which it sounds alright it could make sense for some people . like i agree the rules sound insane but if you have a room to rent in sf if you are willing to lower the price you can make unreasonable demands .

3. so trump says he lied yet somehow vindicated him , called comey a " leaker " which would mean that if i met him , wrote down my encounter and shared it with a friend who put it on his blog , i would also be in the same boat remember , all his memos were unclassified , and now they want to file a complaint because they didn ' t like comey ' s testimony ? do they not think that it might look like that ' s obstruction or are they just " hoping " it will help make it all go away ? not being american and just witnessing this fiasco has been quite good entertainment , unfortunately at your the american people expense . either way , i can ' t wait to see where this rabbit hole takes us . dig that hole ! dig that hole ! dig that hole ! dig that hole !

5. thanks , good to know i ' m not alone . i think the problem comes from how people take the word " noob " to mean . most people here think not being a noob is just able being able to win or get high ranks , so if you win or have a high rank then you ' re not a noob . for me not being a noob means being able to aim well , win fights and just having good general fps skills , as well as all the br skills survival , camping , etc . lots of people who win are terrible at fps stuff and they don ' t even realise it . i see it often when spectate .
