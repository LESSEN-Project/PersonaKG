1. i have this problem too . my trans best friend and i refer to each other as " tr    ies " all the fucking time because we both understand that we ' re doing it to take the piss out of actual transphobes . but then i really have to try hard not to refer to other trans people like this . it ' s really bad lol basically , you ' ve just gotta surround yourself with people who aren ' t going to use that language . we automatically pick up and appropriate the language of those we surround ourselves with something something egotistic in  grouping .

2. if it  s really bad you should try to find a tutor or a study group to keep you motivated to complete your assignments on time . it  s easier when other people expect something from you rather than just yourself

3. my take on it is that  how can we prove they really kicked us out of the group just before the final boss ? a screenshot doesn ' t really prove we got kicked out . for all anet knows we might just be out to give this people a bad time for whatever reason .

4. i think that ' s a really great approach , and it also highlights another thing . a lot of responses here have suggested i ' m a spoilsport for saying that prepping isn ' t just about guns and ammo . and that ' s fair enough , i guess i literally blog about ' sensible survivalism ' , that ' s kind of boring in a sense , but i ' m definitely not suggesting that prepping can ' t be enjoyable and enriching even if it ' s not about the guns primarily . you ' ve highlighted that with your examples of learning new skills and experimenting with cool science . it ' s definitely preparedness because you know how to make useful things out of your surroundings  but it ' s also just as enjoyable for you as going to the gun range is for many people , because you ' re getting to try new things you enjoy whilst bettering your own abilities . so yeah , i really like that you find enjoyment in different aspects of prepping ! thanks for the comment , man .

5. i think what ' s scary about this video is how the cammer seems to be paying attention and driving in a relatively safe manner , yet still is unable to stop in time . this situation happens all the time where traffic slows suddenly , and i " use up " some of my stopping distance . usually , rather than slowing even more to return to a safe following distance i will follow too close for a few seconds until traffic speeds up again . i think most people do this , and it can be really dangerous in those few seconds .

6. sounds like someone really hated that whole family . maybe more than one person , poison and dynamite  bombs are very different weapon choices . it seems weird that she would lean over looking at the package for an extended period of time instead of just picking it up like most people would . i guess she could have been extra cautious because of the dynamite at her brother  in  law ' s place but if she was suspicious , why not call the police to come and look at it ?

7. i will never forget this lesson that i learned on oprah when i was a little kid . " people will always show you who they really are . believe them  the first time . " iyanla ? maya angelou ?
