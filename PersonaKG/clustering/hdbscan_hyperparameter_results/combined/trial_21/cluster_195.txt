1. people might say , he couldve saved that money . but who actually does that ? save for 17years ? only rich people . for average people , its almost impossible to save for years and not touch that money over those years . just take that guy above as a person who smoke cigarettes for years . at least his chance with his money is to become a millionaire and not cancer .

4. convenient excuses for an idiot . if they were so smart , why aren  t we deported ? so much for being superior when the people you thought were lesser , are now your equal . wait a minute y  all fought among and killed yourselves to make us lesser people equal to you ? fucking moronic wouldn  t you say ?

5. this sounds kinda healthy . i know far too many people who do the opposite and bury themselves in kid issues to the neck and when the kids leave , they have nothing more to talk about and get divorced . if you  re resentful about it , why not say something ?

6. why wouldn ' t he change ? if people say something is annoying he ' s bound to stop

7. this is hilarious . the difference is " so huge " you had to film it in slow motion and put it side by side for anyone to notice ? i ' ve said it before and i ' ll say it again  outside of the people determined to applaud or canvass every single fucking change apple makes to every device they release , 60hz is not choppy , 120hz much less 100hz still ghosts , and the difference is god damn negligible .

8. well i seem to be somewhat unique in that i can ' t honestly say i relate to any of them , at least certainty not on the level of a lot of other people on this sub . i am very lucky to have never personally experienced any of the problems portrayed in the game . that said i do definitely sympathize with them quite a lot . i ' d say i sympathize the most with sayori probably because my sister suffers from depression , followed by natsuki . then yuri , then monika . i love natsuki the most though .
