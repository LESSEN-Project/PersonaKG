2. it really makes customer support queries much faster . i find it way more useful than some of the banking apps i use , because all the text and information is automatically saved . you don  t have to go back and forth with different systems and phone numbers and juggle all the information as it  s all there .

5. " don ' t be afraid to be truly bored or alone with your thoughts . " i can ' t remember the situation , but the general idea was to not be afraid of having nothing to do . your mind can create some interesting ideas , given the opportunity . boredom can be a gateway to discovering yourself or a new creative outlet you can use to express yourself . the counter to that tends to be that your mind can also create some rather worrying ideas too , but i don ' t think that was really the goal of the idea .
