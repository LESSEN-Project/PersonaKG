   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

8. this is one case i really hope gets solved soon . i hate to think how many other children have been abused and  or killed by the person  s responsible for this . it makes me sick . the eggplant thing stands out . makes me wonder if it ' s a convenient choice farmer or seller of eggplants , or if it ' s a sick variation on those porn videos where women stick everything from wine bottles and cucumbers to traffic cones in themselves just to show they can , only with kids .
