1. ' why i feel useless ' in that case is i guess something to do with not being able to do anything or contribute to society . but idk it ' s something to do with not being useful to myself too . but i think you have a point so thanks .

6. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .

   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

12. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

13. regardless of the selfishness in your ideas , which caused the existance of the kids in the first place , in going to say that my point is , that you cant expect kids to be slaves because you provide them food and shelter . " i give you shit , so you should do exacly as i say " that sounds like a regular employment , except the kids can ' t quit . they have to put up with you . and they dont even realise that because you have fashioned their brains the way you want . im digit and took me digit years and living away from home to realise that parents are the entitled ones . i hope for the sake of kids , fair doesn ' t only come in octomber to your house too .
   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

14. you ' re gonna get camped one every dozen , dozen and a half or so games during the start of the season , it ' s just people hungry for their old rank . it is a trade off because if he literally facecamps you and you do the right thing draw it out as long as possible then the rest of the team will basically secure a victory in the meantime , but that ' s not a huge relief for the guy getting facecamped . just incentive to learn how to evade better ! as for the rank reset , it happens every month so this isn ' t exactly the moon and sun aligning to screw you personally over . there ' s just a couple days of weird ranking while stuff gets figured out , not a big deal . it ' s gonna happen again in october and november and december and so on so it ' s not really worth complaining about
   (ID: 8df56ee782672f11aeb0f19bf7978b1b1c04e678)

15. even if this photo is fake . the idea is so cringe worthy itself

17. exactly , no way to win . only thing to do is avoid the situations with people who are like that and try to have worthwhile conversations with people who are more reasonable . the stuck up sjws aren ' t worth you time
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

18. " what do you want to eat x or y " giving two options instead of all options reduces the cases of arguing over where to eat to almost nill .

19. woodworking man . go pick up a stack of free pallets , and you can tear them down with an hour and a hammer . after that , you know you have free wood , so even if what you make is crap , it didn ' t cost a dime . make a shelf , box , whatever . if it ' s something you ' re into , it ' ll grow to making cool stuff . and if you ' re not into it , no harm no foul , didn ' t cost anything but a few basic tools if you don ' t have them hammer , drill and circular saw will handle most everything , and are cheap online  craigslist . good luck man ! hope it works out
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

20. people aren  t against you  they  re for themselves . let  s say you  re a local politician  city council maybe . ok . so your pay is shit . this is a part  time position with few benefits . you  re in your 40s and you  ve got two kids to put through college . you  ve got your normal job paying you ok , but not enough to take on thousands in tuition . there  s a vote coming up to decide if you should create a local landfill for a nearby city  s trash . it  ll make the town some money but also won  t be great for the local environment . it  ll smell bad in that area . some people won  t like it . a guy who has the land to sell for the landfill says he  ll give you  digit , digit if you vote yes . a guy who has trash trucks who will haul the trash for the coming years will give you  digit , digit to vote yes . you don  t have friends or family who will be affected and your kids have a jumpstart on paying for school . plus , the city gets some money . a few more people get employed . big reward for you , small downside for some . that  s how this stuff starts . innocent enough . i think the problem then comes from the slippery slope if i did it for tuition , it  s not that much worse to do it for the vacation house ! and the possible blackmail . the next vote comes around and maybe you  re opposed to expanding the landfill but now you  ve got folks who paid you and can tell newspapers other outlets that you got paid . your political career is now done .
