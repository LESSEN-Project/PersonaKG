1. all of the detroit lions players . its like when you say " fuck it " and work for a shitty company that pays way too much .

2. i have no idea about what happened to you . i can only comment on my own experiences . the staff i worked with only medicated patients at a physician request . they are the only ones that could legally prescribe . all medication drawn and administered is documented , heavily . so no one in my organization could " knock you out " simply because they thought you were a burden . it doesn ' t work that way . as for restraints , if you become a danger to yourself , staff or any other patient then for safety reasons you will be restrained . depending on the state or province the form of restraint will vary . some units will use handcuffs , others just simple velcro straps . any properly regulated hospital will ensure that restraints or even isolation units for that matter are used for positive outcome . never as a punishment . i ' m not going to say it doesn ' t happen because i know it does but for the most part in my experience things were always by the book . i can only speculate about your experience . if you did try to leave the facility and you were a level one psych patient then meds would likely be given even after restraints were placed . the number one thing is to keep you safe . if that means sedation then that ' s what ' s going to happen . maybe to get your vitals back or to help you sleep .

3. the best ones are the ones where you say nothing and let connotation , subtext and their own imagination do the work

5. aussie here , so what i ' m about to say may not apply in the us , but going around to talk to sparkies face to face is worth digit resumes you send out . do the leg work .
