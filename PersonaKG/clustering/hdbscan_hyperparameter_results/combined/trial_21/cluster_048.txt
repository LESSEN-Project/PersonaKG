3. some of that stuff looks great but i ' m not sure it ' s all going to fit in a 30l rucksack like the one you ' ve linked . you ' ve got at least 60l of items by my estimation , and it will be very heavy to carry once you include water bottles .

4. i bloody love barcelona  my favourite european city by a mile . i never , ever get bored of going there . the first thing i do when i get home is book my flight back again . it takes a special city to be equally amazing on a wet tuesday morning in february as a friday night in july  barcelona is the one that does it for me . never have got my head around catalan though !
