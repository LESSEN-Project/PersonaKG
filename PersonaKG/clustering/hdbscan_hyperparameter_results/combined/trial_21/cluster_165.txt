2. i  m not saying you  re in the wrong . i  m saying you shouldn  t have to feel bad for something you actually are experiencing , just because other people have it worse . you  re not saying that you have it worse than they do , so you shouldn  t feel bad about having your own problems in a first world country .

3. well , if you stand under the wrong tree a pissed off drop bear might get you , but a snake will only strike at you if you startle it when close enough that it doesn ' t feel like it can get away  like if you ' re crashing through the bush chasing one or two terrified people . i ' d be at least a little concerned , but then , i ' m not a murderer . if i was a victim , i ' d take the chance of a snake bite and leg it at the first opportunity . i save my ' everything in australia will murder you ! ' stories for my kiwi husband and friends  it makes me look like a badass when i tell them about how i killed an eastern brown with a shovel or found a redback in my bed .
