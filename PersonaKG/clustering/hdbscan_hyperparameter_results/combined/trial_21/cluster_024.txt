2. great show , excited to see where this goes in a month when we get by all the obvious games starcraft , cs , ext . do have one suggestion that might already be true but has to do with twitch . could you produce this show inside the " game " category and not the " gaming talk shows " category . since this talk show is digit  just about a the single game and not a of variety game talk show . if you do it inside the " game " i would guess you would get more people checking out the live stream . twitch might have rules against this but its my idea .

5. i ' ve personally faced violence for being a transman more than once , and i live in a really bigoted place filled with truly awful people . i totally get where you ' re coming from  the point of my comment was actually to point of that transmen face their share of issues with being trans . most commonly , in my experience , misogyny that reduces us down to genitals and the use that men can have for them .

6. we just kinda roll with it here , no on really talks about it . some people have whats called a  happy lamp  that gives off uv rays or something . i think digit  of the people that live here get sad , which is caused from the lack of sunlight . sad is a seasonal depression disorder btw i live in america , but alaska

7. funny that the place is so dirty yet people are alive ? or perhaps we live in a society controlled by chemical companies into thinking everything is out to kill us . i am far from saying i would go there but if you see an old person drinking that water , and they have been doing so all their life it makes you think .
