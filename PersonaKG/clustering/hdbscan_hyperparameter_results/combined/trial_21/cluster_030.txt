2. sadly , hormones can  t fix all our features  even though hrt for transmen is stronger than trans women most of the time . i know personally i  m a guy and all but after going on t , i got more dysphoria around my chest when i was pre op , female organs and bottom area . i changed drastically but that made things i can  t change stand out even more . that happens a lot when people transition . hrt is not going to make our lives perfect and amazing like many people think . i personally believe that  s why a lot of trans people are depressed and stuff after hormones , they imagined their life to instantly become perfect and all their problems go away . our problems will still be there after hormones , i knew this . i just knew that my problems will be easier to deal with as a man than a girl for me .

4. as a desktop support technician at a college can i ask you all to just not . we are aware the computers are shit , we are aware you would like better ones and , i am happy to admit it , i am aware that you guys probably know more about computers , networking and other shit than i do . what i would like you guys to be aware of is . everyday i have to smile while people complain about their slow pcs and underpowered pcs and i try to do my best for them by sneaking in extra ram and setting it up so it doesnt strictly follow the start up scripts . however we are underfunded and i can only do so much . senior management at your college probably have much nicer kit than you . they will also get sweet phones and shit . they do this because they are important and although they could afford the devices themselves easily with their pay they would rather spend the money there than on better pcs for the students . i once spent two days tidying up a room making sure that all the cables were neat and the pcs were running well . one week later i returned to find everything destroyed and it needed doing again . it broke my heart . i am dead inside now . what is the point in trying to do my job if people are just going to take a steaming shit on it anyway ? one of the reasons your pcs are slow is group policy . these are not your home machines so they have to conform to a long list of things including stupid virus scans every time they are logged in and also mapping network drives on an ageing network . i cannot fix that . please don ' t make my life any harder by opening the pcs . they are going to be shit , they are going to be dirty and its some poor fuckers job to roll around when you ' re all done tidying up
