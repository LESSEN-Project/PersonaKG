10. i think people that use no true scotsman fallacy to distance themselves from " extremist muslims " will generally have no problem using it again with " stupid muslims " , so don ' t expect instant deconversions from people you intend to debate . still , it may help with people on the fence , go for it .

12. i have nothing against people studying what interests them , but i don  t have much sympathy for people with these degrees who complain about how hard it is to find a job in their field or how nobody wants to pay a lot of money for someone with a liberal arts degree .

13. yta let people be the people they are and for the times they do things that you don ' t agree with let that shit go and just have fun with them .

14. so basically you can not take an interest in another persons culture because , someone might get offended , so should different people from different cultures be separated so that they don  t share and grow from their cultural history  s ?
