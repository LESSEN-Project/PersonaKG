1. i would feel bad for them but also slightly jealous . then you have to realize that it doesn  t really matter that she couldn  t get number one because of course we don  t always get the love of our lives

2. how are you ? well , now that you ask my hemorrhoids are acting up again and i feel really constipated today . so when i leave the room it is probably to take a shit .

3. nah , it doesn  t suck . i actually really like it . i feel like it  s something everyone can relate to , and while it is personal to you , almost all of us could probably pick up on the meaning without your explanation .

4. i feel like the total opposite , swap almost everything you said the other way and thats me . im not edgy , i think my iphone is okay , idk what music i listen to but its not rock musichttps    billwurtz . com  , i like my parents , dont really care about anyone else . i dont use spotify , but instead just using a 3gb folder called " music " . i do use netlflix sometimes . i find that interesting

5. then you really are as stupid as i suggested at the outset . they are completely accurate and they are about digit times more useful than your nonsense because they ' re the meat and potatoes and nobody gives a shit if you could add digit tomes of ands , ifs , or buts to them . " meat " is not a complete description of steak and " vegetables " is not a complete description of salad but those are the main points you think of when you see steak or salad on a menu and an adequate description of the difference between them for you to decide you feel like having one a lot more than the other . and all i asked you , was the difference between autism steak and retard salad .
