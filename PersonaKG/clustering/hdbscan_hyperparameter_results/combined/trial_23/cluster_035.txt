--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 55

1. i think it  s hit reg . as far as i know there aren  t any hacks that make you invincible but in the wake of the hit reg bug it  s entirely possibly it could have been developed since everyone would put the blame on hitreg
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

2. how do you deal with people like that ? i struggle with people already but when it ' s someone either not listening or think they know better i end up snapping at them

4. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

5. i don ' t think you know what i mean . we can eliminate jesus being a human . therefore he is a alien
   (ID: 93e92e6a7d8e94b12bcd450fad136ec14436f359)

6. yeah maybe with mammals and stuff but i don  t think snakes really understand the concept of help . from what i know they  re left on their own from the time they hatch and don  t receive any kind of assistance from mom . it  s possible but i doubt it
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

7. i think i ' m the only who is experiencing a situation where lately the servers which i play on i ' m from india btw have like digit or digit snipers and they alone obliterate my entire team landing perfect headshots or body shots . it ' s really discouraging to play tf2 lately when you know there ' s a sniper out there waiting for your head or body to pop up right out of the corner
   (ID: 43361d3d352286328dcb058ec017ca0e2d364601)

8. sometimes i think that no matter how hard our life is , no matter how much we suffer or put others in pain , the people who have passed on are laughing because they know it doesn ' t matter and nothing matters in life because there ' s something else that ' s better for everyone once we pass on . as far as i know , death only affects those that are living .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

9. none . i think it ' s ridiculous to cry over the death of someone you don ' t know .
   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

10. i think being loving first and getting to know them can permit the conversation about jesus to go more smoothly . they may even come to see god through through tour loving relating as the candle shown for all to see . if we don  t tell our co workers at our jobs about hell digit  digit why should we do it to homosexuals ?
   (ID: 2a3f07a52e2fc5e79fd2ed52f4f601fa39ebe2e4)

11. i think you mean more openly discussed . murder and violence should be discussed while at the same time nobody needs to know the details of someone ' s sex life .
   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

12. i think you know well and good what it is and you ' re deliberately being obtuse .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

13. im waiting for kunimitsu and negan , and i know several pros and cons . pros are you know the most of the match up , move , what safe and what can be punish . cons are sometimes you do wrong input for example yoshi ender i always use with f3  digit but some times i mix that with miguel button input . also , having your brain expand the size of the entire roster , sometimes i found myself think of all the move i use when i fight those character , for example like if i fight yoshi , i would expect my opponent to only use what i also used but nope he use other tech so i find it difficult sometimes . sometime you you underestimate your opponent because you know most of the match up , and other than that , you can mix some move into other character for example yoshi didn ' t have savage but you think he has cause you play most of the roster . in short it can confuse you .
   (ID: cd4ad4cc67fcfb39fcb1f11e52709d863f1c0215)

14. i think now we will see the fighting . germa has been around for so long and we dont know shit about them and about big mom past i think we may see another short flashback at the end of the arc , also mother caramel maybe is alive inside bigmom or as a homie .
   (ID: 28b40f8090abf393e7d7a7cf1772fb2c16d434a1)

15. i think it  s all of the facts that are not fiction . it breaks the fourth wall and if you  re the inquisitive type it kind of sucks you in and involves you . the book has a life of its own , but the reel world facts and history are there to be pursued further . you get this all the time with nonfiction of course , but when fiction does it too , especially a real page  turner , it  s really cool . you know of any others ?
   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

16. i think the viewers are still figuring out what ' news ' is , let alone if it is balanced and if they even know what ' balanced ' means .
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

17. i don  t think you know how the subreddit works .
   (ID: 4136a1b6da64b3c5f49dfe23761d1a0ec8925dba)

18. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

19. you don ' t see the problem at all . you don ' t know any of the complexities or the implications of the issue , and that ' s why you think copy  pasting your own method would work . how offended would you get if the us told your own government  hey , our economy is the most successful in the world , you should copy it directly . of course you ' d be insulted . you should run your own country to your own circumstances , and we should do the same .  copy pasted from question digit mins ago

20. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !
