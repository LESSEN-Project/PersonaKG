3. i think what  s happening is now everyone knows about the show so the typical applicant might br madly in desire of their digit minutes rather than madly in love . collateral damage is what worries me . there are people who would do whatever necessary to get on tv etc , when the shows  s over , their spouse and new families might be over too .

4. ok love . how about the cathedral in naples which holds a vial of blood from an early christian martyr , st . januarius . reportedly , the blood is dry most of the year , but mysteriously liquefies three times throughout the year , on days commemorating his life and impact . i think that one would be testable ?
