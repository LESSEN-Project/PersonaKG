1. the main flaw i see with many answers is threefold . negotiating will be difficult when you don  t know the language . even shakespearean english could be a rough adjustment . depending on whom you are negotiating with , they may just take it . and , if you bring back something that appears too shocking , threatening or evil , you might meet your maker rather quickly .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

2. tpms are horrible , especially in the cold . best bet is to look at the tires and if it doesn  t look flat , it  s not . it  s just a cash grab against people who don  t know how a normal tire looks
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

3. a lady done this for me one time flying to london and i couldn ' t thank her enough . i hate flying but i know it ' s something that just has to be done to get places .
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

4. if someone  s tailgating you , just get out of the way if you can . stopping hard and flipping them off is only gonna make them angrier . if you can  t get out of the way , learn to properly brake check . you  re supposed to lightly tap on your brake , so that you don  t decelerate but your brake lights come on , letting them know they  re too close . if all else fails and they persist in riding your ass and possibly following you , then i  d say it  s okay to stop short . just brace yourself for a possible hit and a lot of yelling afterwards .
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

5. wow . you really know how to kill a vibe , my guy . oh well . i should have known just by the look on your face .  rip
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

6. the screen isn ' t frozen it ' s just unresponsive and it does it even when not plugged . let me know how razer support helps your may do the same then .
   (ID: 064b68f55fd83de76c3cbc4f130670e6435e42a4)

7. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show

8. a lot of the time my mum i honestly dont know why but she just makes me cringe to the point where i get mad at her and can not control it . it ' s rather horrible tbh .
   (ID: 8b409a812bfe5e21e6e8924b5c822fc50d0d2c9a)

9. why the hell would you go a whole month without an orgasm ? do you just turn your morning wood button off or what ? because i honestly don ' t know how someone could do that man  shrugging  medium  dark  skin  tone . good discipline i guess .
   (ID: b5942acb07bb8a74e4924ef75fa70edb4f626161)

10. yes please ! i myself struggle with wave management and teamfighting so tips on that would be awesome ! just teach us everything you know honestly .
   (ID: 12a4255ed85f0655e8fd899838bf98179465eded)

11. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

12. i don ' t know what their problem is but maybe they are just jealous of your table !
   (ID: 183a5eea32f2c73a87c734920d3188862433e411)

13. oh no problem just letting you know
   (ID: 2264050ea82d909575d6593daf8246fa8655751e)

14. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

15. if you know anything about ceo ' s we have plenty of time to kill and this is more fun than playing golf . i don ' t care about helping your numbers . any complaints you get are your fault for hiding the merchandise while it devalues so you can buy it below cost and resell it on ebay . you are the reseller . i am just the advisor .
   (ID: a61db1f2f0a3d15376fd168a1637c028f25100e1)

16. look man , don ' t let the downvotes discourage you . just be you and know that you made some dude laugh at digit  digit am .
   (ID: a90f01f580b7cc08038958d5c1f659fd492b1f2c)

17. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

18. you do realize that its frozen before cut don ' t you ? and yes i know that for a fact my son just had it done last week .
   (ID: e3a37ef234435ebde735894f98de2b3f90e3bbe9)

19. i talk to people every once and a while they hate me at first then get used to me and friend me out of pity . i don ' t know why they do that they could just stop talking to me if they hate me but it ' s just what happens .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

20. how does it make you feel ? it  s just my opinion , i don  t know why everyone  s getting so defensive .
