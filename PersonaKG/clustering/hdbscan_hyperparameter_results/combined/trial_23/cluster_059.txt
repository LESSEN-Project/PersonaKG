1. we want to hear it so we can fix it or oh god not this again ! there ' s two types of managers and owners . sorry i don ' t have a better answer but that ' s just how it is ! i will say though that hilton holds a very high standard and that stuff will not fly for long . the next inspection they get will likely get those types of issues fixed . just always be kind when reporting issues like that . most times we would certainly want those things to not be issues but our hands are tied budget , staffing , time etc . trust me . our job is easiest and most fun when our guests are happy !

3. i ' m talking about people who aren ' t being harmful to anyone at pride . the man pictured above is just trying to participate in pride like a normal human being . whatever his job is shouldn ' t matterunless it was meant to cause harm , which it isn ' t . he just wants to have fun and celebrate pride month with his fellow gays . by commenting this it seems like you want to keep this gay man from being happy , and that is homophobic . good day .

4. could you imagine saving an orgasm for later like a " pick  me  up " you can just activate when you want it ? that would be cool

5. we don ' t want to stop killing each other , we just want to look like we care about people while killing them .

6. no offence taken , it ' s not just about the pvp , it ' s also about farming , which is fine if that ' s how others want to play . i was of the understanding that fw was about conflict and dominating the enemy , this can be pretty hard if the enemy just warps off when i turn up , if you ' re at ' war ' then be at ' war ' . i can understand why these ideas may not be for you in particular , but maybe , just maybe , a lot of others may be just as frustrated as me and actually want to have some gf ' s . i like different points of view as sometimes brilliant ideas can evolve , how  what would you like to see done to improve fw ?

7. i don  t see the shtick about being toxic to jojo fans , jojo is anime . it  s a fact . just let people like what they want to like
   (ID: d72952657a3571deff985040e565d95d8206db60)

8. they ' re just doodles i felt like sharing with the sub . there ' s plenty of great fan art out there , so go look at that if you want something more professional . don ' t gatekeep what other people can post .

9. it was mostly just talk , and they acted like they were showing what the people want , even though a lot of people wanted pewdiepie to be in it , or the whole jake paul suicide forest ordeal .

10. i feel the same way , i guess i just don  t want her to talk shit like , my sorry ass bf didn  t get me shit for md lol
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

11. its was my first one too , so i recommend you jojo ' s bizarre adventure , mob psycho digit and overlord . jojo ' s is a must have for anime fans . just watch it even if the first episodes are more or less bad . if you liked one punch man you will also like mob . that all i want to say to that . try overlord if you want something new .

12. all i really want out of an update would be the ability to buy an actual mansion , like michael ' s house or something like it . price it digit , digit million , whatever , i just want to work towards it

13. honestly i could make the value whatever i want it to be since air is just floating out there and has no production cost . but i feel like i could single handedly crash the economy by charging people for every breath

14. also i am deleting this post now since it ' s just spamming up the sub and the mods don ' t want shit like this on here thanks for wasting more of everyone ' s time on here
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

15. i typically find it easier to show them a picture if i want a new style . if i want a trim i just say something like " a digit fade on the sides and just the tips off the top "
   (ID: e7d4349520d7fd2b6b8d8e41558874e7ce55f7c3)

16. it is but it ' s better like that , plus if i really don ' t want to continue i just break up and appreciate my privacy again until the depression comes back .
   (ID: a80b8bc356414690d849369456d68876c95d5518)

17. maybe try to subtly come off that you really want this job , but not like you just want the money , more like it ' s your dream to work there and that you ' re willing to do almost anything to work there .
