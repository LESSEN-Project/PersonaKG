1. unless your arm is as long as your leg or you can dislocate your should on command i don ' t think the thing you ' re attempting to do is possible . if you ' re feeling a barrier , you might still have some hymen left , but really , your vagina stretches . it can likely accommodate anything a dude has to offer . listen , there ' s no right way to finger yourself . the whole point is just to feel good and it sounds like you ' re freaking yourself out . either get a toy or wait until you have a person you trust enough to talk about this with and let them put their fingers up in you .

2. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .
   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

3. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting

4. main character wise they are standalones , but world lore wise they are heavily linked , specially digit and inquistion . i would hold on playing dai and start with origins . i differ from the general consensus and actually like da2 a lot and think dai is just an ok game aside from the tresspasser dlc , which is phenomenal

5. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

6. i think you should have pride that you haven ' t slept around alot . but not in a way like you are better than any one else just i guess in a " i respect myself " type of way . which is why i don ' t think you should just fuck someone for practice .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

7. i imagine a good relationship , and i think about all of the happiness that will come from a relationship . i mainly feel like society doesn ' t accept me , based on how i look . it ' s frustrating how people don ' t look for personality in relationships , and i have a good personality . it just , sucks .
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

8. there are a few good ones on here like this , but for freshness , this would be best done as mf4a , just saying . my favourite twist , would be the wife on the phone , teasing the husband about what ifs , but it sounds like she ' s alone . she then hangs up , or at least think she does , and you get to ' accidentally overheard ' how amazing it is .

9. kinda of an asshole ? i can see being concerned that your film might not qualify for the lgbt festival but if it  s just about you being straight  chill . no one is going to think you  re gay and it  s not like your gay colleagues don  t attend straight festivals you would feel more comfortable at . if you  re not experienced with the lgbt community , that  s cool , but keep in mind straight people are usually welcome to any event so long as they  re nice ! you might even have fun .

10. the other comments are kind of mean . you aren ' t obligated to be friends with anyone and it doesn ' t seem like you guys are being mean to him . as long as you continue to be polite you won ' t be an asshole . i also don ' t think its clique  y to have a group of friends you regularly hang out with . i would just continue to be polite , and maybe if he keeps signing up for your breaks say that " actually his name , we usually all eat lunch together . we aren ' t asking for you to switch the time you take your break at all ! but because only x amount of people are allowed break at once , could we coordinate a little better so that i can still eat with your friend ' s names ? "

11. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

12. you should watch the videos before you criticize , otherwise you look dumb . i don  t doubt that you are , i just think you  d like to make a good impression here .

13. i think at this point your just upset that a little american boy has a different opinion then you and your trying to make me look like a dumb homophobic nazi

14. stark  digit ? heck no . the character he was more based on , ultimate spider  man ? yes very much so , though neither wanted to be a sidekick but an avenger disney  i prefer it to the other two because people like you have ruined them for me but i in no way think it  s this godsend tom is kind of accurate just not really digit accurate
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

15. do you really think that " getting really big " is a problem ? seriously ? what , ya think you lift a few reps , go to sleep , and wake up the next day built like a gorilla ? like it ' s that freaking easy ? do you have any clue what it takes to generate mass ? it required dedicated , disciplined work , and strict dieting . it doesn ' t just fucking happen . what i ' m saying is don ' t fucking worry about " getting really big . you aren ' t going to have that problem if the level of knowledge you have is so low that you even ask such a ridiculously silly question in the first place . go to the gym , work as hard as you freaking can , and you will be absolutely happy with the results .

16. other family members watched all of it , so i ' d be in the room through most of it . i think early on i just decided it wasn ' t for me . i get why people like it but it was marmite to me .
   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

17. oh boy , i do have a lot of ridiculous stories according to reddit . i didn ' t think i had really interesting or unbelievable stories but it seems like redditors just do nothing all day every day .
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

18. well a ton of socially anxious people think of similar shit like this that happened years and ages ago so just add it to the end of the queue .
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

19. i don  t think it  s women that like you less , it  s just not the best women who are acting like this with you . i mostly have female friends i knew before and after transitioning and they were all really supportive , same with any male friends i had . they are good people , so they accepted me wholeheartedly . i suggest finding those types of people in your life , regardless of gender yknow ?
   (ID: 3510b342268f3bc4c3f1e402201d7c565dfb7648)

20. i think the guy just look like him , not much more to it .
