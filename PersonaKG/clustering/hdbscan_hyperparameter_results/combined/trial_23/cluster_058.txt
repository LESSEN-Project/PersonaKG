   (ID: 37aa751f14bbf132fc2f76d2c2c79142318c3e31)

2. well that just sounds lazy to me . is that the only reason people want illegals is so we don  t have to do the jobs nobody wants to do ? what job could be so terrible that somebody wouldn  t take it ?
   (ID: 89a759866debf6704efa0f603c1b9c4476abd731)

3. she gave both of them the exact same treatment and even tried to get him to hang out at a different time . how is that playing favourites ? he doesn  t get to kick someone out of the friend group just because he  s not comfy around them anymore . everyone else is still friends with her . it doesn  t matter that he was around first , she  s here now and has just as much right to have friends as he does . it sucks that he missed out on game night because he didn  t want to see her , but that  s his problem , not op  s .
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

   (ID: 2c1d97aa622f6ad7ec3a9aad9285dd4ec1e1f28d)

5. why are so many people telling this guy to get a lawyer ? no lawyer needed . just don ' t do it ! it ' s illegal as hell . also , stop paying for your brothers car . tell him it ' s transferred into your name or you stop making payments . also , also  move out ! i have to be brutally honest , your mom sounds shady as fuck . you don ' t want to be around when it all comes crashing down on her . stay at a friends place or rent a cheap room . just get out of there !

6. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .

7. your lie my dude . tell it how you want . over here in reality though this game needs a story to compliment the season or we  re just left with grinding weapons that will eventually get infused into something else .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

8. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .

9. yta you come off as an ungrateful leach and when they told you " hey this is how we do it here , its polite and shows respect , and we will still pay for it " you decide you ' re better than their culture and just refuse to be a part of anything they want to include you in . i can understand why they would be upset with you
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

10. " oh . you want . what ? you want me to speak into a what ? a mic ? for what ? huh ? i don ' t . what do you mean ? what posterity ? man , i ' m just trying to get home , could you . sorry ? no , thanks . i ' m just trying to get home . okay , you too . bye "

   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

13. i  m really open to anything , preferably something light  comedic and from stage . i want to do something that is not over done . the only requirement is that the piece is not something overdone , for example i wouldn  t do something from meryl streep just as her pieces are constantly being used by students similarly , i wouldn  t use a monologue from a chorus line . i want something that my professor hasn  t seen before or something rarely done .

14. depends on what your needs are . if you just want a hole to dump cum in , then yeah , a sex doll will work okay . if you want anything else , then probably not .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

15. she doesn ' t pick out any of my outfits digit . digit  of the time . she just hates how masculine i dress and i don ' t want any thanksgiving drama .
   (ID: 7e58269155b84bc057025d5066e661ba2eb934ba)

16. you can smoke if you want to , just understand the ramifications for your actions .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

17. mosquitoes . they cause the most human deaths compared to any other living thing . seriously , whenever i see one flying around , whether it ' s minding its own business or looking for a midnight snack , i get my zapper and dart to the other side of the room . i ' m literally fine with a spider , i even held a jumping spider to put it outside , with my bare hands ! but i can ' t even look at a mosquito without trying to reach for my zapper . i just realized that i made this a confession . sorry to those who didn ' t want to hear that .
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

18. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .
   (ID: 4422c1db26c9be5bec35694a448a490c2761d985)
