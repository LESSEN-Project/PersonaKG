   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

2. are you suggesting euthanizing all the animals that belong to the unemployed ? what would happen in reality to those animals if the panhandler gave them up ? do you really think they ' ll be adopted by a rich and loving family ?
   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

3. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

6. i think as comments flow , you ' ll realise this may not be so much of an unpopular opinion . nevertheless i must say you articulate yourself well . a  from this stranger .
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

7. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

   (ID: e3a37ef234435ebde735894f98de2b3f90e3bbe9)

10. it ' s the equivalent of canned laughter  the reader is being prompted to laugh . i ' ll laugh if i think something is funny . in fact , if i read something funny but the writer includes a " lol " , i will stifle my laugh . principles .
   (ID: ed9fd9ff218602605c7fbdf8f02f658604680c61)

11. do you think he  ll go anyway ? no matter how you feel about it
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

12. i don ' t think you should feel embarrassed . as far as i understand , you didn ' t really have a choice back then and your friend will probably understand this . i think he ' ll mainly be glad you ' re doing fine now .
   (ID: bfc2e9a6e5f84327293fa1a1fd0287066782bcec)

13. do you think he supports negligent homicide investigations for miscarriages ? either a fetus is a person , or it isn ' t  if you push hard enough , i bet you ' ll find that ryan ' s beliefs have the same inconsistencies as most republicans . it ' s not about preserving life . it ' s about punishing sluts .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

14. my first attempt with these two characters i  ll gladly link you to when i get to my computer , it  s not nearly as good as this one i think but i  m glad you appreciated it ! bob and ervin are pretty much gonna be regulars around here now !
   (ID: 9f681f3dedb4dcecbe41b42dada5f72caae05ebe)

15. why does every customer think  i don  t have to pay , right ?  is the pinnacle of comedy ? honey that wasn  t funny the first digit times i heard it today . that  ll be digit fucking digit .
   (ID: 280643182527d573e119c7952a08fea10d62edd8)

16. i  m a big decepticon fan , and these guys are an inescapable purchase for me . even moreso because i  m in canada and the wait sucks , so i  ll go stateside for it online . one of the thing i think some people have overlooked is that since there are digit bots for devestator , in order to make the star math work , we see the firsts 4pt filler bots .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

17. expectations were also low for you in digit . you looked terrible in your friendlies , right before that world cup . we ' ll see what happens ! if you don ' t advance , i still think you ' ll do better than last time .
   (ID: 3fb1292a0bd26711d797fe1a61e6229794c21b68)

18. i think bethesda will react quicker as soon as they realize is atomic shop items being duped , and they losing revenue . as of now i don  t think they give a damn . never said anything bad about game or studio before . until today . i  ll upvote this  cause i agree to the degree .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

19. another good strategy is to have foreknowledge of whether or not they say " shoot " at the end of the phrase , and then do the opposite of what they do to disrupt the round to give them more time to think , and generally they ' ll not choose rock since they had to think for a longer period of time , and will digit  of the time choose scissor , allowing you to choose rock and beat them .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

20. the book is pretty cool , some good tips and a good little side story , don  t think it  ll help you game any though but i think you  ll enjoy it
