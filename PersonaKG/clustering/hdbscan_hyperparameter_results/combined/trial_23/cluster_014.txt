10. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .

11. i would love to use my most out  there as middles , because they might be too much as firsts , and it would get annoying dealing with questions or having to explain it , but i really do like weird names .

12. the repairs on the car sound reasonable , once the transmission starts to go , my guess is a faulty fuse or a wire grounding out somewhere , i ' d say pay the to fix it and save more money for a car , i love my honda civic she still like new though not for long ha ha
