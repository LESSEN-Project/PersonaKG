4. argue all you want hahahaha . that ' s the answer . they sign up thinking they ' ll " serve their country " , get used to hurt other humans instead , then get unhinged because of it . a great package of stupid from the veto  go , too cowardly to refuse to hurt others during , and weak minded afterwards .

7. look at the sun first . then look at the data of the other planets in the solar system . you may find that there might be something similar going on ? you may also want to look into nasa ' s current observations on sunspots and solar activity and the average temperatures since this sun cycle ended . either your suv is reaching and has changed the heat of pluto  or . well , maybe i ' ll let you be the observational scientist . meanwhile , all the climate projections have been wrong since mr . gore ' s power point presentation . why ? it deals mostly with carbon dioxide , not the sun   and not a single climate projection that i have reviewed has ever taken in account of the heat sync ability of the earth ' s oceans .

9. do you want cell service on it ? i bought a  digit tracphone at walmart for my toddler to watch netflix on during a trip . it has all the things you mentioned . it ' s locked to their network so you ' ll never be able to take it essential l elsewhere , but it seemed to handle what i required of it .
   (ID: 6eec77fe98b9dc85ec1e5e7edc37cdb415794719)

   (ID: 1afb7597077681179430af152997f04fd73ba0ee)

18. i play online vs exclusively . i ' m not saying this to piss you off , but i can poke check and stick lift all day long and hardly ever get a penalty . my poke checking could arguably be considered poke spamming i do it so much . it ' s all about proper positioning and timing for those poke checks , and never poke from behind . as far as stick lifts , they work very well during puck battles , especially along the boards . if your opponent gets possession , lift that shit right away you have to be fast and it ' ll almost always come loose and back to you . i ' m not saying it ' s perfect far from it , but if you ' re getting penalties on poke checks and stick lifts either your timing or positioning is off . go ahead and downvote me if you want , but i hardly ever get penalties for pokes and lifts . almost all my penalties are checks into the boards that ea will randomly call boarding or charging .

19. you should do the thing you want to do . otherwise you ' ll just give the wrong impression and just have dead end conversations with people you don ' t care about and waste all your free time for the rest of your life .
   (ID: aac8075b69856b11cb4307ac267b902010d66e3a)
