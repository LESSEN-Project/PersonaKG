6. well guys do tell me i ' m hot , but they say that about so many guys that i think it ' s just something they habitually say and it really doesn ' t mean much . it ' s also such a 1980s saying that i ' m surprised anyone still uses it lol ! i suspect they ' re just settling since they couldn ' t get any of the hot guys .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

   (ID: 8487a8406f04273c554e2e578c3a667648916790)

8. thanks , that only made me think everyone else was doing the same thing , and doubled down my fear that they were just tolerating my presence out of politeness . that ' s pretty much how all of society works , we all just tolerate each other existence . you fit right in .
   (ID: 225291489bc1a4ddf3d197a3062fa9ff935f3029)

   (ID: cae6d1fb1a818280e66de4a71148560d2d217d70)

10. every reply you make to one of my comments , you just keep getting more and more unintelligible . i think you should be less focused on this kid ' s schooling and more on your own .
   (ID: 3158d7c63f10e871a80f147fb47725c8714163c7)

   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

12. i mean he has a point  when kids are crying and stuff to their parents because they didn ' t make the playoffs they are being kinda spoiled . i just don ' t think that it is rooted directly from getting an end of the year trophy . there are probably other parenting issues there .
   (ID: 89c3606d2dfc5d2a2da97fb49ddc1894f8bf330f)

13. some would argue if a company has interviewers who get off on asking overly technical questions you ' d be better off not working there . just something to think when you choose to grill people with random unrelated  to  work algorithm questions .

15. i don  t think they are ugly , i just think it  s interesting to see something marked on someone and think what was the motive behind the tattoo and what  s the story .
   (ID: c5e877ff3be5d3571f5fe899f55887a6f608ee98)

17. the digit year old can use a full size cue i would say . i dont think the set is a bad idea considering how young it seems your youngest is . just dont expect them to be great quality
   (ID: 6eb8259d7d6b7ae101dda44ceaaf3b9edaab4fad)

18. you think you wanna lose weight because your mind is already tricking you , but you really just wanna get toned . please tell somebody in your real life , it  s already slipped from your control ! it pains me to see how young you are
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

19. i don ' t think there is any " one " for us . i think there are many potential people for all of us . if we just spend our lives bettering ourselves , being alert yet patient , we will find happiness . in ourselves and in someone else , if we so desire . all will work out . red  heart my two cents .
   (ID: 445ba4596e4bcff0c96b23f038cf784185970198)
