1. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .
   (ID: 535c3113ba487b9152c4b0adbe8c36822bc45ca4)

2. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

3. right ? i was so glad they played maud gone at that show , though i preferred their version at shaky knees the most . what did you think of the new stuff ?
   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

4. i sampled 1st chapter and part of the second . there are hints of effective altruism , but not much . also , this taylor is stupidly straightforward . one would think that utmost priority for a parahuman whose power stops working when she is seen would be ways to prevent being seen . the obvious idea is making a lot of smoke bombs , making suit out of them , igniting them all . if someone sees you , you turn into smoke  spewing teenager . as soon as smoke obscures you , you gain your powers back . once smoke dissipates , you turn into smoke machine again . that ' s the idea i got by thinking about cheats for a minute . taylor who lives this , whose life and death depends on it , would think of a hundred more cheats . she did not . i am disappointed . also , i feel compelled to ask the questions  spoilers about ending of worm  s " can taylor win ? if yes  why did simurgh choose this timeline ? why didn ' t contessa involve taylor in her path to victory right away "
   (ID: fae28587bce17296589bf92d656ad68ee32601d6)

5. i ' m in the same boat as you , friend . i ' m working on getting a degree in a conservative field but i really wanted to stretch my ears . so i did . mine are down to a 2g but they will still shrink back to piercing size . i ' d say the lowest you could go without irreversability is 0g but each ear is different .  i don ' t think irreversability is a word
   (ID: 50e37e2011f73f739f76098c3c746e27b8422fd7)

6. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

7. it ' s pretty well established that jesus did exist , i don ' t think that ' s exactly the point op is trying to make .
   (ID: 0fbaeef283f7b2090f763028c227ed73724f3e6c)

8. fallout digit super mutants . they think that they can roam the dc area and kill , capture , torture or   rape   make them more mutants mean they are the ' master race ' " oooh i am stronger than you so i can kill you ooh . how the hell did those assholes get out of digit and roam all the way to dc anyway ?
   (ID: 2731a84ac27fa3325bd3e2bf989471ffcb1456fe)

9. ok so how did those people kill them if they did not use a gun ? nobody ever tells me that part . i dont really care how because i kinda think dying by anothers hand is the issue . so to balance yourself before your audience could you please include the overall death rates ? its a sanity thing for me at this point . thanks .
   (ID: 457d7d37e1181cc932693cd4220e6fbfd564a75d)

10. they shook your hand and smiled at you because their religion instructs them to do so . if you gave a neighborhood party and a guy from down the street came and did something disruptive , i think you would consider it disrespectful in the same way people here think you were being disrespectful . i ' m finding it hard to believe you are actually this dense .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

11. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .

12. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

13. but he ' s an addict and i believe he was molested by his mother as a kid . he has done some nice things for his kid . he always apologizes or at least does something to get on their goodside . and honestly i think he did the right thing by telling fiona that sean still used .
   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

14. it may be a little unclear now that i think about it , but if you look at the timecodes , i also won the first lost run i did ever .
   (ID: c9b1e924c86788c982ec59df3d5704354a2a4ae1)

15. wow this was super interesting , you  re a good storyteller ! i don  t think you did anything wrong considering you were having your own experience and you couldn  t possibly read her mind if she was expecting more to come out of it but you didn  t do anything out of the ordinary . . in the meantime , don  t go into her restaurant until this is resolved
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

16. i don ' t think it matters if he lied or not . i think the only question we need to ask here is " did he use public money to pay her in any way ? " . if not , then i don ' t see the problem here .
   (ID: f7356e924b370675e942b29b9c2184dc895ea5b7)

17. i think we ' re in agreement ? or by ' yep ' did you mean you would stop loving your mother for money reasons ?
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

18. dude you are my savior thank you soo much . last two questions and i think we ' re done . where is hide ? last i saw he was working for the ccg as a news boy or something ? also why did furuta kill ghouls and ccg operatives ? is that why people think he ' s a spy ?
   (ID: 1cd062f77c729b2cea6d91996a2f94b1f5226415)

19. lmao seriously tho what did she think was gonna happen how could that possibly ever go good for her .
   (ID: 3e906e06d59fb5c2993270f0b4efed5b9ab122f7)

20. i think you did , unless you gave me the wrong info haha
