   (ID: bf662bc559367d8b6475102fe891d5e4eb072ffd)

4. i highly recommend getting the nathan drake collection for ps4 that has the first digit games on it . you can decide for yourself which is your favorite but they all have a lot of great moments and it ' s worth playing from the start just to see how nate  elena met .

8. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .

9. thanks a million ! just to pick your brain a little more , my flatmate has pokemon y , he told me there is a way to carry over stats when breeding . is this right . i may have misunderstood what he was saying though . edit  i am aware of nature and characteristics . but we were talking about defence stats and things .

18. yeah i understand ! it has a time and a place in my life i just made it an excessive habit and didnt treat it with the respect i should have i was a wake and bake every day into the night type of guy and i never admitted it was effecting me in an ill way because i was getting my work done and keeping things clean staying healthy but i neglected my mental state of mind living in an altered state of consciousness where i brushed everything off with a bowl just wasnt working for me anymore
   (ID: e3f34e146ce06ba2b5fc5a249c73494f93f56e86)
