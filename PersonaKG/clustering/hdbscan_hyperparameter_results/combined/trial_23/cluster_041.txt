   (ID: 8d5aac58a9c3a7e883f9e90df39dc5ab7c36de53)

18. the connections you make can be more important than the things you learn in the classroom . so if there are clubs and internships related to the job you want do them . look for jobs that have skills related to what you want to do , or can at least sell to your future employer . the worst ? you find out you hate what you are going into but can change to something else before you are too invested ! the best ? valuable connections that will help you get where you want to go . remember , its not what you know its who you know .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

19. don ' t you want to know the character you ' re writing about ? know what makes them tick ? what keeps them up at night ? the why behind the reasons for them doing what they do . someone doesn ' t masturbate with shit for pleasure because they had a normal childhood .
