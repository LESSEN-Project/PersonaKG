   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

10. i know i have no control over her life , but im going to be spending quite a bit of time there , as she is my girlfriend . and it ' s not just that i don ' t like the guy . he actually wants to fight me because i made my girlfriend mad once . i genuinley dont think she ' s safe living there with him .

   (ID: d650356549ff32c6bfb797b13c80b5a0d715da36)

13. good point ama71832 . this is also why i never take cash . we could make a little more here and there , supposing these pax promising cash aren ' t the same ones that promise to tip in the app . but any protection we have is taken away . which means the passenger won ' t be held liable for damage or messes unless you actually took them to court for it . it also means that in the case of an accident , you ' re now liable under your insurance . insurance not enough ? you can bet your ass the pax will sue .
   (ID: 9789fadf3a050c71c64ca7e31c4857fc9094d643)

14. i don  t understand this aversion to violence that you have . take electrical cars for instance , they  ve been around for decades and the only reason their use is not widespread is because of the influence of the car , oil , and car maintenance lobbies . cars cause , what , digit , digit  digit , digit deaths in the us yearly . is this not structural violence on a mass scale ? and how about if we were to apply this to big farming . syngenta , conagra , cargill , and monsanto now run all pretty much digit  of food production in the us . this has wreaked havoc on small family run farming operations as thousands of families have had to close their farms . is this not another example of structural violence ? there is no way to achieve the things you want  democratically  or without violence . the only way to achieve the things you want is to brutally and violently repress the ruling class , namely the purveyors of capital formation and accumulation within the transnational corporations . the transnational corporations will never relinquish their power and wealth willingly . to believe so amounts to liberal idealism .
   (ID: 77d0324af3e030bb9fb9365a16e870bd522fd275)

15. it ' s not great . it becomes the most important thing in your life , feels just as important to you as oxygen or water . you live from digit high to the next . always counting and making sure you have enough , rationing what you have in your head so you have enough til the next day . most times you don ' t stick to the plan cause you gotta get high , no self control . so you have to wait hours lying awake or wasting time til the dealer has time to meet up with you again . then there is all the lying you have to do to keep up appearance . once people know chances are they will stop talking to you . you ' ll become isolated because of the stigma around being an addict . just doing the drugs alone is enough for people to tell you to stop talking to them . so you gotta lead a double life . only a few people know that i use because i knoew they don ' t judge , but i ' ve also misjudged some people who did judge me .
   (ID: b25bdf3935142c93d642393810cba283ec3b801f)

16. definitely say something . call her , though . tone can be kind of difficult to determine through text and you don ' t need want to give her any more reasons to push you away even more . " hey , insert sister name . how you doing , casual chatting , blah blah blah . i need to talk to you about something . i feel insert everything you just told us . i know it ' s your wedding and you can do whatever you want , but i ' m starting to think that you don ' t even want me there . if not , that ' s fine bc you ' re kind of being a bitch and i could do without all the cross country trips . if you genuinely want me to be a part of the wedding , then act like it and maybe ease up a little bit " . feel free to modify to your liking .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

17. and literally what do you have to show for it now ? that ' s why i quit video games . they are a distraction honestly . could be focusing on so many bettecooler things in life .
   (ID: 4a5a9ac8eab027b38804427b3c8c5e19c8991de3)

18. eating smaller amounts isn ' t the hardest thing in the world if you eat the right stuff . things you " can ' t live without " you will still miss most likely but will find other wonderful things instead . rip pizza eating right in a controlled environmental is easy , eating right elsewhere is hard . so the restaurant put fries on your plate even though you asked them not to ? not an excuse to eat them . meat is awesome forever . ok i knew that already but it ' s still true .
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

19. my girl ' s from nebraska and yuengling is a special treat for them because they can ' t get it over there . i think it ' s fucking gross ! give me a natty boh any day !

20. for me the only thing that worked was a motion sensor sprayer connected to the hose . gave the cats a hefty drench but didn ' t hurt them , and meant my kids weren ' t stepping in vile cat poop . the moggies soon learned to stay away .
