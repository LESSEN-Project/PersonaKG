--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 72

1. you ' re staying strong mate , good to hear . it might be unnecessary to reward yourself ' cos you ' re doing so well anyway , but you could always treat yourself with something like a massage , pamper treatment or the like . your way of rewarding you , if you think about your winnings and the fact you ' re not pissing your money away on booze instead like we all have , i reckon it is well deserved ! not your thing ? ziplining ?
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

2. yeah . i dont get that . even as someone who likes trump , this is something i think is okay to make fun of . he even makes fun of his own typos like when he typed covfefe
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

3. do people actually think like this ? you can ' t control the sex of your kids . well actually i think nowadays you can , idk how expensive it is what difference does it make if you have boys or girls anyway . if everyone had boys , there ' d be no one to reproduce in the next generation .
   (ID: 419b67e0e2cdcb7bd8ea9a89d34d0747a1f5f620)

4. i think a lot of this comes down to the definitions of coercion and seduction . yes , in seduction the idea is to do your best to be enticing to someone . however , this should not be confused with a bending of their will or a manipulation . coercion is doing whatever is necessary to achieve a desired response from someone else , including putting extra pressures on them , which can be easily done if the coercing party is in a position of power , whether that is physical strength , employment , or status . seduction is like giving someone all green lights , coercion is like trying to take the steering wheel .

5. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

6. no problem . hopefully there are more like you in the world . fair play to you for wanting to brighten up a strangers day . another thing would be leaving post  its on mirrors in public toilets telling the next person how great they look  have a lovely smile  fabulous hair . or if you are out to dinner and it ' s really good , specifically ask to see the chef and give them a tip . i don ' t think they get them very often .

7. i think most men over digit before that most males would do a pig if it had big boobs prefer the natural look and the covers of these magazines are what women think what men like . the porn industry never realised this and tries to blame its fall in profits on piracy but the reality is that people would rather watch the videos of real people unenhanced by surgery that are widley available online for free .
   (ID: 3f0409a6efb16c26d2f9f7a14f5e75b8945ba427)

8. so what do you think about it do you like it ? i mean sans in one of the best video game characters and fortnite is one of the epicest games so it ' s a good combo . what do you think ?
   (ID: 409a49cde6f1f65f92cac4d33c7c769f7ba9e965)

9. no way ! i grew up on the prequels so i have the nostalgia goggles going on . that being said , i rewatched them last year after years of not seeing them and view them differently now . i like the phantom menace , but still think jar jar and anakin significantly make the movie worse . i do hate that the actors suffered immensely after the film but that doesn  t change that their movie parts sucked .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

10. i would like to think that certain future events could be dreamt about occasionally . but that ' s a different story . i think that this time it is more likely subconscious thing . there is stuff bothering me . either that or i was visited by an evil entity at least i go to heaven ? lol .
   (ID: 7a3a98777bf2cebb6bd14409075a19b82035e535)

11. true , but to me , i think it seems like a question they should be answering rather than asking . that ' s why i ask several questions about working conditions and technologies used , etc .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

12. i like that . i think the origin of " god bless you " was the belief that when you sneeze some of your soul escapes .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

13. it  s more like you return to home . i think it  s a pun on peter being a kid like spider man get back home ! or the chancla !
   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

14. it looks like a rose , i can see how some people would like this . because they think that they are special little flowers .
   (ID: 3b45915d58b20f0e2abb6b26d4534980a5d3aa68)

15. i think everyone pronounces their ts like ds if its in the middle of a word
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

16. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

17. i like the way you think thinking  face but i don  t think that  s how it works
   (ID: 1bb2b5ec27ad0397aea65ab5151bd4a19742f52a)

18. oh okay , yeah i can see what you mean there but i think that there are more people then me that post stuff like this on here anyway . you never answered what makes me an attention seeking whore from this ?
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

19. maybe fairies ? i think that would be really cool . i like dragons more but i ' m afraid they might destroy the world .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

20. yeah the whole politically correct culture is pissing me off . and i think it ' s really a small group of people claiming to be offended . seems like outrage is like a currency these days .
