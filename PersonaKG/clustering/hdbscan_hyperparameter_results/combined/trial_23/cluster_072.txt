   (ID: 4167b7bc7d40ac86ca6b492ac0bbaefa992711f6)

2. seems like a wholesome , genuine bio and its good ! to maybe spur more interest , i would add what your favorite burger spot is as well as where you enjoy getting pizza from . someone may relate or have that in common with you and will give you a reason to ask her on a date , like if she enjoys , " digit guys " then maybe you could both grab a bite over some convo !

   (ID: 199ca187d50b43aebb52968a5525289cb65a1520)

4. my favorite book series is the dresden files by jim butcher . the quality of the first couple books isn ' t great , so i recommend starting with dead beat book digit in the series . that will give you a feel for what the series as a whole is like , and if you like it , then go back and start from book digit .

5. we as humans like to apply black and white labels to everything . there is nothing wrong with emotions . there are things wrong with what people do with them or how we feed them
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

   (ID: 0163212450bac6366408ac8e1e025d32048839ec)

7. one of these things are not like the others .
   (ID: 5a485308ca6e36eb17d7b0fc321fcf7695f3af53)

8. i find it ' s a irrelevant question . " favorite hands " so you over play them pre cuz you like it and lose equity with it ? and would you over fold your " hated " hands and lose future value because of it ?
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

9. so you also like watching woman step on things ?

10. digit things . while this is a good written theory , i see digit flaws . if in the game ' s 2nd act , you go down natsuki ' s path , her manga is brought up , in black text spoopy text she states " my dad would beat the sh  t out of me if he found out " saying she had some prior experiance with his ' abusive ' nature . next is the hidden random poem called ' things i like about papa ' in the end it states " i like it when papa is too tired to do anything " stating he is not a good father , making her happy when he wont do anything . it also says stuff like " i like when papa doesn ' t comment on my friends " and other things . maybe she ' s a good cook because her dad doesn ' t make food as quoted in the poem " i like when papa cooks for me " saying she likes when he cooks and she doesn ' t have to . can i also add that it states " for me " making it very possible that she has to cook for him .

11. anime is a genre no different than a type of music , and yes it may have many subcategories like most things do . you can keep trying to justify your point though .
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

12. i would go around sticking my penis in things . if i ehaculate in or near that thing , then that is what i like .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

13. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .

   (ID: 03d15a94c7d0f2138a5e5c0cf7e503c341abbf78)

16. as someone who stays outside the usa i can honestly say that i ' m not even surprised any time he says things like this any more . i should be shocked or embarrassed for him but i ' m way beyond that .
