4. that ' s pretty neutral , it ' s always best to be positive and not talk about what you didn ' t like but what you did like . for instance , your old boss might have been a real hard ass , riding you all day . instead of saying that you could say your old boss was really involved in my day to day tasks and was really focused on the job getting done . i learned a lot from him . this is not a lie and it spins the situation in a positive light .

5. a friend of mine was being a dick on a constant daily basis after a recent event happened . like he would criticize every thing i did like how i played a game or ate food or even laughed . it bothered him so much he had to say something harsh every damn minute . but his comments pissed me off so much after a few months that one day i snapped and screamed in front of all our friends " diego you became a fucking asshole ever since your dad died " and there my moment was .

6. that ' s horrible ! law should protect people no matter what , not allowing to hurt them legally . i ' m from poland . my physics teacher is roasting and disrespecting whole lgbt  and other minorities all the time . he ' d better teach us physics but noooo . he ' s been teaching in this school for years and it seems nobody ever complained about him to the headteachers , or they did but it had no effect . i guess there are multiple teachers like him here . even wort ones
