1. as someone else said , you need to go with it . two ways to do it  have a comeback . you said you ' re not good at it , but keep trying to think of some even after the fact . if they ' re falling into patterns with what they ' re saying , you should be able to use one of those . build off one of their digs and take what they said one step further . part of this might all be part of being low man on the totem pole , but you want to show you have some edge so you ' re not always that guy . good luck op .

9. make the difference between what you really need and what you want . for the want , don ' t buy immediately , think about it , would that really make you happy ? often it ' s only a happy boost at buying time , an instant gratification and nothing else . many would think it ' s miserable life but it ' s all the opposite , the want i end up buying are things i really want .

14. true story  my friends dad built houses for a living . he had a black guy working for him . the black guy was scared of dogs . the friends dad says ' as long as you are working he won ' t bother you ' . so the black guy would carry ply wood back and forth on the job site . the friends dad asked him why he was doing that and the black guy said ' cause i want him to think i ' m working a comin an a goin '
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

15. i think the division is really individual . i believe in a social democratic society which benefits everyone with some laissez  faire social spheres where there  s a general decorum . if a thoroughly studied , evidence based concept can  t be discussed or legislated without fist fights in the street , it  s not worth discussing at all ! but there are tonnes of people who want more autocratic , paternalistic state interventions on both sides of the aisle . i think all of them are crazy as individuals . face  with  tears  of  joy unlike what either extreme believes , becoming insular and being the loudest person in the room doesn  t make them the smartest or the most right .
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)
