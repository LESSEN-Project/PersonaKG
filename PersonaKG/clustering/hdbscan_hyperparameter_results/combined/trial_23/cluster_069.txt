   (ID: f6b8978c4b660719e17dff38ba86c988b9bf86f5)

2. some random garden type thing that my mom brought me to when i was like digit . it was a wip then . i  ve brought it up multiple times , saying that we should go check it out , and she doesn  t remember . it  s too vivid to have not existed .
   (ID: c89ddae23e08cef80eb492a534ca8ddb441aa512)

   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

5. you  re not in the wrong . who wants to sleep around with a girl who might have stds ? even if she doesn  t , bragging about how many guys you  ve had sex with isn  t really impressive , it makes you look like a whore . he  s not slut shaming , he  s being smart .
   (ID: f72a72c8ffe94061edd962dd3f8293ca75595021)

6. you have one of the most incoherent ensembles i ' ve ever seen . gun , clothes , everything . and i like that a lot .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

7. don ' t let yourself take breaks . if your tired , take a minute and get back asap , but as soon as you say shit like " yah i worked hard , i deserve a break " you ' ve hit the other side of your motivation . momentum is key
   (ID: 5f43a3019d69696064ac659bf6dd25b51f1e5bb6)

8. i don ' t like playing russian roulette . easily digit  of the time i used to quickmatch i ended up alone . server browser is now my default . maybe since they ' ve been opening some of the dlc to non premium players it ' s gotten better . i should try quickmatch again i suppose .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

9. getting real tired of this dumb idea that comp and trim are now easy like you didn ' t have to do everything else on the req list . for comp the only difference is people who would ' ve paid a leech , don ' t have to , it hardly undoes everything else on the cape .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

10. listen , as i ' ve aged i ' ve come to find that someone somewhere will always find you attractive . regardless of what a census says . sounds like you ' re having an identity crisis .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

11. i feel like the  julia  guy would  ve gone to this extent to find her haha
   (ID: 80bb9445ee518d7503eeef1b2c418d38a6e936e9)

12. what state is that ? the reason i ask is i ' ve seen plates for all digit states before but i ' ve never seen one like that
   (ID: 7026695d5469f9ac5987bd602ce0be29968523db)

13. if you take longer than digit hours to respond to a text after we ' ve been replying at a half hour or so reply rate , you should by courtesy , apologize somehow or mention something you were doing that distracted you that long instead of going back to the conversation like nothing fucking happened . i hate that so much
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

14. nah man , even if you put the scenes in chronological order it still has no plot . i  ve tried to appreciate the movie , but nothing happens . compared to other tarantino movies , even ones light on story like kill bill , it doesn  t hold up .
   (ID: c418fa452eafbca022ce1c49b521d4574aa77cd1)

15. that ' s a really weird problem . if you ' ve set the saddles , intonation , and nut like you say the only other variable would be the frets are not cut into the neck in the right spots and i ' ve never heard of that
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

16. you ' d better feel sorry , i could ' ve looked at like two cat pictures instead
   (ID: 3994e1d32967dee02bf170d70c0ccc2d7dbd99d5)

17. looks like every other suburb i  ve ever seen including the one i grew up in . not that that makes it good . unamused  face
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

18. what ? you don  t t like to stretch a bitch open and look in awe at the damage you  ve done ?
   (ID: 840f5d9bddf24e024b9a70f13cdde62d41604e77)

19. sounds like she  s too shallow to understand your pov and what you  ve been through . personally , that trait alone could make or break a relationship for me .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

20. how is rick and morty compared to futurama ? i ' ve heard a lot of people like it but i haven ' t watched it yet
