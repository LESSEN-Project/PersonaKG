5. shmukatelli would do well to get to know someone with genuine gender dysphoria , and shmukatelli might learn some compassion for those with the condition . getting a sex change is not something one goes through on a whim . neither i , nor anyone in my family is like this that i know of but if my children ever came forward as such , i would support whatever decision they might make .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

   (ID: abbe051c76bbb939d8594349cac549cb5435920d)

7. i can safely say that that has never happened to me , although it sounds like an extremely dickish thing to do . i would put this to people who don ' t know anything about you judging you having seen you for about a minute therefore they are meaningless .
   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

   (ID: cd0b72d117bf74908c3edaaf3947b089a9dafc0c)

13. you know you ' re not a bad or dumb person for not getting every cultural or artistic reference in everything you read . hell , the simpsons and family guy are full of references to art , pop culture , literature and more . many people miss some of the references but still enjoy the surface story . having said that , i do like to look  stuff  up when i come across something that seems to be fact based in a piece of fiction . i read a lot on an ipad and highlight something , and use the web  search feature . it takes a little longer but hey , it ' s not a race . take it easy .
   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

14. pulp fiction . interesting directing but the plot as a whole was awful and the witty dialogue couldn  t make up for a lack of a sense of purpose . an issue i have with many nonlinear stories is that it detracts from the tension in certain scenes . it  s like when you  re reading a book and see that there  s still digit pages left , so you know nothing bad is going to happen to the main character .
   (ID: c418fa452eafbca022ce1c49b521d4574aa77cd1)

15. i feel like if i went there , everyone would know my name . coach would pull me a beer and i could put the world to rights with norm .
   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

16. actually what your describing is a thing that has nothing to do with anger . " call of the void " is when you see an opportunity to do something you know to be horrible and feel a sudden urge to do it . this happens to let your mind know it has control over the situation . like standing on the edge of a cliff . the mind goes " this is scary , i could fall , i could die " so the next step is " i could kill myself , but i won ' t kill myself , so i ' m not going to die . does that make sense ? tl  dr you ' re fine , everybody feels this , it ' s a way to feel in control .
   (ID: d54a04c3eba52404f5dd7abb0e459a949dbc7f93)

17. i can  t seem to remember any right now but when someone keeps saying  like  you . already know they  re making the story or dream they have right on the spot
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

18. but how will i know what the food looks like if i dont take digit pictures . then i complain the food is cold and send it back . the sad part is that shits probably true for some people .
   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

19. you know what would solve this type of shit ? eliminate riders that have nothing to deal with the proposed bill it is attached to . riders should have been eliminated a long time ago . when i was a little kid i was wise enough to see the stupidity in riders and now i am in my digit ' s and this bullshit is still going on . i once read a defense budget bill that included removing certain animals from the endangered species list . why the hell would something like that be attached to a defense budget bill ?

20. to be fair i kind of find it interesting . being a straight furry is like being gay in the world . we ' re made fun of , some people ignore us very small minority , but still , and its very difficult to find people you can relate to . so you won ' t find solice here . it ' s the world upside down and its sometimes fun to see what would the world be with lgbt being the majority . i know it can sometimes suck , but hey , being a furry is a choice unlike race or in some cases , arguably , your attraction . you have to put up with all the bullshit , but you can quit at any time .
