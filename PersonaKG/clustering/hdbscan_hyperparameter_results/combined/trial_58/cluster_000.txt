   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

15. because everyone told me that it was bad as a child without being able to explain why . i got a lot of " it just is " which was about as useful as tits on a nun . i ' ve always had a weird trait , though . when someone tells me to stop asking questions or to stop thinking , i do those things even more . so , after being told to just accept things for years and years , i decided to start reading for myself . after all , i had this internet thing . then i had college . i started reading about all sorts of people . people fighting for social justice long before that became a pejorative , people fighting for economic justice . and also the people who conned other people in the name of those things . i came to a few conclusions  capitalist don ' t give half a flying fuck about the people on the bottom  be they workers , consumers , the old , the infirm , or some combination thereof . if they do seem to care , it ' s usually for the following reasons  they were personally impacted by a certain issue , they need to boost their pr , or and this is insanely rare they are actually decent people that managed to get wealthy . that communism seemed a tad extreme for me . also , that i doubt the human race is capable of actually committing to communism on a large scale without succumbing quickly to greed for power and wealth . that socialism seemed like a pretty nice compromise . take the good things that you see in a capitalist society , but remove the parts that shit all over those at the bottom . my views haven ' t really shifted all that much from those points i realized around ten years ago . i have gained far more knowledge since then , and i have realized that i am an outcast within my own region of the united states . the south is the most backward thinking place i have ever seen . they have some of the most government dependent citizenry , but they convince that citizenry to vote against their own interests and give the elite more power and money . and the thing is , i ' m torn . do i try and save the south which seems damn hard when even the liberals i know wholeheartedly embrace capitalism and shun socialism ? do i scrounge as much as i can and get the fuck out for friendlier waters which seems a tad cowardly and defeatist ?
   (ID: 73a501f273781aa2c0deb878ecb02dcab3a9d4d3)

16. science doesn ' t have to give any explanation , but it could point out the reasons why someone is ' messed up socially ' which would be the first good step towards change . better than the typical religious explanation which is something like ' you need jesus in your life ! that ' s why you are messed up ! let ' s pray together ! ' and ' purpose ' in life ? that ' s easy . it ' s whatever you decide it is . sure , it might be hard deciding , but in the end it is still your choice to make .
   (ID: d02dbb1cf70aa95df2b9f1bbd0a0c5bf0a966933)

17. so many questions . how did you breach that subject without pissing her off ? also , can you recommend a doc ? final cost ?

20. always feeling like i was underpaid at work . i felt like i did more work than most and was getting paid less . so in turn i would stop going out of my way and would only worry about myself and my digit every week then i ' d be done . no overtime , no extra work , no nothing and my work eventually declined with my attitude . ended up at a new company who went far out of their way to accommodate me i lost my license and driving to jobsites in a company van was a huge part of everyday and they actually got a whole new insurance policy that would insure me being red flagged when i got my license back . i started off really low on the totem pole only being digit but i worked my dick off and brought back my good habits and my great work ethic . i ' m now digit , been with this company for digit years and happily work overtime and go out of my way because they took risks on me , and even gave me our biggest hospital contract to date . they took the chance on me so i repaid them by giving them digit
