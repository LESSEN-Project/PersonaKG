1. your argument is therefore  " there is one candy in the shop . i have a penny . some guy comes along , and tells the shopkeeper he ' ll pay a dollar for that candy . shopkeeper sells it for a dollar . " so , i can complain about why should i not get candy just because some rich people decided it ' s worth a dollar ? that ' s called socialism . the real question then is , if the city is getting richer and more propserous , why are these poor people still poor ? something wrong with wealth distribution here .
   (ID: e3524b3478c664f2c6e8b00a4341ff0a26995fbc)

2. i am trying to show you how i feel when you tell me to do something because of your " lord " i won ' t stop cursing until you give me a fucking reason other than a deity with a debatable existence said it isn ' t okay . why don ' t you try and help those over at atheism or at least get some questions answered by somebody smarter than me ? many people there are smarter than me .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

3. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

   (ID: 89fd53ef642d85d9a24d63f88469480646354104)

5. you fucking did a discrimination ! and wait , kid ? say it to yourself motherfucker , do you think you ' re mature when you said something like that ? and better get life rather than visiting subs you ' re not subscribing to , just to spread the hateful soul in you . better find your life , unemployed jerk !
   (ID: e4e6a770eda3d8a5505365978baee4568affe531)

6. negative , i ' ll only downvote if you ' re been a moron , but you ' re have a discussion . the greeks and romans were so far ahead of their time it wasn ' t funny . i believe their gods were humans with godly attributes or skills .
   (ID: 65b64663fe8890c471866a25cf075ff50d852dbf)

7. i ' m waiting for the part where it affects you , because right now you are being offended for someone else . and the reason it was in the title was because it was clearly a joke , something that isn ' t serious at all .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

8. upvotes dont validate my existence so do downvotes dont eliminate my opinion just to tell you once again , the person you call indogs has way way more stars than you i believe , you ' ll never even get to digit stars yet you call the person dog ? do u even know why he changed his flag to singapore ? so pathetic , throwing shits with no valid reason
   (ID: e4e6a770eda3d8a5505365978baee4568affe531)

9. i apologise then . i see this a lot from trolls so i had a knee jerk recation . i ' ll tell ya , being white doesn ' t affect my job , my social life , or my relationships . racism happens , that shit is real , but it ' s never had any serious impact in my life .
   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

10. my initial reaction to this was anger and confusion which means i can learn from it if i try to understand you calmly . please expand on why you feel wealth inequality to not be bad .
   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

11. wow a trumper yeah if you voted for him your a racist moron weather hillary was a bad candidate is imaterial and if you think democratic socialism and socialism are the same thing just shows how out of touch with reality you are . hopefully one day you ' ll go back to school and try again
   (ID: 0def2b70456d7a000d0e2b3611ac80cd2990e21c)

12. i ' m confused on your stance on racism . in another comment you claim you were denied into a committee of sorts based on you being white . so you understand what racism is . yet you make a statement like only asians and jews are good at math . sounds to me like you ' re delusional . a stereotype is formed from ignorance and ignorance comes from not understanding or not wanting to understand  which fuels racism . so unless there was a misunderstanding , i think you and i have different definitions of what racism actually is .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

13. you think nobody has ever typed out a bunch of paragraphs telling me to shut up before ? i ' m not going to stop and there mods abandoned this sub years ago . you ' re the one who opened up a comment that was downvoted into oblivion , don ' t open up comments that have been buried if you don ' t want to read them .
   (ID: 24bccbf5956c17ad493afaca1dced8dd5090f865)

14. typical nerdy white english man they can  t grow balls and actually conversate in an argument instead just say something silly over and over again until they feel like they have  won  the argument , your winning an argument by repeatedly saying the same shit over and over again , your a women
   (ID: 7dfa169bdfe2df7e214baa35fc2f2b73cbb10c46)

15. like how you assumed i have a side not religious at all i don ' t care about abortion , i ' m simply pointing out the double standard of " it ' s my body " until the kid is out and then it ' s " but you helped make this kid , so pay up " even if the father doesn ' t want to or can ' t .
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)

16. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

17. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

18. hahahahaha . no buddy . telling someone words is not a threat to them . actually committing acts is a threat to them . they have shown time and time again that they are willing to actually kill people . stop fucking defending these fucks . they ' re scum . and they deserve everything that is coming to them .
   (ID: fe56409176d2a6089f323227d5b07061f851d63b)

19. you have a perceived notion on the us government ' should ' run . which you literally just proved my point . you don ' t understand how they actually work .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

20. you are absolutely correct . they are just points . what the main idea is that they are all a part of several things that you have to consider before just simply saying  giving that land to corporations is just an absolutely horrid idea .  i don  t want to be type of person that draws a conclusion too quickly . instead of seeing a headlining article and jumping on the bandwagon how about going to local sources of the are affected and reading more of what is actually going on . such as my first post , what if it is meant as a means to preserve a community by giving it more land to develop and increase revenue , as opposed to letting it turn into a ghost town and go to waste ? my comments might seem incoherent to you if you don  t take the time to understand , or even ask me , what it is i am trying to say .
