1. i have been in a similar situation . you just got paroled my friend . look at it this way . you can be happy now . that relationship ? that was never going to happen and your attachment was just going to make you more miserable as time went on . now you finally have the opportunity to find someone who will make you happy . you  re like truman burbank stepping out of the studio and into the real world .
   (ID: ead4924f7abc0f9258d2b484a3f379aedee2cc5c)

2. just be straight forward with her . i can  t tell you how to bring it up , you need to figure that out on your own , not on reddit . if it comes from you heart and voice , it will feel sincere and she will know . be yourself and just tell how you feel . that is it . hope everything goes alright .

3. if things change that quick there is a hidden reason for it . maybe something like a better option if she was seeing someone else around you and you were a close second . maybe an ex contacted her again . maybe there was an aspect in your later talks that she couldn ' t get past . either way i think it ' s a lack of communication on her side as to what the reasoning for the drastic shift was . luckily you were early into it and minimal damage is done . one thing i ' ve always told myself and kind of my own line " expectation only leads to disappointment . " remember that , if it ' s expected and happens , it ' s nothing special . if it doesn ' t happen then it ' s only negative emotions .

4. i had a friend . my best friend . i accepted who he was , whenever he has a girlfriend he begins to be on a high horse and judge everyone . he wasn ' t the greatest . college dropout , dead end job , but our clique of friends still loved him . then he started to have girlfriends and began to judge people for what they do . he judged my friend with benefit and so on . eventually he had his third girlfriend and essentially stopped picking up all our calls and invites to boardgame night and beer night . something we been doing for digit years , all cause a girl thought it was lame to have boardgames . eventually we started to do other stuff like go out and take trips . we never spoke to him ever again and from what i heard , he has two jobs just to support his gf ' s party habits . oh well . i cared . once .

5. you didn ' t mention your age . if you ' re coping well with your problem i wouldn ' t bring it up right now . however if you ' re struggling you may want to bring it up to your more understanding parent . your sister may feel that you are trying to steal her spotlight , is that something you think she may feel ? you would know her tendencies better .
   (ID: 2904e4959568457dd43970d8388e42064d7c7d34)

6. what am i suppose to say ? what ' s done is done , no need to keep feeling guilty and letting it eat me up for months messing with my mind and shit . just letting go now and not letting it bother me sounds way better then letting stuff fuck me up like most people do .
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

7. been there and it wasn  t worth the time . the impact it has on you when you like and are not  liked  back is really negative . save your own time and feeling and withdraw .
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

8. nta . as a lesbian and as a human being with good communication in a good relationship , i see no issue with what you did . your other doesnt trust you and is very insecure . i ' d talk to her and if it didnt resolve , i ' d get a new girlfriend that trusts me enough to not cheat .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

9. hey we can go slap cows if u want . anything is better than making a permanent decision over a temporary feeling or circumstance . i don  t know why she  s being like that but she isn  t worth this kind of negative feeling . i know it doesn  t feel like anything else can help but sometimes it  s bc we are so invested and holding on so tight but when we let go it can be a big relief . just remember that her love isn  t what defines you so whether she loves you or not , your value is unchanged . people will love you the way you deserve , it just sucks we have to wait for it sometimes .

10. what do you think he  d do ? it  s it  s hurting you that much then you need to act before your emotions start consuming you . i wouldn  t take any of it personally though . some guys just like sleeping around for fun , and don  t realise how much it can hurt others . there  s millions of good guys in the world that are just around the corner . write this chapter in your life off and start a new one tomorrow .

11. well you ' re not forcing him to stay at home or not to meet his friends at all , you ' re only asking yourself why he still hangs out with her and the situation seems so odd , so i don ' t think you ' re overreacting . if i were you i would try to confront him ! you don ' t have to be together all the time but if she knows you ' re a couple and she has met you it would be polite to invite you as well as him my boyfriend ' s friends always invite me for instance . especially since he does immature tricks such as only telling you things once he has done them or he ' s halfway doing them like staying at her house , you should ask for explanations and if he tells you that you ' re overreacting maybe he just will never get it .

12. don ' t talk to each other for a year then become friends gradually
   (ID: 480e1d5457cca32a54c00398823abca7aae20b86)

13. there ' s nothing you can realistically do about this apart from get a hold of yourself and learnt to move past it . remind yourself that you have no reason to be angry about it and make sure you never treat your girlfriend poorly because of it

14. it happened about a year and a half ago . i am unsure if i could still do so . looking back on it now i wish i had right away . then again i didn ' t quite know what was happening . you hear about it and know the stories . outside it seems so simple but inside it is just a cluster of confusion . i definitely did not feel black and white about it . i was in shock about it and actually just didnt let my mind process it . not to mention the extreme victim shaming and drama that was ensued by my ex over it . the prioritizing of his own feelings . he callrd it " what you did " and how could i have done this " to him " . it distracted me from really ever doing anything about it . and yeah , it was a big thing in my life . still is . i ' m still dealing with it . i found out recently that this guy has another case against him apparently . if i speak out it would help the case . but i am trying to heal . and i ' m currently unsure if i pursue going to the authorities what will happen . will it reopen everything . make it worse . will everyone turn against me again . will i lose the little friends i have left . will i feel worse ? will i find closure ? i will have to tell my parents . now that will just open up more wounds and i am already swimming in lacerations . i am just unsure if i have the strength to survive all of those factors . and until i find that strength i have kept quiet . but then on the other hand i am beginning to feel that if speak up i will find more strength and maybe more closure than i thought i needed . i don ' t even want to face or him or ever see him again . because this guy made me believe that he really cared about me . the lies he told me . if i ever see him again i don ' t know how i would react and i fear that as well . part of me still cares for the part of him that he pretended to be . so it still scares me that i might feel those feelings if i ser him again . for me its hard to let go of that person because i really needed the person he was with that mask on . and i fell for it . ah i dont know . but i do know that hes young . and capable of getting better at being that way . so something needs to be done so he doesn ' t do what he did to me to anyone else , or worse .

15. damn that sucks that she did that to you especially when she knew your personality of being shy too . hopefully the relationship , if you  re in one now , has helped you through all of that .
   (ID: 1ab03d054f341c1ede82c7eb9f871db0a696e44d)

16. of course you aren ' t the same person . you ' ve grown ! i ' m struggling with similar issues and when things get overwhelming or even scary i just think , " you ' ve made it this far and now you know you can choose to be whoever you want to be . " if you weren ' t capable of being all those things you desire , you wouldn ' t have been able to put them into the persona . like you said , you took the best parts of you , but they ' re still you . i know it ' s not the way you want , but from your post , i like you as a person . no one i know personally would admit if they were involved in the sex industry . you ' re real and honest and open about your feelings and that is refreshing . so if i can like you as a person based off this , i don ' t doubt you will find someone if that ' s what you still end up wanting in the future .

17. did you ever talk about it ? with someone close or a professional ? i mean i was in an abusive relation once , took me a couple of years to get over the most troublesome aspects mostly because i acted like i was ok . but i ' m in a happy relation now . i ' ve just been really open about it with my partner and she knows that there are things that trigger me . she tries to help me with it . it ' s nice to have a partner .

18. you do need to suck it up eventually . at the end of the day you ' re the only one in control of your own happiness . this seems mean but it ' s the truth .
   (ID: a5abb0fc49ef940b208bd33b46b6b669a13fc83f)

19. hey , i know there ' s a thousand other comments on here , but just wanted to say real quick that you didn ' t do anything wrong . dude sounds like a hassle to say the least , and anyone who is willing to flip on you and humiliate you online is not someone you should be wasting your time with . that ' s some immature , disrespectful , petty shit . it seems like you feel guilty to an extent , which i understand , but don ' t linger on the guilt . once it passes you ' ll realize you did yourself a favor by setting some standards of what you will and won ' t put up with . lots of people choose to stay unhappy in their relationships and that is an unhealthy way to live .

20. i understand both of your perspectives . for you , seeing ryan get angry , aggressive and violent is likely triggering your emergency response that you felt when you were on the receiving end with walter . it  s awful . for him , he clearly loves you so much that seeing the piece of shit that hurt you , after a few drinks i assume too , he couldn  t stand to see walter out and having fun , escaping any form of justice for his actions . your argument is concerning . the way he views domestic violence survivors is extremely concerning , especially for a nurse . my advice is to have a rational , calm discussion . explain how his actions made you feel , particularly if they did trigger anything to do with your abuse . also try and understand from his perspective why he lashed out . you know him . but the most concerning thing is how he talked about your abuse . ask him if he honestly sees you as you , not as the dv survivor . he needs to understand that that abuse happened to you but you are not your abuse . at the end of the day , the best advice i  ve ever been given is to apply your situation to someone you love and care deeply about . what advice would you give that person ? you deserve safety , security and happiness . i hope it works out for you sparkling  heart
