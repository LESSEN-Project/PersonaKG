4. i think ugliejosh makes an excellent point and is not delusional , but rather rational and insightful . if there would ever be a hypothetical pre  revolutionary rupture within the imperial core , however unlikely , sympathetic elements within the u . s military  intelligence apparatus would be crucial for success . i would highly , highly recommend listening to the ' it could happen here ' podcast . it ' s essential listening for leftists of all stripes . also , eyes left is a very well produced leftist military podcast made by two socialist military veterans . there are many military veterans that are well seasoned activists and organizers that have participated in wto , occupy , standing rock , ferguson , etc . are you sure you don ' t want their help in fighting fascism , building dual  power , and maybe one day capturing the state ?

18. it cost you  digit to build the whole thing from start to finish ? or is that not including the case and wires and all that ? if it was digit bucks total that ' s pretty good . it cost me i think like  digit  digit or so to buy my te2 chun stick although it is an amazing stick all ways around so i like it a lot .

   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

20. nothing changed ? what are you talking about ? the defensive meta is gone after all the changes . it ' s not as reliable as before to stay on defense . for honor is in a digit times better place than it was when this year began and there was no way to do damage unless you picked a dlc character and everything was shadowed by timesnap and it felt clunky . sure , they need to optimize conq ' s bashes and some more character , but even if they leave it where it is , it ' s still a fuck ton better than year digit and a little bit into year digit .
