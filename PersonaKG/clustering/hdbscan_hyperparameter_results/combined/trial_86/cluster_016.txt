15. this is a very smart looking app . a few things that stood out to me as a software architect  i ' m not sure whether the iap unlocks this but it would be quite nice to be able to swipe back from full screen images like you swipe from everything else . it ' s especially a speed bump when using a phone with the right hand and not being able to reach the top left x one  handed . i ' m quite sure you have a bug in your comment folding . some comments fold gracefully but some fold the ops name too and then make it reappear below the fold which is a bit disorientating .
