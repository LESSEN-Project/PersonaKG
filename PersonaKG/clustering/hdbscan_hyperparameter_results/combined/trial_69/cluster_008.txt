1. i see your point but for an equal relationship where both parties are happy you need to care for your partner too , maybe it  s something you don  t really care about but i mean that  s how i do my thing and you do yours .

2. i think you really don ' t get it . we don ' t want a significant other , we do not want to find " someone to spend our lives with " your post and your opinion shows how little you actually know .

3. okay but what about men who sleep around ? it  s fine to think this as long as you hold men to the same standard

5. people are seldom rational about their sexuality . the flip side is that being in a relationship is so socialized into people from an early age that they fail to recognize that it  s an active decision that you need to make with another person and then participate in , the latter involving a continuous renewal of  wanting it  . you can look at others and feel sexually charged ! that  s human , but failing to recognize the decision you  ve made to be in a relationship is an active process is something that a lot of people end up screwing up . it  s not to make it sound like a chore ! certainly too there are other configurations of and agreements to relationships , but the primary recognition , as far as i  m concerned , is that you have to be an adult and responsible for making a choice to be in it . otherwise , why bother ?

6. well yeah of course , but most if not all guys are clueless then misinterpret reactions to mean a completely different thing than what she wants including myself . could you be a bit more specific with examples perhaps ?
