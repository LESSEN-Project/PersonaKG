2. " when you find someone you really like as a person , tell them that you hope it grows into a closer relationship . if they don ' t feel that way . all is not lost , platonic female friends are a good ally when you ' re in the dating scene . " i actually don ' t have very nice experience with this thing . once i confessed to a girl that i want a close relationship with her . she said she didn ' t want it . i then decided to continue platonic friendship with her . i was now looking after other girls . one of whom was showing some interests in me through her body language . i was now interacting with this new girl on regular basis . she was sending positive indicators to me . my platonic friend asked me about my interests in that girl . i told her that yes i ' m interested in this new girl . i was also thinking about getting some female perspective  thought my platonic friend would be good wing  girl . i confessed my feelings to new girl . she accepted . i was a happy dude . but my winggirl started telling me that my new girlfriend is not the ideal girl  that in her words " she sleeps around " . i said that i ' ll be careful . i was on a trip to family for a week . when i came back , my new gf was ignoring me . i felt something is wrong . i just didn ' t know what . i then went straight to her  asked her what is wrong ? she didn ' t answer me . i asked again . this time she said that she didn ' t know i was sleeping with my winggirl . i asked her about who is telling her such things . she said the name of my wing  girl . i was shocked to hear that . i don ' t know why she did it . if she didn ' t want a relationship with me , why was she ruining my relationships with others . i know i shouldn ' t use this blanket thing to stereotype everyone . but now i feel its far better to get rejected  move  on than choosing to remain friends .
   (ID: 5ec957438fa111872baaa0871df8459459cc2519)

3. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

4. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

5. nah . you two are obviously looking for different people . you want a first date hookup and she wants something more long term . at least you were blunt and now you both know how the other feels .
   (ID: 90779ea1e5aa2ec3ed3a1fa6b99a8207c0d66d3e)

6. digit you don  t have to meet him if you don  t want to . lots of people never really get closure , and that sucks , but really what is the goal here anyways ? you could easily exchange longer messages over email or something and give him closure that way . digit why are you so concerned about the image he has of you ? are you hoping that something will be rekindled ? otherwise i feel shattering that image that he has of you will probably just help him move on and you won  t have to hear from the ex again . digit even if you do meet up , you don  t actually have to reveal any information about yourself that you don  t want to . just keep it vague . there  s nothing wrong with just broadly answering  i  m taking out some time to figure out my life , i  ve grown out of x interest  etc . if the subject of what you  re doing these days comes up .
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

7. i would recommend advice for this , but i ' ll try to help as well anyway i think you ' re just friends by convenience . you ' re on the same team , you live near each other and give each other lifts , but beyond that , he has better friends and you don ' t . i ' ve been in that situation , there ' s not much you can do except to to find other , better friends , and accept that that ' s where your relationship is at . if you ' re scared to do things around him , find other friends and don ' t value his opinion of you so highly , that way if he does judge you , who cares ? as a rule , if a friend makes you feel uncomfortable in some way when you ' re around them , get out , find a better person to spend your time with   x200b    x200b

8. the same thing happened to me . i do believe that there are induviduals who misuse sm and take it too far crossing the line to rape . mine eased me into a light sm world . very light . made me trust him . told me all of these things . then when i was pulling away from him he went from digit  digit and choked me into a submissive state . when you fear for your life and that you won ' t wake back up the next time he chokes you until you pass out , you go into shock . or at least i did . i thought " i can ' t say no because if he doesn ' t get what he wants he will hurt me more " and that was a serious thing for me because i couldn ' t possibly have imagined that he wanted more . but he did . then he went right past sm and straight towards torture and humiliation . all without my consent . he knew exactly what he was doing . he knew from our previous discussions that i never would have allowed that to happen . he also knew me . so he choked me enough to make it happen for him . i ' m sorry you went through all that . sm can be really tricky , my personal experience aside . because i really don ' t have any . but i did do a lot of reading on it after my rape . to help me understand why . it takes a lot of trust . if someone goes against your comfort zones it is not a good sign . a sm shoukd always be respectful no matter what .

9. she probably doesn ' t have feelings for you , it was the drugs . that being said you still cheating on your boyfriend and that is uncool . you could keep quiet i guess , but the guilt will likely continue to eat at you . you should probably tell him the truth and not put yourself in a situation to cheat again .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

10. are you dating my ex ? he was the same , completely unhelpful despite me laying out the best way to support me through my bad days . now i  m with a guy who actually listens to me and the difference is night and day . my mental health and productivity has skyrocketed . nta for breaking up with a guy that gets you down because he thinks he knows what you need better than you do . there  s nothing wrong with breaking up over text , either , especially when communication is an issue .
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

11. yea i think that  s what it all comes down to at the the end of the day . i  m always looking for a quick fix or an escape or the easy way out , i need to just confront my problems . i know exactly who i wanna be , i  m just too lazy or scared to get out my comfort zone and just do it . but nobody can make the decision but me . no therapy , distractions , drugs are gonna do it for me . sorry if this is all rambling and incoherent , i  m still pretty blazed . but i think i  m starting to understand . you don  t know how much this means to me man , thanks

12. well if you  re not trying to impede on their relationship why do you want to tell them ? you  re secretly hoping they feel the same way to leave their so . stop lying to yourself and don  t ruin a relationship .

13. feels like a one side of the story . i could see how you weren ' t one that missed an opportunity to point out in the last digit . digit years to tell john he ' s a loser as often as he said you ' re a drone . i can ' t imagine someone would constantly harass you like that without anything coming back . but if he ' s truly the only " bad guy " in your stories , which i kinda doubt , then your reaction would be more justifiable . however , it was still incredibly childish and a dick move . just talk about the issue you have with him like an adult ffs . you guys are 27yo  is it so hard to talk about how you don ' t think it ' s productive to constantly harass each other ? what ' s the point ? and if he continues to be a child about then talk to your friends about it in a way  " look , i respect and want to support john in what he ' s doing and wish him all the success in the world  however he can ' t stop harassing me for what i am doing and is very insultive about my way of life  i don ' t see any other option than not interact with him anymore because he can ' t be an adult about the situation  then see what they have to say  might suggest . do that than rather making a fool out of yourself and completely escalate the situation in a childish way in front of your whole social circle .

14. nta . her life isnt your life . what do your parent want you to do in this situation , lol .
   (ID: 2e369dc21156ed2b443bc09084e27c8acb516093)

15. im diagnosed with anxiety and all i have to say is a couple things . i used to have panic attacks everyday . it was the worst years of my life . there is no way to get rid of anxiety . everytime i see someone ask " how do you get rid of anxiety " i just tell them my story and say there is no way . ive had it for so long that i get used to it . im aware its not going to go away . i listen to music , that helps . i meditate , hard but helps . i paint my nails and chill .
   (ID: 0ddaeffad510fe540496c0e0b97a1a85b13282eb)

16. if you like her go for it , forget what other people think and spend time with her . if you ' re interested show it ! respond to the winks with a smile , funny face , another wink or whatever you feel like , respond to her messages etc . if you dive into the situation you ' ll be able to find out what ' s going on . also don ' t get friends involved , even if she has . it ' s generally a disaster waiting to happen .
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

17. once i fully realized i was an alcoholic and couldn  t control myself like i had been desperately trying to do , i was like  fuck it , what can i do to make this downward spiral faster !  . eventually , i had a moment of being willing to try something different , even though i didn  t know how or what to do . six years ago , i went to a crappy rehab , where we couldn  t even have coffee and i didn  t always want to be there , but , i  ve stayed sober every day since . i  m totally not extraordinary in any way , i just decided to give doing something different a chance and be open to not  knowing  what was gonna happen . i hope you find some comfort , regardless of your next move or circumstances .
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

18. don ' t appease her for risk of breaking your lens , shes just being uncanny . let her come around , , , dont fold my guy its not worth damaging your lens . let her be passive , but when she comes around hold to your strong points you have in why you refuse to use it . but you realllllly shit the bed by using the word psycho ahahaha i mean like , its like if the story of rosa parks went way south ? like if people didnt have none of that sitting down shit . well , you just did that . ahah she will show you psycho now that you called her out . best wishes on that part .
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

19. i have the mentality of " well i don ' t like myself so why would other people like me . this just makes me push people away . the few people that i feel comfortable talking to always remain aquaintances .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

20. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .
