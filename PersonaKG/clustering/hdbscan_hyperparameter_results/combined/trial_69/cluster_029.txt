1. that ' s exactly what i said in the part you omitted lol
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

2. i mean if the government told me it was to help stop a world wide war and you weren  t going to get hurt and you believed them ? bull crap jumping on a bus hurts you and other things don  t and are debatable whether it  s a bad thing . that  s why i always hated that compassion that parents like to do . theres a difference between hitting someone because they told you to and jumping in front of a buss . for example in middle school once we were allowed to walk around by a teacher in the classroom this is important and a guy was pinching me and was chasing me so i kept walking away and he kept walking faster and so i ran and got in trouble . but would you really say did i deserve to take the blame for running ? look at it from the women  s point of view . if all of society and every authority figure told you your life and that of everyone you care about is in danger and the only thing you can do to help is hand out a feather . you would do it ! you gotta understand the whole context and the thing being done and the relative morality of it . individuals are not always responsible for there actions . there are always factors involved that take away the choice .

3. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?

4. except for my very first post where i said lgbtqwhatever , because that  s what those napoleons like to be called , please , show another one of my post , where i was arguing ? i simply stated what i strongly and firmly believe . now back to people , who like to suck dicks , being fuk in the ass , licking each other  i don  t care what they like to be called and what they think they are . they are mentally ill people to me . i could make myself more clear .

5. i understand but it seemed that your question didn ' t make any sense . a cop will give you a ticket if you break the law even if what you ' re doing makes sense as is safer than following the law . a cop will give you a ticket if he doesn ' t know the law or is having a bad day . your question doesn ' t matter , hypothetically or not . you do the best you can and try not to break any laws . sorry if i became outraged because i really wanted to understand and answer the question and really thought that i had , and it frustrated me that i didn ' t .

6. i know it ' s someone else since you replied with decency . just find it comical how my own view and something that should affect no one still offends people . it ' s a pathetic culture we have going on .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

7. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .

8. lol only total alt  right scumbags claimed that the nazis were left wing , now you have no credibility it ' s not for you because i know you ' ll never change your fuctupmind it ' s just to get you to say something stupid so the kids will know that your philosophy is a meaningless nothing just like those who espouse it .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

9. and you ' re the type of person who thinks so highly of themselves they can ' t even understand a simple joke . get your head out of your ass .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

10. i have never stated that disobeying an officer means you deserve to die . i don  t think that at all , i think that anyone when encountering the police should obey an officers orders because it gives you the best chance of getting through the situation with a a better outcomelesser charges and b reduces risk of bodily harm . please don  t put hateful intentions onto me as i wouldn  t apply them to you . i  ll i want is for people to be more informed on police work , by doing so we make lives easier for everyone

11. how cute , you think you know a thing about what people go through . try being bullied and shunned to an extent at digit different schools , 3rd grade until i went to college . oh , and you would all collectively call me a normie because i have an intimate relationship . don ' t assume you know a damn thing about any person who posts here because you simply dont .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

12. but reddit is a place where people care more about being morally right than factually correct . how dare you prove them wrong !
   (ID: d048a45810866f7b853972f50c2c2746bc339a21)

13. you have a perceived notion on the us government ' should ' run . which you literally just proved my point . you don ' t understand how they actually work .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

14. lmao how pretentious are you ? you write like a child found a thesaurus and thought it would make him cool . i understand the historical context . slavery wasn  t ok , slavery doesn  t justify genocide . white people were awful  brutalized slaves , doesn  t mean you should go and murder everyone with a drop of european blood . but sure , go ahead pretending you  re smarter than everyone else  justifying genocide , bud .

15. so it ' s okay to take people ' s rights away as long as they don ' t get angry about it . i am learning so many things today . thank you . you ' ve explained something to me that i didn ' t understand until now .
   (ID: 98df62eadd0a0c80a6084d5e352985209b46cce9)

16. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

17. oh okay , yeah i can see what you mean there but i think that there are more people then me that post stuff like this on here anyway . you never answered what makes me an attention seeking whore from this ?
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

18. imo when you say you believe in something , you stand up for it even when it doesn ' t benefit you . if you believe in freedom , then you have to protect people ' s freedom to do things you don ' t want to do . otherwise you were lying about valuing freedom .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

19. insular people have always done this to protect their own worldview . races , religions , ethnicities , classes , etc . they  ve all been scapegoated and hated for no solid reason because one group feels threatened . i dislike religion because of the use of dogma to legitimize cruelty , but worst of all is hypocrisy . conservatives want to claim to be about individual liberty , unless they feel so inclined to limit any particular group on a whim . christians want to claim to be a bastion of love and patience , but only for a small subset of people who personally serve their agendas . it  s not a difference in opinion that separates you from most of them , it  s iq points !
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)

20. i agree that hubris is one of our species ' flaws . i myself am a religious christian , and i while i do think we are special compared to animals , i believe in scientific proof , before dogma . accordingly , i believe in evolution and climate change , too . there is all the evidence in the world , that gays are normal , and not to be hated . the church says many things i disagree with , so i choose only to follow the stuff that lifts us as human creatures . you know what i mean , right ? don ' t steal . don ' t hump anyone else ' s wife , or your sister . do help people out whenever you can . be honest . be fair . call out liars . etc . basically , if it improves the quality of life , i ' m in . if it tells me to harm someone   like , " let ' s go hate gays ! "   i ' m out .
