   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

9. i can safely say that that has never happened to me , although it sounds like an extremely dickish thing to do . i would put this to people who don ' t know anything about you judging you having seen you for about a minute therefore they are meaningless .
   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

10. i found an article about it on the web  and another in psychology today  the trick is , with a few polite questions and comments , to start a more meaningful conversation , but stick to appropriate topics such as  the weather . the person that you want to talk to . talk very little about yourself . people love to talk about them selves . once they are talking , ask questions like  what do you like to do for fun  or  for a living  also , study non  verbal cues , like facial expressions , and body language . if someone points their face or feet away from you , they may not want to talk . another thing to remember is that it  s just for enjoyment , and to try to get to know someone . don  t put too much pressure on yourself to get it right every time , nobody does . this includes neuro  typicals . it  s difficult for many people , not just autistic people . i think , however , as an autistic individual , that if you approach the matter analytically , that you may have great success at it .
   (ID: afb309c0f8d875957ab1e2c406a762b6127668b6)

11. probably like digit percent cause no one will really notice and it ' s a decent amount of money
   (ID: 818422b560c80f37eedf14f771cd2fcd3657589a)

12. games like that are just depressing . the only reason people play it is to jerk off but if you have to put more than digit minutes into something just to start jerking off you ' re wasting your time . especially when it comes to this where you have to either spend digit hours or another digit bucks to see the outline of a tiddie . it makes no sense since you can just type in " anime tiddies " in google and get a million results instantly and for free .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)

18. just to get his expectations in check  i ' ve been out for digit . digit years and i ' m no where near t . take it slow . best way to support him is what you ' re doing ! show him you care and teach him these little male things . using the right name and pronouns is also super important . beyond that , he ' s just gotta learn to be patient and remember that we ' ll all get there eventually

20. this is the conversation i usually have with myself in my head . man its quiet . i ' m not tired just close your eyes and try to fall asleep anyway , you know when that alarm goes off digit hours from now it ' s gonna suck and you aren ' t going to want to wake up . i wish i had a girlfriend to hold right now . you have a body pillow just cuddle with that . but the feathers stick out and poke me ! stop being a bitch . why do i itch all over ? is it time to buy new sheets ? do i need silk sheets or something to not itch this much ? i must have really sensitive skin . i hate having sensitive skin did my phone just make a notification noise ? it ' s probably a candy crush request or something stupid just check it in the morning you need to sleep . yeah but what if it ' s something entertaining or someone trying to talk to me ? you know it ' s not . rolls over . that fucking notification , what is it ? fuck it . gets out of bed and walks to phone somebody commented on a post that you commented on . see i told you it wasn ' t important . nobody is thinking about you right now enough to make your phone make noise . checks time . shit ok digit hours until i have to wake up . we ' re still good i can handle that . i can ' t sleep . take some unisom . if i take it now i ' ll be extra tired in the morning tho . anyway i continue to think about stupid shit and it only usually gets depressing , until i fall asleep knowing i have to wake up in like digit hours
