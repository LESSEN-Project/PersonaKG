1. rifle training was once taught in school . they even had competitive shooting teams . firearms in america have been part of ordinary life for a long time . it is only recently that mass shootings have become a problem . the number of shootings is increasing , while the number of gun owners is going down . this suggests that guns are not the problem . so , what is the problem ? what changed ? is it a breakdown of family values ? or that we no longer teach civic duty and citizenship ? is society encouraging a sense of hopelessness , futility , and cynicism to the point that we devalue human life ? i don ' t really know what the answer is , but it appears that there is too much fighting for enough people to think about what it might be , in order to make a change .

2. and what if those kids families were killed in the wars they now serve and the only thing they can do to survive is to take up arms . not justifying just saying

3. the religious right , although far from a majority , wields undue influence in congress .  the courts are being stacked with ultra conservatives  voting rights are under concentrated attack  tolerance is decreasing and preference for whites is gaining legal ground i am white  admiration and emulation of more authoritarian rule is increasing , the police are being militarized .  the  god provides for believers  mentality leads to disdain for the poor , unemployed , disabled and homeless . social support programs are being cut .  not only is the majority of the news false but it seems designed to aggravate the divisions in our society . yet individual free speech rights are increasingly threatened  someone was bought up on contempt of congress charges for laughing during a congressional hearing .  if you  re vulnerable a student , looking for employment . what you say on social media can harm you . not derogatory statements but just the expression of your beliefs . state department and epa especially have been openly purging people who have expressed displeasure with trump , belief in climate change etc  consumer rights are disappearing while corporate rights are escalating . it  s frightening . amazon can brag about the rv workers who go from production center to center according to the demand for work . those people are basically otherwise homeless , uninsured , and because they lack a permanent address they are easy to exclude from voter rolls and social benefits . i hear about those amazon workers and i think about the okies in the grapes of wrath . unfortunately there is no new deal or fdr on the horizon .

4. you know what would solve this type of shit ? eliminate riders that have nothing to deal with the proposed bill it is attached to . riders should have been eliminated a long time ago . when i was a little kid i was wise enough to see the stupidity in riders and now i am in my digit ' s and this bullshit is still going on . i once read a defense budget bill that included removing certain animals from the endangered species list . why the hell would something like that be attached to a defense budget bill ?

5. in objective reality , herding children into groups of thirty and having them close their eyes while they pretend to psychically communicate with a deity , does not do anything at all to prevent gun violence . it doesn ' t really do anything at all , period . it ' s pure political posturing and religious exploitation of children . i completely agree with this .  also in objective reality , instituting reasonable , nuanced , and tested gun control policies is strongly associated with reduced firearm  based violence , homicide , and suicide . these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . this statement is technically true , but misleading . let me quote relevant part of scott alexander ' s essay   " gun violence " is the wrong category to use here .   suppose that you went to your doctor and said " i keep having headaches in my bed at night "   your doctor says " you should sleep on the couch .   you ask your doctor " and that will solve my problem of having headaches "   your doctor says " no , it will solve your problem of having headaches in your bed "   this is a bad solution , because although the problem was phrased as " i have headaches in my bed " , the real problem is just headaches . if we get rid of bed headaches at the cost of causing exactly the same number of couch headaches , that ' s completely useless .   " gun violence " is a category much like " bed headaches . some criminologists very reasonably propose a " substitution effect "  that is , if someone wants to commit murder , they ' ll use the most convenient weapon they can get your hands on . if that weapon gets banned , they will substitute the next most convenient weapon , and so on , rather than just deciding not to commit any more murders .   so suppose there were digit , digit gun deaths in the united states . the government bans guns , it is miraculously successful , and gun deaths go down to zero . sadly , by a total coincidence there are also digit , digit more knife deaths .   this would not be a good outcome , but if we ' re looking at " gun violence " , we could hail it as a victory  " gun control reduced gun violence levels to zero ! our plan has worked ! hooray "   so if we actually want to look at effectiveness of policies , we need to be measuring something else , like the total homicide rate . another wordy essay from scott alexander in which he spends a lot of time analyzing studies of gun control efficacy and comes to the conclusion that australia  style gun control , if implemented in the us , will probably , maybe , tentatively , reduce deaths somewhat . maybe .  these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . i am not a usa citizen and second amendment is not relevant to me , actually .  when you consider objective reality , there is no argument . there is no debate , except over the details of the gun control legislation that we ' re going to enact . if scott alexander didn ' t remember to consider objective reality , then his advice isn ' t worth consideration . frankly , scott alexander ' s analysis is much more nuanced than " there is no argument " claim . there clearly is an argument , and pretending otherwise is delusional . if you have specific rebuttals of points made in the essay , i want to read them . claiming someone does not consider objective reality does not constitute a proper argument , though .   x200b

6. the answer to that question is the same as the answer to this one  when are older generations going to stop blaming everyone else for their problems ?

7. reddit has some crazy idea that all lobbyists are just running around with briefcases full of bribe money and buying votes . while it is true that some corruption exists , there are tons of legitimate lobbyists out there doing good work . how do you expect all the senators , and representatives and other government officials to learn about issues ? lets say we want more solar power . we can all post on our representative ' s facebook page saying " yay solar " and linking to random websites with statistics that say solar power is great , but that will just get lost in the other pile of every other person ranting about what they want . now lets say that people pool their money and hire someone who has an intimate knowledge of the cost  benefit of solar power and can not only put together a persuasive and concise report , but can answer any questions on the spot that may come up . that person can do more in digit meeting to inform a representative on the issue than digit , digit people ranting online and writing letters could ever hope to do . lobbyists can do great work and i know multiple people who work as lobbyists in multiple fields , many for non  profit companies , and none of them are dropping off briefcases full of cash . if you want to ban every profession that has corrupt individuals in it , lets go ahead and ban all cops , teachers , doctors , accountants , realtors , nannies , waiters , and pretty much every profession , because there isn ' t a single profession out there that is free of corruption . how many people do you think would be cops , doctors , and teachers for free ? and do you really think that would increase the quality of work from that profession ? if lobbyists are really corrupt , do you think that having them not be officially paid is really going to stop them ? how about instead of making a crazy statement like banning a paid profession , we simply enforce the laws we have regarding government officials taking bribes ?

8. the explanation to a cooling and warming planet is a natural cycle . in the digit ' s it was " global cooling . more recently it was " global warming . since neither of those bogey men ever materialized it is just called the vague " climate change . also , a large amount of environmentalists point their fingers at the united states as the bad guy . imagine that . i say start with china and then get back to me . how certain does one have to be you ask ? digit  or no deal . i am all for a clean world for all living things . no one likes pollution and unhealthy practices . however , i consider it the height of human arrogance to believe we can actually influence the environment to the degree many claim . i dismiss the attitude of " it might be happening so we must do something . i find this to be absurd thinking . it looks like you and i shall respectfully agree to disagree .
