Total from this dataset: 6

1. then replace the coil unit and spark plug wire . before you do , insure yourself with some flywheel marks so your timing doesn ' t become skewed , though that should not be a problem . i have just learned to never say never .

2. yeah that ' s exactly what i ' ve been doing , i ' ll work on the getting the revs lower
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

3. chi brew is better for single target  with serenity , and eventually when you get digit  set and a higher ilvl and class trinket let ' s say average digit  you ' ll want to run chi explosion  ascension for multi and single , as it just gets easier to manage with very little difference in dps . i might be wrong about the last bit as its been a while since i ' ve gone and played ww , mostly brm at the moment . the most important thing to remember is that this is a game , and   you have to play it my way or not at all   personal preference takes precedence over min  maxing unless you prefer to min  max and like doing as well as you possibly can .

4. i dont even know the answer to this one , dark seer seems reasonable , so does tide spam anchor smash . dual lanes would make it much easier
   (ID: 2dcd820eac167adf18c6706f1c0a26a39eb945be)

5. balancedsuperpowers i like it more than godteirsuperpowers or shittysuperpowers because it provides a bit more of a dilemma i would like to go through there and kinda debate with my friends if you would want that superpower downside combo
   (ID: 6b1a5069121a216d43b11b6d5c61b018eb668aaa)

6. ultra necrozma malamar is probably more consistent than this . you have way too much going on . i also don ' t see why you run ditto since you don ' t run metang . also you need digit ultra balls
