1. that actually helps me more than you might think , its been eating at me because even though i have friends who cut i ' ve never met someone else who does this , so just knowing there ' s someone else helps .

2. why on earth would you think i ' ve only ever watched a single documentary ? the one i suggested was , in my opinion , most relevant to this topic . you ' re just spare parts , aren ' t ya bud ?

3. this is a tremendous proposal , one i think would help prolong the life span of eve . i for one wish you the best of luck . you can always message me on here or ig to campura dadunur or fubar philantis . i ' ve been playing for just over digit years .

4. when my stomach hurts on acid , it ' s because something is bothering me and i either haven ' t identified or have chosen to ignore it this approach doesn ' t work . i ' ve found that when i think through what ' s bothering me , most negative physical side effects go away . your issue could just be ibs , though .

5. i think you ' ve stumbled upon one of the great secrets of the universe there . i think you ' ve just paid for your ticket to that great gameshow in the sky .

6. i think the idea of furries existing alongside domesticated animals is kind of the go to explanation that most fiction writers use . it ' s the one that seems to make the most sense . but yeah , when fiction writers diverge from the formula , it ' s often annoying when they don ' t fill in the new gaps they ' ve created in their world . although with a world full of anthropomorphic creatures , i suppose there ' s lots that just has to remain unexplained and assumed . using another example from a series  we still don ' t have any freakin ' idea how the hell pokeballs work .

7. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .

8. hmmm interesting position and definitely a well though out rebuttal . however  i think you might  ve misjudged and unfairly accused me of attention seeking when i could possibly just be wasting time . still i believe you would make a perfect homomate for me wanna be my homomate

9. possibly it  s that then , i didn  t think i had particularly strong features , just a  standard  face if such a thing exists . quite possibly my personality has something to do with it as i  ve always been mature for my age .
   (ID: c391065478603a686531cbdd50568136a5e14508)

10. truthfully i  ve had a bullet on my dresser tucked away in the corner of the mirror for years . . i see it every day . and then i think no fuck that . i can do this . maybe someone out in this fucked up world will smile bc of me today . maybe i can change the world for the better even if it  s just holding the door open for someone or making them laugh . don  t give in . decide to make this cruel world a little less cruel instead .

11. personally , when the op doesn ' t even bother to comment on the article they ' ve linked i ' m not really inspired to discuss it with them . if they said " i just read this article insert link on topic and i was wondering what others think about specific aspect that i have never considered . what do you think ? " i ' m be more inclined to respond with my thoughts . just posting a link to an interesting article is too vague to foster a good conversation .

12. do see men as having more or better privileges or just different ones ? what kind of punishment should women who make false rape claims etc . on men should have , if any ? do you think that relationships  families should be patriarchal , matriarchal or absolutely equal ? should the man be the money maker while the woman stays at home with children , the other way around or what ? just curious . well done for being a sane feminist , it ' s been a while since i ' ve seen any of you guys around .
