1. that makes your opinion even more ignorant than it already was . or maybe your definition of abuse is different from mine . or maybe the abuse you suffered was insignificant . you obviously don ' t know what you ' re talking about becuase no woman who does would say any of the things you said here . nothing about this is funny . how dare you go online and perpetuate the idea to even one other woman that she could possibly deserve to be abused ? shame on you .

3. our desire for things in this world cannot exceed our desire for god . it is a christian belief that who we are and the good we do stay with us in to the next life . you are still you and thus the good things that you liked in life are still part of you . if the creating of beauty through music , art , etc . is a good thing it will exist still in heaven . how we will enjoy it then , i do not know . the book of job is problematic on many levels . first of all it is a marriage of a folktale the prose beginning and ending with the work of a first rate hebrew poet who inspired by the folktale creates the bulk of the middle . the essence of the folktale is that god tests our faith . the essence of the poetry that suffering that we endure has a purpose even if we cannot understand or know what that purpose is . very small children may believe the rules and restrictions placed up them by their parents cause unnecessary pain and suffering , but parents often know it is for their good .

5. i googled peekers advantage csgo on google , that video and that beginners guide were the only things that really suggeted peekers advantage . in a few other pages some casual people were discussing whether it was a thing . the only argument was latency and interp . there was nothing else . that youtuber whose video you shared only has 70k subscribers . he is not even famous or something . you clearly dont know csgo . there are waaay more famous and way better people . if you knew what you were talking about you would have given a more reliable source . there are numerous youtubers with hundreds of thousands of subscribers as well as many csgo pros . none of them i have watched ever mentioned peekers advantage . i havent even heard once in all those streams i have watched . i didnt even know the term before playing r6s , as a person who followed many of those youtubers and pros . sorry buddy . peekers advantage is a cancer of r6b . we dont have it in csgo . its only theoretical and practically inexistent with all those low latencies and high framerates . judging by the ratings of the comments in our conversation , this r6s community must be so pathetic . csgo is notoriously ct  sided , which means if you hold your angles properly , the defender wins most of the times . dont talk about things you have no idea about .

6. the only thing i would do is say  hey what  s your favorite song of theirs  and if they don  t know i would totally encourage them to check the band out . unless it  s nickelback . fuck nickelback

7. i once had a guest completely lie  and i mean totally fabricated everything he said  and my boss bought every word of it . it applies to really any scenario in life but when you know for a fact someone is lying through their teeth and you can  t do anything about it , it has to be one of the most frustrating things ever

8. well omnipotence and omniscience are different things , so that isn ' t very surprising . does anyone know the truth about him ?

9. if there is one thing that i learned about drumming from whiplash is tempo is all that matters lmao . i ' m psyched to hear that though . i grew up on rock band and guitar hero myself and drumming was always my favorite and best instrument to play . i never had enough to get a proper kit though , and i have to imagine my roommates would find it unacceptable for me to do so . what are some trademark songs you know how to play ?

12. " your piece of paper doesn ' t matter . " okay fine , anybody can learn things without college recognition " you only know that because you went to school , so its inherently flawed . " facepalm
   (ID: 03d15a94c7d0f2138a5e5c0cf7e503c341abbf78)

14. because the cheater doesn  t know how to break up with their so . so they do one of the worst things you can do to another person .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

15. you usually get enough info from one to know what some of your issues are . have you tried reviewing one yourself ? get a pen and paper and constantly take small notes even unnecessary things . nitpick yourself from your own view as well as the opponents .
   (ID: d9b642bbd6c09c682f252a2f49914c0d21506e6f)

16. i know it  s a little weird but i honestly walk around talking to myself acting out fantasies that are in my head . they are usually happy and help me forget about my worries and focus on things and ideas that make me truly happy .
