1. in the previous version of the app , if i clicked on a response in my inbox , it took me directly to that responsibility and showed the parent and grandparent comment . it did this regardless of whether or not the comment itself was hidden due to being nested too far . now if the comment is hidden it just takes me to the thread and it only highlights the comment if i open every hidden comment until i find it . edit  after further investigation i have found that i can no longer view the " community information " aka sidebar . this is an issue that needs dealt with because otherwise mobile users will have to rely on pinned posts to see the rules of the sub

2. hahaha . i did this at work , simply tried to force a fart that wasn ' t a fart . ended up running home and yelling to my roommates " omg i literally just shat myself " . then i walk into my room and see my landlord showing some of my friends the house .
   (ID: 5d6cecafd26473d96b39b973965364f09d4d41f1)

3. i mean , its your call . if you wish for me to stop posting these i respect that . but may i ask what qualifies as high content then ? this is an entire essay written about the characters on the show . yes , it has speculation about why characters acted the way they did . but all the events listed happened in the show and ultimately were just a different way to view the shows events . there is a lot that could be said about these posts , but them having low  content doesn ' t really make much sense considering how much longer , more detailed , and how much more i discuss the lore then many posts on this sub .
   (ID: a22b82fe301caa42c89cbd71b2e3733753f695d9)

4. no , i have not read the book . it does sound interesting , but my question , however , is about the general populace . those who may not necessarily been implicated in anything specific , but still nonetheless turned a blind eye to what was going on around them . what was the psychology of their thinking  was it fear of retribution from the nazis , peer pressure , etc . that ' s the general nature of my question , the people at large who just , with only a limited few exceptions , did mostly or absolutely nothing to help or speak out for their neighbor . thank you , though .

5. did anyone else read in their head the way i just did ?
   (ID: 7c7d6a809e77ab08fc65ee63a1ab44c11bd6ab7f)

6. this is just one person , an exceptionally idiotic person . to say that he is all democrats or even that his choice of action is what all democrats are doing from now on is as stupid as when people said that republicans are now all okay with body slamming reporters after gianforte did it .
   (ID: 04e13131ee0b31e4af8e34facf582fad832b1aea)

7. that the secret about wealth you can do a lot of nasty stuff to get wealthy but once you are you just need to fade in the shadow start a charitable foundation , put a sizable fraction of your wealth in it and your family name will eventually be restored to respectability . your wealth will quickly recover and sore to even higher level and with respectability come political power not really for you but for your heir who will be able to enjoy the wealth without any shame . am not talking rich or millionaires that small potatoes . wealthy is intangible it a zone that start somewhere between multi  millionaires and bill gates . lucas does not fit that mold properly he never did anything wrong beside screwing over a few actors and the prequel fiasco . so that make his charitable endeavour a lot more important .

8. fair enough . i was just trying to follow the guide i listed . he says wind lizardman is good for dots , which i ' m lacking in . my acasis isn ' t fully skilled up and doesn ' t have great accuracy to land her dots but i did get her third skill level ' d up which was great .
   (ID: bd951a475ac46323d867ac35ccf0cb4b3e756f83)

9. what compromises did you have to make ? did you have any ideas you really wanted but were just left on the cutting room floor ?
   (ID: 0501bf1e5cd313190bb4590a1c677057b15a6e47)

10. well here is where you went wrong . you jumped into water with sharks ! what else did you expect ? these arent dogs , cats , or any other animal human have domesticated . this shouldn ' t be news , just a reminder if you take a risk expect to get bit .
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

11. merch is not a fanbase , but again my point about the underlying story has to make some sense to you . also america is obsessed with junk media , not all but the majority pushes this fanbase towards fringe . i apologise to those who didn ' t get that . if you have ever looked at tik tok or whatever for more than digit minutes you are probably going to still be offended . also just being extra anal , those two stores do nothing but by merch for new games so i would be curious how well kh sells compared to something for scale . i ' m not doubting it did well , just curious .

12. " why did i just type this incoherent bullshit , and why can ' t i stop myself from posting it "
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

13. was the baby worth it ? did the baby change your sex life ? what about the relationship ? is your husband still attracted to you even though you are a mother ? sorry just really really insecure
   (ID: 85ada8069a64aa3ed39736f565e8a9ceed369acd)

14. she  you don ' t look to me . me  i was supposed to look at you ? oh look someone thinks they ' re people at look at . she  . smiles me  have you solved question digit of chapter digit . digit in multi  variable calculus ? she  yes i did . may i help you with it ? me  no . i solved it too . she  why you asked then ? me  just wanted to check your intelligence . she  .

15. good choice of song . it makes me wanna smash shit from excitement . in fact , i just did . a chair .
   (ID: 164327be87300906de16932661437c5b2b671c9d)

16. did this repeat or something or did you really just happen to be there ?
   (ID: 93133d3335d1543505dad3ffd44a8411e6be2ea9)

17. i nearly did this to a player , not out of spite but by mistake . two accounts would go around our area , take all of the gyms and golden razz spam anyone who tried to retake them . they ' d just monopolize the area twice a week . asked around , no one knew who they were , so based on the behavior i figured it was a multi  account spoofer with a bot set up to berry feed . nearly reported it , but then i found out from someone at a raid that it was actually just a couple from the next town over who drove around and played super aggressively . would have felt really bad if i ' d reported then although niantic doesn ' t do anything about those reports anyway .
   (ID: fc70415de2435c629ec792dbd90c954786c0bd16)

18. apology accepted , sorry for being mean to you earlier . arguing in general is really not my style especially with someone who  s almost digit decades older then me . since you revealed yourself probably so should i . i  m student for eastern europe , and yes , eastern europe sucks pretty hard . not a redhead but i enjoy smoking as well . i just can  t help bit ask you how did you draw a line between me and americans since english is not my native language lol
   (ID: abffa241a0eb33d4cf220980872adc9a148514b4)

19. yeah but why tf did you decide to post this on here . i support the lgbtq community but jeez man , chill out and talk about that stuff someone else . it  s just a meme
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

20. those " weird looks " are just how wizards look at each other , jackass , which you would have known if you were a real wizard ! the important science question here is how did a fake wizard ever end up with a real princess ?
