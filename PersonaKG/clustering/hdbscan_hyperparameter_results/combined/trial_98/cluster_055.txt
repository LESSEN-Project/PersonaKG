1. do you draw your tags or buy them over the counter ? we have tag draws and only you can use your tag . but i have heard of sharing tags in states where you can buy a handful of tags or a punch card . the differences in hunting laws state by state are pretty neat . i was just talking to a guy the other day i forget where he lives but it is illegal to hunt with radios there , and where i live i can ' t imagine going into the woods without one .

4. my mom once told me she didn ' t understand why god allowed me to live . little backstory . i was born nearly digit months premature . i technically died twice . the doctors told my parents not to get attached cause i wasn ' t going to make it . fast forward to the incident . my mom accused me of stealing her digital camera . she had just returned from a stay in maryland and couldn ' t find it . for hours she berated me and topped it off with the " god shouldn ' t have let you live " comment . the next day she found the camera in a box she had yet to unpack . she never told me she found it or apologized for her comment . she just pretended the entire situation never occurred . my dad apologized on her behalf .

5. idontgiveafuckology . learn to live for yourself no matter what the fellow humans thinks or says . do you a favor and let you have it . people who are truly interesting  worth wont ask anything from you aside just have it themselves too
   (ID: ea4bfffa24eb7289b7b7bdfe0eded204916c7fd9)

6. it sucks . we have created a sick system where it is inappropriate to have personal relationships in places where we spend most of our time and are most likely to meet new people . you could just take a chance . worst case scenario is a scandal and you quit . best case scenario you live happy ever after .
   (ID: 2266c34274940e2ea1a22a3dee5a3cbcdad25f53)

7. you ' re an idiot who clearly hasn ' t lived in very many countries . welfare is not what builds the nice parts of town or the transport channels to get a coke into the hand of any person in earth . rich people do , for their own benefit and the benefit of those who work for them . just because a few assholes kill the farm and pocket a tax break instead of giving you personally a job on a micro level doesn ' t mean trickle down economics doesn ' t elevate everyone on a macro level . i repeat , go live somewhere not built by the rich if you disagree .

8. hurt , i live in the middle of nowhere and theres barely anything to do here . the nearest gym is about digit minutes cycling away from me and i cycle digit minutes to school . it ' s just a waste of time , really

9. star wars and make the moon be the death star so that everyone would live in constant , unnecessary , fear of something that was made up just to keep humanity in line . haha that would be so different than today . wait

10. that ' s enough money to live off . just make a good meal plan .
   (ID: 39ba9a65a55c27b50eef7c5cecbc66cc866c4a4c)

11. i understand full well what the symbolism behind all that stuff is intended to mean , i just strongly disagree with it . it ' s not about false patriotism ? dude , what world do you live in ? i don ' t care what your reasoning is , having kids recite the pledge to a flag every morning is brainwashing . they ' re basically being forced into patriotism without being given a chance to decide tor themselves as to whether or not they even agree with it .

12. maybe his friends are just used to mockicking him and they do it rather jokingly . that ' s kind of insult  based friendship  relationship , commonly occur in real life . hiccup allows that because he is fine with it . if it comes to the villain , why wouldn ' t he try to insult him ? his aim was tomake hiccup lose his nerves , start acting impulsively and be easier to defeat . of course the more accurate and touchy the insult is , the better are the results but maybe grimmel couldn ' t come out with anything better as he never met hiccup in his live so he just reffered to his appearance . after all he ' s tights aren ' t very thicc .

13. just do what i do , keep telling yourself you can  t live forever .

14. what a great world we live in , where you can get assaulted just for turning someone down
   (ID: a50471e2e88a582d7b78a3eee4aaf882ed0652cb)

15. thanks for this post , it ' s very informative . i can ' t imagine having the fbi on my tail for just doing what i would consider normal . what a terrible life to live .

16. great show , excited to see where this goes in a month when we get by all the obvious games starcraft , cs , ext . do have one suggestion that might already be true but has to do with twitch . could you produce this show inside the " game " category and not the " gaming talk shows " category . since this talk show is digit  just about a the single game and not a of variety game talk show . if you do it inside the " game " i would guess you would get more people checking out the live stream . twitch might have rules against this but its my idea .

17. dude , if you are serios , don ' t do it , there are plenty of reasons to live , even if you have difficulties . if not , then i will just leave an f

18. unfortunately that ' s just the way things are in the country i live in . i would not be surprised if that manager had to suck someone else off to get to where he is today

19. in my mind the question is why would you ? that would be saying bc someone has a predisposition for a particular disease , they don  t deserve to live . just because you have a certain medical condition does not mean you cannot be happy , and cannot make vast contributions to the world .

20. nah . old people are notorious for speaking their minds , as are iranians in my experience , and there ' s even a chance the neighbour was just venting frustrations on you about their own children they don ' t see . you work a lot and still made time to go see your parents who live a few hours away , your not a bad son by any means well , no means relevant to the story anyways . and had clearly reached a breaking point for strangers bullshit . the neighbour obviously shouldn ' t have said anything that confrontational but realistically probably had no idea that western culture frown upon chastising strangers .
