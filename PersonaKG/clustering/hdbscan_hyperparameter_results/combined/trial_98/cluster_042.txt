1. i think you really don ' t get it . we don ' t want a significant other , we do not want to find " someone to spend our lives with " your post and your opinion shows how little you actually know .

2. strange one alright . i think the general idea behind it is that gender is no longer a biological thing but rather a state of mind . fuck it though , all i really know is that is has zero effect on me and we are best off just letting people be whoever they want lol

3. i know a girl who politely sat through a date where the guy wouldn ' t stop talking about all the ways africa could be " fixed . he ' d never been there , but he was taking a really interesting sociology course and figured she ' d want to hear the entire thing . when he finally stopped for long enough that she could get a word in , she had this inner argument running  should i tell him i lived in nigeria for four years and that he ' s full of shit thus inviting further " conversation " , or should i tell him that ' s fascinating and ride it out to the end ? she rode it out to the end . there was no second date . i think you should tell the story of this date . it sounds entertaining for us .

4. that ' s the reason why i ' m afraid of coming out . i don ' t want people to look at me and think " it ' s that gay kid " i want people to know me by who i am . not just my preference

5. as much as i empathize for your situation , i think you should consider the symbolism of the tattoo to your girlfriend . that tattoo symbolizes a huge part of her life , many memories , the birth of her kids etc . to her , it may come across as if you want to erase that part of her history from memory . i know it would be horrible seeing her ex ' s name every time you see her , but if she won ' t get a cover up tattoo for it , then maybe try to change your view on the tattoo its self . it ' s not her ex , it is a stage in her life that has contributed to the person she is today . tl  dr the tattoo is representing a part of her life . you can ' t change it , so change what you can . your perspective on it .

7. does murata know that there ' s porn of these characters ? judging from how he draws them i would think yes but i want a confirmation .

8. i ' m the only one who wants to see daegon and taven in mk11 . i don ' t know about others but i really found them interesting in mk armageddon and want to see them return along with onaga which i don ' t think any of these is possible looking at how the story is based on time travel

9. yeah , therapy has been a huge help to me , i know it doesn  t do wonders for everyone , but maybe consider it if you aren  t already . but yeah , in those dark times , i  d say the largest thing that  s kept me here is me thinking about what i  d do to my family . i wouldn  t want anyone to think it was their fault

10. you didn ' t mention your age . if you ' re coping well with your problem i wouldn ' t bring it up right now . however if you ' re struggling you may want to bring it up to your more understanding parent . your sister may feel that you are trying to steal her spotlight , is that something you think she may feel ? you would know her tendencies better .

11. to the people that had it all ur life without knowing the proper way to do it lol . how do you determine if u are sleeping or not . i think this sub has a lot of people trying very hard to have lucid dreams . i really want to know other people ' s way of checking not a best proven way just the way natural lucid dreamers do it .

12. i want to stay up to think about it just one more time ! normally its a run through of the day , and the files and files i have in my mind about the people i know . typically i analyze their character and wonder what shaped them , i also worry about them quite a bit .
