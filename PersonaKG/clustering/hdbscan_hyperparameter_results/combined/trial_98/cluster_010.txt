1. that ' s good ! when i say as an avid moviegoer , i mean that the encroaching on space maneuver would annoy me even if it was an agreed upon date just because it can be distracting  if i go to the movies , i want to watch the movie . but i ' m glad he ' s found someone . he can ' t be faulted for explicitly being told it was a date . the virtue of it being valentine ' s day though isn ' t a defense i would hold up in court though . how did you end up liking deadpool ? did you see the second one ? do you have any thoughts about once upon a deadpool ?

2. thanks for sharing . out of curiousity you obviously don  t have to answer if you don  t want to did you find that your anxiety was making your relationship difficult ? i struggle sometimes to enjoy mine because of it . i keep thinking that my so deserve someone better .

4. i agree . it ' s very sad and dangerous . it has taught me that it ' s never something i even want to come close to messing with . it changed a beautiful woman that i adored into a complete stranger who , it ' s going to sound harsh but to be honest , the world would be better off without . she did some horrible things to get money for meth , introduced some horrible people into our lives , put us through some experiences that one never heals from . i feel worst for my little brother who is digit years younger than i and had never known her , or a life , without the drugs . he will be digit next year and i tell him often to get as far away from it as he can .
   (ID: ca13e283de9a99b9eb1cf4f68eed33eccff74e35)

5. actually , it  s completely reasonable . let me break it down for your you . communication is not what you say , but how you say it . so when i say ,  want to watch a movie ?  it means something else . at least it did back in the day . so take your condescending virgin ass and masturbate to your anime girls or whatever the fuck you do now .

6. what medium ? their website , that they own ? or the internet as a whole ? if it ' s the latter , then you grossly overestimate the reach of facebook . if it ' s the former , then you grossly misunderstand the meaning of private property . as for banning bernie sanders posts , they would have every right to do so . and if they banned trump , the same . or if they banned discussions about nascar or bob ross or apollo digit or star wars or anything else . facebook is not yours . you do not own it , nor do your opinions much matter to them . why ? because you are not the customer . the advertisers and shareholders are the customers . you and i ? we are an item on a shelf . our value ? the information we freely provide them that they then sell . why did they ban gun sales ? liability . if a madman buys a gun over facebook and shoots up a building , then the government will crawl so far up facebook ' s collective anus that they will be poking mark zuckerberg ' s brain stem . that is the last thing they want , so they are covering their asses preemptively .

7. i have these moments where i have a lot of energy because i did something well or im just mad and then i want to smash something , though i very occasionally do this . highly satisfying , always regret doing it .

8. you can phone ucas up and ask for your results if you want , that ' s what some of my friends did when they saw that ucas went down .

9. probably turn into one of those guys that want everyone to see it because they did and it was beautiful . it would just take a few years to start getting people to look unless shes ripping off blindfolds

13. yep , was looking to see if someone beat me to it before posting . i forget off the top of my head , but there ' s a country that did or still does need absolutely insane amounts of money to buy anything . they had to make a digit million bill may be off by a denomination or two . anyway , i want to say zimbabwe . can someone comfirm or correct me on this ? i ' d usually turn to google but i gotta get in the shower .

14. this reminded me so much of a situation i had while i was a college student . i had some money , but spent almost everything , expecting my dad will get his pay on friday . well , he didn ' t , he had to wait until monday . my parents informed me and asked if i had enough to make it through weekend , and i said i do , because i did not want them to think i am irresponsible parasite and i did not know if they had enough money for the weekend , since they were expecting it as well . i mean , they always have someone to borrow from , it is never a problem in a small community , but i did not want to ask . well , tldr , i was hungry at the weekend . had money for just a loaf of breed , split in half for two days , and exactly digit eggs . that is all i have eaten for two days plus a jam put on slices of bread , leaving just enough money for the cheapest bakery product for monday morning at college . hunger sounds silly until you face it . never let yourself staying without any money if you are not poor and can save it just enough for a package of groceries .

15. i left months ago . i did it because my ex and i broke up and i didnt need to keep creeping on her social media . but also because i was noticing how much pointless bs people post on them . i didnt want to be doing the same thing , especially when no one really cares anyways .
   (ID: f35d74d4d36905b144a4851bae7ac6c2014ebdbd)

16. i am already electing to not have biological kids because i don ' t want them to have to face this reality . i wouldn ' t be surprised if humans kill ourselves off in the next hundred years . " oh but did you see this adorbs cat video " facepalm
