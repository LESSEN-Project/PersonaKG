   (ID: 7aa559a048e16f5e07993ececfa9eb494e72a8fc)

5. my boyfriend of digit years and i made the incredibly painful decision of breaking up while still in love because our religious ideals didn  t line up . we are both college students and looking for someone to spend the rest of our lives with , so we knew that even though we were completely in love , that the religious differences between us would create problems down the road . making the choice to be adults and separate without any fights or someone  s wrongdoing was the hardest choice i  ve had to make .

6. doing the one thing you  ve always wanted to do with the people you love the most .
   (ID: 160325a949e5dbc41bc99b9243f0df0953ef7bd4)

7. it seems that most aussies including your gov ' t are pretty fond of americans and the us in general . you ' ve even fought alongside our troops in every war since ww2 , iirc . most of the world seems to have a negative view of us , but never australia which is awesome and i love you guys for it , so my question is , why is this the case ?
   (ID: 4be05459ff3da31d5b55f10665fcc3b88a7fa74b)

8. me . all my life . i  ve embraced my sensitivity trough , i  m not ashamed of it anymore . you can learn ways to use it to your advantage . i actually believe we are meant to be empathetic , all of us . wishing you the best . please take care of yourself . much love .

9. in their minds though , they ' ve convinced themselves it has nothing to do with love .
   (ID: 445ba4596e4bcff0c96b23f038cf784185970198)

10. except the whole point of the scene was him talking about his love for his family , even though that isn ' t the vulcan way , so making reference to his wife makes sense . it could be a hint to her heritage , but i don ' t see it . her real parents definitely could come into the series . but it would almost be disappointing because we ' ve been there done that so many times lately .
   (ID: ff39f069f8b23a1fe1a55ce497714a8d205eb0fa)

11. you guys should have gave him a glass of milk . that stuff kills your high quick which sucks cause i love milk . it ' s his house man he isnt an asshole . i ' ve lived in the ghetto and seen people get sent to the hospital for much less so dont worry , listen to z ro hos an asshole by nature
