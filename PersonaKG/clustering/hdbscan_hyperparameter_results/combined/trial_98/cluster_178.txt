1. no not all of them . just the ones who suck and are losers . some people are a  ok they just like being alone and that ' s cool too .

2. funny how you haven ' t actually been able to make a logical counter argument . you ' re just saying " you ' re wrong " without the logical backing that i have . then the " boo hoo whatever dude ! you ' re , uh , just like , uh , a flat earther dude " really , i am ? i ' m literally just like a flat earther ? that is your brilliant counter argument ? that saying it is wrong to promote a lie is exactly as bad as lying ? that is what you ' re telling me ? do you . do you realize how incredibly stupid you just made yourself look ? you just made yourself look like a clown .

3. that does sound more legit , although also kind of weird since processing bitcoin has a cost . ok the more you explain this the less it sounds like a scam . if other nootropics people stand by this provider , then it ' s probably legit . although speaking frankly you will probably find just adding a few dollars to the order less hassle . if you ' re committed to using bitcoin then ok just go to coinbase and do it .

4. hey i mean if you like it all power to you , i ' m just lost on why it ' s so popular . maybe i just can ' t handle the neutron style

5. it ' s justified . if you keep going back to her like nothing happened , you ' re just encouraging her . just remember if she tries to tear you down , its all just guilt tripping and gaslighting .
   (ID: 4e0f41bc85f51f64d9103c2a165328ff6329dea1)

6. you must do it if it ' s just because of laughter . either a  pokerface like your life depended on it because it will b  go to the bathroom and just stay in the hallway to unleash the pathowoyiffogen .

7. funny , just like you chose to make yourself look bad , you could have just as easily ignored my comment .
   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

8. by the simplest and most accurate definition , it ' s a particular act that you personally sexualise more than just about anything else . it doesn ' t have to be innately sexual . just like sexualities and , closer in relation , fetishes , nobody knows why fantasies exist . but there is speculation that the reason they remain fantasies is because people rarely see themselves participating in real life .

9. yes . exactly . seems like you ' re really just wanting to be a victim here . just go out with the girls .
   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

10. yeah like it changed to the boy somehow being alive ? sorry if i ' m spoiling but the movie is shit so it just made no sense and the plot twist was just shit
   (ID: 09635643777fe30eb3750faad0e2ea7a607f855c)

11. play arcade but the ones like team deathmatch or just deathmatch . you dont have a team or  your team  doesnt care about losing or winning bc well , its just arcade .
   (ID: a0849f7d6d0829c8bb5f820aa9bf63584c7471df)

12. just seems like a feature that has little to no disadvantages . it just seems better to have them than to not . the p  47n does has a different wing design so that may be why .
   (ID: a9e8779a80280c00c5063e221eaeba0431068276)

13. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

14. no ma  am you are not worthless and even if nobody notices you have a lot to offer . it feels like nothing can get better or that nothing will ever change but it can . just hold on . you just keep holding on and you can get through this .
