4. argue all you want hahahaha . that ' s the answer . they sign up thinking they ' ll " serve their country " , get used to hurt other humans instead , then get unhinged because of it . a great package of stupid from the veto  go , too cowardly to refuse to hurt others during , and weak minded afterwards .

6. the bloody crow of cainhurst is in my opinion the toughest  boss  in the game . i say  boss  because he isnt actually w boss , hes a completely optional hunter  type enemy . to beat him you have to learn to predict his combos , and play it safe . what i mean by playing it safe is  only follow up a successful hit if you are absolutely certain you can land it , only heal if you are absolutely certain he wont attack  shoot you , only shoot him if you are absolutely certain you  ll remain unaffected , dodge as much as possible . ill link a video of how i beat him herehttps    . there is one more crucial thing you must do if you want to kill him  always heal to full health , never spam attacks and always take time to heal .

7. do you want cell service on it ? i bought a  digit tracphone at walmart for my toddler to watch netflix on during a trip . it has all the things you mentioned . it ' s locked to their network so you ' ll never be able to take it essential l elsewhere , but it seemed to handle what i required of it .

8. do you want to play titanic ? you be the iceberg and i ' ll go down .
   (ID: 1afb7597077681179430af152997f04fd73ba0ee)

9. oh great , now we ' ll have to go through scanners and get groped if we want to go through a tunnel or cross a bridge .

10. i was raised hindu and was always interested in religion so i have a lot to speak of ! another one is that hindus in india will often put a lime and chilli peppers on a string  pin outside of a home or business . this is because lakshmi goddess of wealth and prosperity has an older sister alakshmi goddess of the opposite of those . lakshmi likes to eat sweets  milk  fruits , so if you keep them inside she ' ll come in and you ' ll have good luck . alakshmi likes to eat sour and spicy food , so keeping the lime and chili out there will keep her satisfied outside without coming into your life .   x200b  in a related story , when a sage was asked who is more beautiful between lakshmi and alakshmi , he said that lakshmi is more beautiful when walking towards you because you want good luck to come into your life and alakshmi is more beautiful when walking away from you because you want bad luck to leave your life .

11. look at the sun first . then look at the data of the other planets in the solar system . you may find that there might be something similar going on ? you may also want to look into nasa ' s current observations on sunspots and solar activity and the average temperatures since this sun cycle ended . either your suv is reaching and has changed the heat of pluto  or . well , maybe i ' ll let you be the observational scientist . meanwhile , all the climate projections have been wrong since mr . gore ' s power point presentation . why ? it deals mostly with carbon dioxide , not the sun   and not a single climate projection that i have reviewed has ever taken in account of the heat sync ability of the earth ' s oceans .

12. oh geez , i totally forgot about it . id imagine it ' s still in the earth , considering it can ' t really leave . all the corrupted gems want to stay together , so that ' s that . hopefully , though , they ' ll all be cured in the movie . i loved being able to see all of the corrupted gems as how they should be .

15. why would you want to drink rocket fuel ? once you try the rb  v you ' ll understand !  the first step to dealing with a problem is admitting you have a problem  jase robertson the jase roberton quote reminds me of another , though i am unsure originally uttered it " i have a serious drug problem , the problem is i don ' t have any " but jase had another good one with " you can see the true heart of a man when you ' re out in the woods with a weapon . dick chaney must have had a similar philosophy about ' getting into someone ' s head '

16. when you say to attend , you  re speaking with a bit of certainty that you  ll be getting into those programs . how confident do you feel on those chances ? even if the chances are low , i do believe it  s up to you and what you  re looking to do in the future . what do you really want . if academia is more important to you than becoming a clinician , declining an acceptance may not be the worst idea . but it is ultimately up to you and what you see for your future , and that is what will give you the most fulfillment later on in your life .

17. one thing that worked for me is procrastinating my suicidal thoughts . yes , i want to kill myself , but what about that movie coming out next month that i really want to see ? guess i ' ll have to wait . and then i ' ll find other reason to stay .
   (ID: e216f2a1e0d7d814b7ad58452ce6ac21e0b763fc)

18. you ' re responsible for your actions and if you want something , then you ' ll have to work for it . sadly many people today seem to always want things handed to them , but get upset when they realize it ' s not free .
   (ID: e217e0e78b3d167105d634f49246c934025ff72b)

19. all you have to do is accept jesus christ as your personal savior and you ' ll make it into heaven no matter what you do in this life , so you can even stay in the gang if you want .

20. they either want a number with a digit in the ones place , or6 in the hundreds place . i ' ll guess they mean that the digit is digit  10th the size of the one in digit . the digit digit in digit represents six tens . digit  10th this size is digit ones .
