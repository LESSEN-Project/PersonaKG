1. for the international muppets it ' s 4am in italy . for an article and tweet from different sources to be taken down or edited right now is just weird . i mean i can see night editor having access to the article but the twitter as well ? do journos share their twitter access ? i wouldn ' t . i don ' t have twitter so not digit  sure how it works
   (ID: 5ea29f01c8cdade4f178fd446d00647edc5fc70e)

2. sure , people eat that stuff all the time . and some of them get sick . you don ' t need to check the temperature of your food , buts leaving it out at room temperature isn ' t exactly a " proptip . you ' d be better off putting it in a low heat oven , or the fridge and then just nuking it gor a minute or digit .
   (ID: 8f7369c6ebb47df350fec663be46dfd8481ee2db)

3. i was just thinking about this today ! i am a feminist through and through , went to a local resist rally stoked , even went with my boyfriend . it was not empowering nor have hopes to ignite feminism and create allies . speakers were talking about punching men in the face and laughing about it , about taking our rightful place above men . i was disgusted , sure self defense , take care of yourself , but breaking a guys nose because he disagrees does not look good for feminism nor does it inspire more men to be stronger allies . i don  t understand this reasoning , it doesn  t empower women , it shamed them .
   (ID: 46cf1fc2a9c8dec12fa16589117be75cf1571e1d)

4. hi just wondering if you have any pics with the jacket on ? i  m digit  digit  but much heavier 170lbs and i  m not sure how loose  long it would be on me . thanks in advance !
   (ID: 8d5aac58a9c3a7e883f9e90df39dc5ab7c36de53)

5. not sure what you meant by that ? i was just letting you dig your hole of assumptions until you finally called me a carnivore . felt good to throw that one back in your face .
   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

6. sure , but it gets kinda repetitive after a while , often with me just wondering there no point to being an older brother since your lil ' brother is always gonna tower over you no matter what .
   (ID: 8062cc5726628ea3a4b448436c6c6956263ea6cd)

7. i just said i do work , so i ' m not sure why you ' re even trying to argue with me about this ? crohn ' s is considered a disability and my level of it , i am advised not to work at all . home work is not as easy as it sounds to get . i work now in sales at a call center and work digit  digit hours a week . before that i worked retail and ended up in the hospital for overworking myself . please , don ' t assume you know what i ' m going through , because i assure you that you don ' t . and don ' t assume i can get work from home opportunities because it ' s not that easy to get a legitimate work from home opportunity . i ' m not sure why you chose my comment to comment in when i was all for op encouraging his wife to work part time or help out more around the house . just do me a favor and ignore me yeah ?
   (ID: 2d26439362b22d8737b6d2a810c70fc3b9a3ddaa)

8. are you sure you just weren ' t hoping it would ? i doubt it , but just in case .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

9. pretty sure that a person of interest isn  t the one who might have done it  but they just have some information on it . don  t quote me though
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

10. not a lady , but i ' m pretty sure nothing is so small you can ' t feel it . it ' s just so small you get no pleasure out of it . to truly feel nothing it ' d have to be shorter than digit inch and thinner than the opening between the labia .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

11. ok , i get the point of this and i  m sure it would help clear this up with some people but , if you force a man to get pregnant and carry the baby wouldn  t it be going against their consent thus making you the rapist in this scenario ? i  m not trying to put down somebody  s experiences with this but that sounds really morally wrong . not that any of the other stuff happening isn  t . i  m not trying to say something against this i  m just arguing morals .
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

12. if you had to pilot a plane that locks up in any form of dive and randomly just gets pushed due to ping i ' m pretty sure your awnser would be different .
   (ID: 1160c0c34e8b0184126a6e35a5fa982003442bde)

13. often . it ' s not necessarily a bad thing . just make sure you can talk about it with someone afterwards
   (ID: ef9684680c857510e817ec197ee0615d70b29022)

14. first of all , how would time travel " write out " those characters ? i ' m not sure i understand  just need some elaboration . second , " easy " writing usually isn ' t good writing  it ' s lazy and uncreative . the russos are better than that .
   (ID: bb403667518ffc82f0508e3aee8741ea63cec050)

15. just hide the entire game collecting mats and maybe find a treasure chest then sit in a baller and wait for all the other players to kill eachother . if you get lucky , they might die in the storm . gliders are nice to stay above someone without the worry for dying from falling . an rpg from above would be good . make sure you are rotating into the new safe area quickly and get established there . tldr  just camp lol
   (ID: 52e0e376c09b4862d8eea84ae547c3466a2aac4b)

16. that makes sense . i have bought stuff for team fortress digit before , but they were weapons to be used in game . it ' s just hard for me to justify more than a  digit for an iphone game that you will get bored of in a few days . but i am sure there are many dedicated app gamers out there . someone has to get to the top of the leaderboards .
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

17. ok , just scrolled to make sure . no mystogan ? at all ? come on guys . is he really that forgettable ?
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

18. that is not mainly what we are talking about . sure , occasionally you will wait on a foreign guest but that is not happening all the time . also , most people do tend to do some general research about a country before they just go set foot over there . the tipping culture in america is fairly well known and it  s depicted in their media regularly . but i stand by my original comment , if you are foreign and you come to america and learn about the customs and then say that that  s stupid and you  re not going to tip , you are a cheap asshole .
   (ID: f18b19a52bbf1505af84d01563a51626d4ae363f)

19. i ' m using a phone without a number right now , i ' m not sure if it would work . i hate to ask , but would you mind doing it ? sorry , i ' m probably just really scared right now .
   (ID: 9f31985e70e208f2dc692e2c378f1707cedd3bc9)

20. sure you can also just text the news number when everyone is all done ruining it
