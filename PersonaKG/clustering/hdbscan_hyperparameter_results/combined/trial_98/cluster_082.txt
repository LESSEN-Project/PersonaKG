Total from this dataset: 42

1. i do have strong feelings about keeping the extremely sick alive just for the sake of it . however i ' ve had relatives with alzheimers , and long after they forgot names , they were still able to enjoy life  get joy out of it . that is the most important thing imo .
   (ID: ff39f069f8b23a1fe1a55ce497714a8d205eb0fa)

2. it ' s boring , boring . served with a side order of boring . the stuff you ' ve included , involves too much , about your job , and not enough about you . get rid of your , you should message me section , it ' s just bad on a lot of levels " a nice guy in a stable job ! you should also include better photos . and smile . that half  smirk  smile thing , never really works , unless you ' re a super villain . the scuba pic is good , but a bit grainy . try to find some friends who will take your pix . outside of work .
   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

3. what i ' ve always heard isn ' t that the digit , digit is a literal number of beta access or vip access . it was equivalent in the time the book was written to saying a zillion . just with extra meaning . digit tribes of israel , squared , times digit so a lot .
   (ID: aac80ac9ebef70ab8fe6bc14a8fcccb472099b84)

4. i grew up on a pig farm . my chores when i was digit were harder work than any job that i  ve ever had as an adult . pig farms are highly sustainable because they can eat just about anything , including communists . if the shit were to hit the fan , that  s exactly what i  d feed them . this guy !
   (ID: afb309c0f8d875957ab1e2c406a762b6127668b6)

5. i ' ve seen lots of cover  ups , but this video is new to me ! i do intend on getting a sleeve someday when i have the money to do so . some of these people incorporate the scar as part of the art , but i would rather just totally obscure that there ' s even tattoos there . i have keloids on my leg though , which are harder to cover . still thinking about what to do with those
   (ID: 43a6fe9c16d7a48abeb6832518a650a445974a7e)

6. answered just the way it was asked . mom ' s been on different kinds of shit for awhile . last i heard she picked up a meth habit since my brother is out of the house now . i ' ve been no contact with the family .
   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

7. i ' ve never tried to bust it as quick as i can tbh . there are times where i ' ve lost concentration and bust it earlier than i wanted , but as no orgasm was had i can just wipe off and keep going .
   (ID: 75ca79d6c5cfc50533ff56cde25edfb593ae8568)

8. most guys just go for it . if your super uneasy you can ask her first . i ' ve been asked before , it ' s not a total killer either . don ' t worry if it ' s not perfect !
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

9. everything might just be a creation of man . man put god into a book , man creates more men to be slaves to work for him . and the whole world is ruled by men who control these slaves that believe in a god that was created by another man ? does it make sense ? i  ve had a beer or so , and it  s about a beer before bed , so that  s what time it is
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

10. i ' ve never met a person in my life who looks down at circumcision babies can ' t speak or do anything besides drink and shit , it ' s the right of the parent to decide whether or not they should circumcise their kid . you just sound really stupid considering there ' s no problem in having or not having it the difference is immaculate .
   (ID: ab5524e568131ce7cb4db227daae4d0f489838e1)

11. my son and i have been talking about a lego harry potter night ! you ' ve just motivated us to make it happen this weekend !
   (ID: 1b15fd08311192b471933a314f66dc758a923c02)

12. look i can do the same  you ' ve just creepily searched a stranger ' s post history , taken the conversation off topic and publicly aired their business . such a creepy move . support would have been a private message .  a . stop being a hypocrite b . stop thinking your part of this culture harry
   (ID: 7dfa169bdfe2df7e214baa35fc2f2b73cbb10c46)

13. here ' s another sv650 fan jumping in . bought my first sv650s after digit years of riding . best bike i ever owned in the " what a hoot to ride " category . i ' ve since had two more and an sv1000 which , while far more capable in most respects , just doesn ' t have the same just plain fun to ride character .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

14. i ' ve heard it helps to start cleaning up something small , and then grow from that . even if it ' s just putting a fork into a drawer , it ' s important to start somewhere .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

15. depends on how old you were when he left . if you are digit now then he probably couldn ' t handle the responsibility of being a dad , which isn ' t your fault . if you are digit , then you were probably a temper  tantrum tornado of tumultuous temperament resulting in your dad saying " fuck this " , which is just a little bit your fault . the bright side being you ' ve survived digit years without him , so there ' s that .
   (ID: 306fcce176e83db604dac17838eed1e669cd5a90)

16. if the only reason you can find for still doing something partners included is that you  ve been doing it so long why stop now ? just try to stop and move on . it  s most likely just holding you hostage with your on sentimental emotions .
   (ID: 411b23f3d2a1f254c1c92c17670bb02c191a1301)

17. literally just aaaaaaaaa road so that you  d have to scream it every time . you  ve also gotta pronounce all digit a  s  so next head down main st . and take a left on to aaaaaaaaa road
   (ID: 6710bef520e10a3963d2983d4b36ef411e442f22)

18. wow thanks for this review ! i  ve been dying to get my hands on this bag but am trying to be less impulsive as part of my new years resolution weary  face i just messaged her and am planning to put an order in . i saw you took a digit  digit point off for the g being wrong . what exactly is wrong with it if you don  t mind me asking ? i don  t see anything sticking as bad , but it  s probably just my inexperienced eyes that i  m missing something !
   (ID: 8d5aac58a9c3a7e883f9e90df39dc5ab7c36de53)

19. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

20. ok so this is the first year i  ve told my self no goals just go with the flow . every year i have high expectations of myself and end up disappointing myself , not this year . i  m not gonna take life so seriously and just see what happens .
