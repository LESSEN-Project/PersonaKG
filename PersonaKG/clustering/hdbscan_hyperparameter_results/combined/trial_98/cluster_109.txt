1. thanks for the calm response ! i was half expecting much worse ! i think that people quitting when they ' re about to get interrogated is bad , but i wouldn ' t exactly describe it as cheating . does that make sense ? if it was in my hands obviously not but just in theory i ' d probably give disconnecting on purpose from a match regardless manually not alt  f4 as that could cause issues with crashes a temp ban .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

2. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

3. shadow assault is unquestionably the least desirable . it ' s not a ' bad ' , heroic in reality , vp is just fantastic . most of the other less than desirable heroics i can think of niche use for , but that ' s the most difficult one . the other two that come to mind are rain of chaos which is decent for zoning during a push , and mind control can be used for picks in some cases . i wouldn ' t recommend picking them most of the time , but you can come up with situations where they are pretty decent . abby ' s construct blanking out on the name , is good and bad in so far that if not stopped it can do a lot of damage . it limits his team  fight potential though , so unless your team can compensate in some other ways it can be difficult to use properly . it has high potential though , and under the right circumstances is arguably superior .

4. this is how players get hurt . having to think to much and letting up , not doing what you would naturally do . this is more of a problem than the refs . they should just play digit  hand touch and qbs should wear red jerseys the whole year if this is how it  s gonna be . i understand the league trying to protect the qb , but this is just absolutely ridiculous now .
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

5. not a woman but i am a chef yes it  s absolutely true . the biggest problem is with double standards . i see this every day with my female roommate who works with me . if i get frustrated and raise my voice or snap , i  m getting pissed off . if she does , she  s being a bitch if i get overwhelmed , my natural response is to get mad . if she does , her natural response is to get a little teary eyed . for some reason anger is more acceptable sexual harassment is ubiquitous in the kitchen . most guys don  t even think about it , we tell dirty jokes and grab each other and it  s just the culture . my roommate has a sense of humor and doesn  t make a big deal about it no one touches her , we don  t cross that line , but i can tell it does make her uncomfortable at times
   (ID: a428ebec68dc8bb1dccfb778bb32844c5677e265)

6. i think we need to stop this silly gossip . bruce wayne is a very respectable and charitable man around here , we keep these rumors up he may just pack up and leave .
   (ID: b22d67acc81c3e3bf700f9a159ec06062eb72fd2)

7. just when you think it ' s gone you hear the eeeeeee .
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

8. so what if they ' re not the highest quality ? op is proud of them and i think they look nice , so just stop being a dick about it
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

9. as long as you don  t tell anyone about the crush whatsoever , i  d say it  s not cheating . and i also don  t think you should have to completely cut off contact with the other person . you liked them for a reason so just stay good friends based on that friendship
   (ID: d53ad0bccb6d6f62bf1a4957708759d7b446498b)

10. yes it would be , he already feels lonely for not having a girlfriend . what do you think his friends leaving will do to him ? you might just push him to complete loneliness and sadness . i too have never had a girlfriend and my friends are my emotional support so i feel him . he needs you guys please don ' t leave
   (ID: 96e6613dc4315740eddd6b52a132531aa939f603)

11. let ' s just say that it isn ' t their voices i think of when i ' m in the shower .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

12. i don ' t feel special for it , i wish that everyone felt that way . and i ' m sorry that i responded in a way that you think didn ' t answer the question  if you think it ' s irrelevant , that ' s what the downvote button is for . it ' s just my take on the question ' s topic .
   (ID: 0dd32da9f7e822909c258818ed313736b958a15a)

13. i think you just clearly stated the concept of a ' starter home ' that you and your spouse are doing right now . as your family and income grows , you may find that house too small and if you are able to buy a larger home , you may do so .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

14. well guys do tell me i ' m hot , but they say that about so many guys that i think it ' s just something they habitually say and it really doesn ' t mean much . it ' s also such a 1980s saying that i ' m surprised anyone still uses it lol ! i suspect they ' re just settling since they couldn ' t get any of the hot guys .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

15. no you weren  t raped and it  s sad that people think what happened to you is the same as getting attacked . forget gender , you were in your house with your girlfriend , and the only reason people think is because you were tired . get real kid . your not a victim , you just need a nap .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

16. f but you think it was because of you or just a coincidence ?
   (ID: 23787c4fae3b342db05df0a4a1f689825f600fe3)

17. it ' s sad that because of my name everyone thinks that i ' m just a stupid person that is going to argue that communism is the greatest ideology in the world . but if you think that it ' s okay people have their own opinions . it ' s funny how you think that i didn ' t read the question but it ' s fine i guess . you can call me commie and tell me to fuck off if you wish . if that makes your day better
   (ID: be642743472cdef9445edc6dd55beb3c2a8a1258)

18. just when you think it can ' t get worse , she keeps typing .
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

19. by god its a little baby . what country sends babies to school ? i ' m not judging per say , if that ' s what your country does that ' s fine . it just seems odd from where i ' m sitting . then again my kids came to work with me from the age of digit to digit when they started school . you probably think that is weird .
   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

20. every reply you make to one of my comments , you just keep getting more and more unintelligible . i think you should be less focused on this kid ' s schooling and more on your own .
