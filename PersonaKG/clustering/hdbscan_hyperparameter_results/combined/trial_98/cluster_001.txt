1. you  ll go through about an hour or so of practicing the moves on the ground with the guys who will be strapped on to you , they never once talked about what to do if you wanted to back out , so the thought was never in your mind . when you get up in the plane , they  ll talk you through it while you reach altitude . when you reach altitude , you don  t have much time before they pretty much throw you out of the airplane . it was fun , i was excited to do it so i was never scared of it .

2. thank you for your answer ! yeah i see what you mean . i  ve never seen the sleeping one before and i thought were the same as the ryokan one because they looked so similar when i searched them on google image . the problem is , in tourist shop they only sell the matsuri one , usually with the big obi and shoes etc . but i  ll keep looking thank you !

3. honestly , i ' ve thought about this too much , i would start work at the food  dessert place as a waitress they frequently visit and get to know all the familiar customers and if i hear a comment about someone doing something disastrous . i ' ll get the said person to refer them to the said shop and i ' ll poison them . it ' s doesn ' t ever link back to knowing the person personally or anything either .

4. when i saw her appear on the news i instantly thought " fucking useless " . i honestly don ' t have any animosity to her , barely knew she existed before all this , but now she ' ll always be " fucking useless " to me .

5. yes i thought of doing the survey in both ways it would be cool but first i ' ll see if there ' s enough people answering to this one or if nobody cares about it and then i ' ll probably do the one about the perfect guy !

6. in daft punk ' s " get lucky " there ' s a part where the robot voice repeat ' s the line " we ' re up all night to get lucky " but i thought they said " we ' ll rub a mexican monkey . " i knew it couldn ' t be right but i couldn ' t unhear it and convinced my wife that it was actually the lyrics because " there aren ' t any wild mexican monkeys and it would be awe fully lucky to rub them "

7. i understand dude , i  m digit and you  ll be surprised as hell by how much you  ll learn with each year that goes by . about a year and a half ago i also thought i was with the one , respected her opinion and thought she was smart . turned out i  ve realized a lot i was blind to by my infatuation  love ? and she really wasn  t that smart , great or loyal either lol i was pretty destroyed and still am effected by it and being rather attractive it tore me down . but it taught me a lot in the end . now i  m living in europe , accepted in med school and handsome  fit whilst she failed her school and is with an ugly loser who she screwed me over with . moral is you learn from these things , and focus on yourself primarily aside from family .
