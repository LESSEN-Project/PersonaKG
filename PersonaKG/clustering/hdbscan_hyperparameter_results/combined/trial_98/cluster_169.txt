1. when i was young back in middle school , i had incredible confidence . i remember i proposed a girl by this line  " a woman like you should be mine " . and funny thing is she said yes . with time  age  certain events in my life , all my confidence floated away to oblivion . i don ' t know how this happened . being adult  self  awareness does make us to put limit on ourselves  then this causes us to lose some of our savagery .

2. ok . ay ? but whatever you do you must convince bullets , pendulums , sky and horizon to behave exactly like on a ball . also some examples of people losing jobs and photos of these death threats please . and what do you mean at the end ? in which way does zooming prove flat earth ? second , you answered part of my question , we still don ' t know what ' s the purpose of all this . don ' t try to convince me it ' d be too long , the answer would fit in one sentence .

3. pulp fiction . interesting directing but the plot as a whole was awful and the witty dialogue couldn  t make up for a lack of a sense of purpose . an issue i have with many nonlinear stories is that it detracts from the tension in certain scenes . it  s like when you  re reading a book and see that there  s still digit pages left , so you know nothing bad is going to happen to the main character .

4. it ' s so funny people don ' t know what we turks have to deal with , our minimum hourly wage is around digit . digit  . it ' s like a joke and it doesn ' t even matter if you have a master degree , i ' m so jealous of europe countries .

5. i agree that she ' s dropping hints . next time she brings it up say something like " why in the world does anyone get married ? the details are mind numbing ! i can ' t imagine putting myself through that . big sigh . i don ' t know how you ' re managing to deal with all this . let ' s go to a movie or something because this is seriously depressing me . "

6. don ' t forget to post your results . there might be a wilkinson cameras or something near you too , and they sometimes have good varieties of film in stock . i ' d probably advise to shoot a few rolls normally like that before diving into home development , if for no other reason than it takes a big factor out of the process and it ' s one less thing to go wrong i . e . if the pics come out dodgy , you know it ' s going to be the camera rather than your development

7. i honestly don ' t know how you guys cling to any of your self respect , all of that begging for likes , shares , follows , subscribes etc etc , doing giveaways bribes to make people come and look at your crap . i swear if i ever hear the sentence " please like , subscribe , comment and follow me on instagram and twitter " in real life im going to punch them in the nose as a reflex action .

8. actually what your describing is a thing that has nothing to do with anger . " call of the void " is when you see an opportunity to do something you know to be horrible and feel a sudden urge to do it . this happens to let your mind know it has control over the situation . like standing on the edge of a cliff . the mind goes " this is scary , i could fall , i could die " so the next step is " i could kill myself , but i won ' t kill myself , so i ' m not going to die . does that make sense ? tl  dr you ' re fine , everybody feels this , it ' s a way to feel in control .

9. so if i trap my neighbors dog that gets out all the damn time and comes into my yard say hi to my cat i ' m within my rights to trap it and leave it outside ? it ' s one thing to scare the cat off because you don ' t like it , its completely different to trap it and send it off to be potentially euthanized because the pet owners don ' t know their cat is at animal control .

10. waaaaaaay too many blockbusters i know daredevil isn ' t a part of the cinematic universe , but it was much better than any of the movies minus the fillers and plot holes it didn ' t follow the same formula of intro , blah , blah , and buildup to the cgi fight scene at the end , yay everyone ' s happy now . it had depth . it had enough time to explore both the hero and the villian . i felt like if mcu took a page out of the netflix book , they ' d be a little better off . i don ' t understand how people are still so impressed by the same cgi anymore . it ' s gotten bland . also , the action was very organic .

11. how are you supposed to know what you like if you don ' t try it ? so wait has the narrative shifted away from being born that way to trying it and liking it ? you guys make this shit so confusing it ' s impossible to keep track . half of me thinks the definitions keep getting changed because y ' all can ' t admit you don ' t even remember them .

12. bruh that ' s my mom . it ' s getting embarrassing too . she posted a pic of some black girl in a zoo after that gorilla died . " to remind people of what it used to be like " yeah i know that shit happened , but how many damn years ago ? this is one of the reasons people don ' t take blm seriously , because you always see people holding onto shit for the longest and playing the victim .
