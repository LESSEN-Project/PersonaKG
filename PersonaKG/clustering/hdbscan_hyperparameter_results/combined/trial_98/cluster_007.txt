1. lmao how pretentious are you ? you write like a child found a thesaurus and thought it would make him cool . i understand the historical context . slavery wasn  t ok , slavery doesn  t justify genocide . white people were awful  brutalized slaves , doesn  t mean you should go and murder everyone with a drop of european blood . but sure , go ahead pretending you  re smarter than everyone else  justifying genocide , bud .

3. first of all , not sure why you  re so pressed that you decided to write an essay . second of all , my original comment was referring to myself . of course i don  t have control over the rest of the earth . humans obviously won  t go extinct , and i  m not a world leader or anything like that to ensure that we would go extinct . the idea that not existing is better than a shitty existence makes total sense to me  and you have not brought up a single reason as to why you believe that my opinion is absurd . i  d personally not suffer rather than suffer . not sure about you . i was just voicing what a lot of younger people have thought about lately . tldr  you need to calm down .

7. that ' s what i thought , go and let them see how sick you are but risk getting others sick and look selfish too . i ' m not sure .
