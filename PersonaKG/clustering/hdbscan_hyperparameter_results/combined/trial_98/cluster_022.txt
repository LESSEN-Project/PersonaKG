6. ive done it before intentionally once or twice . it requires a good deal of self awareness . to do it i tried focusing on and idea , almost as if a mantra , as i drifted to sleep carrying the idea with me through diminishing consciousness . then at some point you are just dreaming and you have to realize you are asleep . hopefully this is done by realizing that you are dreaming about what you intended and then go from there . i realized though that i got terrible sleep when i did this so i stopped . i also knew someone who claimed to lucid dream a few nights a week for a about a year . he practiced techniques and got good at it .

16. " riley " i ' m sorry your day turned to shit . the crappy thing about fear is that it isn ' t always rational and when caught off guard it is difficult to act rationally anyway . i had a similar experience a few years ago which helped me decide i was buying a car so i didn ' t have to wait at bus stops and i have the guy half of my land line number and the other half of my cell . to this day i wonder why i didn ' t just say no . or maybe i did and he insisted . i cast it as a lesson learned for the future . sadly he got on the same bus as me and i got got off and doubled back to another route .
