1. i agree with this digit  . when i put my blinker on to get over , more than half the time , the person i ' m trying to get over in front of speeds up to stop me from getting over . so i just quit using them .

2. when people touch your stuff . it happens too often that people just pick up my backpack and throw it on my lab instead of asking to free the seat next to me . and for some reason its always women who do that , guys always ask

3. . so ? i don ' t recycle . why should i conserve the planet for a bunch of assholes making billions exploiting it ? just give them more time to do what they please ? what ' s my " contribution " gonna do , compared to an oil spill ? what ' s my carbon footprint compared to a multinational ' s empire ? fiat iustitia , et pereat mundus .

4. so basically the only reason is so that people don ' t do the same to you later ? not that they have any individual value or right to a seat , just they are some sort of " karma points " for you .

5. men are just mad that they  re being asked to be better people . if the ad doesn  t apply to you , there  s no reason to get mad at it . if you  re getting angry at it , you  re probably a part of the population gillette has asked to be better .

6. uhhhh you can just cup a fart with your hand and put it in your mouth . you don ' t need to be underwater to do this .

7. digit he didn  t make another post about all religions digit he can have whatever views he wants to have , just as i can call out a potential inconsistency in the view . why the fuck do you even care anyway ? do you disagree with my point ? or do you just have some ridiculous need to argue about absolutely nothing .

8. would you , would you really ? or are you just small minded and don ' t understand how to deal with a broken game . working these people to death will get nowhere . they probably hate their managers for working them hard at the end of the project . they probably didn ' t agree with every decision . they probably just go to work and attempt to find solutions , work within the confines of company procedure , and do what they can . why should they be worked all weekend just so you can sit in your underwear alone and play digit . just get a different game and wait for them to do what they can .

13. wow ! that ' s a lot lol thank you . i own a aspire breeze and it says on the packaging that i should not go over 70vg or 6mg . so after reading this i could go past digit but it would just take more time to wick ?

14. just apply , you don ' t need any experience . you apply , they call you in , you take a test , if you pass they do an interview .

15. you will go hoping that maybe , just maybe this time they will see something in you that will change their mind . spoiler alert  they don ' t . either they see you as a friend , and they are doing to be nice  or they will use to take advantage of you . either way doesn ' t end well , in my experience at least . just learn to cut your loses and move on .
