3. i  m a nanny and honestly you pay for what you get . if you want someone to take care of your kids with love and care then you need to pay them happily . the family i nanny right now don  t need me for many hours but they don  t want to lose me so they still pay me my normal pay . if you want someone who you will trust and will take good care of your kids , you pay a considerable amount .

   (ID: 37afe6aed6f5a2677e6ebd0e4e168a560dc96061)

8. we would grow indoors , and one of the main reasons i want to go is i ' m an addict and need to make a change . leaving family sucks but they act and look at me differently since they found out about the drug use . i love them but i need to get away from them as much as my dealers .
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)

9. no one claimed it was ' good ' marketing . you seemed confused as to why a company would want to portray their game in a positive light . personally i would love to see all ads simply read  " here is our product , check it out . if you want "
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

10. i hate when people half share info  even if the news is boring , don ' t not name names or share your " exciting " news . you gotta love it when people talk about how upset they are on a public post , someone asks if they are okay , and they reply with any of the following . " yes fine babes " " don ' t want to talk about it " " it ' s private " fucking sandra .

11. do you want me in your love tunnel

12. the thing i ' d love to see that hasn ' t really been done right is a business manager game . i ' d prefer a restaurant sim , but instead of making it simple and have dexterity type controls , i want it to be a normal " manage " style gameplay , but you ' re dealing with buying food orders , hiring employees , creating a menu out of your food items , pricing your dishes , marketing  advertising , etc .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)
