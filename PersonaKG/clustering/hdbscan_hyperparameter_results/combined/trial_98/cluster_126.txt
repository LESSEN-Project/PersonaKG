5. no , it ' s quite normal to be sedated for it . you generally have to ask for them to keep you awake . it sounds like a failure of the anesthesiologist if they were unable to keep you sedated , and it ' s battery unless you told them you want to be awake plus you described it as what sounds like battery to me .

6. balancedsuperpowers i like it more than godteirsuperpowers or shittysuperpowers because it provides a bit more of a dilemma i would like to go through there and kinda debate with my friends if you would want that superpower downside combo

7. in the days where everyone wants access to free information , we have plenty of sites to provide that access . sites like documenting reality , liveleak , goregrish and best gore . they help preserve the legacy of what rotten was . it ' s not some sicko fetish like reddit seems to misinterpret . we want to be reminded of how bad the world can get , so we may appreciate our own lives and those of everyone else .

8. you mean you want to use a simple splitter cable , like the type you ' d use to plug two sets of headphones into a single headphone jack ? i personally wouldn ' t do that . i ' d get a proper mixer although for what you paid for the scarlett and the cost of a cheap mixer , you ' re probably into the cost of a better interface that has multiple inputs and would allow you to use it as the mixer kind of like what i do .
