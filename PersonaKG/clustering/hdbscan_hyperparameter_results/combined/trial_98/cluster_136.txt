   (ID: 40e9f2306751118eda95174d093680e74831a34d)

3. i ' d have to say ori and the blind forest . it ' s such a beautiful game with such a beautiful soundtrack . the story is told with few words and more visual story telling . that game never fails to make me shed a few tears , even on the 5th playthrough . it ' s not playing a platformer , its living the trials of ori and it just submerges you so well that i ' d have to say it ' s my all time favorite game .

   (ID: 2bb956084cb9bf79f58345d6cf6beca98e76bbb4)

   (ID: c8c5c965e2188b52c51dd0dd8715dabd412209f5)

7. you might be right . there probably was a cause for the big bang . just because we haven ' t figured the specifics , however does not mean we should invent a religion around the mystery . scientists have figured out the causes of many things . so far magic is not one of them .
   (ID: 2266c34274940e2ea1a22a3dee5a3cbcdad25f53)

8. i try to remember that i am just one member of a species on a tiny planet on the edge of a typical galaxy in a vast universe . puts things in perspective for me
   (ID: 2bb956084cb9bf79f58345d6cf6beca98e76bbb4)

   (ID: 89a759866debf6704efa0f603c1b9c4476abd731)

10. little house on the prarie , andy griffith show , the waltons . just regular good ol lessons about life . how that you have to struggle and suffer through things sometimes and not have anyone to ' save ' you . and you learn to be a better person because of it .
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

11. i just recently began an unarmed playthrough on a kajiit . the unarmed damage is insane if you do things right , and it ' s lots of fun to use the wrestling move finishers . the youtube channel fudgemuppet has loads of ideas for new and interesting builds . i strongly suggest checking them out to find one that suits you .
   (ID: 0f8bca5cd80e9429ae58bb976857e3c5ab057290)

12. yea , i realize that , however , it was pounded into since i was digit . one of the few good things about my father is that he actually gave a damn about the environment . so little me was constantly told to sort the trash and whatnot . it ' s just something i never let go .
   (ID: 5ee4d4a98d2da62835d0e63abf8fe5bbfa95111b)

13. yeah , why i was wondering if anyone knew anything else i can rely on . i am scared to heck , we just moved . things haven ' t been the easiest .
   (ID: d42f47f147cdc8e97117f0e4963e2c1309d1dcd8)

14. no one is getting what i ' m saying tbh lol . people are just saying things without even reading descriptions on the game .
   (ID: 7c96bac704435347f721cc9a3056b8d7be16cc06)

15. no i don ' t wanna get into one fast . i have a lot of other things queued up first . if was just thinking one which one it would be better in the long run which it will be

16. once you start the ball rolling with saving money it ' s can become addicting to see your piggy bank et fatter and fatter . just ask yourself , why put your money into depreciating assets ? is it worth the short term excitement for having less money in the long term when you could be using the extra money to pay off debt and expenses ? you will be glad in the long term if you saved your money for important things .
   (ID: 89bda4e1242c8f5567558138509db8b02cf94cd6)

17. a movie where the villain is the main character but every thing that they do was just an accident and these things lead them to become a feared villain .
   (ID: 87921f4850625bbc1ea70e7a3027781ab887303e)

18. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

19. you don ' t looking for good things . they just happen .
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

20. it is better to just get a new controller . you could find some videos on youtube to fix those certain things if you  re handy and can wait for the pieces to come in the mail .
