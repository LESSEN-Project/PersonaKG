Total from this dataset: 14

1. yep , you ' re totally just ignoring this . you didn ' t make a comment about how you were unsubscribing or respond to my comment . i can see how you just mind your own business and ignore things . you ' re totally not acting like a whiny snowflake at all .
   (ID: dc639446b154d74c8655191b5a755643abd00c2d)

2. agreed , the idea that someone or something created all of this intentionally is kind of saddening . i like the idea that we just show up here do our thing and then we  re done way more than being put here by someone do do things , potentially under their control .

3. sounds like your wiki page is just the beginning of things in your world that are gonna get deleted .

4. i felt really shitty , she was like just staring into the ceiling with a " is it over yet " kind of face . i guess it ' s one of those things where you get what you pay for .

5. no problem you have a point though instead of attacking npcs like the left would we should take the high road and discuss and educate each other otherwise we ' re just as bad as the things we shit on

6. i digit  agree . the enablers are the worst . they see something is wrong with the person and say things like  that is just how he is
   (ID: 472de55a2855849453179c0ccb5234c4ea9d1192)

7. you describe parts of a thing called scientific method , and do it rather well may i add . by earlier description it may have occurred to some flat  earthers that they are wrong . i often watch odd youtubes and such about things like that  it doesn ' t mean i believe in them , it just means i find them entertaining

8. the guy is just bad at grammar and making coherent sentences , yet some people still believe that he will actually go and admit things like that to public .
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

9. i get stuck in a place with no dimensions , it  s just darkness around me . i can see things , but can  t tell how far away they are because i have no frame of reference for their size . it  s really hard to explain . it  s almost like floating , but i have a feeling of being heavy , almost weighed down by something . i guess the best way to explain it would be emptiness , with an occasional object in the distance ?
   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

10. i imagine it ' s normal to homogenize your peers , if they like the same things as you , logically they are similar to you and probably around your age , but realistically there is a huge age span of the old nerds who were on computers before everyone else along with those youngsters just discovering reddit . yeah , i do the same thing

11. i was with you until the end man just because you don  t like something doesn  t mean you can  t research things , if you was in a debate then that research would be a lot more convincing than just saying  lol school shooting no matter other things kill more  for example op made a post that out school shooting deaths into context . also that  s really just something a child would say  oh you don  t like      then why are you trying to justify why you don  t like it

12. the controls suck terribly optimised for controller . i am struggling to do basic things like control my phone in game . just terrible , please wait for an update so they dont thino this is ok
   (ID: a2ca7f9e05e83928ce894848f01290dbcd0f654e)

13. wow , do you have a groomer you can trust ? i have read all these posts about how groomers will do horrible things to sammies like shaving them without asking or whatever . that  s awesome that you have someone trustworthy . mainly i just wanted to come on here and tell you how absolutely adorable this video was . this made my morning .

14. i agree with you to a large extent , but part of me imagines some couples just like doing things for one another thus that they don ' t let their so do certain chores as its their contribution to the relationship . so i understand how it can happen unintentionally without someone being lazy , or useless .
