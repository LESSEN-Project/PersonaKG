1. digit is the legal drinking age for most provinces of canada . digit is the celebrated milestone , but so is digit because the states is right below us . for me , kissing draws the big distinction on what would transpire between myself and my . er . partner . take white . i had major major feelings for him and i told him so after kissing him . his response ? word for word  " don ' t say that " . i ' m trying to understand how some people can just walk into a club  bawhatever purely for the intent of sex and they don ' t care who with . maybe i ' m just super picky , i dunno .
   (ID: 9d1e879011bb23fa9a0cff4c99a536feb2705b86)

3. somehow in middle school i managed to access the silk road through tor before i even knew what i was doing was illegal . not sure how i found the website link since it was always changing , but you could literally buy anything on there . anything . drugs , porn , people , weapons , stolen goods , exotic animals , you name it . i got pretty scared of what id find though , so i only poked around for about digit mins before i got off tor forever .
   (ID: 0c93ab3ec35cab16ded3445fcca7b6045c1dd147)

4. why do atheists choose to hide behind " lack of belief " and not be specific ? how is it " hiding behind ? i lack a believe . what more is there to it ? what specifics do you want ? i don ' t believe in zeus because i understand that thunder and lightning and the result of atmospheric conditions . i don ' t believe in yahweh or jesus , because the stories about them are obviously fables . i don ' t believe there is some vague , deistic , sum  total  of  the  universe god because there is no reason to believe that one exists , and as someone who studies astronomy and cosmology , i already have a word for that . the universe .
   (ID: 00b878c3a1ec656c05e2872b35fdccfcfda3baac)

5. what am i suppose to say ? what ' s done is done , no need to keep feeling guilty and letting it eat me up for months messing with my mind and shit . just letting go now and not letting it bother me sounds way better then letting stuff fuck me up like most people do .

6. did you skip the whole part where i talked about 3rd party verification ? i have the internet , it takes very little time for me to confirm the legitimacy of qualifications . there is no full information in the real market ? please explain that , it doesn  t make sense . also , i hate to break it to you but there are shitloads of unlicensed drivers on the roads every day . so if you  re assuming you  re surrounded by competent , licensed drivers every time you are on the road you need to wake up to the reality of that situation .

11. it ' s good to hear he doesn ' t mind the crate . i wish my friends had gotten one of those huge metal crates , i think that would have saved their dog . i wish we could have conversations with our dogs and explain what ' s going on where there is thunder or fireworks . i imagine they think the world is collapsing around them or something . i have heard of people using dog training cd ' s that play scary noises or you can just use youtube videos and teach them its no big deal . good luck !

12. i used to smoke pot daily , gave it up suddenly and had some vivid dreams afterwards , they say you don ' t dream when you smoke weed for a long time , my brain seemed to be making up for lost time one night , i had this dream i had verbally assaulted a female work colleague , it was so real to me that i thought it actually did happen the next morning , i went to work that day and apologized for my poor behavior , she was so confused and she said it never happened . to this day i am unsure if it did or not .

17. when tech  decks were a thing , i was like digit years old and i had one that i thought was super cool looking , when i played with them and did kick flips and ollie  s and stuff i was using both hands and grabbing the tech deck to make it look like an ollie instead of using one hand and kind of flicking the skateboard to do the tricks quickly . so after all my hours of training with both hands , i finally went to the playground . kids younger than me had the little skatepark quarter pipes that you can buy with them to grind and do other tricks and when i went and started showing off my sweet moves the kids told me i  m garbage and told me to leave and not touch their toys anymore and i was so stunned like what i thought this is how you used it ? and they were like nah you use one hand and no thumbs you  re garbage so i was completely wrong the whole time on how to use the toy . needless to say i  d still play with them on my desk when the teacher wouldn  t look and use them my way with two hands and thumbs , and other kids would come and play too it was nice that some people actually liked my way of using tech decks too

20. the people are like everywhere else , you get some good , some bad . however , it is a lot more close knit , i know probably digit  of the people in my age bracket on a first name basis , which is a good thing in a way , bad in another because if you do anything wrong , everyone knows who you are ! . there is a lot of gossip , but theres a lot of gossip everywhere in this day  age haha
