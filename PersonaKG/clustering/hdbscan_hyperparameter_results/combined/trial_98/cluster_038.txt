   (ID: f82f3baec2974026f7aecc84e871be136212e237)

   (ID: e0798c12461ac5613da92581f6008329682d23a7)

11. how often do you tell your water you love it tho ? like , is there a trick ? hasn  t worked for me
   (ID: 827584bdc66e3c4749f22f0ad0a9420dc64ac2b5)

12. i don ' t understand the love for babies . they are such hard work and not at all fun or cute to me yes i ' m a mom and still feel this way . i get a icky feeling around people who have baby fever just oozing out of them . maybe this is super harsh to say , but i feel like there ' s something wrong with people like that who need to have this thing baby rely on them and need them to do everything for them . i love love love seeing my son get more independent every year and don ' t long for another baby whatsoever . buh  bye baby stage forever !

13. the repairs on the car sound reasonable , once the transmission starts to go , my guess is a faulty fuse or a wire grounding out somewhere , i ' d say pay the to fix it and save more money for a car , i love my honda civic she still like new though not for long ha ha
   (ID: da770212ea31887c4be30925213eff0dc5d8687b)

14. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .

15. i love this , maybe it isn ' t as good as other posts , but this really feels like something you would come up with in the shower , nice one op
   (ID: 4cd63391f1644eb1dde02717bf6a72fc6c22acc7)

16. if you have low self confidence it ' s probably because there are things about you that you don ' t like . if having a girlfriend is the only thing about you that you don ' t like and you expect another person to love you without loving yourself , than you ' re going to have an unhealthy relationship . find out what you need to do to love yourself before looking for someone else and when you succeed the right person will come around . and if she doesn ' t , it doesn ' t matter , because you ' re happy .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

20. it was shockingly easy . like , they matched us and we were like  that  s it ?  it  s been wonderful , though . we love our au pair and she loves our kids , and it  s been so cool getting to learn about her culture and show her ours . the only cons would be that they can  t care for really young babies by themselves at all so you can  t even run to the grocery store and leave them with your new baby , and the hours they work are really limited which is good and necessary but is annoying to calculate
