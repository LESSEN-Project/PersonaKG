4. i can ' t stand instagram however i don ' t like the people who use the site , you do you , if you want to use that cesspool of garbage , that ' s fine . the reasons i strongly dislike instagram , is particularly because it is made by the owners of facebook . i ' m not saying reddit is superior , or anything like that it is just because of the history of facebook , history of anti vax users . i

5. its was my first one too , so i recommend you jojo ' s bizarre adventure , mob psycho digit and overlord . jojo ' s is a must have for anime fans . just watch it even if the first episodes are more or less bad . if you liked one punch man you will also like mob . that all i want to say to that . try overlord if you want something new .

8. that  s the whole issue . i contacted support right away , and it  s been digit hours and i haven  t heard from them . i checked my tasks again and it looks like they took care of digit of the digit birds . i recontacted them about the one that is still in my task list . i sent them screenshots of the nest and the error code like i  m supposed to . i just don  t want any problems from big bird if it  s showing in my tasks after digit days , or if i cancel the task .

12. forget about skin color . that  s just completely irrelevant . who cares what color anyone in this story is ? if someone breaks into your home , you have the right to shoot them ! i don  t own a gun but shit like this makes me want to get one . you have a right to protect your home and yourself and the person who broke in is a criminal and should have been aware of the risks ! bring on the downvotes , i don  t care . seems like i  m the only person here with any sense in their head ! why are you sticking up for someone who broke into someone else  s home ? play stupid games , win stupid prizes ! duh !

13. the worst thing that it looks like its triggered by sunlight so most of the time its always in public and i have to rush to go home before i start looking like im turning into monstar cus of the hives and i have to risk my life by running across a street without even looking if there are any cars coming just cus i dont want anyone to see the hives

14. it is but it ' s better like that , plus if i really don ' t want to continue i just break up and appreciate my privacy again until the depression comes back .

16. i don  t see the shtick about being toxic to jojo fans , jojo is anime . it  s a fact . just let people like what they want to like
   (ID: d72952657a3571deff985040e565d95d8206db60)

18. i  m glad you found it helpful btw , if like me you  re a mom who  s frequently sitting around with an infant while they clusterfeed , there is free video content on the  ewtn  app too if you just want to watch some videos and chill for a bit with something not netflix

19. maybe try to subtly come off that you really want this job , but not like you just want the money , more like it ' s your dream to work there and that you ' re willing to do almost anything to work there .

20. well you are setting yourself up for a fall . you said she  s super religious , this will not end well for you . she will either make you go to some other crazy jesus freak that will attempt to rid these devils from you , lol , or she will blow a nut just like you said she does and call you a fag and want you to get out . now sit back and take all that in because you are heading down a path that has no positive outcome for you . sorry . you already said who she is . good luck dude .
