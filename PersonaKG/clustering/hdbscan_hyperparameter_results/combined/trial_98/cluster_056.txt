2. don ' t try to act it was intentional or that you were serious . just laugh in a way , that indicates that you know you just did something awkward . thats how you show confidence and the ability to laugh about yourself . but you still need to stand your ground , if your awkward moment becomes a permanent joke about you . but the absolute worst thing you can do ist to become the aggressor , if you try to bring the attention to somebody else , by beeing an asshole , you show everybody your low self esteem and bad character .

5. the hard work one is debatable . but i do have a clue about the bible and jesus , i just used logic to determine that neither are correct and worth believing in . as for the locker room stuff , i don ' t know about you but i just wanted to change and go with my day since i am straight . kinda goes against the bible thing though if you did what you are talking about in the locker room .

6. either you didn ' t have a television  radio  computer the last eight years , or you just willfully ignored all the rampant whining by conservatives over every little thing obama did . either way , you ' re talking out of your ass , and you know it .

7. next time you are being served by a waitress , strike up a conversation and ask her out of curiosity how many times she gets asked out in a shift  week whatever . them do the math and realize you didn  t stand a chance not because of anything you did but just because it becomes a knee jerk response . you might be a wonderful person but every guy that asks her out thinks he is too . she doesn  t know you .
