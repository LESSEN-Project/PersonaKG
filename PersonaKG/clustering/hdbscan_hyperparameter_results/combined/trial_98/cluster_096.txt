7. by no means an expert just from my experience lvl digit at this time . digit  from my experience incense only works for you my wife has the game too , beside me on the couch will not see the same pokes or any i see when i have incense activated . incense seems to attract pokemon that are " native " to the area , but not necessarily the pokemon on your nearby list . i use incense when i ' m sitting at home being lazy because when i ' m walking around they pop up regularly but hardly at all when stationary . incense seems to create pokemon rather than attract nearby ones . thats all i got , hopefully someone else can help with your other questions .
