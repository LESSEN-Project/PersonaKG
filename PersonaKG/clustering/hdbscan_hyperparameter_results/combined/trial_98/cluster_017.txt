1. attendance policy . i ' ve had teachers who did nothing but read off a powerpoint through the whole class , and yet we still had to be present for the majority of days each semester , even though it was a complete waste of time .

4. sorry on mobile so i booted up the game today and accidentally clicked kyf instead of killer  the game lagged out for maybe a straight minute and then loaded killer without me backing out of kyf and selecting killer killer loaded weird , i had all the perks at rank three but all four perk slots , both addon slots and the offering slot were locked and all the cosmetics except mike ' s bloody mask eventually it smartened up but never did give me my mask back or take away the overalls . i ' ve even played a few matches and still nothing

5. man i ' m looking forward to that 3rd episode , the preview looks fantastic ! also , please keep the updates coming , i can imagine you must be real busy but the occasional word from you guys goes a long way . on a different note  did the banana bread turn out to be any good ? that was probably the funniest , most chaotic yet entertaining cooking show i ' ve ever watched .

7. this turn one is auto concede from odd rogue since the only aoe they really have is fan of knives . then for the late game i run two doomguards , two digit mana digit  7s and leeroy to finish it out . i ' ve found it to be one of the stronger aggro decks but there are a lot of digit or digit card combos . all i did was throw digit digit mana heal boi and digit ghouls into regular zoo .

10. i see what you mean . i have been called stuck  up because i keep to myself and sometimes have a serious expression on my face that really doesn ' t reflect what ' s going on in my head . i ' ve heard of the marco guy  he really doesn ' t have much to be stuck  up about  simply being the drug  addled son of a rich man is hardly an accomplishment . did that sound snooty ? oops !
