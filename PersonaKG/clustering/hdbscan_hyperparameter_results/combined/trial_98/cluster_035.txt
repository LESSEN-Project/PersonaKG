--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 16

1. literally anything by frank ocean does . makes me think of the love life i never had
   (ID: ab5524e568131ce7cb4db227daae4d0f489838e1)

2. animal abuse , because if you think its ok to do it you will get murdered within digit week . note  i love animals
   (ID: 4beccb79954eaf4ba6b69b6ac31b148b48f4f579)

3. yeah but at least you were loved . not ever being love by someone on the other hand i think is worse .
   (ID: be4c274bc118fc65202a843b71f43c10798b6eb9)

4. you think they should love you because you act , ' nice ' when everyone is supposed to do that regardless . you watch too much anime and are a creepy weeaboo loser . you don ' t share your cheetos . these are the top digit reasons .
   (ID: bfbfd4c4caa6b137f79275a24c99808ba3d2305b)

5. i think it ' s a bit soon to start looking for a label on this . give it another month of nonchalant behavior . if you still feel this madly in love for her bring it up to her then . i ' m fearful that if you ask her now what you two are that this may drive her away from you because it could come across as weakness . be an independent man and do your thing . quit being so clingy already .
   (ID: 8f33db98a9fa29c8f9e44012d79de72291a29519)

6. even if your reverse generalizations don ' t hurt anyone because of power imbalances , does that make it morally right to do so ? i think we should try to love each other from both directions . we can complain about inequality righteously without generalizing groups of people . it ' s wrong to generalize anyone , no matter their color , even when the generalized group is powerful enough to not be affected by it . aaaaand let the name  calling begin .
   (ID: 6cb8904cf2faf74f712ddb1c620007fe43bf46df)

7. you are actually right but i think fumino doesn ' t fit that first girl image completely because most of the first girls usually harsh against mc and a bit annoying . fumino is pure and kind  hearted , not harsh to mc . it doesn ' t matter if mafuyu wins imo , i love both of them . thanks for your opinion .
   (ID: c41e4affc406bbc71e6c12aabf095d759b6dbec2)

8. i think the trash wheel and water shark are symptoms of a larger issue we love to ignore . when was the last time you saw a cop write a ticket to someone throwing trash out the window ? yea me neither .
   (ID: 4ad10ae12cb226893a0aec21cddd0e791f57ede2)

9. ok love . how about the cathedral in naples which holds a vial of blood from an early christian martyr , st . januarius . reportedly , the blood is dry most of the year , but mysteriously liquefies three times throughout the year , on days commemorating his life and impact . i think that one would be testable ?
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

10. i love dakota mackynzie . very strong name that flows well . you could call her kynzie , or i think mac is a super cute nickname for mackynzie
   (ID: b481339e58c54d903a5bef6ed58d704163f4f9f3)

11. is there something wrong with loving back pets that show you their unconditional love ? what on earth do you think it has to do with being american ?
   (ID: 514a3ecd0d04716c9225352c4a3a5d5424dd8056)

12. i think what  s happening is now everyone knows about the show so the typical applicant might br madly in desire of their digit minutes rather than madly in love . collateral damage is what worries me . there are people who would do whatever necessary to get on tv etc , when the shows  s over , their spouse and new families might be over too .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

13. don  t go into a relationship with the mindset that you will change the other person , aka don  t fall in love with the person you think they can be . if someone says that they rather be friends with you than date you and you say yes to being friends , you can  t think that they will eventually fall in love with you or that you will be able to win them over . this one might seem obvious to you but i think we have all seen this happen .
   (ID: 83ed088161a0acc5bb20774e9e10435e55e88737)

14. why do you think we do ? i love my independent woman and am not threatened at all .
   (ID: 4520a5ba79e39385d988ada973bf675eafa2fc5b)

15. huh . i never romanced tali but i figured he would say it at some point , maybe you missed it ? i don ' t think shepard ever says it first though , i remember him answering " i love you too " to most of them , but not the other way around . i guess it ' s usually the love interests who confess their undying love and stuff , shep tends to show more with actions than words .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

16. its the same as when you ' re in a really bad mood you think fuck everyone and everything sucks . when you ' re on m everything ' s bliss ans you love everything . of course nobody means everything they say , they are extremely conditioned under the influence or the drug
