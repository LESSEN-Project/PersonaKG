1. you insinuated that you were a member of avo . so you are a member or you think it would be cool to be one . either way i ' m sure there are better servers for you .
   (ID: ddbcd7b957a26c37891ce72069afaf688ba19977)

2. " yea , i already have three bikes , but none of them do what this bike does , so i ' m gonna get this one too . " " but that ' s so many bikes " " sure but would you ever take a ferrari off  roading ? how about trying to race someone while driving a cargo van ? would you take all of your laundry and groceries on a bitch  bike motorcycle ? " i still think that ' s too many bikes " " i still think you ' re an idiot "
   (ID: b073b7138186ccb7fa807af1158cb23d6b7c113f)

3. that was awkward . i think he ' s leaving for sure . or else he would have celebrated with more enthusiasm .
   (ID: 798fc9f22ec2a1c21f6d387916d4d56336b802ef)

4. do a quick visual check to make sure , but i dont think its too big of a problem . check proper fluid level  color , check pad and rotor wear , and look for any leaks in the lines if you are worried .
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

5. not sure if kidding really isn ' t a question , it is more of a statement . and i have no idea why you might have gotten downvoted , so i upvoted , fwiw , as if you care  what is this " beizbol " y ' all speak of ? if it is what i think it is , the dallas fort worth area has no teams playing in the top division this season .
   (ID: e8a9698601228aac42dab1d9134099b1a5a87a50)

6. well if you really do think so and you ' re sure it ' s not right for you , i ' d say call them and be honest . i ' m sure they ' d be understanding .
   (ID: 339d06087e421a1cf86d695af2a2088546f9dc91)

7. i  m not sure i can send it as a link , but if you have discord or an email or something message me and i think i can send the file that way
   (ID: 194714d1fdaeadcdfa8c031ea9ba02536763b6bf)

8. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

9. sure , it wouldn ' t really matter if they were adopted or not . i ' m trying to say that in terms of decision making , somebody with children adopted or otherwise might be more inclined to look at long  term effects  consequences , as they have an investment  asset in the future . though yes , you ' re absolutely right about a politician being able to be extorted more easily if he has a family . i think maybe you misunderstood what i meant by " investment . "

10. yeah it for sure changed , can  t say when . i was in from digit to digit and we carried all weapons with one in the chamber . i think the difference is in mos . i was infantry for digit years so maybe that  s the difference . i  m not sure a paper pusher would carry in that condition since their not the first line of defense . granted on my last deployment i was a mechanic and i carried with one in the chamber , didn  t even ask or care what the unit sop was .

11. one of those books you think " think this would make a great movie " while your reading it . not sure about jackie chan in the role but who knows he might surprise me .
   (ID: 3f0409a6efb16c26d2f9f7a14f5e75b8945ba427)

12. religious people use it as concrete proof that their one variety of religion is correct and everyone else is wrong . as a side effect , at least digit new religions are created by people who will claim to have spoken with god in that brief moment to gain money and power . agnostic people will believe they saw something but they ' re not sure what but if it came back they ' d definitely think about believing it was real . atheists would set about proving it was an elaborate use of special effects . someone would then go about trying to replicate it , further confusing the agnostics .
   (ID: f2eafcb4d8e0b098ec90234d0bc310dcc0e2a189)

13. i ' m pretty sure it ' s before , because in lore it says that doomfist was defeated by winston and put in prison . saying that the fight scene ends with doomfist and winston about to clash i think it ' s pretty safe to say it ' s before prison . i might be wrong though , because the doomfist mentioned in the original cinematic could be a different one .

14. she is violating the child ' s body by having it torn up and sucked out of her . she is using the child ' s life as a sacrifice to her convenience . yes , slavery is always wrong . in a perfect world this wouldn ' t be a problem in the first place . but in the real world i choose the lesser of two evils . taking an innocent life to prevent your own suffering is wrong . please be intellectually honest and stop using the fringe cases as an excuse to justify the common occurrence . they are definitely worth considering , but even if they were justifiable , it doesn ' t mean the others are . i am pretty sure i have heard every reason that pro  choice advocates have for abortion . and so far , they don ' t change what i see as a very simple truth . it is always morally wrong to take an innocent human life . and , though you are free to disagree with my view on morality , i can ' t think of anything worse that one person could do to another . saving innocent life  saving bodily autonomy .

15. i think there should be a path for deutsh  mittelafrika to gain independence and attack germany . i would and i ' m sure everyone would gladly purge syndies with goring .
   (ID: d2c8c42e9cfcdada2e4a7785bcb8272d5f79a002)

16. that is what is going on here . big company wants to make sure each termination is bulletproof so nothing comes back . i am glad you understand my view that he is not a good cultural fit . he makes me cringe with every customer interaction and i don ' t have the time to stand by him constantly and go through what is right and wrong . it seems to go in one ear and out of other . i think the whole outfit would be much more credible if we didn ' t continue to have him on board .
   (ID: 3f3a13bda2e98055fc23d20ace4e5f76118b56c5)

17. how you get them is how you lose them . why would you think that he would be faithful to you ? i ' m pretty sure he ' s reassuring you the same way he reassured her .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

18. i ' m not sure how you don ' t have a slew of comments here , but i ' d say that you ' re better built that digit   of the overweight us here i ' m sure someone will object with that . i ' d say that you ' re a catch for most anyone and if you had some desire to get more defined , you are at a perfect starting point . from what you ' re posting here , i ' d think that your body isn ' t what ' s kept you single . get on out there and have confidence .
   (ID: 66ee9442886cf2e0fff8240a72749b2d87a5282b)

19. i think it is a system that disallows hidden identity . you will now have to go elsewhere to post anon or suck services someone else is paying for . other than that , those crap solicitor phone calls i keep getting can be blocked , and my competitors cant hack up my adwords account when they have no business and cost me money . i am sure its a problem though . somehow .
   (ID: 457d7d37e1181cc932693cd4220e6fbfd564a75d)

20. i ' m fairly sure the smg sprint animation is directly ripped from future soldier or looks really similar . idk why i think that , it looks really familiar but i haven ' t played grfs in a long time .
