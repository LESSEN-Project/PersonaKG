1. it ' s pretty well established that jesus did exist , i don ' t think that ' s exactly the point op is trying to make .
   (ID: 0fbaeef283f7b2090f763028c227ed73724f3e6c)

   (ID: 5c7a23731c46d9c75722023d6108cb45a421fb75)

3. for me it was oregairu , when i first watched i was at a point in my life where i acted very similar to the main character , and i hated that . the main characters actions never did anything but make me dislike the character , when i finally realized how similar i was to the mc i decided i wanted to be more positive and get better at making friends . while now i don ' t have a lot friends , i do have more than i used to and am a generally happy person . i think that if i never watched that show i would be much less happy with who i am now . tl  dr  oregairu made me realize the reason i wasn ' t happy is that i hated the kind of person i was .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

4. i was trolling some goth chick and she started yelling at me her boyfriend a friend of mine had to hold her back but thats not the scary the scary part is every once and a while she would legit try to scope me out whenever she did find me she would tell me to leave her friend alone long story but yeah i would always think she would falcon punch my ass

5. right ? i was so glad they played maud gone at that show , though i preferred their version at shaky knees the most . what did you think of the new stuff ?
   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

6. wouldn ' t everyone be a little bit suspicious , do you think that some people might assume you did something and go after you or at least heavily question you ?
   (ID: 1476398f6c778fb461539e3f78b07720d4ceee83)

7. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .

8. must be all the beauty products she made him bring home last season . i kid , she looks great . i did kind of think it was funny when she called chantel ' s family image conscious or materialistic or whatever , considering the whole tv , laptop , entire suitcase full of beauty products , etc she demanded pedro bring to her . look , no one hates the family chantel more than i do , but you aren ' t perfect , lady !

9. well you seem to be correct about the cities there and i realize i failed to account for population growth earlier however the industrial revolution happened and that likely led to a large decline however the brits did do a lot of harm however india might have not developed as quickly . oh and btw the british raj was not a collony untill the 1850s so yeah that kinda changes the argument by a lot . now i have to make it clear tho i don ' t think what the brits did was moral meerely that it may have had possitive consequences .

10. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

11. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

12. lmao seriously tho what did she think was gonna happen how could that possibly ever go good for her .
   (ID: 3e906e06d59fb5c2993270f0b4efed5b9ab122f7)

13. i was not . my parents were presbyterian on paper , and i think at least my mother did does ? believe . i was taught almost nothing of religion , and only have the vaguest of memories of ever going to church . i think we went a handful of times when i was very young . maybe that ' s what allowed me to gloss over the religious context when i read the books as a kid .
   (ID: 22a043d8284bd8c7c31748b5cc8c8b8efc757df6)

14. i think we ' re in agreement ? or by ' yep ' did you mean you would stop loving your mother for money reasons ?

15. well  known fact that devs pay attention to this sub  where did you learn that well known fact ? we get bugs posted here and fixed within hours when they weren ' t submitted to the official forums . also big hint valve employees commenting on reddit posts about the state of upcoming changes  bug fixes  explanations about seemingly random changes .  how would it be more convenient for the patch team to sift through endless shitposts to find bug reports instead of reading them in a dedicated forum . logic ? because they obviously don ' t " sift through " reddit posts looking for bugs . they check reddit , and if they see a bug post then they check it , or don ' t see a bug post then leave reddit . it is more convenient because reddit has a much higher userbase and so they get a higher sample of issues from looking at comments and can help figure out what causes the issue . all this took less than digit seconds for me to think of so . logic ?

16. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

17. i think you did , unless you gave me the wrong info haha
   (ID: 3cc393500aaac3a2ee1cd96955cee486bb062a46)

18. i think they did a reality show about that . a homeless man was given a lot of money . can ' t remember how much , but apparently he didn ' t really use it well . but we should try again and again .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

19. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

20. it may be a little unclear now that i think about it , but if you look at the timecodes , i also won the first lost run i did ever .
