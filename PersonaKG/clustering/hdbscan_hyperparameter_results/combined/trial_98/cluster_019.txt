1. nothing beats the taste of horse on cup day . my family has been eating horses on cup day for years now . i ' m glad you mentioned dogs  we should make a day when we can eat dogs as well . i don ' t think we should race cats though , unless we gave them lots of steroids so they got big enough that small children could ride them . do you think we could eat the cats ? i don ' t think they would taste too good when they ' re roided up though .

5. you need maxed temple but i think what you ' re doing wrong is that you got the other t5 super monkeys after you got the temple . i read somewhere that you need to get them before you get the temple .

8. actually , i think the answer may be no . think about this  the average muggle parent finds their kid with a letter about some crazy wizard school , delivered by an owl , and doesn ' t immediately go tell their friends , post pictures online , call local news ? of course , the kids themselves would likely do these things too . really , the manner in which these letters are delivered are a potential nightmare for the ministry of magic to clean up after , sending out memory  altering wizards constantly around when the letters are sent . why would the ministry allow this to continue ? there ' s got to be some magic going on behind the scenes we ' re unaware of . i can ' t see the letter forcing students to attend , as that would be tantamount to the imperius curse . but could be some other shenanigans going on . maybe the letters are charmed to only be readable by people inclined to accept , and keep the secret ? so if you receive and read a letter , ipso facto , you are a person who will go .

9. they locked you so youll add your phone number even if they dont need it but thats what i think i got locked yesterday on my main and twitter said the same thing and i needed to do the phone number stuff too but i dont have one

10. i have a friend who is a caregiver and the way he describes it it is the worst possible thing in could imagine doing for someone with bad social anxiety . he doesnt work with elderly but with disabled young adults and he says every little social interaction is so important . he says if the " clients " think they can get away with something they will . moment of weakness where they got their way ? you ' re basically their bitch and they will never listen to you again . look at them the wrong way ? literally get charged and assaulted . he has to take some of them and literally bathe them . how would any of that be ok for someone with anxiety ? constantly looking after someone is the worst possible thing in could think of . the point is to not deal with other people , not have someone dependent on you .

11. i got downvoted on similar posts showing the math too . i dont think people understand the levity of what etsy is going to change .
   (ID: 3dfcdf92c717ed4c117768210afcbbaf9a2ca8a9)

12. i also got a message from what i think is the same guy . the dude is probably on this sub , looking for people to harass . what a sad human being .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

13. have been depressed for god knows how long and never got any treatment . neither can i afford ot nor do i think that it will help because the treatments are shit aroud here .

14. okay , that sucks , but what about the thousands of items we do get undamaged ? i grouse about usps sometimes , but , overall , i think they  re amazing . if you got digit delicious meals for every bad one , would you call for the cook to be fired ?
   (ID: 7a74975099c43e606800d8a9205ec41703ec2a89)

15. i think i misunderstood the question . you meant born a male and now a female , i though you meant which female celebrity will now claim she wants to become a man . sinead ' s got a history of saying dumb shit . most recently she converted to islam and said she no longer wants to associate with white people " if that ' s what non  muslims are called . the last bit is especially funny as the hadith repeatedly describes the false prophet muhammad himself as being white . lmfao , owned . so yeah , maybe the trans thing is next . lol
