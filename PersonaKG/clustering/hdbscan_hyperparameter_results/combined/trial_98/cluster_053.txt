1. certainly not a bad idea to let at least someone know where you are especially when you  re a female . if you do go missing , someone can call the cops as soon as they notice you  re gone and it  s much more likely that you  ll be found .
   (ID: a815d9b5c98aef3203b8f4f74528072fb989f0b1)

2. its from mashiroiro symphony , i don ' t remember the exact quote , i don ' t care , but its something to the effect of  having pets is scary because you know they ' ll die before you , but when they do its important to remember the fun you had while they were alive not the pain of losing them .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

3. depends on how random the words are that i ' ll forget . if they ' re ones i can learn again , i ' ll take it . if they ' re names and identities of people i know , no . also i ' m cracking up thinking of a scenario where a person tries to use this in an interview to one up the interviewer .
   (ID: 8a0d7d262d95d9c10d914ff3b70f342e066aee23)

11. the bailout that has happened for all three of the " big digit ? what about it ? also jd power also gets their information from owners . now go look up what qualifies as a defect and you ' ll know why those reports are horse shit . you thinking a knob should be bigger or your ac should be colder is considered a defect . so anything , including properly functioning systems are therefore " defective .
