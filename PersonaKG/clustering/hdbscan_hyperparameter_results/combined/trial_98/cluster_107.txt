4. telemarketer . if they can sell well , it would be pretty simple to have a low level secretary scan the approved calls and type out the critical information . consulting , if they have extensive previous experience in a field , reviewing projects can be quite valuable . public speaking . people will hire him to talk about how he overcame is hardship even though he only overcame it because people are willing to pay to see him talk about overcoming it . kind of a self fulfilling prophecy all for the entertainment of others by capitalizing on his disability . basically a modern day freak show with better pay , to put it in less politically correct terms i am sure there are other jobs that can be handled depending on exactly his level of disability . does he have any slight motion in extremities ? has he learned any systems for people with his disability like eye tracking or other controls like head or breathing based or speech based computer controls ?
   (ID: b650c9c531ec58d468c7c1fc9b7083efc4cbca9c)

7. gastrointestinal virusnot sure i spelt it right . i went swimming in a lake for a school feild trip then later figured out there was e . coli in the lake . so i had e . coli and the virus at the same time . it felt like someone was hitting me with a hammer from the inside . i was super pale and curled up in a ball on the floor . i puked digit times in digit hours and couldn ' t eat or drink anything .
   (ID: 825a08e404a7e2db2fd9fc73052f89b0d2f148bb)

8. digit  is the maximum reliable charge . it ' s not a " you can ' t fit more than that in here " , it ' s more like " you can fit more than that , but we ' re not sure how much , for how long and how safely .
   (ID: 9a13b21f54717da1499379b5cb0e991e82d4c90f)

9. this is a very smart looking app . a few things that stood out to me as a software architect  i ' m not sure whether the iap unlocks this but it would be quite nice to be able to swipe back from full screen images like you swipe from everything else . it ' s especially a speed bump when using a phone with the right hand and not being able to reach the top left x one  handed . i ' m quite sure you have a bug in your comment folding . some comments fold gracefully but some fold the ops name too and then make it reappear below the fold which is a bit disorientating .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

   (ID: ad6e2a4253e2d855d34a09445a12e49327ba824e)

12. i ' m not sure about how much you ' d need every day but you can certainly become more tolerant of peppers until you can eat them like any other food . you essentially build up a resistance to the spice of it and become , as it were , immune to spicy foods if you do it enough .
   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

13. right , i can see why you would make that decision . i was thinking about the dark base too but i wasn ' t really sure about it . is it any good ? what can i expect from a case like that ?
   (ID: 2971f819c4d7400b9fa7806434e9037b6af4dfae)

14. yeast . i ' m pretty sure i could do up a solid diet of beer and bread  based foods like sandwiches ! ha !

   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

17. sounds like you wanna get back with him . why are you asking this question is the real question . pretty sure this violates several rules of this sub .
   (ID: 76442d997e7f64c10223aeac0f4ff8af70ff9dde)

18. food without a doubt . safety a close second . when i was in hong kong it was nothing bad at all . there were so many americans it felt like new york in a way . taiwan , food was so bad . no one really knew english and at some points it was a little scary at times but not too bad . china was dirt . food was terrible and the concern with my safety was through the roof . i ' m sure it was because i was in the manufacturing district in both countries .

19. it ' s a shame she hardly ever smiles . i ' m not sure why she poses like this in so many photos . she ' s beautiful either way .

20. thank you so much for sharing . honestly the fb groups made me wonder if i wasn  t worried enough about keratoconus . it made me question if i wasnt taking keratoconus serious . post referring to  how much do you miss your life before keratoconus  were really there to bring people down no lift them up thankfully with comments like yours il realize like im not the only who see keratoconus as something that sucks but i also making sure it doesn  t control my everyday life .
