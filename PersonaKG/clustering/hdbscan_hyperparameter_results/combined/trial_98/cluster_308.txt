12. i see what you mean . the first time i read the following sentence in the article  " such young men are the people most likely to be regular voters at the movie information site , and it  s only the opinions of imdb regulars that shape the top digit . casual users of the site don  t have a say in the matter " i didn ' t interpret it as the casual users ' votes not being counted but rather that they were so outnumbered by " bro " votes that they were insignificant . if the former is the case , then i agree that it is rigged by being even more strongly biased

13. most people aren ' t . easiest thing next time , is accuse her of the same thing she thinks you are doing and take your phone to say you are calling the cops . i doubt she ' d stick around

16. you train yourself to bite your lip and ask yourself , do i need to say something here ? and evaluate whether you do . it takes a lot of practice .
   (ID: 3de4b885645ecd39fdcb6a1daf410341eb118d2c)

17. it is not the same because as white people we have not been the victim of systematic oppression and fetishism and our worldview does not allow us to understand the experiences of people of colour because we are in a privileged position where we have not dealt with the obstacles faced by poc , so who are we to invalidate what this girl has to say ?
