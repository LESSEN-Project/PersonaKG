2. this is hilarious . the difference is " so huge " you had to film it in slow motion and put it side by side for anyone to notice ? i ' ve said it before and i ' ll say it again  outside of the people determined to applaud or canvass every single fucking change apple makes to every device they release , 60hz is not choppy , 120hz much less 100hz still ghosts , and the difference is god damn negligible .

11. karl  heinz rummenigge , the ceo of bayern munich , has criticised the wages being paid by clubs in europe ' s top leagues . pointing to laliga santander , the premier league and serie a , as well as referring to the specific example of antoine griezmann , the club chief expressed concern . " i ' m not only worried about the transfer fees , as digit or digit million euros is now nothing spectacular , " he said in an interview with bild . " i ' m much more worried about the salaries being paid , especially in spain , england and italy . " the trend is going towards paying net salaries . " we need to be careful not to destabilise out salary structure . " they ' re huge . " look , for example , at griezmann and his salary worth millions per year and paid net . " all of these salaries have to be multiplied by two because the clubs are paying the taxes . " bayern munich won ' t participate in such craziness . " rummenigge went on to explain that filling the squad up with youth players is one potential solution . " we need to keep doing what we ' ve always done at bayern , " he said . " in the future , the 17th , 18th , 19th and 20th positions in our squad should be filled by young players who don ' t cost as much and who earn a normal salary . " we ' ll need to be able to bring through one or two of these four players each year and have them in the first team consistently . " i ' ll be an interesting challenge . "
