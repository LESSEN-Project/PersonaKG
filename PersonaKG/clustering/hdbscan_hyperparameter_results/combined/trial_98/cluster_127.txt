1. i ' m confused what you ' re upset about . a gunslinger who understands how to use his class to its full effectiveness ? much like a titan putting a bubbleshield directly over a control point and sitting there with a shotgun , or titansmashing everyone at a control point ? haha , as a fellow hunter , i have to say , i ' ve tripped my own tripmine grenade and killed myself more times than i ' d like to admit golden gun gives hunters zero shields , nor does bladedancer . all they had to do was go in one of the two other entrances , double team him and he would have been gone . instead , they filed in the same door over , and over , and over again . edit  just watched the second video . derp . yeah . this is why i always roll my eyes when titans complain that hunters are op .

3. so , everyone and everything on earth would be some sort of a tool  obstacle that could help you discover what life really should be ? i apologize for this , but i can ' t keep up with this right now . i ' m a bit tired and unfocused . i ' d like to keep talking with you about this , but just later on if you ' re ok with that . before i go , i ' d like to show you something musical that i ' ve found to be very interesting . these are many different genres of music . the top layers represent the most conventional and standard types that everyone enjoys . the lower genres are . strange , before anything else . this is completely off topic , but i kinda wanted to leave you off with something i personally , could never make any sense of . maybe you can ?

   (ID: be9f60605270d73ac3a4e5b587575b1f65df15f5)

6. i ' ve developed the habit of just not openening my mouth as wide when i yawn . it ' s almost like muscle memory now although occasionally a wide one happens and it ' s mildly unsettling . lol . i recently had someone tell me to look down when yawning as you physically can ' t open your mouth as wide . good technique if you can remember it .

10. i ' ve beaten most jokers i fight but it feels like they just run and spam the fire move until they can transform and then try and fight aggressively .
   (ID: 3b13182e9a13b392bb9f89990f71d9043459e21f)

11. wanted to ask this to my best friend ' s girlfriend who is also my best friend what she likes and doesn ' t like about me . i have trouble talking with her anyway because i ' m an awkward person . i ' ve tried to gain confidence , but it just never works out
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

12. i just try to play how i  ve been playing the whole game , i usually rush and play aggressive so thats how i try to play in the end , changing up your play style to camp towards the end allows for you to get nervous and lose your touch . playing aggressive lets skill decide the winner not luck like camping

13. i ' ve heard about this kind of thing , it ' s so strange to me . it ' s the most unhealthy expectation , not just physical but mental too , and it even affects personal  family life . like , wtf !

14. from what i  ve heard , they  re still exercising at least once a month which is the same as before . they were all pretty excited when the  no more war games  thing was announced , but we don  t call any of our exercises  war games  so we just assumed it was a way to seem like we were giving up something without ever doing so . if anyone was to bring up the fact that we haven  t stopped exercising we could be like  we gave up the war games , but we didn  t stop our training exercises  . hell , i  m in japan and even we were hoping that maybe we  d luck out and they  d let us quit exercising as well . no such luck .
