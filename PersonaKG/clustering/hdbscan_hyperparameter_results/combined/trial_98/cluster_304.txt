9. you ' re pretty self  congratulatory about your relationship , but the examples you give further down are far different than the struggles some people have in their relationships . failed exam ? not getting promoted ? that ' s life . if you have to pat yourself on the back for staying with someone through that then perhaps you have a different and privileged lens . my read on this thread is that their partner has persistent deep rooted issues that aren ' t improving despite ops best efforts and support . it can take the relationship beyond saving , and it ' s important to recognize that and take care of yourself   if all other options have failed . so revolution outcast ,  digit for the advice from half  elfbard .
