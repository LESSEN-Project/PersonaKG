1. you seem to have normalized his shitty behavior at this point . there is no reason why you should be working full time  still taking on the domestic role . if you weren ' t working , sure . but that ' s just so fucking ridiculous and selfish , " tradition " be damned . it sucks you have kids with this guy imo . i think you should leave him .

2. it ' s clear that azan is her priority . i don ' t think you ' re too uptight . nickle is a horrible excuse for a mother . i mean she has her daughter calling azan " daddy " , and that ' s just the start of all her issues . i ' m sure nickle loves may , but she neglects her and uses her as a bargaining chip , and i won ' t even start with the " daddy " thing . smh .

4. not sure if you ' re being sarcastic or not , but it was just a question . i searched around and couldn ' t find much except what has already been mentioned . i figured i would ask the reddit community for their input . also i play on console , i don ' t think there are too many hacks out there to increase my magicka , but thank you for your suggestion .

5. i ' m sure this is true , even though i think a lot . my gf will sometimes ask what i ' m thinking about and i honestly say " nothing " or " just abstract shit without any meaning " but she always has words to describe her thoughts .

6. sure it would be creepy if the guys were random strangers . but op hasn ' t specified that . it could just be people she knows . in view that , i think it ' s alright . quick to jump to conclusions aren ' t we !

7. i understand . i  m just not much of a lebron fan , so it  s hard for me . also don  t think he  s even close to the goat . best of this era ? sure .

8. i didn  t find relief with omep  i didn  t find relief for the occasional heartburn but have the shortness of breath under control with zyrtec and singulair . which would make you think its just allergies . but i have every other symptom of lpr , and if i don  t watch what i eat the shortness of breath comes back . so it  s been a combo of avoiding my personal triggers and these meds are helping for sure

9. the question was " what is the first thing you think of " . i didn ' t say that i was stating facts , it is just the first thing that comes to mind . i have never actually been there so i can ' t say anything for sure . that is just what i think of .
