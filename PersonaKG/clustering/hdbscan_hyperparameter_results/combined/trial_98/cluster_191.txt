1. it ' s a huge sore spot because people like you are exactly why so many abusive mothers are able to get by without any repercussions . yeah , seems more to me like you ' re one of those guys eager to put the blame on women for everything to prove they can do bad things too . i never gave a pussy pass to abusive mothers anywhere in my posts , so cut that victim bullshit right there . you sound like one of these sjws , " stop appropriating father ' s day "
   (ID: a80b8bc356414690d849369456d68876c95d5518)

2. we as humans like to apply black and white labels to everything . there is nothing wrong with emotions . there are things wrong with what people do with them or how we feed them
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

3. duuude ! what ' s wrong with you ? stop posting things like that .
   (ID: 1cedb012c7702cdd6cf28839fd31ce2bb1eea04c)

4. it takes me a few minutes to really focus on my text book , so it helps when i ' m in a quiet place , maybe with a candle or something that calms me down . for some reason studying scares me  like i won ' t be able to comprehend the material , or i ' m reading the wrong things , so anything that helps me relax i try . for that reason i don ' t like studying in a public place . music helps too but sometimes i get distracted by the words .
   (ID: a3811395c0f6d89e991295b692a54743e657581e)

5. that sounds like me , i have the will to do things but not enough charisma to pull it off .
   (ID: 0163212450bac6366408ac8e1e025d32048839ec)

6. you look like steve from stranger things
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

7. that ' s something that people often turn to , like " people will be out of jobs " but there ' s still things that need to be done within a universal healthcare system . there are still plenty of jobs that people can do .
   (ID: fbed02b3d7caf00e8d1533f452f8951cf390df73)

8. the opposite for humorous effect .  that  s the  now is there anything else i can do to piss you off today ?  that  s almost like when people say  anything else , your highness ?  when told a long list of things they need to do . same principle . it  s sarcasm . no , of fucking course they  re not the fucking queen . but they make it out like they are . that  s the irony .
   (ID: 903829fb4aefc18f9ba3e0dc7d2f3267adf2bcc8)

9. so you also like watching woman step on things ?
   (ID: e871625874733300de2a83384cee8c72546d3ec6)

   (ID: 5b59b30ecdf3a93e4634d1600b3020fd8e9dc7e2)

11. this left a big smile on my face . we need to see more wholesome things like this . he was so existed to see santa
   (ID: 36314aee005a03517f2446ec0da2834fe0f712d6)

12. seems like a wholesome , genuine bio and its good ! to maybe spur more interest , i would add what your favorite burger spot is as well as where you enjoy getting pizza from . someone may relate or have that in common with you and will give you a reason to ask her on a date , like if she enjoys , " digit guys " then maybe you could both grab a bite over some convo !
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

13. it ' d explain a lot of things . like the reason i only have one eye .
   (ID: 4167b7bc7d40ac86ca6b492ac0bbaefa992711f6)

14. whatever we end up making , i demand we include a user manual so people won ' t have to spend thousands of years trying to figure it out and still not understand things like why we get tired .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

15. dude there ' s so many . being out late , not being at certain places after a certain time , what to wear , etc . its not about treating them differently . its about treating both equally . my parents will never be concerned about these little things when it comes to my brother . not saying that it ' s bad that they ' re concerned but the question is whether i like it which i certainly don ' t .
   (ID: db2795e3479f3abf3fd16c22a2bea9450ad82357)

16. so i asked him something similar he said that basically because most people disassociate themselves from the rest of the universe universe in it ' s common usage it ' s not a effective way of explaining it . he continued that in order for something to be all knowing and powerful like he asserts god is it would have to be all things . i personally am digit  with you on this but as i said guy had some odd perspectives .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

17. hardly . i ' m simply pointing out that to dis  believe one improbable thing while believing the rest of the improbable things is , well , hard to fathom to people like myself . edit  removed a redundant " that "
   (ID: 0f3da013abe745c83b2d4eb042abb7fd28f5e872)

18. a this is up for speculation . some people believe it was a production error , but others believe it was intentional to give the idea that if these things happened in the future , then there ' s still time to make a difference in the lives of people like hannah . is not a definitive answer . it leave is open to discussion . isn ' t the point of this subreddit to discussion topics like this ?
   (ID: 737313878d4c0ea930e14b4d6569b91c8028c768)

19. one of these things are not like the others .
   (ID: 5a485308ca6e36eb17d7b0fc321fcf7695f3af53)

20. digit things . while this is a good written theory , i see digit flaws . if in the game ' s 2nd act , you go down natsuki ' s path , her manga is brought up , in black text spoopy text she states " my dad would beat the sh  t out of me if he found out " saying she had some prior experiance with his ' abusive ' nature . next is the hidden random poem called ' things i like about papa ' in the end it states " i like it when papa is too tired to do anything " stating he is not a good father , making her happy when he wont do anything . it also says stuff like " i like when papa doesn ' t comment on my friends " and other things . maybe she ' s a good cook because her dad doesn ' t make food as quoted in the poem " i like when papa cooks for me " saying she likes when he cooks and she doesn ' t have to . can i also add that it states " for me " making it very possible that she has to cook for him .
