1. i know that sucks now but just imagine when you do accomplish your goals ! those same people are going to beg you to let them be by your side . they ' re gonna brag about you and tell everyone that they know you . please don ' t let them win . make them regret ever doubting you !
   (ID: 4e289af5e18133c4578deba659b7e1d2784a925d)

2. well you can see if you items are still in your stash . you can add another option so it works that way . but you can also do it manually just gab you items and then " rightclick the courier icon to send it back to the first person " many people don ' t know you can do that dx
   (ID: 417f107ec53971c82b0d9bb8ee79067ec512bdbb)

   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

4. well . when u leave the world kinda pauses . u see when u come back that the time of the day  night is the same , and every mob is in the same place . so they ' re just frozen in time . may not even know that we ever left once we get back on . this is probably a joke so yeah woooosh lmaoooooooooo but rule digit says no jokes or puns so this is hopefully not a joke
   (ID: db49a30ced23a0e386b799d5f970489f11a53f7a)

5. you obviously don  t know how to read , or choose to misinterpret . you said there were a bunch of people saying  oh no , the game is dying  . i said ,  i wonder  because it was something i was wondering about . it is patently ridiculous to take someone  s wonder as the same thing . also , i didn  t refuse to take anything anyone said . i simply pointed out that i was just wondering about the future . i didn  t say anyone was wrong about why those areas weren  t as populated . again , you choose to misinterpret . have a great night .

6. stephen miller . i just know he ' s plotting the downfall of the world , which is pretty drastic if i do say so my self .
   (ID: e3aadeaf18df437e62f5c1614d251bf343fd2de2)

8. the rest of the post is sweet , just one question . wasnt it the parshmen who willfully gave up their spren to avoid extermination ? i know radiants  humans figured out how to capture them , but i don ' t recall them extracting spren from the parshmen .

9. yo dude , you need to talk to that manager and just say exactly this . since the position was open directly for you , they know that you are a good worker or else it wouldn ' t have been worth their time .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

10. i know that . i was just saying that for an eli5  level explanation , x  x " equals " digit at digit . meaning that the limit of the function exists . of course , as others have pointed out , you can define other limits that are still indeterminate that come out to other values . or no values at all . at x  digit , ln1  x  sinx  digit  cos  digit x evaluates to digit  digit . but , as any mean girls fan knows , the limit does not exist ! but the limit of literally taking x  x to digit does , in fact , equal digit .

11. that is entirely possible . yet , i am simply suggesting that i will hit my own personal panic button in the next few days as it usually takes digit  digit days for me to get my jcrew items once i receive confirmation of shipping . that ' s just my personal experience . i know it varies for many , as it heavily depends on location and accessibility .

15. if you know anything about ceo ' s we have plenty of time to kill and this is more fun than playing golf . i don ' t care about helping your numbers . any complaints you get are your fault for hiding the merchandise while it devalues so you can buy it below cost and resell it on ebay . you are the reseller . i am just the advisor .

17. nah , i was venting , it was my first bike i laid down more than  digit on , i had just made the first payment and he backs into it , if you ask anyone else i know they ' re really bad roommates , but my heart of gold is kinda home now .
   (ID: aaaecf7e1ff261f2a41ad2f7d0229a3f043cb546)

18. yeah , he might know about it , but if you just blow the entire side of the cave to smithereens and are in and out in an eyeblink , wtf is he gonna do about it ?
   (ID: c673eb9fda8629b3a86935092a2668010b581ab1)

19. i ' d bet many wouldn ' t care about the meaning . even as a tattoo enthusiast , i tend to roll my eyes a bit when people brag about how meaningful their tattoos are . it ' s cool if it ' s meaningful to you , but explaining the meaning kinda comes across pompous . if people ask , then absolutely you can tell them , but to go in with the idea of having them read the book and understand the meaning just sounds super odd . tattoos are art , that ' s it , they don ' t have to have a deep personal connection to anything , and tattoo artists probably dislike people who insist that tattoos should have meaning because that ' s and costs the biggest reason people don ' t get tattoos , because they ' re told by everyone they know that tattoos need to have meaning . they don ' t . and tattoo artists would have a lot more clients if people stopped believing that

20. i cant access my xbox rn and i didn ' t see it on the site , but just look at the lists of games i know a lot are multiplayer . i have it right now and i downloaded a few games and they were all multiplayer
