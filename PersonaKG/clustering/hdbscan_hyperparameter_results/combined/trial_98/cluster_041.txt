10. people lying to you about how great they are and how deep and full of significance and meaning their life is . nobody cares about how your grandmother grew tomatoes instilling your love of fresh produce , or how your mother ' s use of seasonings opened up your senses , or your soccer coach touching you filled you with a love of sausage . i just could not remember if i needed digit tbs or digit of flower for a basic roux . please put the recipe at the top and your poorly written life story at the bottom so i can choose to not read with out being annoyed by having to scroll through it .

16. yep . it happens . i noticed that i developed a crush on someone else . nothing wrong with so , and i still care for them just no longer in love with them . it ' s heartbreaking to realize especially when there is no right thing to do that makes everyone happy .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

17. opinions may change on this , but working from home . a friend told me how lucky i am to have an extremely high paying job where i just sit behind a laptop , scrolling through reddit digit  of the time . that means i can work from anywhere . from home , on the train , on holiday , anywhere . i imagine other people would love it . i never tell my friend this , but it ' s awful . the money is great , i love that part  but i cant enjoy it . at any given time , digit  digit , i get a message and i have to get behind a laptop to work immediately for about digit minutes . sometimes it ' s in the night and it ' s so stressful . the worst part is the social aspect of it . i ' d much rather be out an enjoying with friends , but my work doesn ' t allow it unless i bring my laptop out with me on a night out . no chance . this means that although i can chill at home and earn a disgustingly high amount of money doing so , that ' s all my life is . sitting behind a computer using social media while occasionally working . if it wasn ' t for my deathly anxiety , i ' d be much happier with a job at walmart .
