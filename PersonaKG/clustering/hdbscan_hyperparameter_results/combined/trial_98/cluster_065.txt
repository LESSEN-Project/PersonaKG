6. delete the number , or block the number . make it extremely difficult to get in contact with him in anyway . know what he did to you and know how you felt when you found out . do you really wanna feel that way again ? you deserve to be happy and putting yourself in that situation is going to dig yourself into a deep hole . dont give him the satisfaction of cheating on a girl and then having her run back to him . it will make him a worse person and it will only hurt you in the end .

8. it ' s not a salty tyler fan . it ' s about the fact that we have all been watching , so we know exactly what he did and why he actually deserved to win . meanwhile the jury is blind because they haven ' t seen anything , and only get to vote off of what they hear in a digit minute speech .

15. two or three times a month i dream about very dirty public restrooms , or stalls with no doors , or toilets up on pedestals . these are extremely vivid and realistic dreams and i remember several details about most of them . i didn  t know how common it was until my dad said he had the same dream , so i did a google search and it turns out it  s fairly common . something about being insecure and vulnerable .

18. we did acid with two other people , one of them had a fucked up bad trip and was eventually going to hurt himself or us he already tried to shoot us with a gun he hallucinated . before i called digit , the two other people including my former bff left . the other guy could have killed me and no one would know . it was then i realized that he didn ' t actually care about me and was toxic .
   (ID: e7d4349520d7fd2b6b8d8e41558874e7ce55f7c3)
