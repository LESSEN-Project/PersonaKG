2. when people tell me not to worry about my flatulence problem . it ' s like they honestly don ' t realise that it ' s not actually a problem , i ' m deliberately doing them so that if i manage to shit myself i can just got home from work and take a few days off for emotional reasons .

3. fuck sakes of course i ' m generalizing . if the shoe fits , wear it . if it doesn ' t then move along , it doesn ' t apply to you . jesus christ , you can ' t say i ' m wrong . you just don ' t like the tone i used . this sub got an inflow of tone police lately . sorry my vocabulary isn ' t up to your standards but don ' t take it personally . i ' m not some women hater , i made a joke to the wrong audience apparently . take it easy .

4. i had been at my job only a few weeks . the guy i worked closest with was a real jerk . he gave me one hershey kiss . just to act like i wasn  t embarrassed i said thanks and immediately ate it . everyone else in the office told him that was a dick move . he said ,  just kidding  and gave me the case of beer he carried around in the trunk of his car . he later got fired for being a total slacker and i got his job .

5. i have been in a similar situation . you just got paroled my friend . look at it this way . you can be happy now . that relationship ? that was never going to happen and your attachment was just going to make you more miserable as time went on . now you finally have the opportunity to find someone who will make you happy . you  re like truman burbank stepping out of the studio and into the real world .

7. i havent experienced this myself purely , but i got lectured by my mom ' s colleague about it . apparently robbers just hand a sticky note to the bank teller sayain , " i have a gun . give me money " and if the teller tries to resist , they will be fired because if they get hurt , that hurts the bank ' s image . usually , the teller would just give the robber  digit or so and the police would find the criminal later . so no . it is absolutely nothing like how the media portrays it .

8. these jokes are getting out of hand just like my father when he got out of our house not coming back

9. yeah like op said there are two other people here possibly one who are shadow banned so check that out . anyway i ordered some 350s off ali about a week ago and the tracking number begins with ls . they just got processed through the sorting facility , and they haven ' t done anything else . it just takes a really long time for it to get out of the country . give it some time .

10. i was working a food line by myself , and we got a rush of like 9ish small groups , and in the middle of me running around trying to make everything , a woman came up to the counter complaining that i didn ' t cut the crusts off of her son ' s sandwich . if that had been instructed , i would have done so , but i wasn ' t informed that she wanted that , and i was busy as all hell . the dark part of me wanted to hurl a knife at her and yell " do it yourself bitch " but i just asked to wait a few minutes , and i would give her a free sandwich , without the crusts . thankfully she shut up after that , but fuck , i wanted to yell at her .

11. hybrdfast . ca , i literally just got my first order .  digit ounces that are decent but it looks like the strains change week to week so if you ' re look for consistency maybe not for you .

12. at a dinner party , i asked a couple good friends how they met . one of them dumped the other to date my so for a year and then they got back together . everyone in the damn room apparently knew because they all just stared at me like i was crazy . my so never told me this shit .

13. actually i just got more confident and outgoing . you can ' t expect to meet someone sitting in your house . also i was already attractive to a lot of girls , i just never noticed . it also helped that i have a good job and very responsible . side note  women need to be more open with their feelings with the stupid hints . i ' m sick of having to guess what you ' re thinking , then you get mad when i guess wrong . if you like someone then actually show it . a lot of us guys are clueless as fuck .

14. people " bitch " about it because of situations like in this clip . that guy was in a charge for less than a half  second , was sprinting a different direction than the one he was charging , and still got the instant kill . fundamentally , he should be doing no more damage than shanking a guy with a knife under these circumstances  his bayonet charge is missing the " charge " portion . the main balancing mechanic behind the charge is the windup time and the sound of someone charging , but both of those are obsolete in a situation where you can just enter the charge state at the last possible moment and instantly kill someone .

15. just one point of advice . i don ' t care if you take it or leave it . when you disagree with someone , keep the argument on  topic . if you are talking about latin american revolutions , just talk about that . resist the temptation to bring in things like mao , etc . you might feel justified , but it ' s not a productive way to interact , because  a the topic of latin american revolutions is complicated enough on its own , without bringing in the chinese . you ' re just opening a new can of worms , trust me . b the other person will take it as a personal attack , even if it wasn ' t . c it feels to the other person , anyway like you are deflecting . that is , it feels like you are trying to change the subject , and refocus the conversation on her shortcomings , rather than dealing with the topic at hand . she will see you as immature , like a school boy who gets caught cheating , and then screams , " but jimmy cheated last week , and got away with it ! " it does not matter if jimmy got away with it . we are talking about you cheating right now , and talking about jimmy is off  topic . again , this will only make you seem immature .
