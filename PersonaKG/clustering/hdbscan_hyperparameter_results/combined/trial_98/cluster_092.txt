Total from this dataset: 10

1. the staring . of all the things i found difficult over there , staring was one of the worst . you might think that being taught not to stare at funny  looking people is common for children around the world . nope . and what do you do when it ' s a parent and their child , staring and pointing together , like they ' re watching an orangutan at a zoo ?

2. do things you like and try not to think about it too much .

3. best value for the money for a novice is the players pure x cue . seyberts they will prolly run you 180ish with digit . 75mm i believe ldc shaft with a kamui soft tip on them . i have been using mine for digit months and i have nothing but good things to say . you can also buy the shaft separately or any other shaft which i think is a good option as well for you if you really like your butt . me personally i like to look at and touch all different butts

4. people can see mine . the reactions are usually something like wtf , how and why ? i think we have different things .

5. no . okay , think about it like this  people are made up of atoms , and when you die your atoms go off and become other things . this means that every girl would most likely be made up of atoms that were once in a dude , so if you bang her you are technically banging a dude , and that ' s fucking gay .

7. it depends . i like my family and my body . if i were to go through another life with those things different i don  t think i would . if they were the same hell yes . i reckon i  d be a lot happier and take actual steps towards something instead of fucking around until i have to make a decision and then make it not knowing what the next decision might be effectively screwing me over .

8. you ' re getting way too focused on weird combo ' s here , kt would be a very weird card to run in this class since it ' s focused on keeping minions alive not sacrificing them , and even if it could have some great combos i don ' t think it ' s worth running a card like kt for that doesn ' t work with the deck . this is one of the things that needs some playtesting to see how good it will be , you can ' t expect me to make a card that everyone can agree on is balanced .

9. most if not all guys , do things for women . i don ' t think it ' s a bad question to ask at all because if i buy something that is terrible , no woman would ever straight up tell me . so i wanted a list of great fragrances to try out that i might actually like myself on top of knowing it ' s a safe fragrance around women since they have a sharper sense of smell as well genetically compared to men . men are less sensitive to that stuff so their opinion to me is way more vital .

10. i don ' t see why people think the subject of abortion is funny . it ' s like saying sids or miscarriage is funny . none of those things are .
