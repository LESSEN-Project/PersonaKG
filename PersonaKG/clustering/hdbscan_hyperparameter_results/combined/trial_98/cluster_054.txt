   (ID: 87dcb06b0e31b35730fe93ce7dcbef85e6078b40)

6. people tend to confuse tilt  shift effect with miniature effect . we ' re talking the latter here . i ' ll try to explain it shortly  when you are photographing a large  scale landscape see the unmodified picture in the reply to the first post , everything tends to be in focus you have large , often infinite depth of field . as you get closer and your subjects  smaller , depth of field becomes smaller i . e . less of the scene is in focus . if the same scene is composed with toys , i . e . if the balloons were , say , coin  sized , the photo would look like the processed one , but for optical reasons . if you were to achieve the same thing , but in an optical way , you would need a very , very large camera sensor comparable in size to the balloon and a very , very long in focal length lens which would be proportional to you shooting the scene with the toys . in  camera software or the one that ' s used on a computer can somewhat succesfuly fake this effect , which is often the case .

7. you should tell them that you like it . they  ll be proud of you .
   (ID: f031a6829326f9097d63f90ad77c7cac6d8319bb)

8. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

9. i feel like this will be the only kind of comment we ' ll be able to leave after reddit ' s new policies kick in .  s taf   knows what ' s up
   (ID: 1f3e82e13d88ba22fce8ba80102ccc24b3880ae9)

   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

11. my jnmil ' s sister who is a way bad jnmil , once talked to me for an hour the night before my wedding about eating special k only until i started to see the " worms come out " , so like a special k cleanse . because it starves the worms . worms need meat !   . i will add this to my arsenal because god knows i ' ll have to use it .
   (ID: c28c39847d1ec88851aadf063f6e8baf4594b35c)

12. you  re right . if you look at what i said you  ll see i was trying to explain that chickens produce and expel eggs like humans , not that they were the same . obviously i didn  t do a very good job !
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

13. see it ' s hard to describe , but he ' s not one who likes to get embarrassed because he gets super upset and angry . he totally lashes out , so i figured with an instance such as this , maybe wait for him to come to me ? or is that the same as like we ' ll basically never talk about it ?
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

14. anywhere . i don  t like being touched at all . i  ll do a hug if i  m close enough with you but unless you are dating me , do not touch me
   (ID: 4e784da799782c45d8883de53e87a533129a3b8e)

15. thank you so much for answering my questions ! i have some follow up questions . regarding the shower situation , in the navy , are you allowed to wake up earlier than your peers to shower or does everyone have to shower at the same time ? like , can you wake up earlier , quickly shower and get dressed ? so while most are asleep , i ' ll avoid having many people surrounding me ? open showers aside in boot camp , will i go through any other situations where i ' d be openly nude among my peers ? or is everything regarding medical  etc . you will have privacy ? i don ' t mind being " known " if it ' s one or two other professional doctors  etc . but i ' m worried about that when it comes to other cadets .   x200b  when you say steady supply of t , do you mean at home or physically with me ? thank you again ! i truly appreciate it !

16. jdoe74 has a point honestly . if you like doing what you do cut the middleman and slightly undercut the business you currently work for and you ' ll definitely make more than they are paying you .
   (ID: 4d1c53b18fd4290c31e857fc9f9572542fef4fd5)

17. as a child , i suffered a lot from ear infections and as a result i had these drainage tubes which meant that water at the time was a big no . even though that ' s a thing of the past now , my ears are still quite sensitive when it comes to pressure and i would very much like to avoid experiencing what the girl from your scuba class had to go through . i guess i ' ll have to stick to snorkeling .
   (ID: 5fe12b36dc6d3370836c6683997c005efb656c99)

18. sometimes you have to take care of number one , regardless of how others might feel . it  ll be a different story if he was actually trying to get help , you have no reason to feel like the bad guy .
   (ID: b5cc14fd703a97548093b4e06f7e3e92575b80b9)

19. because as like everything else we don  t believe in hear say bullshit . if we believed every bullshit story someone from the past wrote down we would still be worshiping cats and cutting off virgins clits . so from all of us to your god i say this  all it takes is a two minute appearance and boom , we  ll all believe  .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

20. i  m loving it but it  s not for everyone . d2 is really a game that you have to realize that if you get hooked you  ll be playing it until it either dies or d3 comes out . i  m having crazy amounts of fun on pc . my friends and i have created a clan and been running strikes and stuff like that . the entertainment is subjective but it  s much more fun with friends .
