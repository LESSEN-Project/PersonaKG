1. yep . i could see spidey getting in over his head with kingpin fuckery and dd comes in as the expert of all things fisk and helps him out . the two have a lot in common in that their secret identities are very important to protect those they love , and that they are very neighbourhood based . in essence they ' re serving very much the same role .

   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

11. true happiness is eternal reunion with god . it is what we seek that will complete us . desire for power , wealth , possessions or other worldly things above the desire for god is the nature of sin . when we choose these things , we are misdirecting our love for god . in the afterlife , god respects our choices and the afterlife is the perfection of them . the true punishment of hell is the absence of god , the only thing that would truly make us happy . all the other earthly distractions that we choose in life are meaningless there .
