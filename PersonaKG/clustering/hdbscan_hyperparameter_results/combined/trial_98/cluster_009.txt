10. yeah , we got a ton here in seattle , and they ' re almost all great . one of the best ways to keep shops like that open , in my opinion . if you don ' t want to do a lot of food you can always do a coffee shop and allow outside food with a small cover i ' ve seen  digit or partner with a nearby shop to allow their food exclusively in return for a discount for your employees .

11. i ' m certain this isn ' t a misunderstanding . we ' ve offered to do this and they don ' t want a translated copy , they want the german marriage certificate . i ' ve even got emails of me asking the consulate about this when i applied , and they said that it wasn ' t required .
