3. i don ' t have experience with cheating parents or spouses , at least not that i ' m aware . i do agree with you that is wrong and harmful to both women . however , if i were in your shoes , i would have to ask myself some questions . first , what do you want to accomplish by speaking with your mom ? you clearly cannot change her behavior by talking to her about it , as you have tried that . secondly , what kind , if any , relationship do you want with her ? if you intervene in some way call the wife , confront the man , etc , you will be further alienating your mom . and lastly , can you live with this knowledge and not intervene if that is the only way to save your relationship with your mother ? if you answer these questions honestly and with great contemplation or not rashly , i believe you will know what course you should take . good luck !

4. no . i wouldn  t fire them . because i don  t want to get fired lol i don  t know what the law is where you live  but that  s highly illegal . even in countries or american states where they say you can fire someone at any time , it still has to be within the law . firing someone because they are taking interviews elsewhere is not a reason .

5. only people who live here know that . tell anyone else on the planet you ' re from utah  salt lake city , and the next question is almost always " are you a mormon " and no , i am not .

6. you know that has no chance of ever happening ever and for the people that live in the real world abortion needs to always be an option .

7. you might notice that regardless of income it has done nothing but gone down for the past digit years , so don ' t really know what you ' re talking about . as for that ramble you gave , what the fuck is wrong with you ? why would you not want the place you live to be nice ?

8. beyond my pay grade , but i guess the universe has the physical laws needed to keep it from collapsing back into whatever preceded the big bang . who knows how many universes were created in big bangs that didn ' t produce systems that lasted ? pure speculation , but how does introducing a god who doesn ' t want jews to eat pork help solve this great mystery ? nothing . your consciousness ends . there is no " you " any longer . how can someone fake a belief in god ? are gods that stupid , or venal ? same thing you would do if the buddhist bodhisattva avalokiteshvara appeared to everyone in the world . people who live their lives believing stuff i know to be patently false make me nervous . they embody a dark world view that in different manifestations continues to thwart the progress of mankind .

9. i  m talking about in a survival situation dumbass , also , do you not know that most of the police officers , firefighters , military personnel , construction workers , are men . the people that keep our countries safe from other countries are mostly men , they risk their lives so that we could live in a good , relatively safe country , first worlders have the privilege to live safely , a lot of us don  t even know what danger really is . do you want to live in constant fear in a war zone ? no . no one does , but that  s the life that people unfortunately live . no matter what anyone does , there will still be crime , there will still be bad people , and there will still be poverty .

10. this stuff make me afraid that someone is going to take it to far , and someone will die . i  m all for airing grievances but this  we know where you live  stuff is dangerous .

11. you know , we non  americans give you guys in the us a lot of shit , sometimes rightfully so but really , that first amendment of yours is fucken poetry . is it idealistic ? hell yeah . do i want all of humanity to live under governments that take it ' s ideals as the norm ? hella yeah . for all the shitty stuff that shitty people do around the world , that is one piece of writing that really says something .
