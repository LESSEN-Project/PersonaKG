1. a stock market crash did happen , but he lost digit  of the money , and it should have regained it ' s value and a lot more in the previous digit years . what does she think your odds of winning are ? 10k sounds like a small risk if you have a good chance of winning hundreds of thousands .

6. think back to something you did or something that happened and figure out why it was done or why you acted like that . how it effected you or others . that reflection best way i can describe it .

7. first off you sould like the kind of person to think count dankula was a nazi . this post is making fun of how the nazis belived in the aryan masterace and that they belived they were unbeatable . oh and lastly . this is historymemes and not history so now please screw off like mao did in his long march back to the little shithole home he had .

8. that ' s a good theory , but i wouldn ' t discount him overpowering her so easily . i ' m not a small girl , but when i was sexually assaulted by a drunk man who was over digit years old and smaller than me i was barely able to fight him off . if i ' d been as drunk as kristin smart apparently was that night , i have no doubt that it would have been a rape i experienced rather than an attempted rape . it happened in the middle of a sunday afternoon , in a residential area and no one heard a thing , or if they did they didn ' t do anything about it . it ' s a hell of a lot easier to overpower a woman than we ' d like to think .
