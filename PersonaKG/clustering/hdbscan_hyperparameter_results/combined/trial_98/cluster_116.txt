1. you can fake study , just put you book in front of you and put your phone in there or whatever . then you say that you already studied and you can do whatever you want
   (ID: f491028c794855d1611365b07d4525f7b98173ae)

2. maybe ? i mean most of say you want to feel loved , you want a relationship that includes sex , this would just make it meaningless .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

3. i mean , yeah if you want abs this will do it . just remember to progress on each exercise as necessary . also note that you need to be skinny to have abs .
   (ID: 441f42a774bfb13dc694fc8515be8a2da22decb1)

4. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .
   (ID: 4422c1db26c9be5bec35694a448a490c2761d985)

5. for my wifi to work on both christmas eve and christmas . they are the two days i don ' t do any work at all and just want to veg and play playstation and watch tv .
   (ID: 2ce8587266f0888bb10672ccf8a7be1bc6c3f0d2)

6. well it  s not a mean nickname so she  s not making fun of you so possibly she likes you or someone dared her to call you that , maybe she  s just being playful  goofing around or sending obvious hints that she digs you , its hard to tell since i haven  t met her . she could also just want to be your friend
   (ID: 5b1553b6a517f6dfee19019582f0bb534a60ae0a)

7. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

8. i agree with you . it ' s disrespectful when people say friend zoned . all you want me for is to get in my pants ? if you don ' t value my friendship then just leave .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

9. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

10. aasimars make great paladins and clerics . the bonuses they give work great for the class , so the la is worth it . dopplegangers have a la  digit , but to a rogue or a bard the racial bonuses are crazy good . half  ogre ' s  digit to str is great for barbarians . skulks offer a lot for a rogue . it really just comes down to what kind of character you are trying to play . if making a powerful characters is your goal , then any la past  digit is probably not good to use if at all . but if you want to play around and have a cool unique character , they can offer a lot .
   (ID: c018255fd73fced873eb4897821cd82620ba8fe2)

11. i wouldn ' t want to watch it even without the scars tbh . i would just feel wrong . lewds are as far as this man goes .
   (ID: 411b23f3d2a1f254c1c92c17670bb02c191a1301)

12. nsfw ! this post is definitely nsfw , just want to give everyone a heads up ! i just have to write a bunch of cramp so that the automate raptor doesn ' t just kill my comment because all i wrote was " nsfw . so , again  risky click at work , folks .

13. this question always surprises me . women want what men want according to personal preference . in other words  just don ' t be a dick . both genders , duh . no one cares about your stupidly expensive tricked out car , or if you ' re willing to wear a party dress in january . its dumb . just be people ! holy shit , i ' m frustrated now !
   (ID: cca2db8a0bcb7aff323abdba1f381d7388c9f713)

14. your labia is beautiful as it is . i ' m not a fan of the pussy jewelry , but it ' s also not my pussy , so you go girl  do what makes you feel sexy ! but from me to you , i just want those lips . no need to dress them up for me !
   (ID: f709eec52cd0c0cff5afc1f9f3e0caa4a2797782)

15. yes for the stats , companies need to show that they have women . but the way to treat a woman vs a man is not the same at all . a woman isn ' t taken as seriously as a man . i don ' t want to victimize women , it ' s just what i see . maybe that we aren ' t at the same step . and when i searched my job it was very hard and i had a lot of negative answers even with successfully tests .
   (ID: 862cb85d93fa9b931c3c64cf2fd17ef592d48c50)

16. i don ' t care what they prefer , to be frank . shemale is unacceptable but ladyboy is . just imagine the logic in that when shemale is slightly more accurate . if you can ' t use logic to help facilitate your mental illness , then you probably shouldn ' t transition to begin with . i will say this though . trans chicks may be fast approaching the point of no return in telling their difference from biological women , but they still tend to be more humble than said women . i ' d sooner trust one of them not to steal from me than i would a natural woman . because they actually have to work to look how they want . a biological woman hasn ' t worked a day in her life .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

17. this post is too much for me . i can relate in this shit and want to post some original shit that i just created . these seals holds me back from taking over the world of memes .
   (ID: 6b8a83db666de3b1a44e69862b384efc9e8eaad7)

18. my best friend is in a qpr don  t ask me wtf it means because i don  t understand it and she  s basically dropping me for that person . i don  t care about her anymore . when i loved her it hurt but now i really could not give less of a shit and i just want to end the friendship .
   (ID: b1f9e512a76d2c07b1eae248bca4e0bf140d4bc8)

19. the company i work for pays us to go volunteer a few times a year with a food bank we work closely with and donate to and what not . the fuckin nerve of some people that come in there is unreal . you have the super nice and just down on their luck people that are super appreciative for anything you give them , and for helping load it into their cars and what not , then you get the giant pricks who make you put digit bags into their brand new car , then when you get there they open up the bags and start taking out vegetables and whatever else they dont want and demand you bring them back inside and give them extra cake or sweets , or whatever they choose then flip out when you tell them that ' s not really how it works .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

20. due to this sub ' s rules i can ' t say what i want buy you should just leave her .
