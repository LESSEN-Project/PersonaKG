8. conspiracy theories . it ' s not as much a new trend , as one that has been blown up by every lunatic with a stray thought having ready access to millions of other lunatics . it ' s been my experience that two people can ' t keep a secret about where they ' re going that evening , much less god knows how many people keeping a secret like a fake moon landing , or wtc , or sandy hook , or all the other idiocies that abound .
   (ID: f7713e4cd0a5245097f9f45a1194222bda369b48)

9. for me , when i ' m challenged in a field i specialized in by those whom i deemed unqualified to rebuke me . my thought process is something like this  you question me ! you ! a person who has no qualification whatever in this field tries to rebuke me ? this field is not about opinion , but cold hard facts consists of numbers ! ' i tend to punish them by pushing them aside and excluding them altogether because i deemed them to be near useless to me and that i should set a very low standard of them . their only duty is not to get in my way .

11. the problem with dr . manhattan in injustice is the fact that first of all he has no  fighting  moves . he waves his hands or thinks of something and that  s that . secondly , dr . manhattan is seriously powerful . like , digit times more powerful than superman . he can literally have a thought and it can happen . anyone who fought him could be instantly destroyed without a battle . i personally would prefer rorschach over dr . manhattan as he is much more of a brawler and i believe he is a better fit for the game .
