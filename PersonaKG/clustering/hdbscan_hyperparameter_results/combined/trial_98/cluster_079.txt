2. if i have to have an important conversation , i pantomime what i am going to say to practice how and what i should say beforehand . as a teacher , i do this a lot when i know i have to talk to the principal or superintendent and i don ' t want to sound like a bumbling buffoon . my kids always make fun of me for it when they are doing independent work .
