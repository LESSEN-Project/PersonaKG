4. you might consider a short story or anecdote collection . i don ' t know what you like , so here are several possibilities  louis l ' amour , westerns r . a . lafferty , usually described as an sf writer because most of his stories appeared in sf magazines , but his stories are more tall  tale folktales . dr . oliver sacks , british  born neurologist who has written a number of books about unusual cases he ' s encountered  " the man who mistook his wife for a hat " is a good start . if you ' re into alternate history check out some of peter tsouras ' s essay collections . the most recent one i ' ve read is " rising sun victorious " , about ww ii in the pacific turning out differently .

9. one of the biggest errors our little human brains make is assuming people we know are the same from day to day . many people do not understand the episodic nature of depression . i strongly encourage you to mention to a friend of parent something like " this may be out of left field , but between you and me , i ' ve been feeling kind of blue lately . i know i don ' t show it , but i guess i could use a little extra support at the moment " say it in a way that feels like your voice . saying it out loud is scary , but surprisingly therapeutic in and of itself .

10. ehh no that  s not quite what i  m getting at , i know what you  re talking about . like someone looking off in the distance or distracted while talking , that  s not what i  m referring to . i  ve seen several people who talk with their eyes closed , like speak full sentences with their eyes closed . or they look up while their face is facing you . it sounds bizarre but if you know what i mean then i bet you agree it  s annoying . idk why people do it . some strange social phobia maybe

12. clearly , i know what it is . even the origins of the freemasons . but here is my question . which was spawned by this being the first time i ' ve ever seen a manual to rituals of a freemason . why isn ' t religious literature like the bible , the koran , etc . kept in secret  in private like the freemason ' s manuel is ?
   (ID: b5153b16e61f6bc5e4bf4d8db479b7093df1ae26)

13. ask something like ' so i heard you ' ve wanted to know whether i ' m single ? well i am , so what ' s your next move ? '

14. we might know some of the same people . some of the folks i know follow both . i ' ve only seen pearl jam a few times , but they are always awesome . i really like it when eddie plays solo at the bridge school benefit too .
