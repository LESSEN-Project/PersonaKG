1. well i hope she has the same energy for herself and her actions because from what you say , you didn ' t really do anything bad . she just says so .
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

2. even if things go horribly worst case scenario it literally does not matter and wasn  t meant to be . anyone involved will forget about it quickly . if it goes well , it goes great ! and will only get easier . just trust yourself to get through it . also , i carry a small bag when i  m feeling anxious  nauseous so i can throw up in a clean manner in an emergency if i need to . i hope it goes well ! good on you for taking difficult steps , be proud !
   (ID: 4f1b65a581332b9d19507ccf0e921d0967e013e7)

3. that ' s true , i honestly hope h3 just ignores this or just responds once to point out his stupidity .
   (ID: a46a927d1c00d0b3c6ef6c26916584373e7bc5d8)

4. maybe you can join a new sport or some other fun activities , to spend the eveningsi joined mma . don ' t go for gaming though , it just makes you feel empty once done . hope that helps .
   (ID: a168763c82b90dc18ccbbd57533eec2e49d17dc7)

5. pve upscaleds i ' m all for everyone wanting to try wvw but i really , really , really hope they are playing to win rather than playing for the achievement  loot  xp and karma train . i have seen people running back and leaving the zerg in the middle of a siege  clash just to pick  up a gaddam loot bag left behind .
   (ID: 261413214c13676b8aee2ce20a47107c4ccfe6b8)

6. because my friend isn ' t in reddit and he had texted customer care digit times and no reply from them . idk about that . just a tiny little hope that mods will see my post and reply . something is better than nothing
   (ID: bbb6fee39268cdbbb90618968b5dbe6dee839233)

7. i just hope we don ' t have a repeat of charlottesville .
   (ID: 841a375b464a5650f1c027d1c7ae73415228c6ab)

8. yeah . it added up . it ' s hard , and unfortunately will probably happen multiple times in the next decade or two . by all means i hope you can find the right one early on . just basing that off the " typical " run .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

9. i hope you have a great time . i ' m just thinking of my experience at the super bowl in digit . it was fun , but for the price and my seat location , i wouldn ' t do it again .
   (ID: 3790e844e04694d48c253f7aee4d3b61f116d4d6)

10. wow your right . let  s just hope they don  t fuck it up
   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

11. you can say that for every song on btcs . nothing put on the album to fill a space or bridge a gap between digit songs . every note on every tune f  ing kills . i only hope the new album can grab a just a little of this one .
   (ID: b8a837337ecbafd4a4c170d8fad76bd3de102f09)

12. these people should be taking some goddamn responsibility instead of trying to get outraged at the broadcaster for their lazy parenting . this right here is probably the one quote to rule them all . parents seem to shirk their responsibilities endlessly nowadays . it is not the job of the mass media or school teachers to bring up children . if a person is so uncultured that they have no damn idea what watership down contains , perhaps they should get morally outraged at the fact that they are clearly a fucking moron first . i do hope that channel digit just responds with " lol , no " and is done with it .
   (ID: dccaef8a6226163d8d10afb2d04eb5a7babea832)

13. obviously , this argument doesn ' t hold and it  s simply a case of people being irked that non  whites are finally being represented in a larger way . i surely hope you aren ' t assuming that just because somebody is unhappy with one specific historically  incorrect aspect that they do not care about the others . just because somebody isn ' t actively advocating against every historical inaccuracy at any given point doesn ' t mean they ' re using it as a front to deny non  white involvement  most people do acknowledge the participation of smaller groups in the war , but simply find the representation to be statistically inaccurate . i would ask these individuals what they consider of other historical inaccuracies in the game before framing them with what is implied to be a racist undertone .
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

14. sleep with every men she is sleeping to tell her who is boss . i hope this is just a hypothetical situation rather than a real situation
   (ID: f4f004d4cf95fb0021d8bdc10767d5f3e74d3bc9)

15. sometimes i hope he ' s just being ironic
   (ID: 1955f382f8fc2d10480017d73817b8c3b41c2a02)

16. when you are ready then talk to him about it or seek a professional counselor . it seems to me that you are not open with talking about these  obsessions  and that can start to impact your relationship or life because your not willing to open up . it  s just going to eat you up inside . he may be patient , but is this healthy for the both of you ? . probably not . anyway , i hope everything will get better soon .
   (ID: 7f37f47fcf6439c13308caa3da8118ac14f861f6)

17. don ' t get me wrong . doctors would still be there . just that i hope they won ' t be critical in the sense that life or death would depend on it . makes sense ?
