11. seeing a lot of negative comments saying get help . guys , this is a game where you time and time again , without thought , shotgun blast mofos across the room . op was just descriptive and obviously has a unique play style . at some point we have all saved , committed crimes against humanity , then reloaded . to the op , optionally you can attempt to be a pickpocket expert and just take the gun maybe never actually have seen his inventory in that quest .

13. that  s not how it works , his powers are not brutal force , he has the powers to control everything that happened in the past , he is pretty much thanos with complete gauntlet or even stronger , he would  uncreate  pretty much anyone in any universe just with his thought . the only reason he couldn  t end everything in bleach is because he is too big of a ball of pride and protagonism
   (ID: d10c10d39129e1768465d09c5c492657be31ef47)

14. yeah , true . there are so many worse companies . just the first thing i thought of . it ' s great for talking to my friends and family all over the world as well as promoting myself , but i hate to see how people are addicted to it and over use it as well as whatever privacy stuff they violate .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

15. nudes shouldn ' t really be required . when you ' re in a relationship , just the thought of em ' makes you happy . counting the days till you get to see em ' again .
   (ID: 8712de543372bc5f398d43ea5b918c85efc5dda7)

16. correct me if i ' m wrong , but i thought that this sub was for ads on reddit , not on outside sites . especially not a financial site talking about the financial success of a company . which is their job . i mean , just look at this page
   (ID: 73a501f273781aa2c0deb878ecb02dcab3a9d4d3)

17. be aware that if you ' re caught and you probably will be , no matter which way you go about it , the consequences may be a bit more severe than them just saying " no , you can ' t do that " . you may well be ejected from the park , barred for life , or possibly have security involved . the only way for you to do it and feign ignorance and possibly get away with it and i am not condoning this at all would be to try going through hogwarts express or the main entrance and , if caught and chances are you will be , saying that you thought the parks were the same . but , if you try this , you ' re a bit of an idiot , and even more of a complete git .
   (ID: 2ac4d2cea574e655d7fdb1ab9b4886989929ca96)

18. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .

19. sorry my dude the situation here is just not what it was . at first i thought i was gonna get to break the geneva convention for christmas but the state is doing a good job to calm everyone down sadly enough

20. i just saw venom last night for the first time i truly believed that the acting was great in that movie the baddie of the movie truly made u say  wow this fucker can talk you up what a dick  tom hardy always has some great acting but i didn  t hear much about this movie after it  s release only the memes on how venom looked which i thought was actually pretty good
