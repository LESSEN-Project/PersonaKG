1. who could be so heartless to down vote this comment about how cute the pomeranian is ? who ever did this better bow down to that pomeranian and apologise also would you like to sign up for a my best buy credit card to get digit  back in rewards on your first purchase ?
   (ID: 89bda4e1242c8f5567558138509db8b02cf94cd6)

   (ID: 183a5eea32f2c73a87c734920d3188862433e411)

4. that ' s pretty neutral , it ' s always best to be positive and not talk about what you didn ' t like but what you did like . for instance , your old boss might have been a real hard ass , riding you all day . instead of saying that you could say your old boss was really involved in my day to day tasks and was really focused on the job getting done . i learned a lot from him . this is not a lie and it spins the situation in a positive light .
   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

5. looks like the mom did sue in this instance . with parents like that it ' s no wonder that the kid is the way he is woman  facepalming
   (ID: 0eb234eb32f4a74b31c625730bfcb4190d403d56)

   (ID: 9e2852bcfafecccb1e60211326f5fc70d0bbb428)

7. did you forget the bit where canada has actual bears ? like the proper man killing and eating type ? canada is cold as fuck and it has bears . i will stick with the snakes thanks mate .

11. that ' s horrible ! law should protect people no matter what , not allowing to hurt them legally . i ' m from poland . my physics teacher is roasting and disrespecting whole lgbt  and other minorities all the time . he ' d better teach us physics but noooo . he ' s been teaching in this school for years and it seems nobody ever complained about him to the headteachers , or they did but it had no effect . i guess there are multiple teachers like him here . even wort ones

12. did you deliver the talk ? i ' d like to hear it
   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

13. cheating was a sport . i would do it even if i studied like mad . i even cheat for people . i remember in my linear circuits class the guy beside me was doing poorly . i looked at his answers and seen he was going to fail . i took my paper changes to his name and sent him to hand it in while i did his . . he ended up doing better than me . still a rush
   (ID: 803d3eb0d3664275a2ad6840048dba9d4d991cf7)

14. a friend of mine was being a dick on a constant daily basis after a recent event happened . like he would criticize every thing i did like how i played a game or ate food or even laughed . it bothered him so much he had to say something harsh every damn minute . but his comments pissed me off so much after a few months that one day i snapped and screamed in front of all our friends " diego you became a fucking asshole ever since your dad died " and there my moment was .
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

15. no formal training related to this kind of stuff and i feel like they did tell me that everyone was getting a raise .
   (ID: a2ca7f9e05e83928ce894848f01290dbcd0f654e)

16. agreed . he clearly knew what he was doing was wrong , as did his buddies . that ' s why they went up in arms as compared to saying , " oh i didn ' t know " and walking off . you digit  did the right thing . it ' s like when a child pulls the " i ' m not touching you " line while holding his hands a millimeter from your face . he tried to bs his way through a clearly illegal move . to me that is the same as shooting someone from the deadbox . he walked out of bounds , indicating he was out , then tried to justify it with whatever argument he spewed from his mouth . if i was your manager i would have had no problem kicking that dude out for the day . no time nor patience for people who are going to act like immature little children .

17. " added option to skip autopilot sequences in the galaxy map " oh dog yes i swore off another playthrough unless they addressed the gratuitous animation  loading screen garbage . i loved this game more than most , but holy mother of macaroni did that drive me up the wall . i actually regret not doing something neurotic like timing all the waiting i had to do in this game going from planet to planet . it was truly obscene .
   (ID: 0861712f8592c280471770109eb434101eb06dca)

18. did you wrap it ? i can  t seem to decide if i like wrapping or not . it does net a juicer pork butt , but the bark is not as crisp as i would like it . still trying to get mine down .
   (ID: d5ff87b3b0a008d93a655ee4d43e9da3b5db7984)

19. not for pot , but something like this for whatever i did .
   (ID: 725e5a3de682f359cfb87481ec457a2f78867ef3)

20. if you do something in an area , make it cleaner than it was before you did the thing . like if you cook , clean the kitchen so it looks a little better than before
