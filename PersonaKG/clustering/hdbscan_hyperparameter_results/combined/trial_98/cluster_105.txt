1. well if you knew exactly which neurons were responsible you could trace the signal to the exact nerves where the " signals for consiousness originate . that then narrows down the work significantly , then all you have to do is make sure the nerves pass the 40mv point  and i feel like we have many ways we could do that . i mean it just inhibiting electricity right ?

2. how do you tell the difference ? edit  been googling . it ' s not easy to see the differences . i get hobos and brown recluses here . the next one i catch they like my cellar and occasionally come upstairs to say hello that looks like this i will make sure it isn ' t just a giant house spider !

3. thanks everyone , seems like this really isn ' t the right subreddit because its not about anyone being an asshole i just wanted to be sure should i remove the post ?

4. by that logic , we shouldn  t allow driving at all because it increases the risks of harm to people and people  s pets . it is already being worked on self driving cars to minimise the potential of crashes . here is a article about that  dough i do understand what you are trying to say , i would still just do rules like that because still , it puts the animals in danger . earlier you said that weed lessens the aggression , but sooner or later other drugs will be legalized where they do make people more aggressive . that is the problem . by just having rules like that it would atleast prevent a few drug users to buy pets , which is better then nothing wouldn ' t you say ? sure it maybe just prevents digit drug users from buying pets , but thats better then nothing in my opinion .

5. i have way too much training and , unless the person is actively dying . i won ' t do more than make sure they have space and are on their side , just the basics . cruel ? fuck yes it is . but the last time i helped save some cunts life , they tried to sue me . so yeah . jaded . i ' d like to help , but people will sue for anything . no gratitude . just letters from lawyers .

6. yeah , my biggest is not the spoiling . i spoil my daughter a lot too , but i also make sure she is aware of the fact that what you have doesn ' t make you who you are , it ' s in your heart and how you treat people . my biggest pet peeve is the parents that are like , no honey don ' t scream , ssshhh , it ' s ok , and there is their cld having a stage digit temper tantrum in the store  zoo  park wherever and they are just so passive . drives me crazy .

7. kind of . i don  t remember it being like that when i used to be prescribed adderal in my younger years . they said it  s required by law for me to visit that often if i am prescribed now . just wondering if it  s an actual law i  m sure it is but i haven  t heard of it before ?

8. im pretty sure everyones gay . by degree . do you like porn ? do you like your women ravaged by a flaccid penis ? or a hard one ? . see you just realized you ' re digit  more gay

9. i mean it  s certainly possible just seems super unlikely to me . really a one trick pony company as solarcity probably isn  t going to take them there , and sure some of them tend to do good but just like other car companies there will be a ton of competition and to me it also seems pretty unlikely we will see a completely electric car world unless there is massive improvement in battery life and charge time . even so there are tons of other car companies . i mean we will see just seems a bit of a pipe dream to me , suppose we will see though . i mean if tesla completely eliminates all other car companies and electric cars take over the world we could see a multi trillion dollar tesla in digit  digit value , but even still it  s not  my kids will thank me later off my tax return  kind of money .

10. pretty sure it  s the caliber of person . for example , you have couples like evelin and justin who have just a tiny bit of drama but really get along with each other well and seem low key . the producers don  t have to make these people seem like drama obsessed idiots , they come prepackaged that way lol .

11. every day , i find someone that has money , and make them give it to me . stand in line behind someone at the atm and make them give me the money they just took out . hang around at a casino and wait for someone to win big then make them give me their chips . stuff like that . and make sure that it ' s somewhere that has video cameras . i can make them say something like " here man , you take this " " seriously " " yeah , just pay it forward . and then if they try to take it back , i have video evidence that i didn ' t steal it .

12. not sure about canada , but it ' s illegal in the u . s . normally this would be handled through the department of labor here . the questions you have to answer are these  is this something that happens repeatedly or just this once ? if not repeatedly , are you a model employee ? can they find a reason other than this to terminate you ? if you have gone to the top of the food chain trying to get paid for that digit minutes and were unable to , and it ' s a single occurrence , and for the most part , you like working there , is it worth it to pursue ?

13. cash almost none , like digit bucks or so , the clothing and guns , they are there , just not straight into the epilogue , by the end of part one you will be able to get them back in your saddle . not sure if all stranger ' s missions , but all the ones i had available before , are still there . legendary animals will be there as well as treasures and collectibles .   x200b  i only have one question and is if you figured a way so john is not so skinny ?

14. never said i ' d stop replying to you for good , i made it clear i was talking about the specific post i said it in . it really wasn ' t a struggle , just search dbd on f13 sub . doesn ' t matter when it happened . it happened and you were proven wrong and can ' t handle that fact . i made a reddit account a month ago , yeah . not sure why new accounts have to be considered troll but . cool ? if anything , just proves my point that you ' re always paranoid . i mean i don ' t reply to nothing , but like everything else mentioned , keep living in denial , i guess .

15. brecci was good though , this isn ' t . i wasn ' t saying it was the remington , it ' s the only comparable in one shot kill type of way . it ' s bad when i ' d rather use fists in half the gun fights tbh . and the sg12 isn ' t garbage unless you can ' t click the trigger more than two times . any average player can use the gun like any other , sure it ' s no saug , but it ' s still way better than the mog12 . it ' s just depressing .

16. ha ! i ' m like you  i find all that stuff just massively fascinating . not sure how i ' d feel paralysed and not able to communicate , though .
