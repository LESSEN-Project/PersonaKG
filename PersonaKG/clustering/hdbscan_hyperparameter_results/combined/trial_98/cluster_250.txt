1. yeah the ui is probably the thing keeping me from playing it the most , having to wait for the chest inventory to appear every time i open it sucks and my inventory is bad , no digit hot bar stuff . also i feel like moving my view around is different fro java edition and does not feel good at all to use

2. exactly , no way to win . only thing to do is avoid the situations with people who are like that and try to have worthwhile conversations with people who are more reasonable . the stuck up sjws aren ' t worth you time

3. i feel like this would describe me as of now , but i ' m working to eliminate that part of my life as it doesn ' t really serve any purpose but to drain me of time i could spend doing something else . from what the descriptor reads , i do believe people from probably any orientation could fit the term to some extent . sexual fantasies only seem to rarely transition to the real world , and even when they do , it ' s not as you imagined .

4. i havent down voted anyone . simply stating my opinion that this game is shit . you complain about people whining but look what you are doing ? simply because people state their opinions ? to answer your question no i haven ' t downvoted in this particular subreddit . like i said , if it makes you feel better to cry and whine when people shit on the sequel , go ahead whatever makes you feel better man .

5. there are lots of good in this world , my life has made therapists cry , but i still find good in people and places . bad news is what the media sells . good news can be twisted to fit an agenda to look like something it is not . follow the money figure out the angle then evaluate .

6. i couldn ' t get past the scene where the guys lifted up the kids shirt to see if they had boobs . digit . this doesn ' t happen in real life digit . nobody thinks like this digit . this doesn ' t happen in real life .   x200b  and this is coming from a high school student who has many lgbt friends i ' m gay myself   x200b  i do hate this constant pc shit too . like , yes , it is good for there to be acceptance in a show , but when a message is forced down my throat , i feel almost compelled to take the exact opposite standpoint ? am i alone in this ?

7. if you can ' t learn , what ' s the point of having this discussion at all , right ? and yes i agree there ' s no point in trying to regulate or advocate any life choices to anyone unless one is willing to uphold them oneself first . i ' m sorry but it feels like you have had to deal with a lot of hypocritical people especially people who have been unempathetic about the situations infertile people work under . i apologise if i came across that way .

8. i do this a lot . i don ' t like wearing shoes that much but if you go full on barefoot people treat you a lot differently than someone with shoes on . as soon as they see you with no shoes on they automatically start pre  judging my character , i can see it in the way they stare . but if i wear socks people almost never notice , and you can get into any store most of the time , whereas barefoot people will try to kick you out .

9. if we are quiet in a group setting it does not mean we are having a bad time . although it ' s a nice gesture , you don ' t have to constantly check on us . it makes us feel insecure and like we ' re doing something wrong .

10. very good at lying to people . i always try to help out others  tell a harsh truth once in a while if the situation occurs so i can stock up credibility for the day when i need to lie to people . like if friends need me for something  i overslept by an hour . i make up a story like my car broke down , they buy it , nobody thinks works of me .

11. very interesting ! also interesting that you had a similar experience to mine . dengue fever is very serious . looks like if i ever go back there will need to some immunizations or something first , hey ? i lived there digit years ago . saying that makes me feel old . maybe i am old .

12. our commanders does the same thing and i understand why are they so pumped when giving out orders . if you are in the middle of a fight , he  she doesn ' t really have time to type out orders specially if the group was portal bombed . so at least the people in the channel gets the right instruction so that they could react appropriately . sometimes our guild run havoc groups when we don ' t feel like joining the zerg and i sometimes speak rapidly when we are in the middle of a scuffle . it ' s not much scolding but more of excitement specially if you can feel you can wipe the enemy zerg .

13. i stayed trying to help her and be the supporting spouse , the suicide attempts , the anger , the lashing out , the never being good enough , the weeks of abuse and then the apology and the same pattern over and over again . you can only for so long go about questioning your every move and how will it get thrown back at you . i was hurt and hurt to a depth that makes therapists cry , i forgive her , she is ill , am i still hurt ? yes from time to time . yes it does feel like those digit years were ripped from me .

14. i own a meat company , we sell steak chicken seafood and pork , we set up big circus tents in the parking lot of the malls , when i don ' t have enough business coming in , i go drum some up . but why does it matter what i am talking to people about , or what i am selling ? all that should matter is , is it illegal , or is it not ? i have all of my required health permits from the state of tx . but this health permit obviously is not good enough for every single incorporated city who has a city council , who can make up any kind of ordinance that they feel it ' s like making that day .
