   (ID: a8d677a357cabd8cb6d9bfa06e041b5b173582d8)

10. thank you , i just find it to be quite logical honestly . checking yourself in the best way you know will work to see if it ' s worth the wait , if your results were different emotionally you would know not to waste your and your so ' s time , which is better than starting the official relationship just for you to find out you don ' t really love her , now that ' s fucked up . goodluck with whatever you decide !
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

   (ID: 87921f4850625bbc1ea70e7a3027781ab887303e)

12. relax and remember she is a little girl . you are supposed to love her , but not in that way . know that if you had tried anything , it could crush your family . relationships will break apart . your family will grow distant . your parents would be shattered . your sister would be scarred forever . as an older brother , please try to remember the role you are meant to play in her life and try to forget any thoughts you have about her .
   (ID: d8492ac2e05f869f3bd79bafc9f32c603a615e59)

13. pressure is what makes you stronger talk to me , don ' t hate who you don ' t know love yourself i ' m here , stranger but i am here . whats wrong ? whats happening ?
   (ID: d42f47f147cdc8e97117f0e4963e2c1309d1dcd8)

14. i ' m sorry you hate dogs ? people coming together to save a life , or give more time , is somehow a bad thing because its not human life ? this makes zero sense to me . i know people who have spent just as much if not more on their pets . you do what you can for those you love .
   (ID: 8285a776fd60b145ed2afc145cdf2b926b93ed8b)

15. i know it ' s silly but i get embarrassed when people are singing happy birthday to me in a restaurant . you know , when the guy comes over and places the big sombrero on your head and the waiters do that happy clapping dance routine and then ask all the patrons to join in . my family loves it and they love it when i go bright red !
   (ID: fa4c371fe8b38af948c041b548e9bad7869c7b69)

16. yall , vent about the stuff that makes you angry or anything to someone or to a journal listen to music take a shower jack off go for a run sign up for a boxing class where your punches are practices in a safe way don  t know if that sentence makes sense but i  m lazy but for the love of god don  t hurt yourself and don  t yell at anyone who doesn  t  deserve that just makes you a dick no matter how angry , also yes punching wood counts as hurting yourself
   (ID: cc15a2c089fadf84b135f1f61f9666baac04a6e3)

17. if it hurts someone , it ' s wrong . just the golden moral rule . you know , general moral principles are same for all people . anyway , i don ' t need a god watching me to understand that murder or rape is wrong and helping people and making them feel better is right . make love not war .  . also my atheism helps me easily accept some progressive modern trends  i support lgbt rights , feminism and sexual education , for example , while these things are considered as sins in many religions . also , it ' s interesting , i read somewhere , that there ' s a bigger percentage of religious people in prison that in the society . i don ' t remember the numbers exactly , but it ' s probably about digit , digit  atheists among the prisoners and digit  in general in the us
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

18. oh yeah , stay hard at the idea of physically assaulting someone because you  re too much of an idiot to adequately represent yourself in an argument you placed yourself in but know nothing about . suck a dick you fucking lame ass poser . lol . i encourage you to seek me out . i always love watching keyboard warriors picking up their teeth .
   (ID: 08da4119a215672a002df8147181afbb771a75f9)

19. i would say make it so that the readers know why he ' s doing it . what ' s driving him ? for relatable . but personally , i would love to read about a character on their way to their first victory . so yeah i ' d say that ' s brilliant .
   (ID: 79fc72ea72532d39a039ecb4e47a630a601ff4a8)

20. im a male and ladies if i am wrong please let me know . their dog will be there when you cheat , lie , and steal . their dog will love them on their darkest and brightest days . their dog will be by their side no matter what . a large number of the male population cant even accomplish one of those sentences that a dog can do without trying . does this make them  obsessed  ? nope . it merely shows their loyalty to those who are loyal to them .
