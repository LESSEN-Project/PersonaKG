1. hrm , yeah i do want to do that for refining but the phase i ' m thinking of is concept writing   rehearsing . right now i ' ve been writing my bits like . so anybody here like joke set ups ? make some noise !  point to loud person  there ' s my people ! i ' ll tell you something about joke set ups ,  pause and grin  the best part is  snidely  the punchline ! then i practice till i don ' t need the notes , but i find if i let a bit of time go by between writing and rehearsing happens when bits come to me during a busy moment or in the middle of the night i often stumble over my clumsy notation . just wondering if anyone had a better way of putting the extra stuff on paper .

2. they have a strict " we don ' t do that " policy listed on their website . also , in past experiences , when i told the suicide hotline that i was suicidal they pretty much just say " okay , why tho ? " like , the only time they would call the cops is it you were at the edge of a building or had a gun in your hand . just general " i am suicidal and want to die " is what they are there for . also , pro tip  if you don ' t like the person you ' re talking to , hang up and call again . it takes about digit mins for them to get back on the line , so you ' ll get someone new . i ' ve had to do that before once or twice .

3. see , my parents ask for a pre  determined amount of change like digit if i get digit and any that ' s left over gets put in a pot which i can then use as extra if i want more . if you ask your parents they ' ll probably not mind .

4. there is no point doing anything . it all requires too much effort to even start , and why bother doing it because it ' ll have no effect and nobody will care . nobody cares anyway . might as well just go to sleep and not wake up . life would be easier for everyone if you ' re not around because you ' re just trouble for them , they have to look after you . everything you want to do , there ' s someone who will be better at it than you . if you do anything , people will find out that you ' ve been faking it all this while . but try to smile and make jokes anyway because that will make people like at least the appearance of you .

5. you can certainly do amdram style acting for years and it ' ll scratch the itch but if you want to pursue acting as a full time career , you kinda need to put all your energies into that , from my own experience . as i say to folks , and as people like matt damon have said succinctly too , if you can do something else instead , go do that . that ' s not trying to discourage people but it is basically saying that if acting isn ' t in every fibre of your being , don ' t do it .

6. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

10. it ' s very simple , if i say i want to be a vegan because all i eat is fruits and veggies but like me i ' m also a bow hunter i will be denied entry . why ? because i ' ll be breaking a tenet of the cult .

11. for canadians i  m a conservative but compare to americans i  m probably a centrist . i describe myself as a proud member of the  here  s a fair percentage of my money , now fuck off  party . i  ll pay taxes for important shit like infrastructure , education , and health care but i don  t want my money going towards bullshit like art departments or foreign aid . i also don  t want the government deciding what i can or can  t say , or what i can and can  t do in the privacy of my own home so long is doesn  t hurt others physically . basically i  ll pay taxes , let me decide where they go , then fuck off .

12. you have to go out and talk to them first . people seem to want a girlfriend by a miracle also wait until college . you ' ll be more beautiful at college , like everyone else

13. i do put a facade around people that i cannot work with , i acts like i ' m understanding of their problems but that is just for me to gain good reputation . if the opportunity arise to cause their downfall , i ' ll usually considers it . one way to caught people like me is to put me in a situation where i need your help . my ego will usually prevent me from taking your help as i dont want to owe favor from people i deemed useless to me .

14. no , in normal  raids you have a lot more personal responsibility . you can ' t just afk through the fights . it is a helluva lot more fun than lfr . you should try playing each of those specs through lfr a few times . get a feel for how you ' d perform in a large group setting . lfr might not be " real " raiding but it ' s close enough to give you an idea . tanaan , lfr and mythic dungeons can get you into normal raids easily , then from there you ' ll go to heroic and mythic raids , ofc . race only matters if you ' re going for extreme feats like world first . play what you want to stare at for hours on end .

15. i think you ' re trying to learn but i would not say that a lot of guys are bordering on aspergers . plenty enough are smooth . plenty have empathy . sales principles help build armor . approach anyone you find attractive or seems like a nice person and strike up a conversation particularly if you are shy . this will help you learn to read people as well as show people you are friendly and respectful . when people don ' t wish to engage move on asap . analyze it shortly thereafter but you ' ll getter sense of when to approach people any gender for any reason . and since they won ' t all be romantic interests you won ' t get the shot down feeling if someone doesn ' t want to chat each time . make some female friends who are only friends even if they are blood relatives . they can play wing for you and perhaps accelerate your learning .
