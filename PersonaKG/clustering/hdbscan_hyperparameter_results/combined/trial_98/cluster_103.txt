1. what i make best is lemon chocolate chip cookies . but i have to remind myself to hold those in reserve until i know someone a little better because if you just spring them on someone they probably will think it ' s really weird and not risk trying them .

2. thanks , good to know i ' m not alone . i think the problem comes from how people take the word " noob " to mean . most people here think not being a noob is just able being able to win or get high ranks , so if you win or have a high rank then you ' re not a noob . for me not being a noob means being able to aim well , win fights and just having good general fps skills , as well as all the br skills survival , camping , etc . lots of people who win are terrible at fps stuff and they don ' t even realise it . i see it often when spectate .

3. i do know a person who broke off a needle in their arm and just left it . years later i guess some sort of a pimple or sore developed in that area and he squeezed on it and the needle came oozing out . i don  t think you should risk it though and should see a doc .

4. yea i think that  s what it all comes down to at the the end of the day . i  m always looking for a quick fix or an escape or the easy way out , i need to just confront my problems . i know exactly who i wanna be , i  m just too lazy or scared to get out my comfort zone and just do it . but nobody can make the decision but me . no therapy , distractions , drugs are gonna do it for me . sorry if this is all rambling and incoherent , i  m still pretty blazed . but i think i  m starting to understand . you don  t know how much this means to me man , thanks

5. i don ' t know if it ' s just a mental thing of something even if real madrid just field digit players on pitch in the whole ucl tournament i ' d still think of them as the favourites .

6. you know you don  t have to follow a guide right ? one thing about majority of the players playing this game is that they don  t bother to adapt , they just mindlessly play and when something kills them , they think it  s bullshit or the build is trash .

7. i know it isnt a meme just the template but i dont think this is anywhere else

8. god , i hate all of the rock fans . from the gatekeepers to the lewronggenerationhttps    type people . it makes me ashamed to be a rock fan . i can hardly wear a nirvana shirt without someone saying " oh i bet you don ' t even know that ' s a band and think it ' s just a brand " . bitch , you can fuck right off .

9. learn how to joke and also learn that you are not the uk fanbase universe . plenty of friends down the road from me right now and we had a few that were all out of sorts with how the game went last night . i obviously don ' t think the season is over , was just playing up the fact that some of the fans i know were flipping out unnecessarily .

10. i  m not saying she will or not , but this is just a picture of someone standing beside a dog that  s taking a shit . why are you assuming she won  t ? the majority of us dog owners are normal , decent people . glad to know you think all of us are lazy pieces of shit though face  with  tears  of  joy

11. now i still kinda think this is a joke but after looking through your account you seem to be pretty crazy so i just wanna let you know that platypuses are real

12. honestly i think you should go get a makeover and try focusing on your own beauty . i could see how that  s irritating and tbh i don  t even know how you would begin to deal with that but maybe ask her to tone it down with talking with you or maybe find another outlet for support ? idk if i felt this way i  d get my hair done and go shopping maybe get laser hair removal just feel good for yourself .

13. saying for the first time , that there is no god , can be scary . you have to admit it to yourself before all others , and you know in your head what is true . yeah , it can be comforting to pretend there ' s a god out there looking out for you , protecting you . it ' s nice to think of heaven to go to , and all your family being there . but that ' s just a way of denying the finality of death and the ultimate futility of life . but deep down , you know the truth . it just takes some time to admit it to yourself .

14. not exactly , trumpsuki heh represents in the game ' s second act , she just becomes a jerk . trump is also a jerk . i dont know what made me think of that .

15. hmmm . i ' m going to have to add this article to my bookmarks for the same thing . thanks for the article , it ' s amazing to think about what you ' re missing because you just don ' t know about it !

16. i am i suppose . i just think it  s a bit disrespectful in the first instance to post pictures of someone that to me look to be taken with their knowledge , for the internet then to judge whether or not she  s healthy . she might be perfectly healthy for all we know . i believe there  s an element of people using health as a means to justifying their resentment .
