2. there are some idle thought tricks you can do . for example when you feel your mind wander imagine an awesome palace or castle you rule . then imagine the inside of it . fill it full of awesome shit you like . then you put things you need to remember in it . might be a bad example but its similar to what i think about when falling asleep . the essence of it is putting important thing in your idle thought processes .

3. my sister fosters cats and dogs and i think she derives some satisfaction from that . she ' s tried talking me into it but i think i ' m so timid about that subject , i ' d probably have panic attacks at the mere thought of something happening .

4. sometimes when i look at a person with really skinny arms , i think about how easy it would be to break them . then i immediately cringe and my peepee shrinks back into itself because i can  t stand the sight  thought of broken bones . seriously , why fuck do i think of these things ?

5. that ' s you being afraid because you are creating thoughts in your own head about things possibly going wrong . if you were to do any of those activities you mentioned and at any point during them something made you feel nervous or that something is wrong , it ' s your gut feeling . think of fear as a thought process and your gut feeling as a natural reaction .

6. true at the time i didn ' t connect it , but afterwards i thought the same thing . he sort of just disappeared . the only other person i could think of being " the american " would be brenner , but i have my doubts about that .
   (ID: 36314aee005a03517f2446ec0da2834fe0f712d6)

7. idk , i thought about having skaven being able to conquer anything . i ' m not too well versed in the skaven , but i think it ' d be weird to see them defending the walls of a human city . i ' m probably wrong on that though

8. doesn ' t the poop emoji exist because the japanese word poop is similar to the word for luck ? like the emoji is for good luck ? it started out as a joke because people thought it was random to have an emoji for poop , but i think people have taken it too far . also , i hate how prevalent gross out humor is , it ' s honestly really annoying .

9. wow . for some reason i thought i was trying to think of the digit year old virgin and can  t believe how far off i was .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

10. no but i still keep my stance if the money is there . pay me . everybody is different , they have their own thoughts and ideas . if i don ' t do it somebody else will . why shouldn ' t i make that money if i ' m perfectly able to ? it ' s a job . that ' s all . now if it ' s universally immoral then we may have an issue . i ' m not gonna be the spokesperson for human trafficking . with that same thought process though if your thoughts and ideas don ' t allow you to think like that then that particular job isn ' t for you .
   (ID: 7cece6bbdf487f99b6d494ab790bde8e66ce8966)

11. i think a lot of people who are at that point don ' t think anybody cares to listen to them , and they have thought that for so long , that it is very hard to reach out to anybody

12. yepp , i thought i just didn  t have the time or motivation to finish them but after the 5th drama i started seeing a trend . i think it also has to do with the fact that there wouldn  t be any more twists or plot development because the drama is essentially wrapping up . so subconsciously i don  t think i  m missing out on anything .

13. i think you should correct your behaviour . if your first thought when something happens is " im completely faultless " and then after everyone else says you ' re the asshole you still seem to think you ' re in the right . yta taking out your anger on others and racist comments are never valid . dont kid yourself
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

14. yeah , i thought as much , but my friends think otherwise .
   (ID: 75ca79d6c5cfc50533ff56cde25edfb593ae8568)

15. i frequently do . it  s my way of saying  put a little more thought into it , i think you have the ability to piece this together on your own  .
   (ID: 642d313215c4dbadffc4be5d2f254d63d8270b82)

16. oh i thought there was a different aspect too , where the more boxes you open he more likely you are to get a new brawler . i think that part applies to all rarities
   (ID: 26831d6557d17492ae3b0b54585b32e08055f834)

17. i have actually thought about something similar to this . i think we  re onto something shaggy !
