2. don ' t appease her for risk of breaking your lens , shes just being uncanny . let her come around , , , dont fold my guy its not worth damaging your lens . let her be passive , but when she comes around hold to your strong points you have in why you refuse to use it . but you realllllly shit the bed by using the word psycho ahahaha i mean like , its like if the story of rosa parks went way south ? like if people didnt have none of that sitting down shit . well , you just did that . ahah she will show you psycho now that you called her out . best wishes on that part .

3. nothing ' s wrong with having a preference . i prefer neat myself . that ' s fine . but did you notice how i used the term ' really matters '  like  not just ' kind of matters '  more like ' important ' . sometimes you can misread the thrust of a post if you just skim  read it .

4. yup . today my extremely smart and logical mom said that maybe comey isn ' t as clean as he looks . she sent me an article that talked about how he didn ' t take notes during a digit hour clinton interview or something . i told her so what ? he said he didn ' t take notes except for unusual situations and trump put him in an inappropriate situation . i ' m finding one of the problems is that she knows how to use snopes to see through fake news , but a lot of this stuff isn ' t fake , it ' s just biased so much that it ' s lost all sense in reality . did comey attend a digit hour clinton interview and not take notes ? probably . does that mean he ' s not clean ? i don ' t understand where an idea like that would even come from . they just say the magic word " clinton " and all of a sudden any kind of association becomes magically worse than trump . i don ' t even particularly like clinton but the amount of hatred for her is insane .

5. i dunno why but i feel like when it came to naming these animals the people who did it had gotten bored and just went for the first suggestion .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

6. i was just talking to my therapist about this . when you have the ability to do this and still get a ' s , it makes it hard to even be proud of the work you did . because it was so " easy " , and you receive high marks , it feels like false praise . it ' s a totally weird feeling . best of luck to you .

7. juul , the amount of kids im friends with who all regret it a month afterwards is just insane like you knew the risks why did you even start to begin with

8. ive been there man . several times . you get over it and you move on just as i did . i remember counting digit years with an ex and being like  wow  . i  m now with a girl and we have digit beautiful children together and its been nearly digit years .

9. " its kinda like inviting food critics to your restaurant before the actual goddamn clients " is it just me or does that seem like a completely reasonable thing to do , make people who actually have knowledge about it test it first before all the normal clients come in ? i don ' t see the problem , if they did invite people completely random , the chance would be there that you couldn ' t play the game and couldn ' t watch a proper streamer play . because of the way they did it now we who don ' t have a beta key can watch the popular streamers , otherwise we couldn ' t .

10. when someone is your advesary , you have seven choices  beat the crap out of him totally ignore him pretend to be nice to him and slam him behind his back get someone else to kick his ass and deny having anything to do with it kiss his ass in hopes he will come to like you totally surrender have a civil dialougue and see if things progress in a positive direction well . , obama was just sitting there and the man came up to him and offered a gift and a hand shake . unless obama wanted deck the guy right there , act like a spoiled teenage girl , or be a total pussy or a total dick , the only thing he could have done was accept the gift in a civil way and shake the man ' s hand . that ' s option  digit seven choices and he did the only one that any one could call correct . come on guys . , you ' re giving a new definition to the term sore  losers .

11. you have every good reason to be annoyed and uncomfortable . on the other hand people have their preferences and we are led to believe those shouldn ' t include overweight people . so it is possible they just didn ' t have enough self respect to ask you out before if they did like you . i once had someone relay a message about me " she ' s smart and funny , too bad she ' s fat . the great thing is that i won ' t always be fat but the dude who said it will always be an ugly block head

12. but then you would just get people complaining about " waaa why don ' t you tell us how you are fixing the tracker , what are you doing about rural areas , what did you have for lunch " like we do now . that simple tweet would not appease anyone .

13. i just said i like that term , how did you understood that as talking shit ?
   (ID: 833bc208589bf538daebb1a7e14d70fa8a3b7808)

14. i was just curious about how the stock market worked . for  digit , getting a comprehensive look at stocks , what could go wrong ? lol , look at the shit that ' s happened since . boy , did i fuck up , all this talk about taxes , geez , what a crazy fucking life i ' m living . now they have to harass me digit to make it seem like it wasn ' t about stocks . i really opened up pandora ' s box without knowing . looking at the domino effect . don ' t worry , your second house is safe .

15. we must not be talking about the same deku . why does he like bakugo ? they are childhood friends . too unrealistic ? you can believe that a dude ' s sweat can cause explosion but having deku be too forgiving is unrealistic , yeah ok . risking his life to save other ' s ? bro did you not see episode digit , " my body just moved ? deku at his core puts others before himself , thats the reason why all might chose him .   x200b

16. did you not watch the seasons of her becoming an assassin . or the digit minutes she spent sneaking around the dead in this very episode . yeah i do remember the worst storyline in the show was her becoming assassin , i do remember the worst scene in this episode being arya playing hide and seek with zombies in a library , and none of it explains how she managed to get passed the wall of wights and white walkers . this show has become terrible , that final scene wasn ' t even suspenseful for me because you just knew that some stupid shit was gonna save bran at the last second , you knew jon wasn ' t gonna die , you knew dany wasn ' t gonna die , you knew sansa and tyrion weren ' t gonna die . this show lost its balls , it lost its quality , its practically just medieval superheroes now . it sucks , but what sucks even more is the fact that people like you have allowed it to be like this , constantly defending this shows awful writing is why we are getting the biggest disappointment since my birth . how the fuck does " the long night " get teased since the first scene of the first episode , all for it to last an hour and a half ? it just makes me sad how good this show could have been . at least i have the books to look forward to , but not even that will fill the shit show they made of season digit .

17. i ' m just hating on the shows direction . they definitely took a lot of wrong turns and just did whatever made them famous for the time being . kill la kill made by the same studio was made better . i dislike that you like the show . but it ' s a cool tattoo

18. scariest moment was in dino crisis . i had the volume turned up so i could here the click click click of raptor claws on the floor . the part where the t  rex head busts in through the window scared the fucking shit out of me . creepiest moment was in manhunt . at the end of the game where you face piggy , or pigsy or whatever the fuck that freaks name is . anyway i was sneaking around the room , staying in the shadows all ninja like . i waited there for like five or six minutes hoping pig boy would walk by but he never did . so i decide to move to another room , just as i am about to step out of the shadows and become visible i catch movement in the corner of the screen and ol piggy came walking out of the shadows along the other wall and left the room . he had been in the same damn room with me the entire time . i had a huge cold chill run down my back because i had literally been just a hair away from walking out into the open and him seeing me , and thus raping my ass royally . plus that dude looked creepy as hell .
