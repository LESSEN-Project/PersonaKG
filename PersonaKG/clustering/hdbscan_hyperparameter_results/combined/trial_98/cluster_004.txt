9. actually i ' m really sad i thought of this . it ' s just awful . who would want to go through that with the cast of any typical movie ? no matter how attractive a given actor is , there ' s always that one scene where they visit their parents or something . i couldn ' t do it . limiting it to just human adults because , just because , the worst character cast to have to fuck would probably be the silence of the lambs .  shudders

10. just last week a girl at my job would always want to chat with me , she ' d even wait for me to get to break so i could sit with her . i thought it was weird and couldn ' t figure out if she was being friendly or not so i ignored it i suck at reading signals now she doesn ' t bother . oh well

11. well the easy solution is for everyone to not be obsessed with having as much sex as they can get . to treat it with the proper care and attention it deserves . sex is designed by god or nature you pick to produce a child . if you cannot take care of a child or afford the mean to have sex without producing a child then you should not be having sex . an analogy would be like having a credit card . if you cannot purchase something with the card and have the money to pay it off then you should not be buying it . of course that would be impossible to implement because more and more people do whatever they want to do with little to no thought of the larger community
