1. so , this seems like it might be chemical . you mention being inpatient a week ago . do they have you on some medicine ? i know people often have to go through several different ones to find one that works . if they have you on something , it  s not working , so you can definitely tell your doctor that and go from there . and if the current team you have is not helpful or responsive , you can change that . you can change the job , too . don  t worry about being a burden . you have to look out for number one before you can assist anyone else . mostly , i am just so , so sorry you are going through this .

2. boom and zoom planes don ' t just lock up in the shallowest of dives digit i ' m asking for god damm better servers because believe it or not a huge amount of players have to deal with this and pilot ping issues are much worse than tank ping issues if you don ' t know what it does it ' s like when me 262s are flung when landing mid air

3. you might like bros4bros . com or gayxchange . com i can ' t say that these are digit  chat , because people just looking for a cheap hookup tend to infiltrate any site that will let them and i haven ' t found a site yet that blocks those kind of people . i wouldn ' t know how they could do it either .

4. you sound a lot like me , it ' s borderline creepy . i don ' t have dyslexia though , but i have a lot of other stuff so it ' s all good . my sister is even four year older than me . it sounds like it ' s your parents fault for having an impact like this on your upbringing , it ' s definitely affected your life . you should focus on your writing if that ' s what makes you happy and keeps you occupied . one of the best ways to help with depression is to find a hobby , it could be anything from skydiving to working out to writing , anything that distracts you and keeps you entertained is great . as for the girl thing , maybe just keep trying to get her to speak to you . i ' m not exactly an expert on relationships so i don ' t know . and you speak better english than digit  of english people , so well done there .

5. you know what , i try to fucking talk to you like a normal human being , and what do you do ? well , i don ' t wanna say because it will just encourage you to partake in your sick practices even more . so why don ' t you do us all a favor , and fuck off !

6. i ' m not catholic anymore . also , i ' m not really into my college major and have no idea what i ' m going to do after graduation . also , i ' m a little depressed and socially anxious , more than they know , anyway . keeping up appearances on all fronts now . the catholic one is the one they ' d most likely kill me for if they knew . joke answer , kinda  masterbation . i feel like most of these aren ' t major secrets . i ' m just not emotionally close to my parents so they just happen to not know a lot of stuff about my life .

7. knowing what you like isn ' t selfish at all . i know i ' m pretty much just a sub . my partner is a switch . some people are only dominant , some only submissive , some are switches , and with that some are still more dominant or more submissive or are only dom  sub in certain scenarios and the other every time else . it ' s like sexual orientation , your wouldnt be selfish if you were straight , or gay , or anything else , and your definitely not for knowing that you are a dominant and don ' t worry , not all guys are dominants there are plenty of submissive and switch guys too

8. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted

9. my mom ' s exactly the same way , it ' s like she ' s in a cult . and she ' s not even a fan of trump , she just is against abortion and hillary clinton . today she said " well if they aren ' t vetting people and that happens he has a point . there should be middle ground happening here " i told her they are vetting people . in the past she ' s said that " obama likes muslims too much " and i ' m like " where the heck are you even getting that " i told her there ' s absolutely no policy that i know of that showed obama liked muslims a lot . she ' s a very intelligent person , kind hearted and not racist towards anyone and to hear her make a statement that the previous potus liked muslims too much without any kind of facts to back it up really disturbed me .

10. i completely understand . i just imagine my inner meaner as something ridiculous or someone i disrespect  don ' t like so i can tell it as sassily as possible to shut up . sometimes goals take time . its important to remember that no matter how smol the steps are , you are taking them one day at a time , and it should be celebrated . you will get there ! i know it ! just hug your stuffies and dream big lovely  digit

11. that i do care that they eat meat but i don ' t tell them because i know it ' s not my place , just as its not their place to tell me what i eat . also , please don ' t feel like my food choices limit you to where we can eat  there is always something on every menu for me .

12. twas a joke my man seriously speaking , that ' s just the way the world is right now . i ' d say every human being that is breathing right know is depressed , but on different levels and degrees . teenagers are a fucking mess . it ' s not weird for thing like these to happen
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

13. smoke . it ' s the weirdest habit and stupidly tough to quit . i know i just sound like a boring moaning guy but i always tell kids to never start it . don ' t even try it . after digit years of being a smoker it took a lot of effort to cut it out .
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

14. a legitimate reason like that i can totally understand . i even understand the reason why some people have their dog ' s dew claws removed . but i know many people who do it " just because " or to make the dog look more intimidating . selfish reasons like that i don ' t agree with . if it ' s for the health and safety of the dog , i can be onboard with it .

15. yeah i get what you ' re talking about that ' s just how it goes . theres actually a commendation if you can capture all the control points and hold them at the same time , you can also fast travel to main missions , i know it sucks and i get what you mean it ' s annoying to run ecerywhere . i dont remember if you can do it at wt2 , but theres usually little " activites " close to the control points like a propaganda broadcast , or a hostage situation or whatever and if you go do those before the control point it will raise the alert level of the control point which in turn gives you better stuff and gives you a chance to unlock other mods .

16. hate is such a strong word . let ' s say i just don ' t know you well enough to say i like you .
   (ID: 3de4b885645ecd39fdcb6a1daf410341eb118d2c)

17. except no , you do have responsibility . you know that word is offensive which , i would hazard to guess , is why you like it , and further you know what it means to call someone that . it ' s a legitimately offensive thing to call someone , and just because people have called you a faggot and you didn ' t care doesn ' t mean that other people can ' t be legitimately pissed off by being called that , or by that word being used . the idea that you can use a word like that and have no responsibility for how people react is like saying you can swing a baseball bat at someone ' s head and have no responsibility for them being pissed . it just doesn ' t make any damn sense . if you were as emotionally mature as you say you are , you ' d take some responsibility for your own actions instead of projecting that onto someone else . own your shit instead of forcing other people to pick it up .

18. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them
   (ID: 3e7b07ddd384cb288bc529e6aeb73f840aa5a294)

19. i ' m anxious too and that would bring me super down . are those guys average looking or extra attractive ? it seems like a lot of work to have someone come over for sex and do an oh hell no rather than just getting off . not that that ' s a good thing per se but at least you wouldn ' t know . i ' d try and give you my honest opinion but i might be too nice to do so .

20. my brother found something and didn  t know what it was so i made a reddit account so i could post it on whatisthisthing and for the longest time i just checked that sub to see what random stuff people found lol . i use it more than any other social media now and i really enjoy reddit even though i still feel like a newb sometimes .
