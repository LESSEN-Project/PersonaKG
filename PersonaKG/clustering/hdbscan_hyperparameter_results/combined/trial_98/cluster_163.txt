8. i know what you mean . as i said you really have to be disciplined when flying this plane . one false movement and you are dead . i somehow find it enjoyable . i just like the look of it and what its capable of but it is not an easy plane to fly by any means .

9. yes , xhaka needs to go . and , yes , someone must take the blame finally . because with that kind of attitude we would have been sparred at least of some of those pathetic blunders . make a blunder like that just because you are not fully concentrated and you will be dropped . period . they know everything is fine whatever they do and that is mental edge our players are lacking for years and years .
