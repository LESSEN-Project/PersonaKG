1. you ' re staying strong mate , good to hear . it might be unnecessary to reward yourself ' cos you ' re doing so well anyway , but you could always treat yourself with something like a massage , pamper treatment or the like . your way of rewarding you , if you think about your winnings and the fact you ' re not pissing your money away on booze instead like we all have , i reckon it is well deserved ! not your thing ? ziplining ?

2. yeah the whole politically correct culture is pissing me off . and i think it ' s really a small group of people claiming to be offended . seems like outrage is like a currency these days .

3. do you think it ' d work ? maybe , maybe not . the biggest problem is that marcone is assuming that when dresden comes for him it will be a straightforward assault on marcone in a position where marcone has the advantage . harry ' s a lot smarter and sneakier that that . the thing is that marcone as a character is a lot like harry . underpowered compared to some of his enemies , but smart enough to win anyway . a conflict between the two of them is likely to be a lot more like a chess game than a straight  up fight .

4. i think it was more that his character evolved the most . he started out as a date rapist and eventually ended up a monogamist who openly loves blair . he still makes mistakes of course , but he is actually remorseful and doesn ' t continue to repeat bad habits like all the other characters . also , his character has a lot of dimension , which makes him more interesting than someone like nate .

5. it  s more like you return to home . i think it  s a pun on peter being a kid like spider man get back home ! or the chancla !

6. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

7. i used to be like that too , not anymore though . but i ' m afraid i will at some point think about it again so i like to make jokes because it makes something i ' m scared of a little less scary .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

8. it looks like a rose , i can see how some people would like this . because they think that they are special little flowers .
   (ID: 3b45915d58b20f0e2abb6b26d4534980a5d3aa68)

9. i think hot manifests crazy , and i like hot . so by the power of association , i like crazy

10. i think a lot of this comes down to the definitions of coercion and seduction . yes , in seduction the idea is to do your best to be enticing to someone . however , this should not be confused with a bending of their will or a manipulation . coercion is doing whatever is necessary to achieve a desired response from someone else , including putting extra pressures on them , which can be easily done if the coercing party is in a position of power , whether that is physical strength , employment , or status . seduction is like giving someone all green lights , coercion is like trying to take the steering wheel .

11. i ducked up with you still this gets resolved , i mean like pure stranger ' s the same person and i was like that in america . i was in the shower once though . i honestly don ' t think we can do to be a photojournalist for the past few days
   (ID: 533870e07f5d5bb315a9e1e8278df4d123d8a887)

12. i ' m confused on your stance on racism . in another comment you claim you were denied into a committee of sorts based on you being white . so you understand what racism is . yet you make a statement like only asians and jews are good at math . sounds to me like you ' re delusional . a stereotype is formed from ignorance and ignorance comes from not understanding or not wanting to understand  which fuels racism . so unless there was a misunderstanding , i think you and i have different definitions of what racism actually is .

13. that  s wild , she  s either a sweaty girl or that bra hasn  t been washed in like literal months . op should be like  hey i  m gonna do a load of laundry , wanna toss your clothes in ?  . on that note i still think this is shp .
   (ID: 5b21cc135fb593212a5256d44f50dc5eda5d9947)

14. whenever people find their way here they always think it will be like " the one that flew over the cukoos nest " with lobotomy and ect though electroconvulsive therapy is not that medival and in reality greatly assists those suffering from long term depression , it is literally like a whole new person comes out . not lobotimized , more like a medical miracle . plus the media only focuses on the dramatic rather than the relatable , tragically .
