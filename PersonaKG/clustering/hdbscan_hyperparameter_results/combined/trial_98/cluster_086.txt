1. i don ' t believe they ' re cold  tolerant . i live in usda zone 8b , and i can ' t plant them outside . how cold does is get where you live ? and what in particular do you like about their appearance that you like so much ? maybe we could find something that would substitute ?
   (ID: d3491a90d756046acac8c3053e9e99c3e6c231f9)

2. man i might disagree . i feel like trying to live life and getting stopped all the time would get real old .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

3. it is identity theft . it will seriously mess with your living arrangements . be prepared for some fallout , it  s all your roommates fault assuming it is what it sounds like . i couldn  t live with a roommate after that , the trust would be gone for me .

4. well , have you ever considered that your past experience and current lifestyle is what ' s shaping your outlook right now ? i won ' t claim to be an expert but perhaps the lack of " desperate " struggling has raised your level of contentment beyond what even you would consider " normal " perhaps ? my mother came from a 3rd world country we live in the west and my dad is british and i always felt like a piece of trash whenever i visited my relatives and the little nitpicks creep into my mind . but i noticed that despite their struggles , they seem infinitely happier and more comfortable with themselves than i can honestly admit .

5. you look like a lesbian who complains to the manager when a restaurant doesn ' t serve live oysters .

6. omg . dying . jacksonville really is like digit towns in a trench coat trying to be a city . i agree , it  s not a bad place to live . we have some pretty great food here too !
   (ID: 2997447dd39ca55e621bf2769e5d42b81622d35d)

7. could be worse . we could live in an unarmed society were the rich treat the poor like shit .
   (ID: 79e5228419de270c01297915dbce56be0063c52b)

8. if you ' re happy and making enough to live comfortably in the manner of your choosing then it sounds like you ' re getting what you need most out of the job . what do you need beyond that ? maybe that person needs more , and that ' s fine for them . find something to do that makes you happy , surround yourself with people who do the same .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

9. i live in bulgaria and the govenment here doesnt care about shit other than money . for example they keep raising the taxes and the bills for electricity . and if you come here you can see that becouse they dont even bother fixing a single road or anything like that outside the capital . this country used to be great until capitalism took over it and fucked it in the ass .
