1. it  s a common thing  not sure how it  s called but people get paid thousands of dollars to eat in front of cams or in clubs , you know , internet .
   (ID: cc15a2c089fadf84b135f1f61f9666baac04a6e3)

2. i completely disagree . how can you rank something for this event when you know nothing ? you can rank best omegas , sure . but not the best ones for the event . the only reasonable thing to recommend is stockpile omegas and use whenever necessary for the event .

3. tell him and see his reaction . if he is such a great man that wants to be with you , he should have no problem sticking up for you and making sure his family understands that that behavior will cease . if he reacts in their defense and does nothing , you know it  s not worth pursuing . mommas boys are a serious no  no for me , good luck .
   (ID: f18b19a52bbf1505af84d01563a51626d4ae363f)

4. make sure you ' re there before him and don ' t let on that you ' re worried about it . if asked to move , firmly say no and gesture towards the other empty desks . let him know that your momma ain ' t raise no bitch !
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

5. we can ' t know how serious he is until we see him interact with other characters . all we know of his character as yet is that he gets really mad when you chain him to a wall for days on end . pretty sure old dante would show similar anger and defiance were he somehow imprisoned for a prolonged period of time .
   (ID: 4ef88292bcb63ee32b3f587610b610322cea098e)

6. i know ! i worry about this factor  kids are , in fact , not dolls , but human beings . i ' m not sure how i ' d feel about my parents posting my naked butt on the internet some ten  twenty years down the line . i ' d resent them for it . a lot of the posts have the kids ' names , too  imagine what pops up when a potential employer or stalker googles your name one day ? oh yeah , that naked diaper picture of you eating your poop off your fingers , yeah . because it ' s " aww " to the oblivious parents .
   (ID: 53c827dc263721b97d54bc4c972350c3a1b57856)

7. i see things a bit differently . no doubt your dad would appreciate a higher end and therefore more expensive turntable , but as an unexpected gift from his child , either of your options are priceless . go to the top of your budget and if your dad particularly likes audio technica , go with the best you can afford . i don  t know what other equipment you already have , but make sure that you have a pre  amp or integrated amp with a  phono  input or else keep enough money on one side for a suitable phono stage . good luck .

8. you guys get a schedule ? damn lol . at the dc everything is word of mouth and if somebody didn ' t let you know that we are supposed to come in an extra day , you ' re fucked . make sure you have friends here lol
   (ID: 1885b01dd0970230fea2a9c9ae9c4eaeaceb59a3)

9. makes sense . would you happen to know of any good resources i could check out about setting up a vm that i could use for plex ? while i understand the concept and use vm ' s at work i have never set one up for this purpose so i ' m not sure whats all required .
   (ID: 237175707a16a7382ac8130de85ed85b63dc9442)

10. i ' m not entirely sure what happened all i know i someone broke the law and there is absolutely nothing we can do because my whole damn filthy town is courrpetd
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

11. do kiwis even use that term ? i ' m sure they know about it from american movies and whatnot .
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

12. i know for sure that it cost about twice as much to ship something from the us to canada than it does to ship the same thing to from canada to the us
   (ID: 90779ea1e5aa2ec3ed3a1fa6b99a8207c0d66d3e)

13. it ' s impossible to tell someone ' s religion by looking at them . at this time in my life , i ' m not sure i know any jewish people , because no one mentions what their belief system is to me . i can ' t remember when i last saw anyone wearing a yarmulke .
   (ID: 514a3ecd0d04716c9225352c4a3a5d5424dd8056)

14. no way to know for sure , but something doesn ' t sound right .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

15. dating coaches are alright if they know a lot about your demographic and enough about you . if neither applies try another one . key things are to make sure you go places where you can meet people and are active online .
   (ID: 5bae960970112f75742b080e45f735ad64949805)

16. i don ' t know , it ' s hard to compare power level across franchises . if you take mewtwo from the games ? easy , he ' s already out of pp and is using struggle . mewtwo from the anime ? he might be fucked . i ' m pretty sure snake could have a chance against ganon , but i don ' t know enough about either of them tbh .
   (ID: 0dd32da9f7e822909c258818ed313736b958a15a)

17. i ' m not sure . probably a few threads out there . i only say this bc nosleep is usually creepy or paranormal shite that mostly can ' t really be real ya know ?
   (ID: 97c35f21c6a14bb50b6faae9a7b18cd5968c350c)

18. not really sure if things would truly be different or not . i do know that known criminals , and the houses they crash at , get a more through look  see than citizen joe plumber . once again , purely based on social  habitual recidivism . yes you do get a reputation . yes it ' s not fair . that ' s life . unfair as fuck .
   (ID: 2cfcabf07be1420284c0b650fae1643abc6e2bc4)

19. the closer to the finale we get , the closer i get to thinking that we are and have been in both seasons seeing a lot of cr4  dl simulation relating to bernard and william  mib . i haven ' t fully fleshed out what that could mean , but i am not sure that we are seeing much in the way of " reality " when touching on some of the storylines we are following weekly . with that said , it puts me in a spot where i don ' t really know where they go from here besides some contingent of woke hosts infiltrating the real world , but with a less obvious twist of some kind .
   (ID: bd40d7bc2310ec67eb22f820945fdb7d0f6a2550)

20. that literally makes no sense . i ' m not sure you know what hypocrisy is . nor do you have any grasp of the abortion or gun control issue .
