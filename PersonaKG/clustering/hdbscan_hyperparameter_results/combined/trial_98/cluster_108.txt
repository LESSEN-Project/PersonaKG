   (ID: e46c4597dda4f39a1122f37ba9383f7441387cf9)

2. this guy is like herpes . just when you think it ' s gone it shows up again with a vengance to irritate the holy shit out of you .
   (ID: f76420437c1e4fb2e8ba8a9e9b0e116c7fc513ab)

3. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

4. other family members watched all of it , so i ' d be in the room through most of it . i think early on i just decided it wasn ' t for me . i get why people like it but it was marmite to me .
   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

5. stark  digit ? heck no . the character he was more based on , ultimate spider  man ? yes very much so , though neither wanted to be a sidekick but an avenger disney  i prefer it to the other two because people like you have ruined them for me but i in no way think it  s this godsend tom is kind of accurate just not really digit accurate
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

6. you should watch the videos before you criticize , otherwise you look dumb . i don  t doubt that you are , i just think you  d like to make a good impression here .
   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

7. i would actually like to play this scenario . but , the thing is , everyone would just camp their wool the whole game and there wouldn ' t be too much pvp . also , i think popular people ' s wool would get target too much . but overall , great scenario !
   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

8. i think as a canadian this reflects how i feel accurately . it ' s not that i don ' t like america or americans , or that their ideals aren ' t the closest to ours . but if there is truly a superpower that is a threat to world peace , it is without a doubt america . i think just what transpired over the past year there , shows me that at some point an american civil war is a way greater threat to world peace than anything china or russia could do .

9. what ' s been going on inside of my head ? been staring at the ceiling , for hours on end can ' t really think of anything else that i can do  maybe i can go out , and find my way , or maybe i can chill out , stay in today they sound like fun , but maybe another day  sorry , not sorry ! i couldn ' t help it ! just ignore this post , wanted to vent out .

10. social studies . i can ' t stand sjw ' s that think everything is your fault just because you ' re a straight white middle class male . not everyone is like that , but there are enough to seriously rustle my jimmies .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

11. there are a few good ones on here like this , but for freshness , this would be best done as mf4a , just saying . my favourite twist , would be the wife on the phone , teasing the husband about what ifs , but it sounds like she ' s alone . she then hangs up , or at least think she does , and you get to ' accidentally overheard ' how amazing it is .
   (ID: 720bf2762acb0f756492e6e40ae840126dae87ce)

12. i think the guy just look like him , not much more to it .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

13. those kind of games have that " feature " but it ' s not what i meant . i think i just made some term up in my dreams or something like that . thanks for the answer though
   (ID: 9d412b0236e1db384766edb9df245de053d643ad)

14. coincidentally just finished my latest rewatch last night before bed and this post made me chuckle . creed ' s appearances in the last few episodes , and the grass roots story , is pretty funny . i like to think that creed , out of all of the characters that use their real names , is most like himself in real life .

15. i didn ' t say that a certain title makes you less or more interesting or something like that but simply that gamers and players are not the same thing because one plays the game and one is " going the extra mile " i don ' t care if you or anyone is a player or gamer i just wanted to say i think there is a difference between the two
   (ID: c863a7172df41853f354be7adff4b3f9a0cb9736)

16. god , i make this game sound dry , don ' t i ? i just mean that it takes a certain type of person to enjoy it and i would hate for you to find out that you don ' t like it . most of us , obviously , think the game is amazing .
   (ID: 05ea8ab3980e7e9b17e008954c8e6b0d7355612a)

17. timing when to buy a home is difficult since it will obviously be a long term investment . i think you should gauge where you are living to determine if you have confidence in your city and county first . if you do then go out and buy a home that you like and can afford at the best possible price for you . trying to timing the market for a home is just not worth it .

18. i agree with you for the most part , but some of the halloween items , like the templar ' s spirit for the medic and the squid ' s lid for the demo actually look pretty cool . i think they should just do away with the restriction .
   (ID: e53542ff680164cdf45964372fb47cf6a7d48484)

19. i see where you are coming from . like i said earlier i just don  t think this year is the year to do it . we really need an ace or two . other then mike do you really trust any other starter ?
   (ID: d5ff87b3b0a008d93a655ee4d43e9da3b5db7984)

20. well a ton of socially anxious people think of similar shit like this that happened years and ages ago so just add it to the end of the queue .
