1. digit weeks monday here , idk if it  s just me but instead of craving the taste of foods i crave the texture of foodface  with  tears  of  joy i  m trying to make as much sense as possible here , so for clarity , a lot of times i  ll really crave gummy bears , not the taste of the actual gummy bear but the way it feels to chew on a gummy bear .
   (ID: b481339e58c54d903a5bef6ed58d704163f4f9f3)

2. can you talk to the manager at the new job ? explain that if cvs decides to let you go sooner , you ' d like to start working for them sooner , and you ' ll inform them as soon as you ' re made aware . that way if your boss is a jerk and just let ' s you go , maybe you can start the new job right away ?
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

3. you still need a police report to prove it ' s not a hit and run , or that you didn ' t smash someone to death with it in the middle of the night . if its a write off you normally just get a pay out . if you try to fix it you ' ll have to pay the deductible .
   (ID: aac8075b69856b11cb4307ac267b902010d66e3a)

4. the left is never happy and is relentless . this is exactly why if we let them take away ar15s they ' ll just come after shotguns  handguns next .
   (ID: 0d5c70b45072ef9ffc8fb257e4775e8302391e3c)

5. you dont look at something , that ' ll just make your situation worse . best idea is to take a cold showebath , workout , or be with family  friends
   (ID: bd005ac438966eb1f8d6de10fcb1bb6fd4565782)

   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

7. that  ll just prove the point that they are lost before they go in the laundry . why would you kill an urban myth ? are you insane ?
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

   (ID: 5c6637fdf7e2a9a256d6401153dd9d07b5361ef5)

9. in a word  no . writing is tiring for me and the number of stories would push the thread well into tl  dr territory . i ' ll keep writing these and posting when i can and if you don ' t like it you can just not read them .
   (ID: 4d17a8a4d7907bba6d158e8a0b9c3504d69be003)

10. i look for life skills . it ' s retail work were not designing aerospace components so i ' ll give just about anybody a chance if they can show up on time . i don ' t care if you can ' t operate our cash register or pos system . that can be learned . but if you can ' t demonstrate basic life skills like using hand toolsproperly and picking up trash and breaking down boxes so the dumpster isn ' t filled with empty boxes i ' ll send you packing on day one .
   (ID: 4ad10ae12cb226893a0aec21cddd0e791f57ede2)

11. cool ! that ' s a lot of info , i ' ll have to wait until i get home tonight to dig into it . i ' ll have to give voya a good look to see what their fees are like . i might just dump my schwab ira into voya , if the numbers are right . i could also shop around some more , since i ' m not tied to voya anymore due to employment . thanks for the link .

12. because you were obviously born here , have an excellent command of english and you ' re an aussie reddit user , so i ' d imagine reasonably well informed and educated and likely , left leaning . i ' m making assumptions here just as you make assumptions about these people and their situation . i ' m assuming you aren ' t working because you ' re picky about what you ' ll do to earn a dollar , consider yourself above physical labour and simply working hard , seeking opportunities where you can find them . or the most likely assumption is that you ' re just damn lazy .
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

13. embrace it . nothing good will ever happen if you bottle it up and keep denying yourself . you ' ll just end up hurting yourself .
   (ID: afb250d177d47ce6467dfa3414d91e9e07eec6c4)

14. nta you ' re actually being very reasonable . you don ' t wanna end it just because she ' s digit , but because she lied and her biologicl clock puts some strain on your life plans . it ' s a new relationship and i can confirm that you ' ll move on and find somebody who suits you better
   (ID: 28e24cb71e2c0068fef35890d39022b686e4215d)

   (ID: 339d06087e421a1cf86d695af2a2088546f9dc91)

16. just for general knowledge  the chick  fil  a thing isn ' t a corporate policy . it ' s entirely up to the owner if any special promotions are given for birthdays . if you told anyone at the cfa i work at , we would just be like " aw , happy birthday ! that ' ll be  digit . digit . "
   (ID: 17496dcfdb38727f022d155f086be60541019391)

17. good luck . if you get a craving , just do something different . for instance , if i get one in the car , i ' ll change the channel and listen to something else that distracts me . on chantix , the cravings pass pretty quickly , if you have any at all .
   (ID: 5603c8fcb517a4b5745afb8c3f46248974edebe3)

18. i ' ll just grab a full plate and take it to my room everytime we ' re having dinner

19. i used to do this , but several times , not just once , there was someone already in my lane even though i was still partially occupying the left lane . i ' ll wait a few seconds and not get sandwiched between two idiots .
   (ID: 9b41f9c0d7bce732d9af75c3b13bd58e9ce2a1e1)

20. yeah unfortunately essentially every movie ever made has the bad guys line up to get ass kicked problem , almost never do digit bad guys just bum rush the main characters because no matter how good your skills odds are you ' ll die .
