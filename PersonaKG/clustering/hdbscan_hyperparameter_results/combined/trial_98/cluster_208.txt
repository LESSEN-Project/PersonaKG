1. it  s actually insane to me how ppl call tat waiter a creep and suggest op should report him to the restaurant . with the given info the waiter really might have just tried to be as friendly as possible  maybe just really likes kids  has grandchildren himself . he even gave her a desert for free , jesus . just to be stigmatized for being a pedophile , potentially being fired ? op , yta .

3. that ' s not really her goal though , is it ? if westeros was being run by a benevolent ruler , she would still be invading the continent to reclaim the iron throne . she just happens to have lucked out that someone worse than her is currently in power .
