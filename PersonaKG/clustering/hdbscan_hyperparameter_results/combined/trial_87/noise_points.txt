6. you should really be able to deflect bayonet charges like this with a well  timed melee attack . it doesn ' t have to kill the target like it does here , but it should stop the charge and prevent you from dying . it could even work differently across different melee weapons , or only be a feature for certain ones . example being that it ' s much harder to shove aside a bayonet charge with a knife than it is a large club or shovel .

18. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .
