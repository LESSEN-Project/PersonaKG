1. hey it  s good you  ve acknowledged you have a problem ! i don  t think disliking your boyfriends watching porn is inherently a crazy thing but the depths to which it  s making you suffer isn  t normal . do you have any trauma or mental illness history ? things of that nature can influence feelings like this . i know you said you  ve tried therapy but i would give it another go , and or make it a requirement that your bf  s don  t watch porn . some men don  t watch it in the first place

7. One of my favorite things is geoff.
   (ID: 88279b92dca36b3b3c236d960135a2afe2e68b33)

8. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .
   (ID: f7356e924b370675e942b29b9c2184dc895ea5b7)

9. nah the only challenging monster is behemoth and it ' s only because of the weird mechanics . great game don ' t get me wrong on of my top picks of the year , but compared to mhgu that came out on the switch it just doesn ' t hold a candle to the amount of content .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

10. this sounds kinda healthy . i know far too many people who do the opposite and bury themselves in kid issues to the neck and when the kids leave , they have nothing more to talk about and get divorced . if you  re resentful about it , why not say something ?
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

11. One of my favorite things is little girls oingo boingo.

   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

13. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

14. yes . what ' s it like ?
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

15. yea , schools also do a shit job of showing what respect is . if you have to say it , you don ' t have it . pretty sure anyone can get the gist of it after that
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

16. it ' s because they ' re removing anything decent with excuses like ' you ' re post has been removed because it ' s a play on words ' . i assure you non of the many i submitted were a play on words . only total bullshit gets accepted .
   (ID: c9a98f7f4291c6c1eefeeaae838890408881f877)
