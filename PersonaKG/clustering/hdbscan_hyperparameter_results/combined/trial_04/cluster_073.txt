1. as someone else said , you need to go with it . two ways to do it  have a comeback . you said you ' re not good at it , but keep trying to think of some even after the fact . if they ' re falling into patterns with what they ' re saying , you should be able to use one of those . build off one of their digs and take what they said one step further . part of this might all be part of being low man on the totem pole , but you want to show you have some edge so you ' re not always that guy . good luck op .

4. think about your network . can you build one quickly , can you survive without it ? if the answer is no , don ' t go . you are married . how does your husband feel about it ? is your relationship solid enough for long distance . if it works out , what will your husband do for work ? can he transfer ? its your decision , but you are also a team . if he doesn ' t want to leave or can ' t , you may not want to take the job . can your finances handle supporting two households ? if you move to establish the homebase across the country , your husband still needs to maintain the current home . this means a strain on the finances . can you afford it ? do you want to ?

5. yeah people get so weird about it . when i came back after living a few years abroad and be asking my friends how much their casofa  etc cost i  d be greeted by utter awkwardness . i think it  s because in france there is a general hate towards rich people so people don  t want to come across as  wealthy  if they spent a lot on an item .
   (ID: 272bbd1e0746915faf3405ae9c33485b5967ca9f)

   (ID: 6ea82786a74ccdc85dc1fddd809a575aa4e4efcf)

7. . let people do what they want to do unless they are not really harming others . i do not think most of the christians spread hate against the other people . what do you gain if you deny god ?
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

8. yes , you need to tell someone . school nurse might help . but it may come down to child protective services . do you want to be pulled from your home and placed somewhere else ? it could come to that . is it really as bad as you think ?
   (ID: fca46720f9aa154a0559b1e4d2d28cb0df46b00a)

   (ID: 60a31a4071ae4962f2a308822d53a634a3760fa1)

11. definitely nta but your bf is because if he can ' t respect someones boundaries  consent than that says a lot about thew kind of person he is . i really don ' t think you should have kids with this guy and while i don ' t want to get all up in your personal life ' do you really want to be with a guy who doesn ' t understand consent and the meaning of the word no ?
   (ID: 1df1bd07e28c0df73bd865f8cb447d7c8f1bd4d3)

12. well , you could say that about any corporation that i can think of . do you want to get rid of all of them ?
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

13. i think the division is really individual . i believe in a social democratic society which benefits everyone with some laissez  faire social spheres where there  s a general decorum . if a thoroughly studied , evidence based concept can  t be discussed or legislated without fist fights in the street , it  s not worth discussing at all ! but there are tonnes of people who want more autocratic , paternalistic state interventions on both sides of the aisle . i think all of them are crazy as individuals . face  with  tears  of  joy unlike what either extreme believes , becoming insular and being the loudest person in the room doesn  t make them the smartest or the most right .
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)

14. out of interest do you think you should be able to send anything you want to anyone else ? if not where do you draw the line ? i think almost everyone can agree that threats of violence should not be protected under freedom of speech . that said , thank you for offering your take on this , it was very informative .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

15. what is responsible for the existence of our universe . i  m not talking about the big bang , rather i want an answer beyond that . i also wouldn  t accept anything involving a god of some kind . sadly i think this question is deemed to never be answered .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

16. from what i can tell you ' re smart , but you want everyone else to think you ' re an idiot
   (ID: f0cc6658fb97955562b5f1b7845c6141dd2eefdf)

   (ID: 02e801249875692d61023bbfbc79d7ff34c9eddf)

19. i qas born in ' digit and i think it was a good thing to grow up not having the electronic distractions . i think as adults when we say i want to give my kids what i never had they don ' t build that character trait you value in yourself .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)
