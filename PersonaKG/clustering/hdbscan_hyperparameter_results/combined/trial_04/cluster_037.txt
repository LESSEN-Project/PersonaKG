1. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .

   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

6. i  m loving it but it  s not for everyone . d2 is really a game that you have to realize that if you get hooked you  ll be playing it until it either dies or d3 comes out . i  m having crazy amounts of fun on pc . my friends and i have created a clan and been running strikes and stuff like that . the entertainment is subjective but it  s much more fun with friends .
   (ID: 2657c8854c93e48c0bab9764c7904833e823cac9)

7. but to act like by being born you ' re entitled to anything more than life is something i ' ll argue about all day . . unless you ' re rich .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

8. there was a mom in michigan whos kids starved to death because she said they wouldnt eat what she made for them . the old adage " they ' ll eat when they ' re hungry " isn ' t true for all kids . it doesn ' t mean they jave autism , either . doesnt mean you have to give into junk , but they should at least have milk or vitamin shake . kids usually like those . sustenance is important for kids especially .
   (ID: d8014467041b98317d9f1dec2b0dae4ff9405b91)

9. see it ' s hard to describe , but he ' s not one who likes to get embarrassed because he gets super upset and angry . he totally lashes out , so i figured with an instance such as this , maybe wait for him to come to me ? or is that the same as like we ' ll basically never talk about it ?
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

10. it ' s sounds like my well executed life plan . we may not get there the same way as everyone else , but we ' ll have some interesting stories about the journey .
   (ID: f7713e4cd0a5245097f9f45a1194222bda369b48)

11. are you somewhere weed is not totally legal ? if so , i would say mailing joints would be an unnecessary risk . i suggest you give them to a stranger that looks like he smokes weed and maybe you ' ll make a new friend .
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

12. as a child , i suffered a lot from ear infections and as a result i had these drainage tubes which meant that water at the time was a big no . even though that ' s a thing of the past now , my ears are still quite sensitive when it comes to pressure and i would very much like to avoid experiencing what the girl from your scuba class had to go through . i guess i ' ll have to stick to snorkeling .

13. they ' ll still be learning to drive like everyone else , age and skill mean nothing
   (ID: b29114e3d39ee1086f5eb2abbe6cbec33bc7749f)

14. you  re right . if you look at what i said you  ll see i was trying to explain that chickens produce and expel eggs like humans , not that they were the same . obviously i didn  t do a very good job !
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

15. you need to find the right shampoo that ' s important . i generally liked aussie . a lotta girls like dove . invest in conditioner . now i ' ll tell you a secret . there ' s a bottle of anti static spray . its blue bottle with a women in a skirt spraying the skirt . i always use that before i brush . but i ' ll warn you , who knows what ' s in it , it ' s most likely flammable but your brush will have next to zero resistance
