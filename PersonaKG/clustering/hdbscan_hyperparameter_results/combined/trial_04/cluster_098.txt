   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

11. i highly recommend getting the nathan drake collection for ps4 that has the first digit games on it . you can decide for yourself which is your favorite but they all have a lot of great moments and it ' s worth playing from the start just to see how nate  elena met .
   (ID: a18adc4ad3b28b34dfa3063a1c77566b8681a79d)

   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

   (ID: d42f47f147cdc8e97117f0e4963e2c1309d1dcd8)

15. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

16. nothing really . i was allowed to watch just about whatever and even if i was told not to , i would watch it anyway . i understood things a lot sooner than most kids as a result .

   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)
