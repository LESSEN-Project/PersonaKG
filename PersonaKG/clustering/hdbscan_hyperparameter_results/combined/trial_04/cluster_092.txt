1. twas a joke my man seriously speaking , that ' s just the way the world is right now . i ' d say every human being that is breathing right know is depressed , but on different levels and degrees . teenagers are a fucking mess . it ' s not weird for thing like these to happen
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

2. i don ' t even know what to say , like do you drink wine and read books all day explain please cause being in france on holiday and try to get someone to speak english is impossible just because they refuse it ? i myself prefer the very down to earth , high all day on herbs  tea mess around with chemicals dutch lifestyle .

3. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them

4. yeah i get what you ' re talking about that ' s just how it goes . theres actually a commendation if you can capture all the control points and hold them at the same time , you can also fast travel to main missions , i know it sucks and i get what you mean it ' s annoying to run ecerywhere . i dont remember if you can do it at wt2 , but theres usually little " activites " close to the control points like a propaganda broadcast , or a hostage situation or whatever and if you go do those before the control point it will raise the alert level of the control point which in turn gives you better stuff and gives you a chance to unlock other mods .

5. not everyone is created equally , that includes the mind . it  s just very sad , above everything else . you never really know what it  s like to have another person  s experience of life .
   (ID: 76442d997e7f64c10223aeac0f4ff8af70ff9dde)

6. a legitimate reason like that i can totally understand . i even understand the reason why some people have their dog ' s dew claws removed . but i know many people who do it " just because " or to make the dog look more intimidating . selfish reasons like that i don ' t agree with . if it ' s for the health and safety of the dog , i can be onboard with it .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

7. smoke . it ' s the weirdest habit and stupidly tough to quit . i know i just sound like a boring moaning guy but i always tell kids to never start it . don ' t even try it . after digit years of being a smoker it took a lot of effort to cut it out .
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

8. great question and i honestly dont have an answer for you . it can ' t be just feminity because the women i like , and the woman i married , are tall basketball player types . so . i dont know . just is what it is , i guess .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

9. i completely understand . i just imagine my inner meaner as something ridiculous or someone i disrespect  don ' t like so i can tell it as sassily as possible to shut up . sometimes goals take time . its important to remember that no matter how smol the steps are , you are taking them one day at a time , and it should be celebrated . you will get there ! i know it ! just hug your stuffies and dream big lovely  digit

10. if you know that he ' s not okay with it , why do you still cheat in a game with him then ? like it just sounds like you ' re asking for it .
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

11. i can  t be the only one who wants to know who the hell they ate and also does anybody actually like this crap or is this just a huge troll

12. this might just be my experience , but with the younger crowd , jazz has really lost its seductive luster and now just sounds like you ' re trying way too hard to be suave . i don ' t know your situation and i ' m sorry i don ' t have any suggestions , but yeah , jazz sadly doesn ' t wet panties like it used to .

13. hell yea lol . i bought some care for digit and it looked absolutely perfect but the check engine light was on and i asked the guy about it and he said it just needed spark plugs replaced . so of course i was like hell yea , that  s not too bad . and after a month the tranny went out digit dollar fix and then digit months later engine was shaking uncontrollably and i took it to the mechanic and they said it was a cracked head gasket . shit like this happens . there are so many scammers out there and i don  t even know how the hell they fix it up to last well for like a week lol . but it happens . i cried my eyes out cause i was struggling for money and i needed a car so badly i just jump on it . don  t beat yourself up to hard about it . sometimes unlucky stuff like this happens . next time remember to   ask for a car fax  bring a mechanic  bring an ob2 scanner  literally type into youtube  what to look out for when buying a used car  or something similar .  take your time looking . good luck op . and just remember to learn from this mistake .

14. i ' m anxious too and that would bring me super down . are those guys average looking or extra attractive ? it seems like a lot of work to have someone come over for sex and do an oh hell no rather than just getting off . not that that ' s a good thing per se but at least you wouldn ' t know . i ' d try and give you my honest opinion but i might be too nice to do so .
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

15. luckily i haven ' t , and i pray that day never comes . just like my other " gun , " i don ' t pull it out unless i know i ' m gonna use it .
   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

16. you might like bros4bros . com or gayxchange . com i can ' t say that these are digit  chat , because people just looking for a cheap hookup tend to infiltrate any site that will let them and i haven ' t found a site yet that blocks those kind of people . i wouldn ' t know how they could do it either .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

17. hate is such a strong word . let ' s say i just don ' t know you well enough to say i like you .
   (ID: 3de4b885645ecd39fdcb6a1daf410341eb118d2c)

18. sorry but i know nothing about modding . do rtdl emulations exist already ? and if so are they laggy like you said ? or is it just laggy when trying to mod ? anyway , keep up the cool work !
   (ID: 1cd062f77c729b2cea6d91996a2f94b1f5226415)

19. yeah it was very quick but this one was pretty painful . but once you start you have to keep going so just persisted with the pain . they told me they were putting the power up but that was it . nothing to say that there was a chance of burning or damage like i experienced . my brother was telling me to try and push for damages but i would be happy with just my money back . i don ' t know if i ' m looking at this the wrong way regarding the damage that has been done .
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

20. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .
