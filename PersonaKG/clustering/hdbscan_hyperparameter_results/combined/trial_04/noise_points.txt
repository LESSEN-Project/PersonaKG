1. i want to say youre just making it up for the post , but you dont throw something like that out there without having actually put some serious thought into it before
   (ID: 0c93ab3ec35cab16ded3445fcca7b6045c1dd147)

2. a lot of girls and guys have their  list  of celebrities they would sleep with . most people know it  s never going to happen , so it seems harmless enough . she was trying to get you to play the game too , so it doesn  t sound like she meant to hurt you . if it  s something that really bothers you , tell her about it . i think it  s admirable that you want to be the best version of yourself for her . maybe use it as an opportunity to ask her what characteristics make her attracted to those people and whether she would like it if you had those characteristics . she  ll likely say no because it sounds like she loves you exactly the way you are and you should never feel pressured to change for anyone .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

3. i was thinking about that when i ' m finally old enough . i want to move out of the us and to canada or at least far away from my family .
   (ID: 825a08e404a7e2db2fd9fc73052f89b0d2f148bb)

4. i feel the same about reyn , i like riki he acts like you would expect from a nopon but reyn has just as much out of place lines as riki if not more . i know he is the best friend and everything but how can he be so stupid considering who he hangs out with . reyn and riki are both comic relief characters but i think riki has more depth . and i think riki would be far less hated if reyn had just kept his big mouth shut in riki ' s early cutscenes . reyn also has the least interesting heart to hearts with a few exceptions while riki has some of the most heartwarming . his voice might be a little grating to listen to but that is just the best any western could have done sounding ' childish ' without having an actual child or a woman doing it .
   (ID: 2e2a44cdfc726423ec202a2fe420543af441d1ad)

5. so now i can tell all crossfitters at my gym to stop give other people advice . what is up with that ! everytime even my boss who is a crossfit guru or something like that tells me what to eat , that i need to join him and hog all the playground equipment from children . i said kindly no sir !
   (ID: 14bd1366b004b74cfd8c9cb269849740d12cff80)

6. dude , seriously , get over yourself ! i  m so sorry that i didn  t phrase my original comment to be  this specific man is really something else . just this one ! all the rest of em are ok !  like fuck off , men do stuff like this all . the . time . so stop caring about being generalized and go actually try for some positive change since youre not one of those guys .
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

7. set it at a temperature where the majority of the office staff are comfortable . it doesn ' t have to be about man vs woman . it ' s time to stop defaulting yourself to be the oppressed sex .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

8. is there anything i could do or say to her that would make it easier without it being too weird . we have only gone out once and i feel like asking her how she feels about me leaving would be too soon right now . like i should try and take her out again and see how it goes ?
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

16. i would like to lock my door , but i don ' t for this very reason . if i slip and fall and need assistance , i would like it sooner rather than later .
   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

17. yeah , this is sorta what my mom believes , and what i believed i guess , but not so much the " greater reward " thing . it ' s true they use language like that , but a lot of christians who would basically believe this tend to get pretty fuzzy with whether some people will be any happier than others , usually saying no they won ' t , everyone will be equally happy if they are saved and spending eternity in the presence of god . my mom believes god could heal me , and that i should never stop seeking to be healed , but she could believe that a person might never be healed of same sex attraction , just like she believes for any ailment . you pray to be healed even until you die , and if it never happens , that doesn ' t mean you weren ' t sick . i figure though that being gay and in loving relationships looks pretty nice and healthy . but also , some straight people believe they could choose to be gay , that they just aren ' t . some people i suppose i might guess they ' re bi , but who knows ? say they have experienced same sex attraction , and then rejected it to pursue an opposite sex relationship . i think there ' s pretty clear evidence that people who experience same sex attraction can ' t really stop it , but i think it might be possible for some people to grow a certain kind of attraction . i say that mostly out of personal experience . i was never in conversion therapy , but i did try my best to like girls , and in my mind , as good of a christian as i was , that meant training myself to get off to porn of girls . not successful , but now vaginas are pretty ok to me , so it didn ' t do nothing . i feel like my attraction to girls sometimes gets as high as digit  what it is to guys . which is more than before .

18. dude right ? most bees don ' t want anything to do with you along with a lot of other creepy crawlies you find and they won ' t bother you if you don ' t fuck with them . trap it in a cup and put it outside , that ' s probably where it wants to be anyways .
   (ID: 2e34fbd58bc49726f7e8c74b8ea82513ca226ab4)

19. it ' s not only russians . there are a lot of groups like albanians , servians etc . that are portrayed as villains and that is because it is known that there are mafia groups in those countries .
