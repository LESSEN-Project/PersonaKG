1. i was just talking to my therapist about this . when you have the ability to do this and still get a ' s , it makes it hard to even be proud of the work you did . because it was so " easy " , and you receive high marks , it feels like false praise . it ' s a totally weird feeling . best of luck to you .

5. what do you mean by  backward  do you mean developing country because of so than this comparison wouldn  t make sense . also if you mean hostile country then your comparison also wouldn  t work because the british and french before the outbreak of ww2 were like  hey germany let  s just settle down now okay like you can take that but no more  and how did that work out ?

6. but then you would just get people complaining about " waaa why don ' t you tell us how you are fixing the tracker , what are you doing about rural areas , what did you have for lunch " like we do now . that simple tweet would not appease anyone .

7. we must not be talking about the same deku . why does he like bakugo ? they are childhood friends . too unrealistic ? you can believe that a dude ' s sweat can cause explosion but having deku be too forgiving is unrealistic , yeah ok . risking his life to save other ' s ? bro did you not see episode digit , " my body just moved ? deku at his core puts others before himself , thats the reason why all might chose him .   x200b
