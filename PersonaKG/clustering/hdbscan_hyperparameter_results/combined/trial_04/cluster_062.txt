1. depends on how old you were when he left . if you are digit now then he probably couldn ' t handle the responsibility of being a dad , which isn ' t your fault . if you are digit , then you were probably a temper  tantrum tornado of tumultuous temperament resulting in your dad saying " fuck this " , which is just a little bit your fault . the bright side being you ' ve survived digit years without him , so there ' s that .
   (ID: 306fcce176e83db604dac17838eed1e669cd5a90)

2. i ' ve noticed a couple people pulling more dps but for the most part hasnt made a huge stink . i play a prot warrior and i was expecting alot of change due to the rage nerf but im just as tanky as ever . just made me change the way i play to be more patient .
   (ID: 45768598053a5b3cdf1e6e286b99114b7acf5f3c)

3. you could ' ve just made it into multiple pannels , that would have made it easier to read
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

4. rip but that  s okay , my advice is have a look into some business . not school business but just start making something and selling it . i am now digit and when i was digit i managed to make myself  digit within a year making and selling protein balls . i  ve only stopped since cause i paralysed myself and been busy and exhausted to do it .
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

5. i ' ve heard it helps to start cleaning up something small , and then grow from that . even if it ' s just putting a fork into a drawer , it ' s important to start somewhere .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

6. wow thanks for this review ! i  ve been dying to get my hands on this bag but am trying to be less impulsive as part of my new years resolution weary  face i just messaged her and am planning to put an order in . i saw you took a digit  digit point off for the g being wrong . what exactly is wrong with it if you don  t mind me asking ? i don  t see anything sticking as bad , but it  s probably just my inexperienced eyes that i  m missing something !
   (ID: 8d5aac58a9c3a7e883f9e90df39dc5ab7c36de53)

7. i gotta be honest , i ' ve spent way too much time on this on the past and mentally still assumed it ' s digit in digit odds . somehow i always just overlook the assumption that the host will always open a door with a goat behind . guess just my own fault for overlooking that detail
   (ID: 1cf567904675ac1ca7b5a90612e5479a5b6c9bef)

8. answered just the way it was asked . mom ' s been on different kinds of shit for awhile . last i heard she picked up a meth habit since my brother is out of the house now . i ' ve been no contact with the family .
   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

9. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

10. " not unconventional " doesn ' t make sense , and no it ' s not strange to wear plain clothes but it ' s just hard to believe that every single item of clothing you have ever bought is digit never had a logo , brand name or been designer of some sort and digit you ' ve never been asked by anyone you ' ve ever come in contact with where you have bought your clothes from .
   (ID: d45001f1fdd37cda488cfddffabec23e83ee7b7e)

11. thank you for the response , i  ve been considering whether she  s really worth keeping around anyways . it  s just so hard to cut out someone who you  ve known your whole life .
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

12. here ' s another sv650 fan jumping in . bought my first sv650s after digit years of riding . best bike i ever owned in the " what a hoot to ride " category . i ' ve since had two more and an sv1000 which , while far more capable in most respects , just doesn ' t have the same just plain fun to ride character .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

13. i  ve been engineering for years and it still happens every now and then . you just realize it faster . this is how you learn .
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

14. i try to do the accents from whatever tv show i ' m watching . i ' ve just watched true blood so i ' ve been mixing in the occasional deep south phrase now and then
   (ID: 5dc1e0203cb86a245c4ede5cb73923b295b1fdc8)

15. what i personally am afraid of are the open statements that mail won ' t be integrated any more . i ' ve never been a heavy e  mailer , but found out about the integrated mail and feed client around version digit and began using it just for the sake of convenience . it has been just fine as an integrated client , but as a stand  alone one is a big joke compared to thunderbird , for example .
   (ID: 32520dc340c18ed101e3d5ea02b3a7bca25dcc29)

16. my son and i have been talking about a lego harry potter night ! you ' ve just motivated us to make it happen this weekend !
   (ID: 1b15fd08311192b471933a314f66dc758a923c02)

17. everything might just be a creation of man . man put god into a book , man creates more men to be slaves to work for him . and the whole world is ruled by men who control these slaves that believe in a god that was created by another man ? does it make sense ? i  ve had a beer or so , and it  s about a beer before bed , so that  s what time it is
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

18. most guys just go for it . if your super uneasy you can ask her first . i ' ve been asked before , it ' s not a total killer either . don ' t worry if it ' s not perfect !
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

19. my girlfriend and i drive about digit or digit hours every weekend . we both play pretty casually i ' ve been playing since release and am just now getting close to i . rex . still great fun to just drive and get dna . even if college demands that we can ' t do it often .
   (ID: 3158d7c63f10e871a80f147fb47725c8714163c7)

20. not that i ' ve ever heard , this is just bizarre . it could just be an excuse to leave faster , if they don ' t get along  he doesn ' t get along with your brother . sounds super weird .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)
