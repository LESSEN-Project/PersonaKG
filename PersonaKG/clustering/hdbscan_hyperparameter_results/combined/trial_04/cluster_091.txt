   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

   (ID: 54920691b1e05863de734f0444f66749700c4331)

10. it sounds to me like you should be talking to a lawyer instead of asking the internet . you make one google about a cough and before you know it google says you have aids . don  t expect any different . at least i gave you ideal advice .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

11. i always wondered why people like you feel the need to be dicks on the internet . is it because in real life you  re pushovers who don  t know how to earn respect or stand up for your selves ? is this your outlet ?
   (ID: 05bc4f6f6f6bb573d85181292f88efbd50c59547)

12. i agree that she ' s dropping hints . next time she brings it up say something like " why in the world does anyone get married ? the details are mind numbing ! i can ' t imagine putting myself through that . big sigh . i don ' t know how you ' re managing to deal with all this . let ' s go to a movie or something because this is seriously depressing me . "
   (ID: 1293e72aa7301baf0ecb3a2509e46cdcca834cd9)

   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

14. i ' m afraid that i really know nothing about the industry , except as a watcher . it seems like netflix is growing and is vastly expanding its home  grown content , so going that route would certainly be a valid one . best of luck !

15. how does the caption generator work ?  know police serve you with very high iq , kids . that sounds like a botched attempt to give me useful advice .
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

16. waaaaaaay too many blockbusters i know daredevil isn ' t a part of the cinematic universe , but it was much better than any of the movies minus the fillers and plot holes it didn ' t follow the same formula of intro , blah , blah , and buildup to the cgi fight scene at the end , yay everyone ' s happy now . it had depth . it had enough time to explore both the hero and the villian . i felt like if mcu took a page out of the netflix book , they ' d be a little better off . i don ' t understand how people are still so impressed by the same cgi anymore . it ' s gotten bland . also , the action was very organic .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

17. if you ever find that  feel good  character let me know . i would like to try them for myself

18. you can get the back embroidered to say " proud dad " or " best father " or something like that to avoid anyone getting butthurt on him having it . the nex can do it or a shop in town . if you know any prs they may be okay with doing the embroidery for you .
   (ID: 7632dd7ebcb664bfada5fff420a436f42e3721d5)

19. that can ' t be healthy . yeah my friends are literally the reason i even know of furries because their the ones that told me about them in the first place . now of course it wasn ' t good stuff but i gradually started to like them from my one sided mind .
   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

20. i do this , because it occurred to me one day to save the electricity . wife says it ' s weird every time she walks into the bathroom during my shower . it ' s not like i don ' t know where my body parts are .
