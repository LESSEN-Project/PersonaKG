Total from this dataset: 27

1. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

2. merch is not a fanbase , but again my point about the underlying story has to make some sense to you . also america is obsessed with junk media , not all but the majority pushes this fanbase towards fringe . i apologise to those who didn ' t get that . if you have ever looked at tik tok or whatever for more than digit minutes you are probably going to still be offended . also just being extra anal , those two stores do nothing but by merch for new games so i would be curious how well kh sells compared to something for scale . i ' m not doubting it did well , just curious .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

3. saw dogs getting killed for food . it wasn ' t even an ethical kind of kill , they just beat the dogs until they stopped whining . the dogs did even fight back btw , it ' s also on youtube
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

4. makes sense . just funny how all ' s i did was make an observation which is most likely correct and instead of either acknowledging it , or moving on , they have to be so salty for some reason .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

5. " alex what the fuck are you doing " " did you just cum in your sister  " " tiffany is not on birth control " " lexi do you ever shut the fuck up " " they ' re just kids "
   (ID: db1ffea2a957f19bfc0fffdbd89a6d65be91fd5c)

6. i ' m really sorry if this actually did occur , but it ' s just too thathappened for me to believe this . this reminds me too much of the stuff deviantarters with mary  sues post about their characters . maybe it ' s the format . maybe it ' s the fact their dialogue is just so basic this it pretty farfetched
   (ID: 28e24cb71e2c0068fef35890d39022b686e4215d)

7. i just had three days off ! i visited my grandparents , met with a friend for coffee , did some baking , cleaned the house and played an unreasonable amount of stardew valley
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

8. you might have seen this thing where people link theydidthemonstermath after someone links theydidthemath , as in , " they did the mash  they did the monster mash " the song idk why everyone ' s downvoting , maybe they just dont have a sense of humor
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

9. most of the time the  sass  is unintentional and  talking back  is often just asking for clarification about what i actually did wrong and trying to explain my point of view .
   (ID: fa9acab3fbd86b1f64e6380ef31b49912dae0c74)

10. why did you take the time to question it ? were you genuinely curious or were you just complaining  either to degrade me or for the attention of strangers ?
   (ID: eab4b13c25e8e05018f7cb7159b0e36614341438)

11. well here is where you went wrong . you jumped into water with sharks ! what else did you expect ? these arent dogs , cats , or any other animal human have domesticated . this shouldn ' t be news , just a reminder if you take a risk expect to get bit .
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

12. depends how fresh . if it just happened , you say sorry and then might wanna give them space to process whatever it is you did .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

13. this is enlightened . complaining is not the same as soliciting advice . so often a child ' s minor complaint about something gets a response telling them what they did wrong , just making the kid feel bad .
   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

14. what the hell happened to jeff ' s face ? did he get plastic surgery or is it just extra make up ?
   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

15. well you just did it , how does it feel ?
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

16. why did you delete your post ? why are you doing the exact same thing you just called the op out for ?
   (ID: a4eb94a9fe8ebabb780c319cc7d3f552eb79625e)

17. did anyone else read in their head the way i just did ?
   (ID: 7c7d6a809e77ab08fc65ee63a1ab44c11bd6ab7f)

18. those " weird looks " are just how wizards look at each other , jackass , which you would have known if you were a real wizard ! the important science question here is how did a fake wizard ever end up with a real princess ?
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

19. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

20. lol what , did it take you the full digit hours to come up with that shit spray ? you couldn ' t be more wrong about everything you just slammed your ass on the keys to write out . what a waste of my time reading such garbage .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)
