1. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .
   (ID: 4422c1db26c9be5bec35694a448a490c2761d985)

2. so you pointing out that it ' s about race and gender implying that you want it to be true just because she is a woman and an african please provide a valid counter argument or fuck off with your faminazi sentimentality .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

3. for the most part , you have the freedom to go or do whatever you want . whereas , in a relationship , you have not just yourself but your so to consider . as far as what ' s the worst thing in relationships ? that ' s more or so subjective . everyone will tell you something different .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

4. no . you ' re not the only one . my manager does this . every time i ' m standing at the computer putting someone ' s order in , he will stand directly over me and just watch . i kind of want to turn around and just say " uh . do you mind ? " . its quite infuriating for me . it makes me forget what i ' m trying to put in . it makes me feel rushed , even though if he wasn ' t stabding there i would probably zip through it faster . i don ' t feel judged because i could literally care less if he is because i ' m not doing anything wrong . hes just a micromanager and has to control everything to a t . kind of actually makes me feel bad for him because i watch him get overly frustrated because he has issues letting go . ha end rant .
   (ID: 9981a65782780477b53d712e936b6997a4092240)

5. she doesn ' t pick out any of my outfits digit . digit  of the time . she just hates how masculine i dress and i don ' t want any thanksgiving drama .
   (ID: 7e58269155b84bc057025d5066e661ba2eb934ba)

6. just quit . they don ' t own you , you can do whatever you want with your life . i can understand you may have a tough time with her personality , so just simply send an email or write a note and attach it to your timecard or whatever , and simply say you are giving your two weeks notice as you have been given an opportunity to do something new and exciting in your life . thank  you and good  bye !

7. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

8. i just don ' t understand why anyone would want that instead of physical keys
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

9. yes it use to help all but it no longer does . i don ' t want to call out any vendors but i wonder if i ' m just getting lower quality kratom . i just to get a nice rush of energy and non of my pain i could feel .
   (ID: a2ca7f9e05e83928ce894848f01290dbcd0f654e)

10. if it was easy op wouldn ' t ask for a quality of life change qol suggestions aren ' t limited to being difficult , in fact most of them i see are purely because the current version is annoying . stop trying to argue against qol suggestion with skill cap complaints , literally everything in the game can be considered part of the skill cap . e . g . why show a number for gold when you can just see if there ' s a gold rim around the item you want , why show health  mana numbers when you can just look at the bar , why show health  mana at all when you can just calculate how much health your hero has at each level with each item then calculate mathematically the damage after reductions of each enemy spells as they happen . my point is that skill complaints are nonconstructive criticism and just plainly bad arguments .

11. haha it was a one time thing via tinder so i don ' t have it , but i would suggest you just be upfront and say you want that to happen .
   (ID: c6e395c03fa0151554baed67a84968066bfa9cf3)

12. for my wifi to work on both christmas eve and christmas . they are the two days i don ' t do any work at all and just want to veg and play playstation and watch tv .
   (ID: 2ce8587266f0888bb10672ccf8a7be1bc6c3f0d2)

13. depends on what your needs are . if you just want a hole to dump cum in , then yeah , a sex doll will work okay . if you want anything else , then probably not .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

14. she gave both of them the exact same treatment and even tried to get him to hang out at a different time . how is that playing favourites ? he doesn  t get to kick someone out of the friend group just because he  s not comfy around them anymore . everyone else is still friends with her . it doesn  t matter that he was around first , she  s here now and has just as much right to have friends as he does . it sucks that he missed out on game night because he didn  t want to see her , but that  s his problem , not op  s .
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

15. some woman supposedly .  i  m not saying this didn  t happen but fuck me . you won  t listen to the fucking fbi but this is a credible source for you ? at what point will you realize that you just hear what you want to hear .
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

16. mosquitoes . they cause the most human deaths compared to any other living thing . seriously , whenever i see one flying around , whether it ' s minding its own business or looking for a midnight snack , i get my zapper and dart to the other side of the room . i ' m literally fine with a spider , i even held a jumping spider to put it outside , with my bare hands ! but i can ' t even look at a mosquito without trying to reach for my zapper . i just realized that i made this a confession . sorry to those who didn ' t want to hear that .
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

17. your lie my dude . tell it how you want . over here in reality though this game needs a story to compliment the season or we  re just left with grinding weapons that will eventually get infused into something else .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

18. no , not just free stuff . you want to force the wealthy to work for free for you .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

19. what do you want ? answer that first even just to yourself and then it will be clearer what you should do . i want hugh jackman to come over to my house and rub me with oil and roger me senseless . i can want all i want  nothing wrong with wanting . it is just that what we want is not always going to happen .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

20. nsfw ! this post is definitely nsfw , just want to give everyone a heads up ! i just have to write a bunch of cramp so that the automate raptor doesn ' t just kill my comment because all i wrote was " nsfw . so , again  risky click at work , folks .
