1. kind of . i don  t remember it being like that when i used to be prescribed adderal in my younger years . they said it  s required by law for me to visit that often if i am prescribed now . just wondering if it  s an actual law i  m sure it is but i haven  t heard of it before ?

2. brecci was good though , this isn ' t . i wasn ' t saying it was the remington , it ' s the only comparable in one shot kill type of way . it ' s bad when i ' d rather use fists in half the gun fights tbh . and the sg12 isn ' t garbage unless you can ' t click the trigger more than two times . any average player can use the gun like any other , sure it ' s no saug , but it ' s still way better than the mog12 . it ' s just depressing .

3. pretty sure it  s the caliber of person . for example , you have couples like evelin and justin who have just a tiny bit of drama but really get along with each other well and seem low key . the producers don  t have to make these people seem like drama obsessed idiots , they come prepackaged that way lol .

6. not sure about canada , but it ' s illegal in the u . s . normally this would be handled through the department of labor here . the questions you have to answer are these  is this something that happens repeatedly or just this once ? if not repeatedly , are you a model employee ? can they find a reason other than this to terminate you ? if you have gone to the top of the food chain trying to get paid for that digit minutes and were unable to , and it ' s a single occurrence , and for the most part , you like working there , is it worth it to pursue ?

7. well if you knew exactly which neurons were responsible you could trace the signal to the exact nerves where the " signals for consiousness originate . that then narrows down the work significantly , then all you have to do is make sure the nerves pass the 40mv point  and i feel like we have many ways we could do that . i mean it just inhibiting electricity right ?

8. google anything you are not sure about , every little thing . digit  of the time you find the answer . it seems like common sense but most people never do it .

9. every day , i find someone that has money , and make them give it to me . stand in line behind someone at the atm and make them give me the money they just took out . hang around at a casino and wait for someone to win big then make them give me their chips . stuff like that . and make sure that it ' s somewhere that has video cameras . i can make them say something like " here man , you take this " " seriously " " yeah , just pay it forward . and then if they try to take it back , i have video evidence that i didn ' t steal it .
