1. its was my first one too , so i recommend you jojo ' s bizarre adventure , mob psycho digit and overlord . jojo ' s is a must have for anime fans . just watch it even if the first episodes are more or less bad . if you liked one punch man you will also like mob . that all i want to say to that . try overlord if you want something new .

3. maybe try to subtly come off that you really want this job , but not like you just want the money , more like it ' s your dream to work there and that you ' re willing to do almost anything to work there .

4. honestly i could make the value whatever i want it to be since air is just floating out there and has no production cost . but i feel like i could single handedly crash the economy by charging people for every breath

6. no offence taken , it ' s not just about the pvp , it ' s also about farming , which is fine if that ' s how others want to play . i was of the understanding that fw was about conflict and dominating the enemy , this can be pretty hard if the enemy just warps off when i turn up , if you ' re at ' war ' then be at ' war ' . i can understand why these ideas may not be for you in particular , but maybe , just maybe , a lot of others may be just as frustrated as me and actually want to have some gf ' s . i like different points of view as sometimes brilliant ideas can evolve , how  what would you like to see done to improve fw ?

7. we don ' t want to stop killing each other , we just want to look like we care about people while killing them .

8. i ' m talking about people who aren ' t being harmful to anyone at pride . the man pictured above is just trying to participate in pride like a normal human being . whatever his job is shouldn ' t matterunless it was meant to cause harm , which it isn ' t . he just wants to have fun and celebrate pride month with his fellow gays . by commenting this it seems like you want to keep this gay man from being happy , and that is homophobic . good day .

11. i can ' t stand instagram however i don ' t like the people who use the site , you do you , if you want to use that cesspool of garbage , that ' s fine . the reasons i strongly dislike instagram , is particularly because it is made by the owners of facebook . i ' m not saying reddit is superior , or anything like that it is just because of the history of facebook , history of anti vax users . i
