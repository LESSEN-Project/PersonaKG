1. the main flaw i see with many answers is threefold . negotiating will be difficult when you don  t know the language . even shakespearean english could be a rough adjustment . depending on whom you are negotiating with , they may just take it . and , if you bring back something that appears too shocking , threatening or evil , you might meet your maker rather quickly .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

2. sorry , you incriminate the christians . i won ' t start a butthurt polemic , but some may find that offensive . i know you are just kidding and you posted it in funny . have a good day
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

3. yo dude , you need to talk to that manager and just say exactly this . since the position was open directly for you , they know that you are a good worker or else it wouldn ' t have been worth their time .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

4. i dont know if this is cheating since the official album version has vocals , but the anthology version of " eleanor rigby " with just the orchestra is amazing . better than revolver ' s version imo
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

5. noobmaster , hey it  s thor again . you know , the god of thunder ? listen buddy , if you don  t log off this game immediately i will fly over to your house , and come down to that basement your hiding in and rip off your arms and shove them up your butt ! oh , that  s right , yea just go cry to your father you little weasel .
   (ID: 77a6bff8693a174b55d34fc32fdd8a87710fecb7)

6. youre probably just paranoid . you dont even notice the mistakes you make . going to the same position each round , doing something " obvious " . most of the time you dont even need to know where someone is cus its obvious . if you face a wallhacker you can still outaim him . however if the guy has an aimbot it doesnt matter if he sees you or not . he just holds down lmb and you die
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

7. it ' s not a odd question at all . it ' s a legitimate question that everyone asks . you know i don ' t really remember honestly . lol so i ' m just gonna say it didn ' t hurt all that much .
   (ID: deb51648159c9d9d915a701d8f77ac885a29b9b4)

8. tpms are horrible , especially in the cold . best bet is to look at the tires and if it doesn  t look flat , it  s not . it  s just a cash grab against people who don  t know how a normal tire looks
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

9. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

10. ummm . wow ! it wasn ' t the nazis who built that wall . yikes ! i correct my previous statement , you should have just learned history ! that was not such a wall , that was to keep people in . much easier to do if the gov ' t kills anyone you know if you escape . kind of puts a damper on escapes and the ability to plan them with others .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

11. i didn ' t imply that , you inferred that very incorrectly i might add . all i said was they matter , and you twisted my statement around to make it something it ' s not . you really don ' t know how mental illness works , do you ? tell a suicidal person to just buck up and see what happens . most likely , it ' s not gonna do a damn thing for them .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

12. i know it  s not just handed out because i  m one
   (ID: a778c9b10000a3e15377e87997ef5bea46cfe33f)

13. please karen just one weekend with the kids . hey wait there ' s someone at the door . wait , you sent the cops over here ? why , you know im clean ? you ' re trying to get me arrested ? why , so you can keep the kids ? why karen , why ?
   (ID: b62d2865206257ab4ea65a5e489f9d4e1c8d5e9b)

14. quietly letting customers know they can save some money by paying me cash in hand rather than paying me the full quoted amount and receive a pointless invoice on their email . just occasionally , of course !
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

15. if someone  s tailgating you , just get out of the way if you can . stopping hard and flipping them off is only gonna make them angrier . if you can  t get out of the way , learn to properly brake check . you  re supposed to lightly tap on your brake , so that you don  t decelerate but your brake lights come on , letting them know they  re too close . if all else fails and they persist in riding your ass and possibly following you , then i  d say it  s okay to stop short . just brace yourself for a possible hit and a lot of yelling afterwards .
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

16. ah i see , so the actual answer is nothing to do with circumcision , it ' s about hygiene . okay then . you should find yourself a hygienic male . i can confirm , having never had dick cheese myself because i know how to operate a shower , that it is just fine .
   (ID: b42bcbaed0ea1f011b4d8c42d4ad9df732ecc5d5)

17. a lady done this for me one time flying to london and i couldn ' t thank her enough . i hate flying but i know it ' s something that just has to be done to get places .
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

18. wow . you really know how to kill a vibe , my guy . oh well . i should have known just by the look on your face .  rip
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

19. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

20. if you ' re doing it once a week , that ' s a habbit in it of it ' s own . now i don ' t know how it will affect your brain . i would just warn you about addiction . it ' s a slippery slope .
