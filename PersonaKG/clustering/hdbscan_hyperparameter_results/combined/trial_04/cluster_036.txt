   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

2. my first attempt with these two characters i  ll gladly link you to when i get to my computer , it  s not nearly as good as this one i think but i  m glad you appreciated it ! bob and ervin are pretty much gonna be regulars around here now !
   (ID: 9f681f3dedb4dcecbe41b42dada5f72caae05ebe)

   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

5. but those digit characters are unlikable and very annoying . i think it ' s gonna be jay . the guy is pretty old and they might end it with him on his deathbed . he ' ll say a few words to each of the family members , everyone cries , fade to black .
   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

6. another good strategy is to have foreknowledge of whether or not they say " shoot " at the end of the phrase , and then do the opposite of what they do to disrupt the round to give them more time to think , and generally they ' ll not choose rock since they had to think for a longer period of time , and will digit  of the time choose scissor , allowing you to choose rock and beat them .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

7. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

8. i think it ' s because half the time you keep talking to the wrong end . pick the side that ' s not blowing hot air , and you ' ll have a good conversation . if you do pick the wrong side , run , for it will soon be smelly .
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

9. i mean you could try to have a long distance relationship even if you think it won ' work . and if it does work out , you ' ll be happy that you tried it .
   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

10. i don ' t think you should feel embarrassed . as far as i understand , you didn ' t really have a choice back then and your friend will probably understand this . i think he ' ll mainly be glad you ' re doing fine now .
   (ID: bfc2e9a6e5f84327293fa1a1fd0287066782bcec)

11. if you ' re on vacation and you see a bunch of bike messengers hanging out and you think " ooh boy , the other soccer moms in the book club will really enjoy this urban experience , i ' ll snap some pics ! " , remember it ' s five bucks a picture . if i wanted my job to be your entertainment i ' d be a mime or a hooker . now fuck off and let me smoke this blunt at 10am .
   (ID: b073b7138186ccb7fa807af1158cb23d6b7c113f)

12. if you think that way you  ll never make money .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

13. i think bethesda will react quicker as soon as they realize is atomic shop items being duped , and they losing revenue . as of now i don  t think they give a damn . never said anything bad about game or studio before . until today . i  ll upvote this  cause i agree to the degree .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

14. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

15. why does every customer think  i don  t have to pay , right ?  is the pinnacle of comedy ? honey that wasn  t funny the first digit times i heard it today . that  ll be digit fucking digit .
   (ID: 280643182527d573e119c7952a08fea10d62edd8)

16. i  m a big decepticon fan , and these guys are an inescapable purchase for me . even moreso because i  m in canada and the wait sucks , so i  ll go stateside for it online . one of the thing i think some people have overlooked is that since there are digit bots for devestator , in order to make the star math work , we see the firsts 4pt filler bots .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

17. i think there ' s not a wildlife center in my city but i ' ll check . thanks
   (ID: 2834b254700cedfb96641229b712899b4d697418)

18. if you ever find yourself in " that situation " think of me , and how disappointed i ' ll be in you . you better straiten your self up boy . i ' m counting on you .
   (ID: bd005ac438966eb1f8d6de10fcb1bb6fd4565782)

19. it ' s the equivalent of canned laughter  the reader is being prompted to laugh . i ' ll laugh if i think something is funny . in fact , if i read something funny but the writer includes a " lol " , i will stifle my laugh . principles .
   (ID: ed9fd9ff218602605c7fbdf8f02f658604680c61)

20. are you suggesting euthanizing all the animals that belong to the unemployed ? what would happen in reality to those animals if the panhandler gave them up ? do you really think they ' ll be adopted by a rich and loving family ?
