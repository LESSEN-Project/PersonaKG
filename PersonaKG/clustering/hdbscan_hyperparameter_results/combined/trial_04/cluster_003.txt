2. that ' s you being afraid because you are creating thoughts in your own head about things possibly going wrong . if you were to do any of those activities you mentioned and at any point during them something made you feel nervous or that something is wrong , it ' s your gut feeling . think of fear as a thought process and your gut feeling as a natural reaction .
