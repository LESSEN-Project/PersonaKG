1. huh . i never romanced tali but i figured he would say it at some point , maybe you missed it ? i don ' t think shepard ever says it first though , i remember him answering " i love you too " to most of them , but not the other way around . i guess it ' s usually the love interests who confess their undying love and stuff , shep tends to show more with actions than words .

2. i think what  s happening is now everyone knows about the show so the typical applicant might br madly in desire of their digit minutes rather than madly in love . collateral damage is what worries me . there are people who would do whatever necessary to get on tv etc , when the shows  s over , their spouse and new families might be over too .

3. is there something wrong with loving back pets that show you their unconditional love ? what on earth do you think it has to do with being american ?

4. ok love . how about the cathedral in naples which holds a vial of blood from an early christian martyr , st . januarius . reportedly , the blood is dry most of the year , but mysteriously liquefies three times throughout the year , on days commemorating his life and impact . i think that one would be testable ?

5. i think it ' s a bit soon to start looking for a label on this . give it another month of nonchalant behavior . if you still feel this madly in love for her bring it up to her then . i ' m fearful that if you ask her now what you two are that this may drive her away from you because it could come across as weakness . be an independent man and do your thing . quit being so clingy already .

6. animal abuse , because if you think its ok to do it you will get murdered within digit week . note  i love animals
