3. can you give some details on how you made this work ? i ' ve made some initial tests of trying the same thing , and i can ' t seem to figure out how to get it to work , the message isn ' t revealed before the paper burns , and the citric acid just bleaches the tea  staining and it can be read without heat . did you tea stain before or after writing the message in the acid ? what concentration of citric acid solution did you use ? how long did it take for the map to appear ? etc .

4. sorry on mobile so i booted up the game today and accidentally clicked kyf instead of killer  the game lagged out for maybe a straight minute and then loaded killer without me backing out of kyf and selecting killer killer loaded weird , i had all the perks at rank three but all four perk slots , both addon slots and the offering slot were locked and all the cosmetics except mike ' s bloody mask eventually it smartened up but never did give me my mask back or take away the overalls . i ' ve even played a few matches and still nothing
