   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

11. delete the number , or block the number . make it extremely difficult to get in contact with him in anyway . know what he did to you and know how you felt when you found out . do you really wanna feel that way again ? you deserve to be happy and putting yourself in that situation is going to dig yourself into a deep hole . dont give him the satisfaction of cheating on a girl and then having her run back to him . it will make him a worse person and it will only hurt you in the end .

13. i ' m a go ahead and disagree with you on that one as many people have already said the kid is digit and should already know how to treat other people property regardless and the kid did offer to pay the whole digit so op let him of easily .
   (ID: 1df1bd07e28c0df73bd865f8cb447d7c8f1bd4d3)

14. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

15. getting offended and correcting others everytime from your horse doesn ' t make you superior over others . i know he did something wrong and hasn ' t repeated that since but the media should understand that they can do something better by raising awareness on what ' s happening around the world rather than attacking a man over petty issues
   (ID: 43361d3d352286328dcb058ec017ca0e2d364601)

17. shit . that ' s a terrible thing to happen to you so young . if it helps , you ' re getting internet bro hugs from me . you should know that you ' re an absolute hero for talking her out of it . even if she ended up doing it later , you still gave it your all to save her . most people go through their lives without ever saving someone else ' s . most adults wouldn ' t know how to do what you did . you are a legend .
