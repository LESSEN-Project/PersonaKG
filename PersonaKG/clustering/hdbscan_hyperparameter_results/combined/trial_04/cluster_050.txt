2. that ' s nice to hear ! i love elf ' s face powders . bronzers , blushes , finishing powders , etc . i want to try them all . some are too shimmery for me , but the good ones are so good .

3. i love how this assumes there ' s a significantly large amount of people who want to dress up as prince . what happens if i want to go as michael jackson ? how does that work ?

4. no one claimed it was ' good ' marketing . you seemed confused as to why a company would want to portray their game in a positive light . personally i would love to see all ads simply read  " here is our product , check it out . if you want "
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

5. the thing i ' d love to see that hasn ' t really been done right is a business manager game . i ' d prefer a restaurant sim , but instead of making it simple and have dexterity type controls , i want it to be a normal " manage " style gameplay , but you ' re dealing with buying food orders , hiring employees , creating a menu out of your food items , pricing your dishes , marketing  advertising , etc .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

6. we would grow indoors , and one of the main reasons i want to go is i ' m an addict and need to make a change . leaving family sucks but they act and look at me differently since they found out about the drug use . i love them but i need to get away from them as much as my dealers .
