Total from this dataset: 87

1. not being preachy but maybe look at potential partners other aspects mental  spiritual , lifestyle choices etc . and see if those are healthy  attractive . people can change but if you are dating someone in a rut , it will be ten times harder for them to better themselves once dating and that ' s the real ugly side of relationships . if you think you are shallow about appearances then you might be using it as an excuse to not address other flags from that person . unfortunately it is so easy to rate people based on image so it ' s just a constant effort to remind yourself .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

2. let ' s just say that it isn ' t their voices i think of when i ' m in the shower .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

3. oh hell yes . just the problem was that i was bad at swimming so i didn ' t really think about participating there not that i had a possibility tho
   (ID: 8487a8406f04273c554e2e578c3a667648916790)

4. listen , you  re not a humanitarian , you  re not a good person , from your post history you  re an extremely sad person , you  re the definition of a piece of shit . yet you seem to think you stand above others because of physical appearance . just because you weren  t happy with the way you were does not give you the fucking right to belittle those who are content with their body , regardless how much extra weight they have . i  d bet my bottom dollar that digit  of those fuckers are happier than you . nobody wants to be as sad you . fuck off . humanity is better without you
   (ID: 18e18998471794de2ee0ded08a5f57a45a336e24)

5. thanks , that only made me think everyone else was doing the same thing , and doubled down my fear that they were just tolerating my presence out of politeness . that ' s pretty much how all of society works , we all just tolerate each other existence . you fit right in .
   (ID: 225291489bc1a4ddf3d197a3062fa9ff935f3029)

6. i think you ' re just bad at it , it ' s fun
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

7. you really think someone would do that ?               just             go             on             the             internet             and             tell             lies ?
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

8. think of every horror movie out there or you watched now remember someone had to think it up first . just cause they think it doesn ' t mean they are evil well except me muah ha ha ha .
   (ID: 2623e4996f6df0e5814dbede4fbc9c1f13de4382)

9. and if that small chance does happen . what are you going to do without a way to get help ? get yourself out ? what if you were just hiking in the forest and you find yourself lost , without a way home ? i don  t think the ability to pay taxes will help in that situation , imo .
   (ID: 93c3b3d523de0afd404d3bcb4acdf023866f9281)

10. i guess i just don ' t see where this is going ? i don ' t think a single person has agreed with you . maybe you should try it and post your results .
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

11. go , why the hell not ? just be smart and have a plan to gtfo if everything goes south midway through . i think you should tell someone you ' re going , a friend an adviser or someone you can count on if it goes to shit . you will regret not going .
   (ID: f4e4929bb0bef09e7eb72aaccf20c2d9454729c7)

12. no problem . i think if you ' re doing a long term planning and you ' re not good with investments and finance , yeah they totally worth it . but in my own opinion i ' m no expert . if you just wanna deal with your saving , then nah just invest your money in a moderately safe portfolio and take it out when you ' re done .
   (ID: 9adb5fb6fb9aeeeb65afe41002460d73817044b0)

13. just saying , i should have a featured flair . i think you remember can it be ai this time around please ?
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

14. i think you are an upstanding member of a higher functioning society . i agree with you on all points . and i greatly appreciate that you have replied to people disagreeing with you . it ' s just a shame that none seems open minded to it .
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

15. by god its a little baby . what country sends babies to school ? i ' m not judging per say , if that ' s what your country does that ' s fine . it just seems odd from where i ' m sitting . then again my kids came to work with me from the age of digit to digit when they started school . you probably think that is weird .
   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

16. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

17. surely there are other avenues to take this information . you reported it to the police department of which luke murray is assigned ? nothing seems to have been done ? take it to another department , go get legal advice , take it to a lawyer , any of these options are better than posting it on reddit , and if this turns out to be a false report then you are committing an act of defamation . i ' m not doubting your honesty , just think you should find another means of having the law look at this accusation .
   (ID: 9e8a44f7c55ebce4785906436a033b33a1ccb949)

18. i don ' t think others are wrong , per se , mine just works for me . the whole " faith " thing .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

19. i just don ' t see how you are allowing yourself to go through the torture of bible camp . maybe you don ' t think it so bad , but i cringe of the even thinking about being forced to go to a place where i ' m surrounded by people who have completely different ideologies as i .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

20. so what if they ' re not the highest quality ? op is proud of them and i think they look nice , so just stop being a dick about it
