   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

   (ID: 6eec77fe98b9dc85ec1e5e7edc37cdb415794719)

5. several questions . why is the dad calling his digit year old sexy ? why did she supposedly call herself brave instead of something like smart or kind ? why do her feet look that damn big ?
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

6. i ' m sorry , ' might ' not ? if i was unclear , i apologize . were you previously uninsured ? did you intend to remain uninsured past this point ? how much more are you spending on healthcare today as a result of obamacare ? i would also like some more detail about this ambiguous ' other policy . '
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

7. why does the spiderman suit look like it ' s xxxl ? did you steal it from a poor fat kid ?
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

8. that ' s pretty neutral , it ' s always best to be positive and not talk about what you didn ' t like but what you did like . for instance , your old boss might have been a real hard ass , riding you all day . instead of saying that you could say your old boss was really involved in my day to day tasks and was really focused on the job getting done . i learned a lot from him . this is not a lie and it spins the situation in a positive light .
   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

9. hey , that  s really cool . have you still kept your culture ? what was it like for your children growing up ? did they have to learn aramaic ?
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

   (ID: e3a37ef234435ebde735894f98de2b3f90e3bbe9)

11. i doubt you ' d look like a potato and even if you did who cares ? life is too short to worry about it , wear what you like !
   (ID: 183a5eea32f2c73a87c734920d3188862433e411)

12. why did you post it in this subreddit , we literally are like the most racist people ever
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

13. this is the hardest thing to deal with in this day and age . this kind of stuff has happened to me and what i did was tell twitch and stuff like that . they don  t listen to creators now . it  s super difficult .
   (ID: 29f3e9a3f8c02fc1b9aa346cffb8edec6caac89f)

15. how do you answer the question that always seems to get beat like a dead horse when i cosplay . how did your character end up at the convention ?
   (ID: 03d15a94c7d0f2138a5e5c0cf7e503c341abbf78)

16. me and death used to be super close . did every thing together . then he tried to make a move on me and i was like " sorry i don ' t swing that way . " we drifted apart and i feel like an incomplete person without my best buddy death
   (ID: 7c3eb339580d281fcb54cb04dbb55f6921fceec5)

17. that ' s horrible ! law should protect people no matter what , not allowing to hurt them legally . i ' m from poland . my physics teacher is roasting and disrespecting whole lgbt  and other minorities all the time . he ' d better teach us physics but noooo . he ' s been teaching in this school for years and it seems nobody ever complained about him to the headteachers , or they did but it had no effect . i guess there are multiple teachers like him here . even wort ones
   (ID: 337350fc54133b327ce0d6d9f385f82a2a6738cf)

18. never seen a cap like that , build looks a bit ropey . i could be wrong because not had many cohiba . where did you buy it from ?
   (ID: 1413da4d65544a15a55a7323945fa06ed3f67f4a)

19. this is like a criminal pointing to another criminal and saying " well he did it too "
   (ID: 9e8a44f7c55ebce4785906436a033b33a1ccb949)

20. sounds like you had it rough in hs , sorry to hear . i did to , but eventually you grow up and realize none of that matters
