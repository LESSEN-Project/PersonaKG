1. main character wise they are standalones , but world lore wise they are heavily linked , specially digit and inquistion . i would hold on playing dai and start with origins . i differ from the general consensus and actually like da2 a lot and think dai is just an ok game aside from the tresspasser dlc , which is phenomenal

2. i would actually like to play this scenario . but , the thing is , everyone would just camp their wool the whole game and there wouldn ' t be too much pvp . also , i think popular people ' s wool would get target too much . but overall , great scenario !

3. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

4. other family members watched all of it , so i ' d be in the room through most of it . i think early on i just decided it wasn ' t for me . i get why people like it but it was marmite to me .
   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

5. i don  t think it  s women that like you less , it  s just not the best women who are acting like this with you . i mostly have female friends i knew before and after transitioning and they were all really supportive , same with any male friends i had . they are good people , so they accepted me wholeheartedly . i suggest finding those types of people in your life , regardless of gender yknow ?

6. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .

7. unless your arm is as long as your leg or you can dislocate your should on command i don ' t think the thing you ' re attempting to do is possible . if you ' re feeling a barrier , you might still have some hymen left , but really , your vagina stretches . it can likely accommodate anything a dude has to offer . listen , there ' s no right way to finger yourself . the whole point is just to feel good and it sounds like you ' re freaking yourself out . either get a toy or wait until you have a person you trust enough to talk about this with and let them put their fingers up in you .

8. kinda of an asshole ? i can see being concerned that your film might not qualify for the lgbt festival but if it  s just about you being straight  chill . no one is going to think you  re gay and it  s not like your gay colleagues don  t attend straight festivals you would feel more comfortable at . if you  re not experienced with the lgbt community , that  s cool , but keep in mind straight people are usually welcome to any event so long as they  re nice ! you might even have fun .

9. what ' s been going on inside of my head ? been staring at the ceiling , for hours on end can ' t really think of anything else that i can do  maybe i can go out , and find my way , or maybe i can chill out , stay in today they sound like fun , but maybe another day  sorry , not sorry ! i couldn ' t help it ! just ignore this post , wanted to vent out .

10. it just adds to the badass effect , i like to think of it as having my gun out passively but always ready for shit to hit the fan .
   (ID: 23394798067974e95a922a95c6609d16ca1b11dd)

11. look up " romantic bpd relationships . not saying this is what she has , and not trying to shame anyone with this diagnosis . i just think this may give you some insight and useful strategies you seem like a lovely , thoughtful person
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

12. stark  digit ? heck no . the character he was more based on , ultimate spider  man ? yes very much so , though neither wanted to be a sidekick but an avenger disney  i prefer it to the other two because people like you have ruined them for me but i in no way think it  s this godsend tom is kind of accurate just not really digit accurate
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

13. i think you should have pride that you haven ' t slept around alot . but not in a way like you are better than any one else just i guess in a " i respect myself " type of way . which is why i don ' t think you should just fuck someone for practice .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

14. i like it because this makes for a perfect metaphor for sucide . maybe i ' m just predisposed to think so . it ' s surreal . true to an absolute .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

15. you should watch the videos before you criticize , otherwise you look dumb . i don  t doubt that you are , i just think you  d like to make a good impression here .
   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

16. i think at this point your just upset that a little american boy has a different opinion then you and your trying to make me look like a dumb homophobic nazi

17. there are a few good ones on here like this , but for freshness , this would be best done as mf4a , just saying . my favourite twist , would be the wife on the phone , teasing the husband about what ifs , but it sounds like she ' s alone . she then hangs up , or at least think she does , and you get to ' accidentally overheard ' how amazing it is .
   (ID: 720bf2762acb0f756492e6e40ae840126dae87ce)

18. do you really think that " getting really big " is a problem ? seriously ? what , ya think you lift a few reps , go to sleep , and wake up the next day built like a gorilla ? like it ' s that freaking easy ? do you have any clue what it takes to generate mass ? it required dedicated , disciplined work , and strict dieting . it doesn ' t just fucking happen . what i ' m saying is don ' t fucking worry about " getting really big . you aren ' t going to have that problem if the level of knowledge you have is so low that you even ask such a ridiculously silly question in the first place . go to the gym , work as hard as you freaking can , and you will be absolutely happy with the results .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

19. " you can just speak plain language to yourself " if you speak words in your head , like think whole sentences , you can change your mindset .
   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

20. well a ton of socially anxious people think of similar shit like this that happened years and ages ago so just add it to the end of the queue .
