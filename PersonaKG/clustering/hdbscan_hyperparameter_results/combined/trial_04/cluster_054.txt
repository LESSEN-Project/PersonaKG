--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 60

1. i think it ' s more of a confidence issue for me . if he makes the first move than i know that he likes  wants me rather than me taking the chance and getting rejected . although i have asked out all of my past boyfriends so i don ' t require it .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

5. i didn ' t know about the ice cap thing you mentioned , but i feel like governments should do what they can to try to minimize it , i think that we should work towards developing a way to harness fusion power and attempt to proliferate that around the world and that would solve nearly all of our energy problems and it wouldn ' t polute
   (ID: feb4a6aeed8e7e14b0592329bd91d7933a93217e)

6. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

7. not to mention the weather instances i think you know of .
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

8. how do you deal with people like that ? i struggle with people already but when it ' s someone either not listening or think they know better i end up snapping at them
   (ID: f8771fc63bc4c52bb04b2e71d4aefe7bf406c65c)

9. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

10. i hate how people think that it ' s a woman ' s job to be the one who does housework . in a perfect relationship yes , i know there ' s no such thing both the man and woman do equal parts of the housework .
   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

11. please calm down it ' s a trailer and the film has an emphasis on dancing , if you know his stuff then you should also know there ' s a lot of hideous shit that ' s gonna occur . i don ' t think anything on his resume warrants a mocking use of " dark "
   (ID: 1d327d2812dfee71bf8ef77d36ffd5eb70efd55b)

12. having my underarms touched . i don  t know why , but whenever i think someone is going to touch them or come close to them i freak out and hyperventilate .
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

13. i think it  s all of the facts that are not fiction . it breaks the fourth wall and if you  re the inquisitive type it kind of sucks you in and involves you . the book has a life of its own , but the reel world facts and history are there to be pursued further . you get this all the time with nonfiction of course , but when fiction does it too , especially a real page  turner , it  s really cool . you know of any others ?
   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

14. you should know that your so ' s real side . personality , quirks , temperment , etc will come out only after getting married ! you will think you married a stranger !
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

15. sometimes i think that no matter how hard our life is , no matter how much we suffer or put others in pain , the people who have passed on are laughing because they know it doesn ' t matter and nothing matters in life because there ' s something else that ' s better for everyone once we pass on . as far as i know , death only affects those that are living .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

16. his greatest song is let it be . i don  t know how you could think that it would be rocky raccoon . whenever that song comes on , i run across my room and throw my record player out of my window .
   (ID: a8d677a357cabd8cb6d9bfa06e041b5b173582d8)

17. wow i can  t even imagine . the only thing i can possibly think is to try and burn your loves faces  childhood room or home  any thing else nostalgic into your mind while you have time . i really don  t know what else i can say , that  s terrible .
   (ID: c787052a42459acc9cd2034c7531250ccd441795)

18. i do get laid , and i dont think you even know how to please one . however i am an enviro9enthusiast and care about all animals and ecosystems , which you so clearly dont give a damn about . bust since you are all high and mighty . can you tell me where the clit is ?
   (ID: ee2906681b3174a80cefe2bcfb40bd3a110c1b29)

19. how cute , you think you know a thing about what people go through . try being bullied and shunned to an extent at digit different schools , 3rd grade until i went to college . oh , and you would all collectively call me a normie because i have an intimate relationship . don ' t assume you know a damn thing about any person who posts here because you simply dont .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

20. stick people can make any situation funny . that ' s what ' s complicated about history . you never know if it is good or bad . you only do what you think is right .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)
