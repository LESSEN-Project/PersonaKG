4. correct me if i ' m wrong , but i thought that this sub was for ads on reddit , not on outside sites . especially not a financial site talking about the financial success of a company . which is their job . i mean , just look at this page
   (ID: 73a501f273781aa2c0deb878ecb02dcab3a9d4d3)

5. i never knew that . i thought the deworming was more of preventing it , but obviously what you just said makes a lot more sense . til .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

6. i can  t even . i  m trying to come up with a good joke , but there are none . just what . this had to pass through many people , who all somehow thought it was a good idea . lol
   (ID: e1cfe7e3bd4f78988caf9c6fd043691888e401c8)

7. be aware that if you ' re caught and you probably will be , no matter which way you go about it , the consequences may be a bit more severe than them just saying " no , you can ' t do that " . you may well be ejected from the park , barred for life , or possibly have security involved . the only way for you to do it and feign ignorance and possibly get away with it and i am not condoning this at all would be to try going through hogwarts express or the main entrance and , if caught and chances are you will be , saying that you thought the parks were the same . but , if you try this , you ' re a bit of an idiot , and even more of a complete git .

8. yeah , true . there are so many worse companies . just the first thing i thought of . it ' s great for talking to my friends and family all over the world as well as promoting myself , but i hate to see how people are addicted to it and over use it as well as whatever privacy stuff they violate .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

9. seeing a lot of negative comments saying get help . guys , this is a game where you time and time again , without thought , shotgun blast mofos across the room . op was just descriptive and obviously has a unique play style . at some point we have all saved , committed crimes against humanity , then reloaded . to the op , optionally you can attempt to be a pickpocket expert and just take the gun maybe never actually have seen his inventory in that quest .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

10. that ' s actually some great advice i just thought it might be a good idea but maybe i should just wait until i need to or have more money how much money would you say you need to start ?
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

11. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .

12. after a nasty change if leadership we believe you are just too close to the former director and our lawyer thought it would better if you resigned i broke no rules
   (ID: 7c3eb339580d281fcb54cb04dbb55f6921fceec5)

13. lol and i thought my own outlook on people was pretty bleak . just comes down to trust in the end here . yes a lot of people suck but there are good ones out there . gotta take a risk now and then for the reward .
   (ID: 1cf567904675ac1ca7b5a90612e5479a5b6c9bef)

14. oh wow i  m dumb as fuck thank you for the correction . id heard about that case long time ago and always just thought it was here thats the one where the killer fed one of the victims fried chicken , yes ?
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

15. ah yes ! i knew it wasn ' t conan ' s show , i was just in between this gag and that one . thanks though , i was trying to figure out who ' s show it was and thought it was fallon ' s for some reason .
