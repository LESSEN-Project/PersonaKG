--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 69

1. im not hating but every time i see a pic of a joint like this it makes me think how much is being wasted or perhaps being offered to the gods
   (ID: e3f34e146ce06ba2b5fc5a249c73494f93f56e86)

2. i think a lot of this comes down to the definitions of coercion and seduction . yes , in seduction the idea is to do your best to be enticing to someone . however , this should not be confused with a bending of their will or a manipulation . coercion is doing whatever is necessary to achieve a desired response from someone else , including putting extra pressures on them , which can be easily done if the coercing party is in a position of power , whether that is physical strength , employment , or status . seduction is like giving someone all green lights , coercion is like trying to take the steering wheel .
   (ID: df28c2a39b633ca418192316a199668289382292)

3. i like the way you think thinking  face but i don  t think that  s how it works
   (ID: 1bb2b5ec27ad0397aea65ab5151bd4a19742f52a)

4. do people actually think like this ? you can ' t control the sex of your kids . well actually i think nowadays you can , idk how expensive it is what difference does it make if you have boys or girls anyway . if everyone had boys , there ' d be no one to reproduce in the next generation .
   (ID: 419b67e0e2cdcb7bd8ea9a89d34d0747a1f5f620)

5. hahah ! like they would make three matrix films . i think you might be trolling .
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

6. i think it was the first time i played the last of us , i absolutely loved ellie  s character and wanted to raise a badass kid like her . also , i felt the same way when playing god of war . so i guess if i ever have kids i  m naming them ellie and atreus
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

7. yeah i fear that a lot actually , especially since i watch hentai from time to time which is nothing like real life . think i should quit ?
   (ID: 1e6ea64fb15fb5b12b1d82a3a5bdced4e3a6559a)

8. i think damage should be the number one criteria . that ' s the whole point of fighting , right ? i feel like aggression is a terrible way to score if you ain ' t hurting no one . i mean , i can follow someone , make a mean face , growl , and point at them angrily . that ' s not fighting though .
   (ID: 3b00a7fe72d71c6162850ad66e6322e5d78fb79d)

9. i think , this is woooosh inside of woooosh , cuz that comment looks like another joke . i mean , that dude seems to understand the irony and he replies it with another irony , because it ' s obvious that digit hours in settings is either softwaregore or some development stuff
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

10. this card is basically a zero mana discover a spell . u can either play the discovered card or another spell but either way you are still paying full price it ' s not that similar to glyph because the discount doesn ' t last . it ' s not a true discount like prep because the card itself costs digit mana . personally i don ' t think it will see any play outside of hagatha .
   (ID: a5abb0fc49ef940b208bd33b46b6b669a13fc83f)

11. i think everyone pronounces their ts like ds if its in the middle of a word
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

12. i think it ' s more like when you go to pick up your kid from school but you forgot his name .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

13. no way ! i grew up on the prequels so i have the nostalgia goggles going on . that being said , i rewatched them last year after years of not seeing them and view them differently now . i like the phantom menace , but still think jar jar and anakin significantly make the movie worse . i do hate that the actors suffered immensely after the film but that doesn  t change that their movie parts sucked .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

14. i think the question is asking what industries you ' d like to kill off , i think you ' re taking it as an insult
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

15. whenever people find their way here they always think it will be like " the one that flew over the cukoos nest " with lobotomy and ect though electroconvulsive therapy is not that medival and in reality greatly assists those suffering from long term depression , it is literally like a whole new person comes out . not lobotimized , more like a medical miracle . plus the media only focuses on the dramatic rather than the relatable , tragically .
   (ID: b5153b16e61f6bc5e4bf4d8db479b7093df1ae26)

16. no way . i don ' t think i ' d like to be a kid in this day and age . potentially everything i do would be saved for posterity somewhere on the internet
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

17. i used to be like that too , not anymore though . but i ' m afraid i will at some point think about it again so i like to make jokes because it makes something i ' m scared of a little less scary .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

18. this actually sound like an issue with the pc  mac  s hardware . you could check your activity monitor and see if the interface is initiating some type of search for new software , but i don  t think that  s what it is . turning off the internet is recommended for optimizing your daw . but who are we kidding . i don  t think many prosumers do . this isn  t a very common issue which is another reason i think it  s the computer  s ports .
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

19. you ' re staying strong mate , good to hear . it might be unnecessary to reward yourself ' cos you ' re doing so well anyway , but you could always treat yourself with something like a massage , pamper treatment or the like . your way of rewarding you , if you think about your winnings and the fact you ' re not pissing your money away on booze instead like we all have , i reckon it is well deserved ! not your thing ? ziplining ?
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

20. i sometimes imagine telling someone off , who has done something i consider rude , so i don ' t have to actually do it . i don ' t like actual confrontations but in my head i sometimes think about potential ones .
