1. i play online vs exclusively . i ' m not saying this to piss you off , but i can poke check and stick lift all day long and hardly ever get a penalty . my poke checking could arguably be considered poke spamming i do it so much . it ' s all about proper positioning and timing for those poke checks , and never poke from behind . as far as stick lifts , they work very well during puck battles , especially along the boards . if your opponent gets possession , lift that shit right away you have to be fast and it ' ll almost always come loose and back to you . i ' m not saying it ' s perfect far from it , but if you ' re getting penalties on poke checks and stick lifts either your timing or positioning is off . go ahead and downvote me if you want , but i hardly ever get penalties for pokes and lifts . almost all my penalties are checks into the boards that ea will randomly call boarding or charging .

4. do you want cell service on it ? i bought a  digit tracphone at walmart for my toddler to watch netflix on during a trip . it has all the things you mentioned . it ' s locked to their network so you ' ll never be able to take it essential l elsewhere , but it seemed to handle what i required of it .

6. when you say to attend , you  re speaking with a bit of certainty that you  ll be getting into those programs . how confident do you feel on those chances ? even if the chances are low , i do believe it  s up to you and what you  re looking to do in the future . what do you really want . if academia is more important to you than becoming a clinician , declining an acceptance may not be the worst idea . but it is ultimately up to you and what you see for your future , and that is what will give you the most fulfillment later on in your life .

7. argue all you want hahahaha . that ' s the answer . they sign up thinking they ' ll " serve their country " , get used to hurt other humans instead , then get unhinged because of it . a great package of stupid from the veto  go , too cowardly to refuse to hurt others during , and weak minded afterwards .

8. for canadians i  m a conservative but compare to americans i  m probably a centrist . i describe myself as a proud member of the  here  s a fair percentage of my money , now fuck off  party . i  ll pay taxes for important shit like infrastructure , education , and health care but i don  t want my money going towards bullshit like art departments or foreign aid . i also don  t want the government deciding what i can or can  t say , or what i can and can  t do in the privacy of my own home so long is doesn  t hurt others physically . basically i  ll pay taxes , let me decide where they go , then fuck off .

9. oh great , now we ' ll have to go through scanners and get groped if we want to go through a tunnel or cross a bridge .

13. just say you disagree , if they want your reason , they ' ll ask for it . then , they can decide whether to agree with you or not .

14. since what a fursona is has been explained to death here i ' ll just add to it first , you do not need a fursona to be a furry . in general " being furry " is a very loose term . the only thing in common between all of us is that we like anthropomorphic art . however if you do want to interact with the community outside of reddit having at least an oc as an avatar will help tremendously . second , hya reddit is the best place imo . stay here if you want amazing furry art regularly oand go to furry  irl some nsfw , not a lot for memes and shitposting .

15. you should do the thing you want to do . otherwise you ' ll just give the wrong impression and just have dead end conversations with people you don ' t care about and waste all your free time for the rest of your life .

19. all you have to do is accept jesus christ as your personal savior and you ' ll make it into heaven no matter what you do in this life , so you can even stay in the gang if you want .
