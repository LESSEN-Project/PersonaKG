   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)

   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

   (ID: 37f1dd54cc7fbf9961db909e5dce33ca94dc5b82)

7. actually i just realized op  s would still be wrong because the apostrophe shows ownership so i think it would just be ops . my bad
   (ID: 5042e4f4cf4f00f86836211d30b97922c92f0b46)

8. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

9. copy and paste made me laugh . can you not just type , what you think about the book and why will anyone read it ?
   (ID: 782311f0352356940fd2c1e77bc3cfa9f74b06fa)

10. how well someone speaks in a beauty pageant is irrelevant to my point , i wasn ' t trying to point out everything about each topic . plus it is just an idea , i think you are taking it a little too serious .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

11. you think a decade and a half of blacklisting , effectively destroying his ability to have a career and a prosperous life , is a just reactioon to what you classify as dumb mistakes ?
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

12. i don  t think they are ugly , i just think it  s interesting to see something marked on someone and think what was the motive behind the tattoo and what  s the story .
   (ID: c5e877ff3be5d3571f5fe899f55887a6f608ee98)

13. losing partial  full control of myself is a scary concept that i don  t think is just limited to me . you do you tho
   (ID: 8ea8e4a00c3f2a64096e00bdbba0247e580cdb17)

14. this question just made me think of the movie sleepwalkers .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

15. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

16. this is how players get hurt . having to think to much and letting up , not doing what you would naturally do . this is more of a problem than the refs . they should just play digit  hand touch and qbs should wear red jerseys the whole year if this is how it  s gonna be . i understand the league trying to protect the qb , but this is just absolutely ridiculous now .
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

17. i think you ' re just bad at it , it ' s fun
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

18. im not . i just think its kinda bruh moment cuz no part digit character is gay . and no one can disagree . sorry but judt remember thats a weird fantasy . also you used the word hypocrite wrong .
   (ID: de0709ad19c458ffff0b96aab8fcfa9c40b24603)

19. i think a lot of us can agree " daddy " is creepy as hell , but the idea of spanking is just as creepy for me .
   (ID: 36314aee005a03517f2446ec0da2834fe0f712d6)

20. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
