1. go through and see what you  re getting wrong . maybe it  s content you haven  t reviewed yet . maybe it was your headspace during the test . if i take one and go in with a negative mindset , my score drops i just found this out with my most recent fl . good luck !

5. ooh good point . just because something or someone has left you , there is still the emotional trauma left behind . i have no idea what that trauma would amount to when it comes to an extra sliver of someone else ' s evil soul inside another .

6. quick question instead of posting a new thread  for you toy collectors , is there a particular set  line of sw toys that is sought after or preferred ? or do you guys just collect figures that looks good

7. there ' s a few good youtube videos on it . watch mark kermode revisit on the film , where he feels more warmer to it . take a look at ' the philosophy of cloud atlas , how beauty will save the world ' and the in  depth analysis by ' the angry hippo ' such a shame the film is so polarising . as jim broadbent ' s character says " if you extend your patience for just a moment , you will find there is a method to this tale of madness "

9. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .

10. not an answer but atlas is not that good maybe just the puch , just team up and go farm him . i ' d suggest look in recruit for casuals every now and then to get it eventually . so you

11. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !

12. no problem . i think if you ' re doing a long term planning and you ' re not good with investments and finance , yeah they totally worth it . but in my own opinion i ' m no expert . if you just wanna deal with your saving , then nah just invest your money in a moderately safe portfolio and take it out when you ' re done .

13. that i just applied for a  10k  loan that will be looming over me for the foreseeable future in hopes of not washing out of college and getting a job good enough to pay of for the loan plus interest in an extremely competitive society that is only growing more cutthroat by the day . college is fun .

14. little house on the prarie , andy griffith show , the waltons . just regular good ol lessons about life . how that you have to struggle and suffer through things sometimes and not have anyone to ' save ' you . and you learn to be a better person because of it .
