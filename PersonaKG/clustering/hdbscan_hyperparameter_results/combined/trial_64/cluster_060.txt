1. . um . this doesn ' t explain anything except that you need to work on your parkour . was this just a view grab ?

2. because why would you need it , if it ' s for self defence and knife just as easily does the trick . if you like to shoot it go to a gun range . for what reasons would you need one in a home

3. a few months back i found a youtube video explaining how the whole movie is actually just the two guys trying to murder the girl and that there is no witch or anyone following them . i would need to dig to find it but it ' s the most air tight movie theory i have ever heard and made me appreciate it even more .

5. sorry man , but he has a gf already so you can ' t do anything about that . you need to let go and just respect his decision .
   (ID: ab38d3f31156c0cca1babe826c83025e8694eca2)

6. but why would he need just one ?
   (ID: 77a6bff8693a174b55d34fc32fdd8a87710fecb7)

7. hey considering your starting qb is constantly playing injured because his backup is that terrible y ' all are doing very well . sad your run game just hasn ' t developed because y ' all need it .

8. you have a big bang hypothesis . now you just need a career  s worth of mathematics to validate it .
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

9. sometimes in life you just need a change .
   (ID: 2bb956084cb9bf79f58345d6cf6beca98e76bbb4)

10. not too many . you just need to hit the right spots . for example , one explosion would probably set off yellowstone , which could cause a fair bit of trouble .
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

11. this makes a lot of sense . i guess i just need to learn what doesn  t have to be engaged depending on the position
