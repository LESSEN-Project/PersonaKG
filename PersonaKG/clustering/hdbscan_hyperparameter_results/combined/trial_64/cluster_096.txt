3. choose your poison that ' s a nice test to give to people that are literally incapable of telling good from evil , because you made them in such a way . doesn ' t sound very flattering about god ' s character , is it ?  christianity at least imho is a soothing white lie i prefer calling it opiate of the masses . it helps one notice both great utility as a painkiller and horrible side effects .   x200b

7. i took this question as what policy the manager should implement for themselves . i have noticed that management only does what the higher ups tell them . there is no leadership . what is lacking in most places are leadership . i ' m not in a good headspace on this topic bc of my current employer lacks leadership especially at the lower levels . our turn over rate is atrocious . i always think of the old army doctrine of " people first , mission always " if you can understand what that requires , then you are on the path to good leadership .
