1. yeah . i see why some women don ' t but i think it ' s an important thing to at least attempt . lets print of cards and be weird together !
   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

2. no way . i don ' t think i ' d like to be a kid in this day and age . potentially everything i do would be saved for posterity somewhere on the internet
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

3. i don ' t think they believed i would go anywhere in life . i was never told exactly why but she lost interest and wasn ' t " attracted " to me anymore . not for looks but perhaps out of boredom or fear that there could be someone better .
   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

4. died from cutting ? ummm isn ' t that like little ticks or scratches ? i don ' t think they normally go that deep . if even part of this is true this is pretty sad but

5. i used meditation about a year ago to help cope with stress and my night terrors , i stopped over the summer , and now that classes have started up again , my night terrors have come with them . i don ' t think meditation is bullshit , but i can understand why you would .

6. i ' m not trying to defend him but don ' t you think someone might have already redeemed it and you later decided to check it out only to find out it ' s gone ? it ' s happened to me many times for free steam keys in discussion tabs
   (ID: 43361d3d352286328dcb058ec017ca0e2d364601)

7. yeah , everyone knows you don ' t wear a donald trump inside . come to think of it , i wouldn ' t wear that big asshat anywhere .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

8. i ' m not following . in op ' s scenario , they ' re getting referred for a procedure  service not covered by their insurance . what about the solve . care platform would lead to the payment responsibility being handled similar to a pcp visit ? i can understand solve . care handling the referral for an hmo . but unless i ' m misunderstanding op , don ' t think that was the scenario .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

9. why do you think i automatically support it because i don ' t smoke it ?
   (ID: fddeeaa11799939dfe96bc7fae74a22b474aaf20)

10. he didn ' t almost collapse a grooming gang trial and it utterly transparent that you only all of a sudden give a shit about the victims because you think it bolsters your point of ' football man bad ' . you didn ' t care about those girls before and you don ' t care about them now and that is precisely why someone like tommy robinson came to prominence .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

11. to be fair i used to think this . i agree that some women are not funny . however some men aren  t funny either . usually if you don  t like vagina jokes don  t watch amy schumer . she is the female equivalent to louis c . k . i do recommend you watch catherine ryan  s special on netflix for you to change your mind .

12. yeah i was reading his post and was unable to even answer what the third perk on a shotgun was . he first said it was two shot and then anti armour and then digit  strength which i don  t think is even possible . he should be reported to mods but in my experience they dont do shit anyway
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

13. considering that the atmosphere on pandora is carbon dioxide i don ' t think firebenders would be able to do much .
   (ID: 395865cc8932d0b3d13214bce052e8915f32835b)

14. if you don ' t care for my ideas you could provide one of your own . why do you think a gender gap exists ?
   (ID: f3657f57aa348caf1c32ec21ef139ea41a45dc29)

15. hmm . i don ' t think it can see its own reflection from there .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

16. i don ' t care if you have black friends . i think it ' s wrong to only care how a person looks and not take anything else into account .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

17. i sometimes imagine telling someone off , who has done something i consider rude , so i don ' t have to actually do it . i don ' t like actual confrontations but in my head i sometimes think about potential ones .
   (ID: e6c4a2b8e8c999b54ade342babc3d7b48868cc6d)

18. i don ' t think so . you could shoot your something else off too .
   (ID: 98df62eadd0a0c80a6084d5e352985209b46cce9)

19. thank you ! i didn ' t even think of vintage . even if i don ' t buy one , it would be a great way to learn about some of them . the vintage omega constellations are unbelievably beautiful imo .
   (ID: 2e34fbd58bc49726f7e8c74b8ea82513ca226ab4)

20. this actually sound like an issue with the pc  mac  s hardware . you could check your activity monitor and see if the interface is initiating some type of search for new software , but i don  t think that  s what it is . turning off the internet is recommended for optimizing your daw . but who are we kidding . i don  t think many prosumers do . this isn  t a very common issue which is another reason i think it  s the computer  s ports .
