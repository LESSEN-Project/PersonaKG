4. the only reason we have more shootings is because we have the right to bear arms , and almost digit times the population of the uk at least we don ' t have fucking acid attacks in broad daylight where police don ' t do shit and can ' t do shit because they don ' t have anything to protect themselves or civilians besides a glorified bat and a taserwhich hardly ever works . not to mention that the us healthcare system , i agree the us is overly expensive , but it attracts the best doctors based on pay . what ' s the point of paying for a doctor if you ' re not gonna wake up after surgery . the government shutdown has literally done jack shit , and is completely and utterly useless . it hasn ' t changed anything of any importance . we have the most powerful military in the world , were not warmongering , the us goes after high priority targets that european countries cannot track down because their limited spending co tributes to poor technology in comparison .
