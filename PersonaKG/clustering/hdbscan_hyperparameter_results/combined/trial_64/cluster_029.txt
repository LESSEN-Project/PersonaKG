2. if you call me , please tell me your name . i can ' t distinguish voices aside from male  female . when i pick up a phone , everyone sounds alike . i imagine if morgan freeman called me my brain would label him ' generic male ' . and yes , i ' ve had entire conversations with people without knowing who they are because i ' m also socially awkward and past a certain point , it becomes too awkward for me to ask who i ' m talking to .

5. i ' ve done nothing . i see these posts online about people who ' ve murdered sex offenders , and the comment section is filled with people who applaud the murderes actions . though i dont completely agree thats the way to go about it , i always think what if one of my friends or family members was a victim of assault .
