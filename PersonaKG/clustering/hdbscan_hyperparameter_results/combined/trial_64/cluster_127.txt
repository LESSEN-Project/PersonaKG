1. i agree we are all waluigi , but he would be better off if he didn  t have mario or luigi stealing his spotlight . waluigi is more than capable of being his own man , but he doesn  t . you see the key to his personality is that he stands out so much , and at the same time fits in so well
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

2. my area put up a stink about this because they put in an old time clock that barely works . we all manage to get clocked in before 5am but it ' s tough some days when it ' s malfunctioning . the supervisor has been nice enough to forgive a tardy so long that you were in line at digit  digit .

5. everything that you said is absolutely true . the most aggravating thing about the focus tree is the middle tree especially . oh you have to take digit focuses to get on with the tree ? ok . oh digit days wasn ' t enough ? how about digit different sub  trees that take another digit days to start . the war is almost long over by the time you get the claims on neighbors .
   (ID: fc02053133b0aa8d444b95ed56c24999ae82879b)
