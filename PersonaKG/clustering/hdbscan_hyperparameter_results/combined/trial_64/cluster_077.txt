1. listen , as i ' ve aged i ' ve come to find that someone somewhere will always find you attractive . regardless of what a census says . sounds like you ' re having an identity crisis .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

2. yes its an fsa gossamer . do i have to find like for like or will another brand do ? only the ones i ' ve found online are a little out of my price range . i bought the bike on the ' cycle to work scheme ' and it didn ' t even occur to me to check the cost of replacement parts
   (ID: e982e025c0604997a6e2072eb87b9bb01bed38ae)

   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

7. yeah i saw that today while i was at work as well . souls be out april 26th . surprised that the tcg twitter account hasn  t announced it yet . cheapest place i  ve found for devastator for me or from a site in the uk . one or two i  ve tried in the states have the product region import locked like magic is . amazon would run me about  digit .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

8. a lot of disney movies or maybe even things like spongebob squarepants because there are so many hidden references that you only get after you ' ve grown up .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

9. saying neither you ' ve affirmed their statement . should switch it off with something like ' well it ' s more natural than  insertrandomcharacteristic . plg '
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

10. nah man , even if you put the scenes in chronological order it still has no plot . i  ve tried to appreciate the movie , but nothing happens . compared to other tarantino movies , even ones light on story like kill bill , it doesn  t hold up .
   (ID: c418fa452eafbca022ce1c49b521d4574aa77cd1)

11. the answers to these tell me a lot about a person . what  s on your playlist ? what  s the most fulfilling experience of your past year ? what  s the funniest thing you  ve ever done ? how many times have you cheated on a partner ? what  s that body count looking like ?
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

12. the only difference is you sound like your experience is from page digit while mine is from raising a daughter after many failed relationships as a teenager , hence my clumsy attempt at telling the young team how life works . i may not come across like it but i am the voice of experience . i  ve lived it
