3. i have not even the slightest clue what is going on in this video . he is playing a custom game where the projectiles digit shot you , he goes into the cinematic view then blink dodges a projectile and hits his own . it ' s just impressive because of how hard it is to do anything in that view , including basic walking .

4. you may actually have some merit in this . i just realized that i can , completely on accident , be going digit and thinking i ' m going digit in my girlfriend ' s car . then again i drive a prius so . yeah . that might have something to do with it too .

5. i used to take a couple hits from our gravity bong before going to work but it made for awkward interactions in the mornings . i would space out more often or forget what i was saying mid sentence . i had to stop to avoid drawing suspicion and just to function better .
