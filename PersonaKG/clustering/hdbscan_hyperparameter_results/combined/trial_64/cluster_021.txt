2. exactly , you ' re not here to entertain me , but this post was meant to entertain whether or not it ' s for easy karma is a different matter . this is the first time i saw this , and judging from all the up doots , i ' d say i ' m not the only one . nothing is original because someone is always going to say it first , all that matters is how and when you do it .

3. i was ringside , and saw things that cannot be unseen . the way the room was set up , i had no choice but to see what was going on . all i can say is that i give women some serious credit for childbirth .

4. while i agree somewhat to the fact that hispanics like to fuck . i find it a bit distasteful to say that the problem is with hispanics . not with retarted white christians . who are too dumb to realize that their children are going to fuck regardless of what they ' re told . so hey lets get them to put on a jimmiehat

7. aussie here , so what i ' m about to say may not apply in the us , but going around to talk to sparkies face to face is worth digit resumes you send out . do the leg work .

8. lol what are you going to say ? just straight up ask  what are your views on feminism ?  you think a guy that wants to have sex with you is going to say  oh i hate women  ?
