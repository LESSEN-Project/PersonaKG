1. i have never stated that disobeying an officer means you deserve to die . i don  t think that at all , i think that anyone when encountering the police should obey an officers orders because it gives you the best chance of getting through the situation with a a better outcomelesser charges and b reduces risk of bodily harm . please don  t put hateful intentions onto me as i wouldn  t apply them to you . i  ll i want is for people to be more informed on police work , by doing so we make lives easier for everyone

5. oh god you are fucking stupid i already answered that dumbass question before you answered it . also , quit projecting i  m in between rolls on a machine i operate so sometimes i have to hurry typing . but back to your stupid question , you  re just so sheltered it  s unfathomable for you to actually be in a situation where racism applies . you just wanna be like everyone else , huh , lil puss puss ? i got a question for you , how about you pm me your address  an adress where we can meet up so i can show you what it  s like to suffer real racism , bitch boi .

6. i don  t understand this aversion to violence that you have . take electrical cars for instance , they  ve been around for decades and the only reason their use is not widespread is because of the influence of the car , oil , and car maintenance lobbies . cars cause , what , digit , digit  digit , digit deaths in the us yearly . is this not structural violence on a mass scale ? and how about if we were to apply this to big farming . syngenta , conagra , cargill , and monsanto now run all pretty much digit  of food production in the us . this has wreaked havoc on small family run farming operations as thousands of families have had to close their farms . is this not another example of structural violence ? there is no way to achieve the things you want  democratically  or without violence . the only way to achieve the things you want is to brutally and violently repress the ruling class , namely the purveyors of capital formation and accumulation within the transnational corporations . the transnational corporations will never relinquish their power and wealth willingly . to believe so amounts to liberal idealism .

7. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .

8. funny how you haven ' t actually been able to make a logical counter argument . you ' re just saying " you ' re wrong " without the logical backing that i have . then the " boo hoo whatever dude ! you ' re , uh , just like , uh , a flat earther dude " really , i am ? i ' m literally just like a flat earther ? that is your brilliant counter argument ? that saying it is wrong to promote a lie is exactly as bad as lying ? that is what you ' re telling me ? do you . do you realize how incredibly stupid you just made yourself look ? you just made yourself look like a clown .

9. i ' m a christian . i believe that jesus preached for us to do things like love , be compassionate , generous , and honest . as such  i believe in evolution and human  caused climate change , because the proof is overwhelming . i believe that being gay is neither evil , nor a choice . god created gay people , just as he created me . he loves them , too . i refuse to believe that god would be so cruel , as to set gay people up for failure . i believe that money and religion cannot mix . either you serve god , or you serve your greed for money . not both . there is no such thing as a racist christian . there are plenty of racists , though , who call themselves christian . if you truly love christ , you love your fellow human , no matter the ethnicity . i sincerely wish that the many cinos christian in name only in the world would recognize their own hypocrisy , and denounce dogma , when it clearly causes suffering , inflames hatred , or requires hefty lying to oneself .

10. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

11. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

12. you really simply do not understand logic , do you ? let me spoon feed it to you , since you ' re such a little dumb baby  from your perspective , your beliefs are correct . which means you should be putting them out there . if you ' re right , you ' d be helping people . but you don ' t do that , because you ' re a fucking coward . from a logically sound perspective , however , your beliefs are completely unethical . why ? because you are selfish , and only give a fuck about your emotions while compiling them . as a result , you completely failed to base them on evidence , or reason . if you cared about logic , you wouldn ' t dare believe the bullshit you believe . doing so would be a fucking embarrassment . see , your confusion is what happens when you hide like a little cowardly fucking bitch . this is also what happens when your beliefs have such low standards  you aren ' t accustomed to needing to make sound evaluations , because you don ' t do that to yourself . you ' re logically fat and lazy . so now , you meet someone like me , and you can ' t see the differences between logical arguments that should be obvious simply because you never behaved like you ever had to . see ? those beliefs effected your behavior . they effected your abilities to use reason as a tool for discourse . and because those beliefs have low standards , you have low reasoning ability . if you demanded a high standard of yourself , you would have never made such a basic bitch mistake . see how i ' m right now ? see how beliefs effect behavior in unexpected ways ? you ' re welcome .

13. imo when you say you believe in something , you stand up for it even when it doesn ' t benefit you . if you believe in freedom , then you have to protect people ' s freedom to do things you don ' t want to do . otherwise you were lying about valuing freedom .

14. but that ' s not actually what ' s happening , you are writing hypothetical fiction at this point . suppose in your hatred of trump supporters you become a murdering psuedo  vigilante who kills trump supporters . you should be banned from reddit you murderer ! you should be in prison ! see , anyone can do it . and my point with that example is that you are really going to say that a good father and successful mechanical engineer is " piece of garbage " just because of who he voted for ? give me a break . to be fair , though , washington dc is just a corrupt city in general , it ' s not just trump , although he is probably among the worse . nonetheless , the whole city is owned by corporate donors , e . g . the koch brothers . at least it ' s not as corrupt as it used to be in the gilded age , boss tweed era .

15. how can you speak for someone else regarding their own intentions ? for arguments sake , let ' s say that i thought the two bombs were a step too far , does that make me anti  western ?

16. i agree that hubris is one of our species ' flaws . i myself am a religious christian , and i while i do think we are special compared to animals , i believe in scientific proof , before dogma . accordingly , i believe in evolution and climate change , too . there is all the evidence in the world , that gays are normal , and not to be hated . the church says many things i disagree with , so i choose only to follow the stuff that lifts us as human creatures . you know what i mean , right ? don ' t steal . don ' t hump anyone else ' s wife , or your sister . do help people out whenever you can . be honest . be fair . call out liars . etc . basically , if it improves the quality of life , i ' m in . if it tells me to harm someone   like , " let ' s go hate gays ! "   i ' m out .

17. really , i have to thank you for the exchange we ' ve had . i intend to share it with as many people as i can . my friends all over the internet , my peers at work , and all the folks i have contact with on social media . i plan to share it with strangers at every opportunity . and you know what , those folks will share it with their friends and acquaintances . it will go far and wide . on and on . all over the country . look back at the lengths you ' ve stretched to bend reality because of your obsession with guns . the facts you ' ve attempted to dismiss because they don ' t square in a gun nuts head . the reality that americans kill eachother with guns more than any other developed nation . that america leads the world in mass shootings . keep hunting your hogs as the world looks back at you with disgust and pity . i should feel sorry for you but i don ' t . i have common sense and you do not . this is the last time i ' ll be responding to the nonsense you post . just know that you ' ve provided me with enough evidence to convince all those that have yet to be subjected to the garbage you and your ilk spew to reject it on a logical and factual basis . sleep on that . like i said earlier . thank you . your posts are nonsensical and increasingly bizarre . you have confirmed to me and to all that i intend to share this exchange with lol , which is a hell of a lot that gun nuts are real and are preposterous . so in love with the ability to create death that the essence of living is total lost to them . thank you . you have gone beyond proving any point i wished to make . once more . the gun control lobby have nothing to fear from you and will soon see their advocacy pay dividends because of crusading sophists like you leading the charge .

18. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .
