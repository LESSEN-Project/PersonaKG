1. there are some foods that need to be cooked that are otherwise toxic , quinoa for example . the ' cooking destroys nutrients ' thesis , although often true is irrelevant . you can eat eat a greater quantity of steamed broccoli and recieve the same amount of micronutrients as a smaller quantity of raw brocolli

5. i ' m not sure if this is the most effective technique but i just try to be honest . i ' ll ask for them by name and then ask if i ' m pronouncing that correctly . if someone asks how i got their number , i say it ' s from a list that the campaign has , i ' m not sure how it ' s compiled .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

6. she acted like you took up sooo much of her time whining about your poor baby . no . this woman is a cold lizard . she gave you the minimum and you are victim blaming yourself ! sorry . she sounds peeved that you are so sunk in your grief that you  ve forgotten the planets revolve around her ! well screw her . you are grieving your baby . what was her name ? where is he buried ? and what did she look like ? these are all such basic questions , for god  s sake that she could have asked ! because they mean something , and like any parent , you want to share your memories of your beloved infant . and you deserve to .

9. relax and remember she is a little girl . you are supposed to love her , but not in that way . know that if you had tried anything , it could crush your family . relationships will break apart . your family will grow distant . your parents would be shattered . your sister would be scarred forever . as an older brother , please try to remember the role you are meant to play in her life and try to forget any thoughts you have about her .

12. but he ' s an addict and i believe he was molested by his mother as a kid . he has done some nice things for his kid . he always apologizes or at least does something to get on their goodside . and honestly i think he did the right thing by telling fiona that sean still used .
   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

13. oh jeez . honestly . my recent ex has said so many horrible things to me not one sticks out on my mind anymore . just the most recent horrible things . the last thing he said before i blocked him on everything was that my therapist was being paid to be nice to me . one thing that stands out the most . he called my rape " what you did " . he calls it " what you did to me " . he said that because of it i was vile and disgusting and he says that i need to take responsibility for it . he also posted it all online only he changed it to make it seem like i was cheating on him . and he said that digit  of the memories he has of me in the last five years are filled with misery . when i tell him what he ' s saying is absolutely horrible he responds by telling me that i ' m being disrespectful . and that i dont know how wrong i am . he said i shouldn ' t be allowed to be in a relationships with anyone . i don ' t deserve it . that he feels sorry for me because i dont have any sensibility . he even went as far as to play the popular card . everyone likes him better . blah blah . its all really horrible stuff . hes lucky that i dont believe him because that stuff can really break a person . i mean really break someone . theres so many other things . digit years worth of horrible things . i didn ' t realize how bad they were back then though . i think back then i believed them . now i dont because i know hell say just about anything to make me feel worthless .

14. that is so homophobic !

15. i agree . once the achievement hunters get their aps , everything will be back to somewhat normal .  the only real bad thing about leagues so far are the pve commanders . yeah , there ' s a ton of them  but on the flipside , they probably really want to help . it just so happens they get overwhelmed with all the things they need to do . they may have been used to running with their guild then decided to try it out on the server . i once commanded our guild run in wvw and it ' s really different when you ' re working with your guild and when you have pugs with you . with your guild , you know what they are capable of so you always know what to tell them . with pugs , there are a lot of probabilities with them  are they upleveled ? because they might not survive the first clash . are they here just for the karma  xp  loot ? then they won ' t follow instructions if you tell them to " stack " , " blast statics  might " , and so on and so forth because they would be like , " whatever man let ' s get this over with "
   (ID: 261413214c13676b8aee2ce20a47107c4ccfe6b8)

16. ok , i figured out how to do it , i deleted all the entities that i didn ' t know what they were and i was able to open my world ! thank you so so so so much !

   (ID: bb79791c3753a1fc8ece696b3835b0f59ddccc90)

18. sometimes i  m asked to judge science fairs . it  s so disappointing to see that teachers approve projects that have zero scientific merit and allow kids to waste their effort pursuing meaningless  findings .  the kids are so proud of their display and project and i  m put in the awkward position of explaining how it  s flawed . yet , if you don  t tell them , you  re no better than the adults that mislead and misinformed them .
   (ID: 7a74975099c43e606800d8a9205ec41703ec2a89)

19. dude , if you have an attractive so , let her show that shit off . you should take it as a compliment when other people want to fuck your girlfriend . if you really can ' t handle her style , then maybe she ' s not for you .
