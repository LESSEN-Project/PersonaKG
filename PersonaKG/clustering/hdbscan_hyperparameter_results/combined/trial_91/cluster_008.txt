1. this post is actually a pretty good start . whether you realize it or not , you ' re reaching out . now you need to go to a doctor , or a therapist , or whoever you feel comfortable with , and tell them all of the things that you have told us here . i ' m no doctor , so i can ' t say one way or the other whether or not you actually need medicine . but that ' s all the more reason to go talk to a real one . if you really do have depression , you might need meds . you wouldn ' t leave any other disease untreated , right ? as for the girl in the pic , i ' m guessing you look nothing like her . the hard reality is that you probably never will . everyone is different . you need to stop comparing yourself to other people , because you ' re only hurting yourself more . chances are , that girl has insecurities of her own . everyone does . but you can ' t let it control your life .

2. i don ' t have experience with cheating parents or spouses , at least not that i ' m aware . i do agree with you that is wrong and harmful to both women . however , if i were in your shoes , i would have to ask myself some questions . first , what do you want to accomplish by speaking with your mom ? you clearly cannot change her behavior by talking to her about it , as you have tried that . secondly , what kind , if any , relationship do you want with her ? if you intervene in some way call the wife , confront the man , etc , you will be further alienating your mom . and lastly , can you live with this knowledge and not intervene if that is the only way to save your relationship with your mother ? if you answer these questions honestly and with great contemplation or not rashly , i believe you will know what course you should take . good luck !

3. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .

4. i know you guys are gonna tell not be with someone who i can ' t trust you ' re goddamn right .  but hear me out . maybe we ' re just doing something wrong ? mmmm nope . you shouldn ' t date someone you can ' t trust .  i just wanna fucking know who she ' s talking to lol . bit controlling but okay . ask her if its that big of a deal .

5. i don ' t know about the falling in love and all that . but if you ' re looking for advice take it from someone digit years older than you . forget about her . don ' t even think about it anymore . you ' re young as fuck and there ' s plenty of women out there . and don ' t fall in love .

6. don  t blame yourself for being cheated on . no one deserves to be cheated on . it  s her being fucking shitty and don  t let anyone including yourself tell you otherwise

7. im gonna tell you , mate , taking your life only hurts the people around you . not one single person is thinking life would be better without you . high school is no determination factor anyway , life changes after high school and you can make life what you want it . you can start and entirely new life for yourself , you ' re moving on to how you want to impact the world . i know talking to someone isnt at the top of everyones lists when it comes to mental health but from experience , it really helps . reddit is a really good place to get your emotions out mate . there are lots of people on here with the same problems you ' re going through and we ' re trying to overcome it together . we ' re here for you , mate .

8. sounds like a rough situation , if s is really obsessed i guess not doing anything don  t help , so you got to take action . i would suggest telling s you don  t like her , and hope for the best .

9. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .

10. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .

11. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him

12. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .

13. yeah that ' s ridiculous . you ' ve been dating for less than a month and she constantly pesters you ! like jeez when did she start , week digit ? you ' re nta in this situation , i think a sit down discussion about it is definitely needed tho

14. it does take a lot of courage , but you have it in you . otherwise you wouldn ' t have made this post ! just know you ' re not alone . there ' s a whole community here that supports you . here ' s maybe an odd idea  instead of only looking at body types that you would want for yourself , try checking out all sorts of people with different body types . big , little , thick , thin . don ' t judge , just accept them for what and who they are . then after a time , try to find little things you appreciate in each one . maybe it ' ll help broaden your horizons a little , instead of being so focused on what you covet right now .

15. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

16. oof , as a woman i suggest you not to spoil women that much , some of us get used to get all we want and then it ' s really hard to get on track again . not my case , i made clear to my boyfriend we are equal and he can count on me as much as i can count on him . i suggest you to talk to her and give her an ultimatum , you should take care of her but she ' s abusing it and not thanking what you do for her . obviously you need to change this , and don ' t have any kids for now , neither more pets or expenses . that wouldn ' t be good for the kids or you .

17. long ass post but i ' ve read every single word of it . congrats on your successful transformation . leave while you can . you are still young and have a long way ahead of you . i really hate manipulative person and hope you find a better person . but i would suggest telling her about the divorce in advance if you don ' t want to hurt her too bad but even then , you wouldn ' t know what type of shit she ' ll pull . it ' s going to get better from now !

18. move out . do you know how many people have problems like this because they live together first ? he has no incentive to marry you . you ' re probably sleeping together and living exactly like you ' re married . so either you need to take all those privileges and perks away to motivate him or let go of being sensitive . not trying to be harsh . but you got yourself in a pickle here . honestly ask yourself if you ' re in his shoes , why should you go through the risk and trouble of getting married when you can have what you want ? why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free ? old saying

19. you gotta get out , this is the tip of the iceburg . if you want a red flag this is a huge one . as a matter of self preservation you get the hell out . been there it does not get better with time . don ' t be a schmuck

20. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .
