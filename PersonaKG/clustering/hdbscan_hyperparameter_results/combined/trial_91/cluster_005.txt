8. lol ! i liked it a lot , especially the sense of isolation and vulnerability you had playing as a regular soldier rather than a spartan . it also reminded me a bit of metroid prime , which is one of my all  time favorite games .

   (ID: 2a3f07a52e2fc5e79fd2ed52f4f601fa39ebe2e4)

11. so i just recently re  watched the digit  digit batman film . saga ? i ' d also just yesterday posted on lounge about how much batman forever didn ' t live up to my fond memories of it . i still liked batman returns even though i felt that it is more goofy than ' digit batman . i like michelle pfeiffer ' s selina kyle , devito is so good . it did bug me that the world ' s greatest dective didnt work out that his date was catwoman sooner . uhm , the siouxsie sioux song is also good although it ' s certainly not the best orginal song the franchise produced . instead of alien digit that i haven ' t seen yet you should definietly do the sync  points on batman returns , batman forever the purgitorio film and batman  robin . good soundtrack , bad almost everything else

12. digit  confirmed . so , what gets to happen is that we get to do the same thing when they get cars . i am about digit months away from realizing that dream .
   (ID: f8d48136e1ccbc739d4b7fb8db1e8f668422b145)

13. i agree with this digit  . when i put my blinker on to get over , more than half the time , the person i ' m trying to get over in front of speeds up to stop me from getting over . so i just quit using them .

14. would now be a bad time to tell you about rule digit ?
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

15. probably one of my favorite game . the combat and movement are fluid , and the maps are very well designed . if you want to play stealthily , the maps offer many different ways to achieve your goal . if you want to don ' t want to play stealthily , you get a large array of weapons and powers . just watch stealthgamerbr on youtube to see what i ' m talking about . great replayability , and the dlc that comes with this bundle is excellent as well  they ' re not just short missions , but lengthy sets of missions which introduce you to new characters and powers . the only drawbacks i can think of are that some people may not like the artstyle , and that people complain about some powers being op . also , if you ' re a completionist , finding all gold in every stage is a pain . for  digit , it ' s a must buy imo

16. digit is need for a nuclear winter . russia alone has about digit to digit
   (ID: b5bfc53fa7245451bad229f942e351fdc7360321)

17. everything is bullshit if you don ' t have an answer to it . personally you pick it if you can get bursted down a bit quickly , and there ' s probably digit key heroes that are pretty tanky and do quite some damage . other than that the attack range is so much better , you ' re illusions get it too and you can take t3 and barracks in like digit seconds

18. are you taking about trails in the sky digit or trails of cold steel digit because the english release of sky digit came out last year and the japanese release of cold steel digit came out last year and they usually take a couple of years to be translated . you can definitely start playing cold steel digit without having played any in the trails in the sky series . the first sky is only  digit at the moment but the other two are still somewhat expensive , by my standards at least . i haven ' t actually played the third sky , but i think the story is only somewhat related to digit and digit , in that it has the same characters but runs somewhat parallel to the story of digit and digit , which is a continuous story .

19. i would say digit or digit
