1. you really simply do not understand logic , do you ? let me spoon feed it to you , since you ' re such a little dumb baby  from your perspective , your beliefs are correct . which means you should be putting them out there . if you ' re right , you ' d be helping people . but you don ' t do that , because you ' re a fucking coward . from a logically sound perspective , however , your beliefs are completely unethical . why ? because you are selfish , and only give a fuck about your emotions while compiling them . as a result , you completely failed to base them on evidence , or reason . if you cared about logic , you wouldn ' t dare believe the bullshit you believe . doing so would be a fucking embarrassment . see , your confusion is what happens when you hide like a little cowardly fucking bitch . this is also what happens when your beliefs have such low standards  you aren ' t accustomed to needing to make sound evaluations , because you don ' t do that to yourself . you ' re logically fat and lazy . so now , you meet someone like me , and you can ' t see the differences between logical arguments that should be obvious simply because you never behaved like you ever had to . see ? those beliefs effected your behavior . they effected your abilities to use reason as a tool for discourse . and because those beliefs have low standards , you have low reasoning ability . if you demanded a high standard of yourself , you would have never made such a basic bitch mistake . see how i ' m right now ? see how beliefs effect behavior in unexpected ways ? you ' re welcome .

2. how cute , you think you know a thing about what people go through . try being bullied and shunned to an extent at digit different schools , 3rd grade until i went to college . oh , and you would all collectively call me a normie because i have an intimate relationship . don ' t assume you know a damn thing about any person who posts here because you simply dont .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

3. i apologise then . i see this a lot from trolls so i had a knee jerk recation . i ' ll tell ya , being white doesn ' t affect my job , my social life , or my relationships . racism happens , that shit is real , but it ' s never had any serious impact in my life .
   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

4. well did you ?
   (ID: eee9dc5129787c4d2a8fda055f09565efcf9322a)

5. ahh , now you ' re playing stupid , huh ? way to show intellectual honesty . really . well done . thanks again for displaying what fucking liars you all are . way to show , again , that you have to lie through your teeth just to feel like you aren ' t a bunch of fucking rats . seriously . thank you .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

6. i don  t understand this aversion to violence that you have . take electrical cars for instance , they  ve been around for decades and the only reason their use is not widespread is because of the influence of the car , oil , and car maintenance lobbies . cars cause , what , digit , digit  digit , digit deaths in the us yearly . is this not structural violence on a mass scale ? and how about if we were to apply this to big farming . syngenta , conagra , cargill , and monsanto now run all pretty much digit  of food production in the us . this has wreaked havoc on small family run farming operations as thousands of families have had to close their farms . is this not another example of structural violence ? there is no way to achieve the things you want  democratically  or without violence . the only way to achieve the things you want is to brutally and violently repress the ruling class , namely the purveyors of capital formation and accumulation within the transnational corporations . the transnational corporations will never relinquish their power and wealth willingly . to believe so amounts to liberal idealism .

7. you have a perceived notion on the us government ' should ' run . which you literally just proved my point . you don ' t understand how they actually work .
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

8. but reddit is a place where people care more about being morally right than factually correct . how dare you prove them wrong !
   (ID: d048a45810866f7b853972f50c2c2746bc339a21)

9. i feel like you invite this kind of opposition view to your thoughts when you post them unasked for in a sub called unpopular opinion . we ' re not talking about laws here , were talking about your unpopular opinion .
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

10. yes i  m fully aware , but through consistent elaboration then maybe i could help at least one person learn the truth and show them the difference . as long as just one person learns from me , then my efforts are all worth it
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

11. how can a person disagree with something they think is correct ?
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

12. this is an obvious joke
   (ID: c418fa452eafbca022ce1c49b521d4574aa77cd1)

13. i am trying to show you how i feel when you tell me to do something because of your " lord " i won ' t stop cursing until you give me a fucking reason other than a deity with a debatable existence said it isn ' t okay . why don ' t you try and help those over at atheism or at least get some questions answered by somebody smarter than me ? many people there are smarter than me .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

14. lets take a moment to appreciate how much you assumed i implied from my accusations of your implications . have fun with your lesson in reading into things
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

15. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

16. really ? you feel the need for personal attacks because i disagree with you ? well , how about you try understanding the sentence before you attack someone . let me help you " it ' s exactly why i oppose tax hikes right now "
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

17. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

18. funny , just like you chose to make yourself look bad , you could have just as easily ignored my comment .
   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

19. and you ' re the type of person who thinks so highly of themselves they can ' t even understand a simple joke . get your head out of your ass .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

20. but the left has a ' my way or the highway ' mentality do you not even realize how biased you just were ?
