1. this sounds like you need to talk to your so , you need to make it clear to him the way you feel and how you want to live your live .
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

2. stop arguing with your brother , and have a calm conversation with your mom . listen closely to her , without interruption and without formulating any rebuttals . try to understand her views , and verify you understand by repeating her exact words back to her . when you think both of you feel like you understand her point of view , then ask her questions . an example  if you could dictate your children ' s futures , what would they look like ? do your current actions help put that in place ? what do you think dad would say about this ? how can i help to alleviate your worries or whatever negative emotion she shares . next step , request a certain amount of time for you and her , but don ' t say that to think about what was discussed , and schedule when you can meet privately again . do the same process as above , but allow her to change her stance without confronting her about the change . just make sure you both understand how she feels and why she feels that way . now you can share with her your feelings and opinions , just keep it calm . i bet you two are not as far apart as you think .

3. he will find his own way . my sister still has a relationship with them but i am nc with my parents . it  s weird sometimes . but that  s what works for her and this is what works for me , and that  s ok . just give him hugs , and be there for him , because we have to choose our family very carefully  we were given such crappy ones ! sounds like you both are on the same page . and don  t ever give your ssn to anyone who asks . god , so many horror stories of nparents stealing their children  s identities and ruining their lives ! aack ! protect yourself !
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

4. i feel like im at edge because i honestly thought i had real willpower to stop and now here i am failing multiple times . constantly persuading myself to give in and juat have a drink and now i cant even last longer then digit days without a drink . its heart breaking and im afriad about how this has come to be . i juat dont know anymore

5. the short answer is , get in and be the doer , not the done to . if he ' s wishy washy , unless you ' re in super deep , consider the fact that you are the age you are and the people you spend time with rub off on and affect you with you wish them to or not . pull back , give him some space and give yourself some space to evaluate what you want from a relationship . it sounds to me like you want a lack of games and a proper commitment of " we are together and we love one another , so let ' s make this work " it doesn ' t sound like that ' s the case .
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

6. the same thing happened to me . i do believe that there are induviduals who misuse sm and take it too far crossing the line to rape . mine eased me into a light sm world . very light . made me trust him . told me all of these things . then when i was pulling away from him he went from digit  digit and choked me into a submissive state . when you fear for your life and that you won ' t wake back up the next time he chokes you until you pass out , you go into shock . or at least i did . i thought " i can ' t say no because if he doesn ' t get what he wants he will hurt me more " and that was a serious thing for me because i couldn ' t possibly have imagined that he wanted more . but he did . then he went right past sm and straight towards torture and humiliation . all without my consent . he knew exactly what he was doing . he knew from our previous discussions that i never would have allowed that to happen . he also knew me . so he choked me enough to make it happen for him . i ' m sorry you went through all that . sm can be really tricky , my personal experience aside . because i really don ' t have any . but i did do a lot of reading on it after my rape . to help me understand why . it takes a lot of trust . if someone goes against your comfort zones it is not a good sign . a sm shoukd always be respectful no matter what .

7. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

8. sounds to me like you ' ve been screwed over a lot and are making the best of your situation . sure , the person you live with is your mom but you ' re paying your share . you ' ve got a roommate you just happen to be related to . you ' re doing what you have to do to take care of your kid , no shame in it .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

9. " sucking it up " is a bad phrase to use imo . idk your life , but " accept " is a word that works for me . i am me , the world is the world . if you ' ve been sheltered , use every experience as a lesson that helps guide you in your journey exploring the world . going back to your bad trip , personally i think it ' s your body trying to tell you something . we have amazing , intuitive instincts that are buried within us but we ' re afraid when they try to tell us something . even if it ' s scary , you have to embrace what you feel so that you can get to know yourself a little better . baby steps are absolutely ok for this process .
   (ID: 2db14c004e6ef125f85aa3678978a5718eebd11a)

10. sounds like a rough situation , if s is really obsessed i guess not doing anything don  t help , so you got to take action . i would suggest telling s you don  t like her , and hope for the best .
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

11. a few things . clean your room . exercise every day . eat a non inflammatory diet . lots of veggies , legumes , lean meats , nuts with few carbs and no bread . take adaptogens like ashwaganda and rhodiola rosea to combat depression , anxiety and enhance cognition . meditate digit  digit minutes a day take a lot of initiative to contact people . work hard on yourself to be better groomed , behaved , mindful , successful or generous . fix your inner dialogue so your inner voice is more friendly and affirming and guides you to do things that you benefit from and allows you to move on from your mistakes .

12. did you ever consider that your own habits and personality are your roadblock to those things ? if you never make an effort to better yourself or even try how can you blame the world for your blunders ? nobody is depriving you to your right to anything . companionship isnt assigned , its something that is found , love is something that is developed along with intimacy . its not just something like equality and civil rights . theres not a chance in hell you could tell me that you cant find a single woman that you cant connect at least a little bit with and work into something more intimate if you want .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

13. well , i hope that you ' re still here . those friends that your referring to , those aren ' t the type you want to have . if they don ' t like you or your interests , that ' s their lost , not yours . if you don ' t mind me asking , why does your mom want you to move back in ? you may call her narcissist , but aren ' t all parents , in a way ? i would suggest you call her . if you kill yourself , it could destroy her . i wouldn ' t know , but maybe she wants you to move back in because she likes having around . maybe she needs some help , that is if she lives alone .
   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

14. yeah i get that . don ' t feel lost in your situation though . i can assure you that there are a few people , myself included , that can relate to what you ' re going through just now . it ' s extremely tiring but make sure you have an " escape " for yourself . it certainly made my situation better when i had something i could get lost in and alleviate the stress on myself .
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

15. not eat too much salt and get better sleep . sometimes a good adaptogen helps to keep the serotonin flowing , like rhodiola rosea . all in all it ' s usually an atrophied muscle you have to exercise . just like how people are full of shit when they say they can ' t run , focusing , socializing or managing can be learned because the brain is very plastic . just stick to subjects you enjoy and work to empathize with other people and listen to their stories . some people are simply boring or self centered , but there are also a lot of interesting people out there . like good books , you have to seek them out , and stick to being around them and then over time socializing because rewarding because there is commonality between you and the person you found . indeed , the beginning requires getting out of your comfort zone and making the effort . it is so worth it though .
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

16. you know , i  ve been at that point in my life where i wondered why i had so many failed relationships . but then i realized all of them had one thing in common . me . there  s a reason why we pick the partners we do . go to counseling because you want to be the best you that you can be , not because she made the call . go for you . i hope you do it .

17. oh it is several things . the first thing you do is completely cut off all of the energy vampires in your life . try to figure out if somebody is making you feel bad . maybe they aren ' t trying to . that being said , many people are subtly abusive and you might not know that what you are feeling is not you , it is somebody else ' s toxic emotions that they have projected on to you . learn about adaptogenic herbs and supplements and start an adaptogenic stack . loneliness sometimes is just stress , fatigue or a chemical imbalance . i recommend , n acetyl l tyrosine rhodiola rosea , ashwagandha  ksm  digit , tumeric  curcuminoid with pipeline , magnesium citrate , fish oil and vinpocitine . make sure you are listening to positive people , positive music , positive messages and are engaged in plenty of self affirmation . then you want to reach out to people . being lonely means that you have to project onto others what you wish to receive so you have to give the right people your time , love and attention . loneliness sometimes isn ' t helped by being around more people even though i recommend this but is more ameliorated by improving your relationship with yourself . maybe you need to be a better friend to yourself ? do you think you should read more ? maybe exercise  jog  lift more ? do you think you should listen to more music or get out more ? do you need to clean or decorate your apartment ? do an all the above approach and remember that you can always give yourself permission to feel loved and cared for without a material manifestation to validate it ! often people feel warmth , generosity , compassion and admiration first , and then the outside world reflects that feeling . try to exercise your mind with meditation and being to dim certain thoughts and emotions . if you can fake happiness , after a while it becomes a muscle that builds over time .
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

18. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .

19. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

20. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .
