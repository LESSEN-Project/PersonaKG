--- PER-CHAT (7069 points) ---

1. because i felt like my body failed , or was broken , especially since i already had one child , so of course i should be able to have another . so somehow that made me responsible . grief is a hell of a thing .
   (ID: c0c5a7c74c41387a99afab68d3e9fe0bfab4b8b9)

2. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

3. One of my favorite things is yaoi.

4. hmmmm . what would be a good place ? get everyone to head out to a wheeling spot like hot springs ? i ' m not coming up with a good one between me and you .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

5. thanks all . i ' ve done a large scale crown lift on the tree , so hopefully shouldn ' t be too bad with the light . it ' s a neighbour ' s tree but i took as much advantage as i dared when they said i could do what i wanted to it . the area got a fair bit of sun in the summer last year , before i cut the tree . so will risk it , i don ' t really have much option to go elsewhere with the plots . the daikon  green manure idea sounds good . but can i resist the urge to get growing veg this year ?
   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

6. as a teacher , i have usually had the lower echelon of students in my classes . it is fairly frequent that i ' ll be cussed at , most of the time because i did something the kid didn ' t like . i ' ll just reply with something like , " why thank you john smith , that is the nicest thing anyone has ever called me . i appreciate that compliment , i really like you , too " sometimes it pisses them off more because they don ' t have control over my actions . after all , when cussing out a teacher , they usually expect an explosion from the teacher , which classmates will film to make vines or other social media videos . most kids will usually realize that they aren ' t going to win and just mutter a " fuck you " and then go back to doing something less inappropriate .
   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

7. because people can sit behind a screen and not get punched in the face which is an unethical thing to do to someone who doesn  t agree with you .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

8. you are a machine . thanks so much for cranking out this content so consistently fast at a high quality .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

9. i ' m proud of my body and how much hardwork , time and effort i ' ve dedicated to the gym . i can ' t really talk to anyone about it because i ' ll come off as conceited or something . but i ' m so proud of myself .
   (ID: 4e289af5e18133c4578deba659b7e1d2784a925d)

10. two or three times a month i dream about very dirty public restrooms , or stalls with no doors , or toilets up on pedestals . these are extremely vivid and realistic dreams and i remember several details about most of them . i didn  t know how common it was until my dad said he had the same dream , so i did a google search and it turns out it  s fairly common . something about being insecure and vulnerable .
   (ID: c0c5a7c74c41387a99afab68d3e9fe0bfab4b8b9)

11. jerry ? is that some kind of slang for moon  sex or something ? can you use it in a sentence ? is it " i ' ll do you in the jerry " or " turn around and let ' s jerry " or what ?
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

12. people lying to you about how great they are and how deep and full of significance and meaning their life is . nobody cares about how your grandmother grew tomatoes instilling your love of fresh produce , or how your mother ' s use of seasonings opened up your senses , or your soccer coach touching you filled you with a love of sausage . i just could not remember if i needed digit tbs or digit of flower for a basic roux . please put the recipe at the top and your poorly written life story at the bottom so i can choose to not read with out being annoyed by having to scroll through it .
   (ID: a76c6dcf1c50896c141e83f47bc82d2256c9265a)

13. ok . i kinda get the impression that you want a sexual relationship with your mother . which i personally find abhorrent .
   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

14. just take time talking with him . as a male , performance anxiety can certainly be tough . however , with the right support , it can be a great dynamic . tell him and show him that finishing early one of the main fears is perfectly normal and will take practice to control . nobody is born to be a pornstar in terms of performance right away ! for example , if he finishes early , i found the greatest confidence booster wasn  t necessarily my partner saying  it  s perfectly fine  rather showing me and reassuring me that she viewed it as me being so attracted to her that i couldn  t hold back . after we both took time to learn each other  s sexual preferences and finding the balance , the sex is great and i don  t have to worry about performance anymore the nervousness was simply caused by me thinking about societal  norms  and their implied notion of me having to perform perfectly or my woman would get bored and be unimpressed .
   (ID: e7516540d2045135f43a4a7c61f0bd88856c8ff4)

19. glad it  s helpful  i  m fairly  new  as a catholic and not a cradle catholic either so i can empathize . there  s a really good video series from  dynamic catholic   they are currently doing this series during lent and i find it helpful  they  re 3ish minute daily snippets . it  s easier for me to listen to a video on my phone daily than most other things . certainly i don  t say the rosary enough . a couple days ago the video was about the  lie we tell ourselves   it hit me that i lie to myself too , sometimes , and you might as well . it really is more about saying yes to god everyday , even if we muck up and we do , and he knows this ! hope this link works . ? best wishes
