2. people point out to me that i am soft and kind and i guess that sets me apart from other people ? but thats only digit of my personalities .

4. are these people and their one sided twitter beefs a joke or something ? this phd person has to be satire . then there  s the troll who keeps trying to stir up stuff with rackets for attention i guess ? maddox needs better foot soldiers on social media , the cringe is unreal .

5. depending on how many died of the catriona , it might turn out that ciri killed more innocent people than anyone else in the books or games . i guess she kind of balanced that out by saving the world , but still .

6. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .
