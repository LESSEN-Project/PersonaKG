4. the regional pokemon are supposed to be something special you get for traveling . i ' d always assumed that , once trading came out , it would become something that players who didn ' t have the means  opportunity to travel could get by engaging with other community members . this was kinda the expectation i had , and i knew a lot of other people that shared it . having it come out as a special event was kinda cool , but it changed farfetch ' d from this cool , insanely rare thing to another event pokemon . farfetch ' d went from being more rare than a legendary to essentially another pikachu in a hat .
