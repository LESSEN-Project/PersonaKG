1. i think people that use no true scotsman fallacy to distance themselves from " extremist muslims " will generally have no problem using it again with " stupid muslims " , so don ' t expect instant deconversions from people you intend to debate . still , it may help with people on the fence , go for it .

4. you ' re suppsoed to release the ble  whatever before you push the plunger down . so tie off  register  release the belt . if you leave the belt on andyou inject more iquid int he vein then the vein is under more pressure . when you release it the blood flow continues and the drugs you inject is carried off with the blood that is pumping through the vein . or don ' t use one if you ' re able to do it withoout , it ' s not a necessary step just a helpful tool . the bruising could be a result of that if you didn ' t release it . what also helps if you bruise easily is to put pressure on the injection site . the alcohol wipe that you use to clean your arm with before iv you can also use to push down onthe site when you are pushing the needle out . this will stop the bleeding faster , so also less blood with leak from your vein causes bruising under your skin . but most important things are to use new needles , don ' t use the same spot too often and pick a different spot to iv so the previous places can heal a bit before you use them again . lave the site witht he trackmarks a lone for a bit , let it heal .

7. when your dad consigned that loan let ' s use a  digit , digit example here for  digit , digit , he guaranteed the bank all of that money would be paid back , it wasn ' t the payments weren ' t made , the car was repossessed . they took it to an auction to try to get some of their money back , they have no use for a car . if the car only sold for  digit , then you dad still owes them  digit for the difference since he guaranteed that the  digit , digit he guaranteed would be paid back . now that they have had to repossess it , on top of that  digit , the bank has incurred additional expenses to try to recover their money . since your dad guaranteed the loan and it hasn ' t been paid , the bank is entitled to recoup the expenses they have already paid out to get their money back . don ' t fight it . this will only incur more expenses that your dad will have to pay . find out how much they will settle for and just settle it
