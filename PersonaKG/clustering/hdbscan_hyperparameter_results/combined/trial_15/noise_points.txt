17. you really not comparing yourself to another when someone in your class is smarter and you tell yourself you are stupid . you are only comparing your brain to that person ' s brain . there ' s so much more to you than that one part of yourself . if you find yourself comparing just one part of yourself to another and getting down on yourself , you need to compare the whole person or at least more than digit characteristic . for example , that person is smart . but they don ' t have the same hobby that i have had for years which i have gotten so many compliments about .
   (ID: 1ebb4643f7e1e4d41ee2503d9b5d94ed0224c96b)

18. the hard work one is debatable . but i do have a clue about the bible and jesus , i just used logic to determine that neither are correct and worth believing in . as for the locker room stuff , i don ' t know about you but i just wanted to change and go with my day since i am straight . kinda goes against the bible thing though if you did what you are talking about in the locker room .
   (ID: 388a9b7cd52305ad65297c63f4c50272c2661e4c)

19. lol  nope , generally they gitchya before you even know they ' re there . i actually find intoxicated humans and old folks contribute far more too my workload . maybe if spiderman was a drunk geriatric australian we ' d be on to something .
