1. really don  t think about that aspect much . you have a job to do , so that  mission focus  stays . i remember freaking out the first time mortals fell near our fob , i panicked and ran for a bunker . a few months later i wouldn  t even bother grabbing my helmet and kept walking to lunch chow .

2. a clear  cut answer to that would be great . i don ' t think one exists . the correct information has been out a long time .

3. try to waste their time as much as possible by pretending you don ' t understand what they are talking  asking about

5. yeah maybe with mammals and stuff but i don  t think snakes really understand the concept of help . from what i know they  re left on their own from the time they hatch and don  t receive any kind of assistance from mom . it  s possible but i doubt it

6. they sort of fade in time , you can get creams that are meant to help . but totally vanish ? don ' t think so .

7. my mom says ,  it  s because you  re on that game all the time .  while that  s partially a factor , i  m on the game so i don  t go into mental breakdowns every night

8. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .

9. yeah it ' s annoying but over time it does get better . it will always be there but you get used to it . i don ' t worry about it much nowadays . if i ever get a flare up or more pain than usual i do the exercises over a week or two and it settles down again .
