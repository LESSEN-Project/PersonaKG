3. i get social anxiety too sometimes when i ' m in larges groups of people when i smoke . i don ' t know of a way to counter that , but alcohol makes me much more sociable , while when i get high i ' m just chill and spaced out . try smoking alone a few times to get used to the feeling of it , and try to smoke with people you know well i would suggest .

6. surely there ' s comfort in knowing there ' s absolutely nothing you can do about the eventual heat death of the universe . it ' s out of your control so just let it be . you don ' t know that this universe doesn ' t collapse down to a single point and birth anew with another big bang . either way i ' ll be long dead so it matters not

7. it appears to be . i sit on the sidelines a lot . if i don ' t know the answer to a question , i give my fingers a rest . if people are truly struggling to find a solution after a while , i ' ll always qualify my reply with " i ' m just guessing here " or " maybe you can try this , but i haven ' t done it myself . i ' m not one of those guys who can ' t say " i don ' t know . denying my ignorance of something just gets in the way of overcoming it .
