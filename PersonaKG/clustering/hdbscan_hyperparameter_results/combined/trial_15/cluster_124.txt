1. i understand where the op is coming from because if ea allows this , then what is stopping say a good fifa player to be paid by a bad fifa player to get them in top digit . doesn ' t seem fair for the rest of us .

6. i dont know about pudding because even if she becomes good she doesnt have any purpose in strawhat crew but saying that katakuri will be joining im thinking u are trolling otherwise he is the strongest after big mom and lets say her security guard and if u say about her realitonship with the kids i think is the same will all of them they fear her and they are tools for her acomplishments , so katakuri doesnt seem mistreated or anything .
