2. similar ! i don  t care if my friends go without me but i do care when they insult me . i don  t really care who else insults me whether it be a stranger or family , but if my friends insult me i will think about it for at least two decades and become extremely insecure as a result of it .

4. i ' d also recommend showing your friends some of the really entertaining old films i ' d go with rear window , charade , and tootsie having friends who are into the same stuff as you can be very helpful , just don ' t start them off with really obscure stuff because you risk turning them off to old stuff if you show them something like the seventh seal or stalker first
