2. being in apprenticeship and doing a job about your studies . so you study , you work for good experiences and you have a wage .

3. england are very good at starting things , bands , tv shows , arguments , wars etc and brits have a unique way of doing things which seems to work . maybe it  s our personality , humour , mindset who knows but you can  t deny that a lot of good comes out of it .

4. choose your poison that ' s a nice test to give to people that are literally incapable of telling good from evil , because you made them in such a way . doesn ' t sound very flattering about god ' s character , is it ?  christianity at least imho is a soothing white lie i prefer calling it opiate of the masses . it helps one notice both great utility as a painkiller and horrible side effects .   x200b

5. i felt the same way in the past . but maybe the fact there is no objective point is a good think ! you can choose to do something or absolutely nothing .

6. you can be on your way of hitting rock bottom and nobody will warn you . people will view you as human filth , but nobody will say anything . in their eyes you are past redemption . ask yourself if your life is on a good course .

7. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .

8. if that was my sister i would do the good old " listen here you little shit . " talk . i broke many people ' s bubbles this way . i would tell her off , break everything into her face about how embarassing she actually is . you do everything she says and ignore her tantrums , try to not accidentally push her buttons etc and expect change . it ' s not happening and you ' re giving her more control over you . iron fist for people like your sister !
