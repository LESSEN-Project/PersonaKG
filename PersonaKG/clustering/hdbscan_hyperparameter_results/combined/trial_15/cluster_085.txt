1. omg . murder and war are just examples of the flexibility of human morals . i knew some idiot would get wrapped around the axle over some inconsequential minutia and miss my point . it was simplistic to make a point . morality is completely relative based . mistakes are made when i apply my morals to your situation . fuck , people , get out of the fucking weeds . op wasn ' t asking about specific moral issues just morality in general . goddammit .

4. because you were obviously born here , have an excellent command of english and you ' re an aussie reddit user , so i ' d imagine reasonably well informed and educated and likely , left leaning . i ' m making assumptions here just as you make assumptions about these people and their situation . i ' m assuming you aren ' t working because you ' re picky about what you ' ll do to earn a dollar , consider yourself above physical labour and simply working hard , seeking opportunities where you can find them . or the most likely assumption is that you ' re just damn lazy .
