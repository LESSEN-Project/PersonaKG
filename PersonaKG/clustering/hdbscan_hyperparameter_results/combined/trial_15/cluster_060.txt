1. actually i ' m really sad i thought of this . it ' s just awful . who would want to go through that with the cast of any typical movie ? no matter how attractive a given actor is , there ' s always that one scene where they visit their parents or something . i couldn ' t do it . limiting it to just human adults because , just because , the worst character cast to have to fuck would probably be the silence of the lambs .  shudders
