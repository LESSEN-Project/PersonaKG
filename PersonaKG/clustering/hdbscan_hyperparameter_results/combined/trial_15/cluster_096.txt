1. i ' m afraid that i really know nothing about the industry , except as a watcher . it seems like netflix is growing and is vastly expanding its home  grown content , so going that route would certainly be a valid one . best of luck !

2. didn ' t  pics used to have a rule along the lines of " the picture has to be interesting independent of its title " or something like that ? even then , there was no moderation of the sob stories , but now i don ' t even see that rule on the sidebar anymore . this sub is really going to shit

3. don ' t get it if you ' re not sure you ' re going to like it . remember you can back out anytime . even when they put the stencil on and it ' s not what you really wanted , speak up .
