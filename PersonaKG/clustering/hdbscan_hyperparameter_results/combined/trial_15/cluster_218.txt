1. life is cruel to men in ways women just won ' t understand . oh fucking get over yourself . when you have to deal with  periods , pregnancy , sexual assault , harassment , constantly being afraid around men , not knowing whether you ' re going to get taken seriously by the police or if they ' re going to rape you too , constantly being maligned for being not sexually active enough or to sexually active , or being told you ' re not pretty enough , or being told you ' re too fat or too skinny or too literally anything , and constantly being told to " smile sweetie " these people have no fucking clue what they ' re talking about . pathetic scum .

5. the photos are photos of my kid and the boyfriend eg my kid going down a slide on his lap etc . i can see why she values the photos  but i think it is unnecessary to share them in this context as the only people in this group chat who these photos are of any relevance to is herself . nobody else in the group chat even knows the bloke except my in laws who have met him once or twice .

6. it ' s called " generalization " and it happens for everything . but yeah , if people are going to piss you off because you play a certain game , you really shouldn ' t be talking to those people .

   (ID: 14bd1366b004b74cfd8c9cb269849740d12cff80)

8. if you hold people to impossible standards , you ' re going to be disappointed . what if the perfect man for you isn ' t exactly " hollywood handsome ? " you ' re excluding a lot of people because you ' re too picky . also , you might not be as great as you think . if you ' re so great and you ' re still single , there might be a reason . maybe your personality .
