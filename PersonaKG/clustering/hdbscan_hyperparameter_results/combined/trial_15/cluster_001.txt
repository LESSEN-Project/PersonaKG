1. talk to him about it . if he seems to dislike it as much as you do then i  m sure you can find a common ground of when in the hectic schedules it  s more likely to happen if either of you initiate .  dry  spells happen in every relationship at some point and it  s important to talk about it and reassure him it  s not a guilt trip rather seeking open feedback because you feel so strongly about it .
