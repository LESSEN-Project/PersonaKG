3. well  known fact that devs pay attention to this sub  where did you learn that well known fact ? we get bugs posted here and fixed within hours when they weren ' t submitted to the official forums . also big hint valve employees commenting on reddit posts about the state of upcoming changes  bug fixes  explanations about seemingly random changes .  how would it be more convenient for the patch team to sift through endless shitposts to find bug reports instead of reading them in a dedicated forum . logic ? because they obviously don ' t " sift through " reddit posts looking for bugs . they check reddit , and if they see a bug post then they check it , or don ' t see a bug post then leave reddit . it is more convenient because reddit has a much higher userbase and so they get a higher sample of issues from looking at comments and can help figure out what causes the issue . all this took less than digit seconds for me to think of so . logic ?

6. yeah i was reading his post and was unable to even answer what the third perk on a shotgun was . he first said it was two shot and then anti armour and then digit  strength which i don  t think is even possible . he should be reported to mods but in my experience they dont do shit anyway

7. that ' s not how i works . i don ' t see every meme that has ever been on the frontpage . i looked now , didn ' t see it so i decided to post it . it ' s that easy

8. can i ask how you are funding your education currently ? i want to get back into post  grad stuff but can ' t fathom a financial method in order to do so .

9. fuck them . even the ones who post spoilers without context . even if you post that meme , i don ' t want to go in the cinema expecting those things .

10. the post clearly says the point . 400ms lights , in response to consoles extra delay with frames and guard switch makes the lights unhealthy for the game , it promotes spamming and ' lucky ' interruptions of combos . i didn ' t go from " this to that " , it ' s all apart of the discussion , if you ' re not following it don ' t comment ? and as i said before the party for lights arent consitant enough to keep up with the dmg that lights do . i mentioned orochi because his lights are nasty , you can whiddle and opponent down in digit light combo strings , let alone if you mix anything in .

11. i know that anything i post here generally stays at digit upvotes , if you do want upvotes and often more comments on your pics post in penis or cock , maybe even mangonewild .
