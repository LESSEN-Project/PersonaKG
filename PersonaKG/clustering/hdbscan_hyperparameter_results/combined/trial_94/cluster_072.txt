7. you should see his previous speeches where he essentially generalized the population of mexico as a bunch of rapists , murderers , and thieves . i can ' t figure out the exact reason , but this has to be a smoke screen . someone , somewhere is doing something diabolical , but we ' re fixated on trump and what he will say next . tl  dr illuminaughty touched my body .

14. if a rubber ball filled with helium is placed on the incline , it will not roll . if a ball of glue is placed on the incline , it will not roll . almost nothing ever has a single cause . most things have their entire light as their cause , and it ' s usually nonsensical to consider something to be a one true cause of an event . this is the first flaw i see in your definition of " cause . another flaw i see is  nowhere in the naive definition does it say everything must have a cause . yet your argument hinges on this .
   (ID: fae28587bce17296589bf92d656ad68ee32601d6)

18. from the epilogue of the book , professor pieixoto says they narrowed the commander of the handmaid on the tapes down to either waterford or judd , and they went on to say " judd devised the particicution , realizing that it would release the pent  up anger of the handmaids . pieixoto says that particicutions became so popular that in gilead ' s " middle period " they occurred four times a year . judd also came up with the notion that women should control other women . pieixoto says that no empire lacks this " control of the indigenous by members of their own group " so yes , the women are living under the control of the men  but the men were pitting the women against each other .
