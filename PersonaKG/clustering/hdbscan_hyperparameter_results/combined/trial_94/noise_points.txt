   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

5. yup . today my extremely smart and logical mom said that maybe comey isn ' t as clean as he looks . she sent me an article that talked about how he didn ' t take notes during a digit hour clinton interview or something . i told her so what ? he said he didn ' t take notes except for unusual situations and trump put him in an inappropriate situation . i ' m finding one of the problems is that she knows how to use snopes to see through fake news , but a lot of this stuff isn ' t fake , it ' s just biased so much that it ' s lost all sense in reality . did comey attend a digit hour clinton interview and not take notes ? probably . does that mean he ' s not clean ? i don ' t understand where an idea like that would even come from . they just say the magic word " clinton " and all of a sudden any kind of association becomes magically worse than trump . i don ' t even particularly like clinton but the amount of hatred for her is insane .
   (ID: abbe051c76bbb939d8594349cac549cb5435920d)

   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

14. i make music . my advice is no matter how " bad " you think you sound compared to whoever your current favorite artist is , and no matter how much you want to give up , if it ' s your passion ? dont stop . eventually you will make something so beautiful , you ' ll say to yourself " wow , did i seriously make that " , and later in life you will come back to those artists you loved and say " huh , i actually am as good as them . it ' s a process . and some of us are slow learners . but if you love it ? don ' t give up on it .

16. personal preference  rest . there is no reason for you to swap if you really dont want to but you might aswell try and see if you like others more . a different crosshair literaly changes the whole way the guns feel . starting with a simple dot to weird crosshairsettings . fool around , copy others and see what suits you best . as for me . coming from digit . digit i really need someone similar to that .
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

17. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .

18. " i ' m serious . there is a serious crack through the central weight  bearing support of the island . what is the repair protocol for that ? " i frown . i have been on this island since the beginning , digit . i was involved in designing these 3d printed plastic islands as rising oceans dominated needed living space . the recycled plastic designs are eco  friendly and include an airport as well as digit surrounding islands , which house digit , digit people . the island system was exactly what those of us on the coast needed . five minutes ago i was dreaming of retirement confident my home would last for digit years or more . this entry  level engineer , mark england , was risking his job by telling me , the lead engineer for the entire chain , that our home was close to falling apart . could i really have missed this ? " there is no repair protocol . the protocol in that situation would be evacuating everyone off the island and recycling the plastic . can you show me what you saw ? " he nods and we walk down two floors into the basement of the maintenance building . i unlock the door to the hull of the island . we step out into a wide expansive room . the flood lights click on from a motion sensor and we each grab a high  powered flashlight . we walk down steel steps to a charging dock for electric scooters and get on . he leads me for digit minutes into the expanse . i watch the grid numbers pass by and can imagine the streets above us . the island is beautiful . it has no heavy motor vehicles for safety and weight reasons , so the young use electric scooters and the elderly use electric wheelchairs . bicycles still haven ' t gone out of style . the size of the community makes it a bit of an idyllic small town , although there is flow to and from the other islands and the central airport . the harmonious city planning is enhanced further by the fact that you can see the ocean from nearly anywhere on the islands . we arrive at grid g7 , an important load bearing area with many more support columns than elsewhere on the island . mark shines his flashlight between two flood lights at the massive ridge that forms the spine of the structure . i see it immediately . there is a massive crack forming directly in the middle of the support . i know what lies above that crack . exactly in that position is the connecting road between this island and the central airport island . each island is connected to stabilize the structure in the ocean and even one being compromised could create a horrible chain reaction in bad weather . " thank you for showing me this . you can go . " " what ? " he raises his voice slightly , " what ' s going to happen ? should i evacuate ? " " no . don ' t raise any alarm yet . people need to be told through the right channels when a plan is in place . " he squints at me , frowning , then nods and drives away on the scooter . i pull out my cell phone and call mayor richardson . " jacobs ? what is it ? " he seemed annoyed to hear from me , understandable given the coming election . " there is a serious breach in the hull . potentially catastrophic . we may need to evacuate all islands . " " what ? you ' ve got to be kidding . you know i have an election coming up . it ' ll have to wait until after then . " i hear a click as he hangs up . richardson is completely self  serving , of course he would see this as a threat to his campaign . i call another number . the governor . " jacobs ! good to hear from you , son . " his loud voice makes me pull the phone away from my ear . " we need to have a drink sometime , boy ! " " sir , we should , but this is actually a serious professional call . we are having a problem on the islands . i think the island print had a flaw . all the structures may be compromised . " " now jacobs , have you been working too hard ? the island program has been a huge success . sounds like you need to retire already ! " his loud guffaw echoes in the phone . " you eggheads crunched those numbers a thousand times . i ' m sure it ' s fine ! is there anything else ? " " sir , i really dont  " " nonsense ! and i won ' t hear another word about it ! " he shouts . " i am connecting you to my secretary . she will schedule us a time for drinking whiskey and playing pool . relax . " jazz music takes over the line and i hang up . i flip through my phone to recent calls and i find the call from a unrecognized number , two hours ago . i call it . " mark ? " i say when he answers , " get ready and get off the island . i ' m telling everyone tomorrow . "

19. leaving cupboards and drawers open is a man thing . we ' re too busy to close them , i think .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

20. i like to solve problems . if someone complains about something to me , i ' m ready to jump in and fix it . apparently , people enjoy the act of complaining , and me leaping in to correct the issue startles them or something . i ' ve had people even tell me , " i don ' t want your help , i just want you to listen " . it ' s really difficult for me to just let people whine .
