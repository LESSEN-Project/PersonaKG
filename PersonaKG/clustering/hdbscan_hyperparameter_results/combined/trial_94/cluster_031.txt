1. ok . though a subreddit is only as strong as its hallowed parameters , and is only as worthy as its erudite membership , one still seeks that spark of humanity , that intangible whisp of a soul existing beneath the unyielding tradition of syntactical perfection . tragically , one would be on a fool ' s mission , and would be reminded of his folly in a manner most brusque . in a way , such bitter truth is its own reward , sharpening the rose  tinted myopia of the naive optomist so that he is able to alter his path before it leads him off the precipice .
   (ID: 5b02e2fd29e743c4c80de2b0919a03d95400c23a)

2. had to google this , as i had no idea what op was asking . i should have guessed , though . it ' s a porn series . a more general way of asking is  have you ever fucked a taxi driver or medical professional in their vehicle  office ?
   (ID: 73a501f273781aa2c0deb878ecb02dcab3a9d4d3)

5. if i were to stay with her , i would try my best to give her attention back and be the best boyfriend i could be . that  s not how i could see myself as an asshole . the way i could , would be me losing my patience and leaving in two months .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

14. no , he ' s not . unlike satan , trump is real . he ' s not a threat because he ' s evil or out to watch the world burn while he cackles . he ' s a threat because he ' s out only for his own power and is unwilling to compromise on anything or admit any sort of mistakes like his general pershing claims . he lies constantly . not in the way other politicians do , either . he lies about meaningless bullshit that embarrasses him when disproved like lying about being invited on talk shows and major issues that can place the us in a tenuous situation like lying about how the us is in a prime position to rain hell down on north korea , when the navy hadn ' t changed it ' s readiness level . he is uneducated on what it takes to be president , he is a horrible businessman , he has never been proven to have any knowledge of foreign affairs , he places his own family in positions of authority they have no qualifications for , and he is a massive hypocrite . he ' s blatantly unqualified for the job he has . he needs to go , as soon as possible . anyone with eyes can see that .

17. the best frozen pizza is the one that gets you laid . here ' s my story  i was wandering through wal  mart when i came across a rather attractive female . as we passed , i shot her a smile and noticed a frozen pizza in her cart . thinking quickly , i made my way to the frozen pizza section and grabbed a freschetta pizza . i made my way over the sharpie markers , opened a pack , and wrote my name and phone number on the pizza box . i then tracked her down , told her freschetta was a better pizza and handed her the box with my digits on it . two days later she calls and invites me in for pizza . although we never had any pizza , i did get immediately introduced to her bedroom . freshchetta gets the ladies wetter .
