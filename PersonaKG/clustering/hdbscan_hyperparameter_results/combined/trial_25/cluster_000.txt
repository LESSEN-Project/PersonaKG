   (ID: 8bc3c38873da8df8d450deb17fd3c4a602037c65)

2. sounds like you had it rough in hs , sorry to hear . i did to , but eventually you grow up and realize none of that matters
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

3. you come across as such an entitled douche , just because your opinions are different from others . doesn ' t make them wrong . get over yourself , ever think you ' re part of the problem with society today ? such a hypocrite
   (ID: 059c976738098229106db9c4736116cbb2f47eb8)

4. i know it ' s someone else since you replied with decency . just find it comical how my own view and something that should affect no one still offends people . it ' s a pathetic culture we have going on .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

5. what do you mean , really ? is this not the explain it to me like i ' m digit years old ? is there really a question so obvious that saying " really " is necessary ?
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

6. sounds a lot like my story , honestly . your best bet is to talk to her about it . don ' t do what i did and hide it , it ' ll probably come back . digit divorces , digit years old , a ton of self esteem issues later and i ' m just starting the transition process now .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

7. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

8. it sound that those people in your life are holding you back and that isn  t good for mental health . i  m not saying you should get rid of them but certainly make them aware that your life is more than chores or work and everyone needs a hobby and shouldn  t have to hide it .
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

9. a few things . clean your room . exercise every day . eat a non inflammatory diet . lots of veggies , legumes , lean meats , nuts with few carbs and no bread . take adaptogens like ashwaganda and rhodiola rosea to combat depression , anxiety and enhance cognition . meditate digit  digit minutes a day take a lot of initiative to contact people . work hard on yourself to be better groomed , behaved , mindful , successful or generous . fix your inner dialogue so your inner voice is more friendly and affirming and guides you to do things that you benefit from and allows you to move on from your mistakes .
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

10. what i thought the question meant was something different , not all this " social justice warriors " nonsense . also , the cop thing i said happens very often in big cities .
   (ID: 504068c33194e1261903c2e0b19c42fc1d06b0a2)

11. you have only proven that you do not know what you are saying regarding this subject . may you never know what it  s like to be forced to fight a war or be put in a cage . are you a brit ? still mad about the american revolution ? imperialist twat , how funny .
   (ID: 4776f36398122cafa421393accf6939d82603a44)

12. calling me a fool for giving you advice ? if that ' s how you treat your daughter no wonder she talks back to you and treats you badly . you literally described your own child as a " fucking ass  hole " your digit year old daughter . jesus christ . the stuff you have described makes you look awful . and your ex  husband never shaped her like that especially when your the one " looking after " her for the majority of the week .
   (ID: 4bddcbadec311f472e8b62614b7394e14eb1d7ac)

13. i can think you should be honest with your feelings . i say with experience and to ignore or overlook it can be more destructive than anything else . if she genuinely likes you , she ' ll come back . if it ' s just the physical stuff the friendship will fizzle out . that ' s the worst part though . fwbs ruin good friendships most of the time .
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

14. tale a day . sit down and talk . spend all the time finding something easy to talk about . don  t let her leave . if she gets mad tell her why , explain very clearly why you  re sitting her down and just talking all day . let her know that you are just worried . this isn  t her problem alone , it  s very much about both of you and you need to make her understand that the main reason you get in a relationship is to help each other and be happy . take all the time you can without hurting your own mental health and spend it with her . i hope you and your so will get past this and go forward even happier than ever .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

15. haha just fucking with you buddy . couldn ' t help myself . my advice , ignore the haters , there will be plenty of people that agree and disagree with you . people are going to troll regardless of opinion .
   (ID: 31d924f098e0871341a799d7a5777fb635f53b34)

16. how can a person disagree with something they think is correct ?
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

17. lets take a moment to appreciate how much you assumed i implied from my accusations of your implications . have fun with your lesson in reading into things
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

18. i would recommend advice for this , but i ' ll try to help as well anyway i think you ' re just friends by convenience . you ' re on the same team , you live near each other and give each other lifts , but beyond that , he has better friends and you don ' t . i ' ve been in that situation , there ' s not much you can do except to to find other , better friends , and accept that that ' s where your relationship is at . if you ' re scared to do things around him , find other friends and don ' t value his opinion of you so highly , that way if he does judge you , who cares ? as a rule , if a friend makes you feel uncomfortable in some way when you ' re around them , get out , find a better person to spend your time with   x200b    x200b
   (ID: c1af2a10f968ba6f52d825dbf8fc9b8210db72ba)

19. idk if i  ve had this problem but it sounds extremely similar . this is what i did  what it sounds like to me is that you constantly have judgements hanging over you . it sounds bad too if it  s everything you say or do and i  ve been there . think , is it your thoughts or is it just thoughts you think other people are having ? if it  s the second one , relax . it  s better if you think about nothing or what  s going on during your day or whatever . just don  t think about what other people might think of you because that is going to affect every single one of your actions . i hope i somewhat helped .
   (ID: 7a36b5607ec030b33a99723097f6d67b04c38d99)

20. you probably don ' t have a clue what it entails . calling one out for stupidity while the biggotry and sjw ethics almost drips down your comment . not knowing what mgtow entails , but still judging upon it . do you get triggered by your own stupidity too ? or only when you think you can respond to it . i didn ' t call you sjw , though your reasoning and choice of words indicate you are , a raging one at that . so , if you wanna argue about these topics , start to learn how to read and understand . idiot . you know these subs are regularly vacated by raging sjw ' s that can ' t accept that people disagree right ? pretty much what you are doing .
