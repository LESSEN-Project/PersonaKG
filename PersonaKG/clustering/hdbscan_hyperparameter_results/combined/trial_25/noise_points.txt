1. i don ' t know , i have imaginef myself dying more than hundred times and never regret any of those imaginary experiences . i guess death is fantastic when you are old because at that point life is quite crappy .
   (ID: 3171687207fd659f146afaa305fc2ad7b92ea52b)

2. i love your post , and it ' s a really good question ! i don ' t think it ' s ridiculous to feel like you owe something to your genetic mother . she gave you life , twice ! a sense of gratitude for that is perfectly normal ! personally , i don ' t feel i owe my genetic parents anything , but that ' s because i endured a lot of neglect and abuse at their hands . i ' ve been messed up most of my life because of this , so no i don ' t feel i owe them anything . but i don ' t think it ' s unusual if adoptees do feel that way .
   (ID: 23d8dae7213e264b515a84a02f18e02f44dbe192)

3. be happy . wait that might have been earlier than digit .
   (ID: 42d0bab08dc67ecb5ab1c5fdc07cbe6a31015990)

4. what i ' ve always heard isn ' t that the digit , digit is a literal number of beta access or vip access . it was equivalent in the time the book was written to saying a zillion . just with extra meaning . digit tribes of israel , squared , times digit so a lot .
   (ID: aac80ac9ebef70ab8fe6bc14a8fcccb472099b84)

5. i ' ve beaten most jokers i fight but it feels like they just run and spam the fire move until they can transform and then try and fight aggressively .
   (ID: 3b13182e9a13b392bb9f89990f71d9043459e21f)

6. there is nothing wrong with ending people  s careers . who gives a shit about their kids and their welfare . little fuckers should have thought of that before being born to conservative douche nuggets .
   (ID: ef87eefe030bad98e7a1705beba0859fe1869cef)

7. if your family barges in your room out of rudeness or to make shure you aren ' t doing anything , then i have the solution for you . hentai , but the weird stuff that you only jack off to when your really really horny . pull that up and your pants down then go to work on your mighty maul . when your family member barges in without knocking , look them in the eyes and yell at them to stop watching you masterbate maybe a good " this isn ' t alabama ! stop standing their ! " . bonus points if you nut while there still there . masterbating is a completely normal thing that everyone does , but it ' s not normal to watch your fam do it . so it ' s really effective at getting them to knock . and if they take off your door , then do it without headphones so that they can hear and when they complain , comment on how they " want to watch so might as well help them hear it too "
   (ID: 2168250be01c43791f88e7c8ad875c0396307047)

8. almost suffocating myself with my bed sheets . makes for a funny story though .
   (ID: 40f1dd99755dca159ccdbdacafea183ed0a104cd)

9. a few months back i found a youtube video explaining how the whole movie is actually just the two guys trying to murder the girl and that there is no witch or anyone following them . i would need to dig to find it but it ' s the most air tight movie theory i have ever heard and made me appreciate it even more .
   (ID: 55510b17a4f0d7b5820e6f21287525ef6cd60994)

10. basically yea , they ' re better for fantasies and sex . most the women that look like that get surgery because they have self esteem , and low confidence , or some other mental problem . but that doesn ' t make them any less physically attractive though lol . if i were to cuff a chick it ' d would be a regular woman that doesn ' t have all those enhancements
   (ID: 2e30252ab6ce4c1807bb315c6103be324b841909)

11. phase digit actually ends with spider  man far from home but you ' re totally right .
   (ID: 569832646eef001c1724d2ecdb8abedbbfd927ab)

12. i am not sure i do follow you . while i do not invalidate their experience , it ' s just that i mostly dislike how they say positivity will cure me of my illness .

15. right ? it  s like .  oh , so you  re cis ? you can tolerate and enjoy your body without any mental anguish ? you can regularly look in the mirror without hating the facial structure your sex destined you to have ? you like yourself enough not to pretend to have a mental illness ? well then die !  people are insane , my dude !
   (ID: 129ef8c0c15772442f28ff253ba4d16a19caef46)

16. i know someone who was woken up by chainsaw right over them .
   (ID: 5042e4f4cf4f00f86836211d30b97922c92f0b46)

17. yeah i understand this . one of the things i  m going through now is seeing high school friends on facebook make posts about being home owners , and i want to buy a house soon . so it is easy to feel jealous but i don  t want to . you know ? i want to mature and just be patient and not envy others . but it is a conscious decision that we have to make sometimes .
   (ID: d28c94c02761dbceb7bd64e3288f28eeef3a75cf)

18. these people are not that smart . where doe you get your anthropormorphic fantasies from ? it seems a bit sophisticated for you . prehaps the alex jones conspiracy network ? do you buy his vitamins ?
   (ID: 457d7d37e1181cc932693cd4220e6fbfd564a75d)

19. finally , my time to tell a story . a long time ago , we had this one pizza chain in germany that let you create online accounts and you would receive a free pizza every three to four months but you needed to order something at least once . funnily enough , that order could consist of a coupon . add to that that creating accounts is fun with google , because you can add " . " to the mail to create a new account , but the mails still go to the normal gmail address without the dot . and i am not sure i remember right , but i think everything behind an underscore just didn ' t count too , so you could create example  01  , example  02  etc . mails . after a couple months of sharing that mail account with friends , we got digit  digit free pizzas every day . so yeah , we enjoyed abusing that exploit to get cheesy pizza .
   (ID: 581212399ab927ef4ad073e5e0d8d36cf5929452)
