1. if you just met them like at a party ,  tell me about yourself  is a perfect opener that allows people to take it where they want . if you have developed some rapport , asking about people  s brothers , sisters , and parents  remember their names , and if they sound positive , ask what that relationship looks like  would you say you act more like friends or are you the protective sibling  . if they sound negative , venture elsewhere or play it safe and ask something more open ended like ,  who are you closest with ? who do you tell stuff that nobody else knows ?  the provocative questions like that last one is a gambit and can either turn people away or build intimacy quickly .
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

2. wait so why are you saying this in a go group . if you haven  t even tried the go . also explain how it isn  t immersive

3. i left months ago . i did it because my ex and i broke up and i didnt need to keep creeping on her social media . but also because i was noticing how much pointless bs people post on them . i didnt want to be doing the same thing , especially when no one really cares anyways .

4. sir , you just mentioned something which i ' m going through . whenever i have enjoyed doing things in my life , i became good at it . when i looked back i see that whenever it matters the most , fear of failure cripples me down . when things were not significant to me , i turned up doing good . pressure of performing when it matters the most gives birth to my fear of failure . i know that without pain there will be no gain . thank you for your words .

9. nah i didn ' t really give a shit excuse my language about obama . i voted for him , but he never got my feathered rustled like bernie can . bernie stands up there and says exactly what i would say digit  of the time . obama talks like someone wrote it for him or he wrote it himself the night before . i believe other people like me are ready to make a real revolution with bernie . i never felt that way , not one second for barack .

12. the best thing is not to " find a trick to fool yourself into not buying things " but to look how much money you earn in one month and don ' t spend more than that . it is irrelevant how much your credit card lets you spend . what matters is how much you earn .

16. i ' ve been thinking about this deeply for awhile now and i can ' t think of anything that could be considered the best . i mean there ' s some good things and there ' s some bad things . picking through the good to try and find something best is hard .
   (ID: 54d8d3056c8f47c31e118e652b57922cf96c4876)

17. yes it is very true . usually mods and yourself only see the comment karma , mine had been negative for going on digit years now because of this . the majority see something they don ' t like and immediately downvote , yet keep scrolling without up vote on anything they agree with .
   (ID: ef02e812d417ba40d4b3e2f97601e54e4a68c5c5)

18. don  t try and spare his feelings now if you  ll probably destroy them later . do you think the relationship could end because of this ? or that you might get so attracted to another man you could cheat on him ? either of those would be worse than saying  hey , the baby talk weirds me out , could you stop ?
   (ID: f8a8648f114c1dd8984a809bd49816978d9970c0)

19. all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be  so i guess what i  m saying is breathe . enjoy each breath and take it for what it is . you  re not in the past and if you keep looking back you  ll never enjoy today . and life is a beautiful thing that you don  t want to let pass by . i don  t know if that will help but it  s the advice i can give . best of luck
