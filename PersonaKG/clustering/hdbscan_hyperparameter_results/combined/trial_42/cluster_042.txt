11. you ' re suppsoed to release the ble  whatever before you push the plunger down . so tie off  register  release the belt . if you leave the belt on andyou inject more iquid int he vein then the vein is under more pressure . when you release it the blood flow continues and the drugs you inject is carried off with the blood that is pumping through the vein . or don ' t use one if you ' re able to do it withoout , it ' s not a necessary step just a helpful tool . the bruising could be a result of that if you didn ' t release it . what also helps if you bruise easily is to put pressure on the injection site . the alcohol wipe that you use to clean your arm with before iv you can also use to push down onthe site when you are pushing the needle out . this will stop the bleeding faster , so also less blood with leak from your vein causes bruising under your skin . but most important things are to use new needles , don ' t use the same spot too often and pick a different spot to iv so the previous places can heal a bit before you use them again . lave the site witht he trackmarks a lone for a bit , let it heal .
