3. is there anything i could do or say to her that would make it easier without it being too weird . we have only gone out once and i feel like asking her how she feels about me leaving would be too soon right now . like i should try and take her out again and see how it goes ?

5. sounds like they might be a bit envious of your successes and they are picking on the tattoo out of spite . why see them at all tomorrow ? it will be more crap about the tattoo and nothing about your new job . reschedule and say you are sick . it  s your bday , you deserve to feel cherished and loved and you aren  t getting it from them .

7. in my teens i wasn  t very sensitive to the subject . definitely use derogatory words and definitely wasn  t befriending anyone who was openly gay . but then i moved to ann arbor to work at my aunts bar and the very first two friends i made where gay but i didn  t know for like a month . that really opened my eyes . these two are amazing people , and after talking to them i couldn  t believe all the hate they have to face day in and day out . and i used to be apart of that . i can  t believe i used to think and act like that to another human just because of one difference . i will never use homophobic terms again and i pray that everyone in our society regardless of sexuality will receive the respect and happiness they deserve . i will always stand up for love for the rest of my life
