1. are you just trying to make friends with kids on the street , or are you seeing them for a medical visit , because if it ' s the latter , you probably aren ' t going to have much luck . they ' re afraid of you because you ' re going to poke and prod them and give them a shot .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

2. what this guy said . unless you ' re going to raise morale with free hooker thursdays , nothing you ' re going to do is going to compensate for the stress of having to work digit hours a week for several months straight .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

3. nothing . its all bullshit . i wonder what kind of investigation would be going on if hillary won .
   (ID: b6567f005c34603036e6119544386ff4f12ec3a9)

   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

   (ID: 9e778023eda5589ac577e3789edfd900d208edf7)

   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

7. are you going through a mid life crisis , is that why you are posting on reddit , just to stay in touch with the younger generation
   (ID: 87173aaf55980a77c94bd30c851c39fb0b52ff2e)

8. would definitely recommend they try to start and keep a fire going . big stones spelling sos ? it works occasionally . some lonely fuck on a beach waving there arms ? not very effective . but smoke ? that ' s the way to do it .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

9. oh snap ! how is trump and his supporters going to kill the country ? you have some specifics you can provide us or at least a logically put  together theory ?

   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

11. you may actually have some merit in this . i just realized that i can , completely on accident , be going digit and thinking i ' m going digit in my girlfriend ' s car . then again i drive a prius so . yeah . that might have something to do with it too .
   (ID: 3158d7c63f10e871a80f147fb47725c8714163c7)

12. even the new tim comes as a gift . and no one claimed that this is more than a slight refresh . nobody has the reason to complain , especially when the new parts are going at the old prices .
   (ID: 32520dc340c18ed101e3d5ea02b3a7bca25dcc29)

13. i think im going to try to introduce myself like " what ' s up im addison , my friends call me aj " because addison itself is a pretty feminine name but it ' s the only one i could get by with bc of my unsupportive parents
   (ID: 7e58269155b84bc057025d5066e661ba2eb934ba)

   (ID: 9e778023eda5589ac577e3789edfd900d208edf7)

17. the answer to that question is the same as the answer to this one  when are older generations going to stop blaming everyone else for their problems ?
   (ID: afb250d177d47ce6467dfa3414d91e9e07eec6c4)

18. more like for security . the reason someone would carry a gun is very similar to why someone locks their doors . if it  s that hard to understand , maybe you will after your involved in an incident that threatens you or your loved ones . most malicious attacks  robberies are going to tip the scale towards the criminal meaning they are not looking to present you with a fair fight . so for that reason , it  s wise to be prepared yourself .
   (ID: 237175707a16a7382ac8130de85ed85b63dc9442)

19. why can ' t he ask her what she wanted if its that important to you ? no one here is going to be able to tell you what a random girl messaged him except her .
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

20. unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot , nothing is going to get better . it ' s not .
