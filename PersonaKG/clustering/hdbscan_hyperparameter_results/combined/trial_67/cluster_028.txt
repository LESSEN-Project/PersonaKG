1. your lie my dude . tell it how you want . over here in reality though this game needs a story to compliment the season or we  re just left with grinding weapons that will eventually get infused into something else .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

   (ID: 0163212450bac6366408ac8e1e025d32048839ec)

5. so you pointing out that it ' s about race and gender implying that you want it to be true just because she is a woman and an african please provide a valid counter argument or fuck off with your faminazi sentimentality .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

7. that whole  shoot your brains out  answer might have been the one you wanted but it  s still a answer , you won  t want to whip out your cock and beat it to death if your brains are all over the room it  s just an solution not saying he should i  m just saying that would stop the sex drive
   (ID: cd907372aff0871825a64e977822586e3bb0ecb7)

8. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

9. i wouldn ' t call myself a producer i just dabble in it when i want to be creative , massive would be my favorite

   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

11. fuck all this relationship shit , i just want a switch tbh .
   (ID: 064b68f55fd83de76c3cbc4f130670e6435e42a4)

12. for the most part , you have the freedom to go or do whatever you want . whereas , in a relationship , you have not just yourself but your so to consider . as far as what ' s the worst thing in relationships ? that ' s more or so subjective . everyone will tell you something different .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

13. but if you want to build up , that ' s fine . just send me your trainer code .
