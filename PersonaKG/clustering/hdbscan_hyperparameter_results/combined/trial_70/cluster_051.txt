1. so many of my women friends fall into this totally consciously saying shit like " well ya i don ' t like her but you know keep your enemies closer . " no thats if they are planning to assassinate you in the shadows  not if they judge every aspect of your life to your face
   (ID: 5f43a3019d69696064ac659bf6dd25b51f1e5bb6)

2. i feel like it wouldn  t be so good honestly . i know i shouldn  t judge a book by its cover but the movie  s plot seems too bizarre to me .
   (ID: 7a36b5607ec030b33a99723097f6d67b04c38d99)

3. well , this depends on the person . as for me , i consider any superstitions as something weird coming from the past , so i don ' t believe in them . also there are some superstitions noone believes in , which are still being used sometimes like spitting over the left shoulder to prevent happening a bad thing that was mentioned some people say " spit ! " after someone said about something bad that could happen , although they know this doesn ' t work
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

4. anywhere except where op works . i didn ' t even get a reprimand . the guy didn ' t ask to see any sort of supervisor . sounds like i was being rude , i know , but in my line of work , you can give as well as you get . its sort of the best version of customer service ever .
   (ID: 20b71c431f98b1f88ec1b3e7ada79d31df65a8c2)

5. so it looks like you know what you ' re doing with your life but actually have no idea but who knows
   (ID: 8b409a812bfe5e21e6e8924b5c822fc50d0d2c9a)

6. leaves party gets gunned down by the rogue for leaving lmao but really , yeah they should have the feature to give someone like digit seconds to leave before also being marked . i enjoy going rogue but i know some of my friends are like you and dont so i won ' t go rogue if i ' m with them , but you never know when you squad up with a rando .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

   (ID: 4d17a8a4d7907bba6d158e8a0b9c3504d69be003)

13. why do you hate freedom  tm ? a significant portion of the audience here does not know what that means in context . it ' s like digit and digit never happened .
   (ID: 338fc695adfaaf11a58feb723c7240c6700982d8)

14. it ' s so funny people don ' t know what we turks have to deal with , our minimum hourly wage is around digit . digit  . it ' s like a joke and it doesn ' t even matter if you have a master degree , i ' m so jealous of europe countries .
   (ID: c41e4affc406bbc71e6c12aabf095d759b6dbec2)

15. why am i fucked up because in my last hours i would like to experience one of life  s greatest pleasures ? if rape is immediately what you go to , you have problems . i would never rape someone because i have friends what have been and i know the toll it takes on someone . don  t ever assume that everyone is the same .
   (ID: 19d727be6c2cbac7b528c7c522e3aa512e48025f)

16. i ' m afraid that i really know nothing about the industry , except as a watcher . it seems like netflix is growing and is vastly expanding its home  grown content , so going that route would certainly be a valid one . best of luck !
   (ID: aa4c399e0083dd1bf730546e6c4fbd9b75104d67)

17. pre  teen to teenage years , perhaps , but there ' s no harm in doing it earlier . you can ' t really know if you like something if you don ' t do it .
   (ID: 618e7c681a628e6c6c5521926bf4d17deb5ed5d6)

18. i see nothing wrong with free donuts cause you don  t have to take one . whereas in this situation they keep pestering me expecting me to change my mind . like i  m not stupid , you know ?
   (ID: 903829fb4aefc18f9ba3e0dc7d2f3267adf2bcc8)

19. so if i trap my neighbors dog that gets out all the damn time and comes into my yard say hi to my cat i ' m within my rights to trap it and leave it outside ? it ' s one thing to scare the cat off because you don ' t like it , its completely different to trap it and send it off to be potentially euthanized because the pet owners don ' t know their cat is at animal control .
   (ID: 4ad10ae12cb226893a0aec21cddd0e791f57ede2)
