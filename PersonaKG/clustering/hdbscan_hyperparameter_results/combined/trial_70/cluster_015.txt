   (ID: 9f681f3dedb4dcecbe41b42dada5f72caae05ebe)

2. i  m a big decepticon fan , and these guys are an inescapable purchase for me . even moreso because i  m in canada and the wait sucks , so i  ll go stateside for it online . one of the thing i think some people have overlooked is that since there are digit bots for devestator , in order to make the star math work , we see the firsts 4pt filler bots .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

4. do you think he supports negligent homicide investigations for miscarriages ? either a fetus is a person , or it isn ' t  if you push hard enough , i bet you ' ll find that ryan ' s beliefs have the same inconsistencies as most republicans . it ' s not about preserving life . it ' s about punishing sluts .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

   (ID: a6171234e1a4ec65a39ad55aa0aa058eb98dff83)

6. jack handey v  o  if you ' re in a war , instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy , throw one of those small pumpkins . maybe it ' ll make everyone think how stupid war is , and while they are thinking , you can throw a real grenade at them .
   (ID: 2988ee1cd7a2bcf8e2d215c795ee2d06a985665a)

   (ID: 1476398f6c778fb461539e3f78b07720d4ceee83)

9. sign it up with superrewards and their network of advertisers so that even at 3am they ' ll get cold calls from numbers that are bogus or whose caller id appears as " not available . even better if the mark is already paranoid , they might think the man is keeping tabs on them .
   (ID: dc123ff47fa4f2e85bbecd444342fe7d8fcb7db5)

10. why does what others think about it matter to you ? it will sell millions and you  ll be one of them . you do you man .

   (ID: 2834b254700cedfb96641229b712899b4d697418)

13. i think it ' s because half the time you keep talking to the wrong end . pick the side that ' s not blowing hot air , and you ' ll have a good conversation . if you do pick the wrong side , run , for it will soon be smelly .
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

15. i never understand what people think will happen if lowe is gone . i ' ll answer that question , nothing . nothing will happen good or bad .
   (ID: e3a37ef234435ebde735894f98de2b3f90e3bbe9)

16. its not really about the money . i can make money in incursions in no time . but i think doing some lvl5s with a carrier as well as repping poses and hauling ships around , would be useful . but its not very high priority . after all i think i ' ll train it with my alt .
   (ID: 699195a280fce86200065786c40a00e3096406da)

17. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

18. i mean you could try to have a long distance relationship even if you think it won ' work . and if it does work out , you ' ll be happy that you tried it .
   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

19. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

20. expectations were also low for you in digit . you looked terrible in your friendlies , right before that world cup . we ' ll see what happens ! if you don ' t advance , i still think you ' ll do better than last time .
