   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

   (ID: 75ca79d6c5cfc50533ff56cde25edfb593ae8568)

4. i ' ve never met a person in my life who looks down at circumcision babies can ' t speak or do anything besides drink and shit , it ' s the right of the parent to decide whether or not they should circumcise their kid . you just sound really stupid considering there ' s no problem in having or not having it the difference is immaculate .
   (ID: ab5524e568131ce7cb4db227daae4d0f489838e1)

   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

6. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

7. i ' ve heard it helps to start cleaning up something small , and then grow from that . even if it ' s just putting a fork into a drawer , it ' s important to start somewhere .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

8. thank you for the response , i  ve been considering whether she  s really worth keeping around anyways . it  s just so hard to cut out someone who you  ve known your whole life .
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

9. i gotta be honest , i ' ve spent way too much time on this on the past and mentally still assumed it ' s digit in digit odds . somehow i always just overlook the assumption that the host will always open a door with a goat behind . guess just my own fault for overlooking that detail
   (ID: 1cf567904675ac1ca7b5a90612e5479a5b6c9bef)

10. " not unconventional " doesn ' t make sense , and no it ' s not strange to wear plain clothes but it ' s just hard to believe that every single item of clothing you have ever bought is digit never had a logo , brand name or been designer of some sort and digit you ' ve never been asked by anyone you ' ve ever come in contact with where you have bought your clothes from .
   (ID: d45001f1fdd37cda488cfddffabec23e83ee7b7e)

11. it ' s a text message . if it was urgent , you should ' ve called , imo . we ' re all adults and we ' re busy living our lives . a text message just frankly isn ' t a priority .
   (ID: 5a15ed606a86674cb48abaf9fee4375ff6bbff09)

12. if the only reason you can find for still doing something partners included is that you  ve been doing it so long why stop now ? just try to stop and move on . it  s most likely just holding you hostage with your on sentimental emotions .
   (ID: 411b23f3d2a1f254c1c92c17670bb02c191a1301)

13. literally just aaaaaaaaa road so that you  d have to scream it every time . you  ve also gotta pronounce all digit a  s  so next head down main st . and take a left on to aaaaaaaaa road
   (ID: 6710bef520e10a3963d2983d4b36ef411e442f22)

14. be me , digit year old mexi boy , scared and tired of what i ' ve just learned my body could do . ' twas noon and the wall seemed hot . so yeah a wall .
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

15. how do you mean ? i  ve read the kybalion and only just started reading the corpus hermeticum so i  m a bit new to all of this . what makes the kybalion not hermetic ?
   (ID: d7b75c00237dc445cdc3ebc380fbcb79a40b1a5f)

16. rip but that  s okay , my advice is have a look into some business . not school business but just start making something and selling it . i am now digit and when i was digit i managed to make myself  digit within a year making and selling protein balls . i  ve only stopped since cause i paralysed myself and been busy and exhausted to do it .
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

17. look i can do the same  you ' ve just creepily searched a stranger ' s post history , taken the conversation off topic and publicly aired their business . such a creepy move . support would have been a private message .  a . stop being a hypocrite b . stop thinking your part of this culture harry
   (ID: 7dfa169bdfe2df7e214baa35fc2f2b73cbb10c46)

18. depends on how old you were when he left . if you are digit now then he probably couldn ' t handle the responsibility of being a dad , which isn ' t your fault . if you are digit , then you were probably a temper  tantrum tornado of tumultuous temperament resulting in your dad saying " fuck this " , which is just a little bit your fault . the bright side being you ' ve survived digit years without him , so there ' s that .
   (ID: 306fcce176e83db604dac17838eed1e669cd5a90)

19. i do have strong feelings about keeping the extremely sick alive just for the sake of it . however i ' ve had relatives with alzheimers , and long after they forgot names , they were still able to enjoy life  get joy out of it . that is the most important thing imo .
   (ID: ff39f069f8b23a1fe1a55ce497714a8d205eb0fa)

20. it would be nice if this girl i ' ve been trying to go out with would just message me .
