   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

3. just hide the entire game collecting mats and maybe find a treasure chest then sit in a baller and wait for all the other players to kill eachother . if you get lucky , they might die in the storm . gliders are nice to stay above someone without the worry for dying from falling . an rpg from above would be good . make sure you are rotating into the new safe area quickly and get established there . tldr  just camp lol

   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

5. every break has to be done where both parties can see each others faces , next time youre on skype or something where you see his face , show him he ment something to you and just rip the bandaid . never ever text im breaking up with you . that will destroy a person . also make sure hes fully aware of whats going on , and explain why youre breaking up with him
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

   (ID: ab3c8c681660786b8cfd174d247a71a2d57b02b6)

7. first of all , how would time travel " write out " those characters ? i ' m not sure i understand  just need some elaboration . second , " easy " writing usually isn ' t good writing  it ' s lazy and uncreative . the russos are better than that .
   (ID: bb403667518ffc82f0508e3aee8741ea63cec050)

8. for the international muppets it ' s 4am in italy . for an article and tweet from different sources to be taken down or edited right now is just weird . i mean i can see night editor having access to the article but the twitter as well ? do journos share their twitter access ? i wouldn ' t . i don ' t have twitter so not digit  sure how it works
   (ID: 5ea29f01c8cdade4f178fd446d00647edc5fc70e)

   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

   (ID: 8062cc5726628ea3a4b448436c6c6956263ea6cd)

   (ID: ac0e0bfdedf04bf5199d4337ba10a43f13e1e49c)

12. not a lady , but i ' m pretty sure nothing is so small you can ' t feel it . it ' s just so small you get no pleasure out of it . to truly feel nothing it ' d have to be shorter than digit inch and thinner than the opening between the labia .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

13. just talk to everyone you can . sure you may have some weird convos that are a lil uncomfortable but then its done and you move on with life . the more comfortable you are talking to people the easier life will be
   (ID: 6eb8259d7d6b7ae101dda44ceaaf3b9edaab4fad)

   (ID: 7ebdc00c75f6f836557e13d39a9efb279ed2ef7a)

19. she ' s only snored while i was conscious at least every few months before , last few weeks have been rough . i just sleep on the couch if it becomes a big issue . that sounds rough i guess , but i actually sleep at least as well if not better on the couch than in bed . i made sure to talk to her about it and make sure she knew there were no hard feelings and it was just a practical matter . i never start out there , and make a point to spend time talking to her and the bump before she goes to sleep every night , we just agreed i can bail if i need to .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

20. they were trying to get rid of child porn on their site , but doing a blind generic sweep of just nsfw content with a weak bot didn  t do them any good . porn bits are still around , countless nsfw blogs , and i  m sure there are still pedos lurking on that site . i heard if they had been deleted off tumblr that they migrated to twitter
