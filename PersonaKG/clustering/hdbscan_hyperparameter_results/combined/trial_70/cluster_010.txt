   (ID: 93133d3335d1543505dad3ffd44a8411e6be2ea9)

   (ID: d048a45810866f7b853972f50c2c2746bc339a21)

   (ID: bb403667518ffc82f0508e3aee8741ea63cec050)

   (ID: 439e78cca3643ee51185b36cedaa4c3e72551ef5)

6. yea but where did you find it to begin with like which post
   (ID: 258f707f4d4ef2a235c76e1a3f46df976a2e0270)

7. hey , that  s really cool . have you still kept your culture ? what was it like for your children growing up ? did they have to learn aramaic ?
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

8. who could be so heartless to down vote this comment about how cute the pomeranian is ? who ever did this better bow down to that pomeranian and apologise also would you like to sign up for a my best buy credit card to get digit  back in rewards on your first purchase ?
   (ID: 89bda4e1242c8f5567558138509db8b02cf94cd6)

9. sounds like you had it rough in hs , sorry to hear . i did to , but eventually you grow up and realize none of that matters
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

10. looks like the mom did sue in this instance . with parents like that it ' s no wonder that the kid is the way he is woman  facepalming
   (ID: 0eb234eb32f4a74b31c625730bfcb4190d403d56)

11. that ' s pretty neutral , it ' s always best to be positive and not talk about what you didn ' t like but what you did like . for instance , your old boss might have been a real hard ass , riding you all day . instead of saying that you could say your old boss was really involved in my day to day tasks and was really focused on the job getting done . i learned a lot from him . this is not a lie and it spins the situation in a positive light .
   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

12. what are the gods of caia like ? did they create any sapient life ?
   (ID: 59231a2c6c18ffc9988af4adbd5a441bf1221c38)

13. i had the same reaction as you . after powering through the book it ' s hard to imagine what a fitting ending would look like , but somehow mccarthy did it . it ' s pretty relentless and beautiful .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

14. why does the spiderman suit look like it ' s xxxl ? did you steal it from a poor fat kid ?
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

15. would you please elaborate . how the two of you met ? what made you like each other initially ? what we ' re the mild irritants ? did you meet each other ' s friends . we ' re there red flags ? what was her relationship history  yours ?
   (ID: 9e2852bcfafecccb1e60211326f5fc70d0bbb428)

16. did you deliver the talk ? i ' d like to hear it
   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

17. since it ' s under the table , i ' m guessing the money your parents give you can be treated as a gift . as such , there would be no taxes owed or paid since it ' s not on record at least i ' m assuming your parents did not note it in their business expense report . since it doesn ' t sound like an actual " job " job , then i ' m also going to say that this isn ' t something you plan on writing on your job resume in the future . if that ' s the case , pocket the money and save  invest wisely .
   (ID: 3a74a7f224822b70fc5b403157367714c46b161a)

18. several questions . why is the dad calling his digit year old sexy ? why did she supposedly call herself brave instead of something like smart or kind ? why do her feet look that damn big ?
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

19. never seen a cap like that , build looks a bit ropey . i could be wrong because not had many cohiba . where did you buy it from ?
   (ID: 1413da4d65544a15a55a7323945fa06ed3f67f4a)

20. this is the hardest thing to deal with in this day and age . this kind of stuff has happened to me and what i did was tell twitch and stuff like that . they don  t listen to creators now . it  s super difficult .
