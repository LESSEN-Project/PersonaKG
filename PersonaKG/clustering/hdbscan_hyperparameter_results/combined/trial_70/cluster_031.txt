4. does she want to be with you ? if not , then she is not the right one for you . obviously i don  t know the details of your relationship so i can  t really say but my rule is that i want someone to be with me , not because i convince them , but because i didn  t need to .
   (ID: d95d3548a9506e48c5310c85f3b2994820405e0d)

5. eh , no big . you stop taking the estrogen and move on . shit happens . don ' t know why we have to pigeon hole people and make them miserable , in any capacity . be what you want to be , even if you change your mind later , and everyone else can go fuck themselves .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

7. youtube is going to be your best bet . as someone else mentioned , just pick a topic and go . if you ' re wondering how brakes work or how you replace them , or you want to know the difference between engine configurations , etc , you should be able to find a video explaining it .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

8. okay , but that  s not a valid sample . results will be purely anecdotal . you may want to point that out to your teach so they know you  re aware of the faults and limitations . also , the same study found that about digit percent of shower water is from the hot water source . and if your calculating enviro footprints , don  t forget about all the embedded energy in water , both hot and cold .
   (ID: 7a74975099c43e606800d8a9205ec41703ec2a89)

9. you don  t have to . just letting you know about the side subs that these kind of posts would be more popular and appropriate in . it  s still twd , so you can keep it if you want .
   (ID: d8492ac2e05f869f3bd79bafc9f32c603a615e59)

10. i want to know . maybe i could use it for myself . i ' m too wary to share my trust issue with my counselor hence the question .
   (ID: a35d2e75aaca32c6e87ef13f40d514b9769453f0)

11. i want to know why many black people put their hair in dreadlocks girls or super curly guys . i want to know if it ' s a cultural thing or they just do it .
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

12. youtube can be so nasty ! i didn ' t want to be too judgemental . for all i know this was last month . kid  time moves very slowly from what i remember .
   (ID: 2266c34274940e2ea1a22a3dee5a3cbcdad25f53)

13. i ' m about to buy one  want to know if you found anything really fun to do with it ?
   (ID: 80d504f68f5028edc4d8e5926e3a2a93b0c84d8f)

   (ID: 795c678726f71492166b6677c955ce0a48a9b294)

15. how am i petty for wanting to know what he meant ? i just want to answer the question . this isn  t a joke for me . why are you so aggressive about this ?
   (ID: 2319e968bf60fef4f281e564c6b126147e06cc04)

16. hey you i want you to know . i don ' t care and don ' t even remember it . get some sleep , sleep is important .
   (ID: 7ed1ff576cc7dc77750ed5f15461eb3ccdb52a7a)

17. that ' s the way i ' d go . if you don ' t want to do any of the things you already know , knowing more means options you might not have considered will open up .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

18. since some of the results occasionally mimic what ' s to come on tv , perhaps there are people who don ' t want to know what happened . raw taping last night , for example , had an equal outcome to its house show the previous night in one of its key matches .
   (ID: 3790e844e04694d48c253f7aee4d3b61f116d4d6)

19. you know there are free hotlines if you want to talk right ?
   (ID: 02cf76dae1fda8da1d2e5bbbaeb0da5a77cb6e3e)

20. it ' s hard enough to get them to help with recovering an account that all the info is known for . if you don ' t know the email address , password , or birthdate , their hands are kind of tied . there ' s no way to prove that it ' s actually your account . i mean , of course you can always try . are your pets the same ? do you remember any items you may have had , or avatar count ? maybe someone changed your info . seems unlikely that it can be recovered , but if you really want it , it can ' t hurt to see what tnt says .
