   (ID: 89e76efb1868896fe46bffbc2c10d965b53857d1)

   (ID: 7a396588993d687f5528f10b200dc9d6db769270)

8. no you weren  t raped and it  s sad that people think what happened to you is the same as getting attacked . forget gender , you were in your house with your girlfriend , and the only reason people think is because you were tired . get real kid . your not a victim , you just need a nap .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

13. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

   (ID: c8c5c965e2188b52c51dd0dd8715dabd412209f5)

18. if you use treat as rewards , try not to let other people just give treats for no reason . i can ' t use small treats with training anymore becuase my roommate was an idiot and would give them to my dog regardless of outcome . had to switch to a new reward system , which isnt fun with corgis because they tend to think they are smarter then us owners .
   (ID: 31d924f098e0871341a799d7a5777fb635f53b34)

19. it ' s both if you ask me . he clearly can ' t just forget it , but i think he also makes a choice not to .
   (ID: 9c2d2fde31927b8cc3bc419049de8844ca720cb9)

20. i just watched the movie a couple days ago after reading the book , also titled " unbroken . the book provides more detail , and even though the movie might help to visualize a little more , i think the book is a great read .
