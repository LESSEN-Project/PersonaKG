1. the bailout that has happened for all three of the " big digit ? what about it ? also jd power also gets their information from owners . now go look up what qualifies as a defect and you ' ll know why those reports are horse shit . you thinking a knob should be bigger or your ac should be colder is considered a defect . so anything , including properly functioning systems are therefore " defective .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

   (ID: 58245e8d537b9e7b6d76cc6a9919ea776e4ef6f0)

7. absolutely ! i was that person in class who  d go up and draw a stick figure and call it a masterpiece with a straight face . now if i something with no effort it  ll take someone who has no practice about digit hours to do . i don  t know how to explain it but i used to be very terrible at drawing .
   (ID: 1ab03d054f341c1ede82c7eb9f871db0a696e44d)

8. its from mashiroiro symphony , i don ' t remember the exact quote , i don ' t care , but its something to the effect of  having pets is scary because you know they ' ll die before you , but when they do its important to remember the fun you had while they were alive not the pain of losing them .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

9. the only way you ' ll really know is if you ask them . it could be because of doing work months food , it could be a green house , it could be a secret lab .
   (ID: 7632dd7ebcb664bfada5fff420a436f42e3721d5)

10. definitely , if you could let me know where to send it here or by commenting on the pic , i ' ll get it to you .
   (ID: 664b365f80ff1d51db95866fada8009f14d8e9b1)

11. you would know better than i would about anything related to those serving in the vast majority of government so i  ll defer to your expertise . the skeptic in me comes out a bit sometimes . i appreciate the reassurance . i can absolutely get on board with your plans . it  ll never be perfect but we can certainly strive to improve . and you are right that regulations have certainly been beneficial to human kind in the past . personally , large scale public health risks probably need regulating but we  re getting into regulating the minutiae of the day to day life of the citizenry . and that  s where i have to draw the line .
   (ID: 8b20a772d1697ecc1b19f9f6451e7346e8b98987)

12. depends on how random the words are that i ' ll forget . if they ' re ones i can learn again , i ' ll take it . if they ' re names and identities of people i know , no . also i ' m cracking up thinking of a scenario where a person tries to use this in an interview to one up the interviewer .
   (ID: 8a0d7d262d95d9c10d914ff3b70f342e066aee23)

13. it can be frustrating when people use depression to excuse all their failings . as someone who myself is in constant battle with mental health , i know as soon as i use it as an excuse it  s game over for me . i  ll join the other failed victims . so many amazing people who succeed in spite of depression
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

14. 1m ? you know , there are rats with that much bounty in about every belt . you ' ll have to put a few zeros on it , to get people interested .
   (ID: 699195a280fce86200065786c40a00e3096406da)

15. ok cool , thanks for the clarification frient ! i ' ll try a gram for fun if my local coffeeshop ever gets some , but now i know i don ' t need to expect something wildly different
   (ID: 932561c7cc5f0c280d4b6b0c7824dbd5aed5f350)

16. thanks for the ideas everyone ! i ' ll post here after i call and let you know how it goes .
   (ID: c1c3bee034ba3e70e4bd22d7987533e43f2b424b)

17. do i drop everything and everyone i know to work with a major producer and make my dreams come true or stay and throw it all away knowing i  ll never get an easy opportunity again and be a dad my ex was about to have our kid at any moment
   (ID: 4e784da799782c45d8883de53e87a533129a3b8e)

18. certainly not a bad idea to let at least someone know where you are especially when you  re a female . if you do go missing , someone can call the cops as soon as they notice you  re gone and it  s much more likely that you  ll be found .
   (ID: a815d9b5c98aef3203b8f4f74528072fb989f0b1)

19. interesting . i didn ' t know there was a remake of that show  i watched the original when i was a kid . i ' ll have to check it out  have been looking for a new series to watch . limitless is pretty good , but it ' s only one season .
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)
