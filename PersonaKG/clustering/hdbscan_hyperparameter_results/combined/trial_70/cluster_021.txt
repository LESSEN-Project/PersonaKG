Total from this dataset: 22

1. me and my brother went to this wedding . my brother doesn ' t drink , and he was bored . so he decided he would pretend like he ' s drunk . so he sit with other digit friends on a table by the dance floor . they started yelling thing like " how does it go now " and " wait for it " before the drop on every song that the dj played . this went on for almost one hour before the three of them got bored with that as well and stopped doing it . i can ' t decide if i wanted to die or to kill them . put yourself in the bride ' s shoes , three idiots ruining the wedding party out of boredom . geez .
