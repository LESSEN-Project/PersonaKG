1. spouting hate in this thread too ? of course you are . and it  s because you know when your pitiful life eventually ends you won  t have a tenth of the people at your funeral as this young lady did . she  s honored and respected by her community . you on the other hand are an insignificant shit stain .

6. two or three times a month i dream about very dirty public restrooms , or stalls with no doors , or toilets up on pedestals . these are extremely vivid and realistic dreams and i remember several details about most of them . i didn  t know how common it was until my dad said he had the same dream , so i did a google search and it turns out it  s fairly common . something about being insecure and vulnerable .

9. shit . that ' s a terrible thing to happen to you so young . if it helps , you ' re getting internet bro hugs from me . you should know that you ' re an absolute hero for talking her out of it . even if she ended up doing it later , you still gave it your all to save her . most people go through their lives without ever saving someone else ' s . most adults wouldn ' t know how to do what you did . you are a legend .

20. getting offended and correcting others everytime from your horse doesn ' t make you superior over others . i know he did something wrong and hasn ' t repeated that since but the media should understand that they can do something better by raising awareness on what ' s happening around the world rather than attacking a man over petty issues
