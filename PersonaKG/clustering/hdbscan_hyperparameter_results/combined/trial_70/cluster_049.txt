   (ID: 339d06087e421a1cf86d695af2a2088546f9dc91)

6. it ' s not about time . you just have to immerse yourself by moving to a place where the language is spoken and it will flow like a period .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

7. i wish i were joking too women dont tend to talk about how a loss feels or how it ' s not just a loss but more like the death of a dream . " be lucky for the kids you do have " is not a consolation in any way .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

   (ID: 01d4ddab8cb9e73e5e85941c592482da1b3c6bcd)

   (ID: 821feb57a838ce1b3e5f4aeb9b8e118113a7b57c)

12. i like how no one really answered your question and we are just arguing over nothing
   (ID: 93e92e6a7d8e94b12bcd450fad136ec14436f359)

13. for me , the settlement system was an awesome idea but it wasn ' t handled very well . i feel like if it does exist in fallout five , then it should be restricted to a couple of larger areas about the size of sanctuary and it doesn ' t have anything to do with the main plot or hold any story importance . just a mechanism for base building or potentially tie it in with a quest where you compete  trade with the main city in the region and give it something that would be interesting to do or have an actual tangible benefit ? but if it were just a system for building a sick as fuck house , i ' d be all for it
   (ID: 6ab97df6bacac740d323c579b509de1838c5d332)

14. like how i just responded to someone who replied in a similar way , its not necessarily a bad habit . i was just taught that it wasn ' t good to do a lot . i say dont worry about it . i personally dont care if someone looks up or down while walking . just do you dude !
   (ID: 89e76efb1868896fe46bffbc2c10d965b53857d1)

15. how do people not just sit back and be like . this is ridiculous !
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

16. yeah that ' s fair enough , although players like t . brady and sydney crosby actually do do that , it ' s just more difficult for then to build super teams around them . lebron has only been able to carry a shit tier roster to the finals twice in his career , and in this year ' s case a lot has to do with the weak competition in the east . also the commercials , stoppages , and fouls are actually the biggest issue with the nba . the o my reason it seems like the " main theme " is because it ' s them only thing people are responding to . they have no answer for the terrible stoppages , fouls , and commercial breaks .
   (ID: 0264eec5f9f9a43d83f3a82c46341e90961fa3b8)

17. same ! i understand she ' s not the best unit , but i mostly go for heroes i like . call me crazy , whatever . i ' m just a fan of lyn , and the artwork for l ! lyn is beautiful .
   (ID: bb403667518ffc82f0508e3aee8741ea63cec050)

18. aight , just pm me when you ' re done , what would you like in exchange ?
   (ID: 4b127841179d58078b4fbc1377158cb136f3156f)

19. i feel like ever since digit took over everything halo has severely dropped in quality apparently that includes text on a box which would be so easy to spot and cheap to fix that they just really must not give a shit anymore
   (ID: 6b1a5069121a216d43b11b6d5c61b018eb668aaa)

20. dude if there is an audience for it then why wouldn ' t i ? it just seems like an honestly genuinely good idea .
