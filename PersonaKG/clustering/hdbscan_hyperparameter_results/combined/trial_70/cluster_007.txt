7. like at times he ' s unnecessarily judgemental about people . about views he doesn ' t agree with and i call him out for that saying that he should be more inclusive and less judgemental . then he ' ll get all defensive about how i ' m disrespectful without even registering my views and what i actually meant to say . he just wants me to agree with everything he says and not have any views that oppose his .
   (ID: db2795e3479f3abf3fd16c22a2bea9450ad82357)

8. you still need a police report to prove it ' s not a hit and run , or that you didn ' t smash someone to death with it in the middle of the night . if its a write off you normally just get a pay out . if you try to fix it you ' ll have to pay the deductible .

   (ID: 521b989779e5e44f8854ed1438b914dfb8f19eb6)

11. op makes claim using vague terms , gets told to define term , provides definition , gets argued with or laughed at for mistaken assumptions . that ' s usually how things work around here . just substituting ' circlejerk ' for ' god ' or ' soul ' or ' spiritual ' or whatever the hell else . tell me exactly what you mean by it and i ' ll tell you what you have wrong . tl  dr whoosh
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

   (ID: 5bae960970112f75742b080e45f735ad64949805)

17. because you were obviously born here , have an excellent command of english and you ' re an aussie reddit user , so i ' d imagine reasonably well informed and educated and likely , left leaning . i ' m making assumptions here just as you make assumptions about these people and their situation . i ' m assuming you aren ' t working because you ' re picky about what you ' ll do to earn a dollar , consider yourself above physical labour and simply working hard , seeking opportunities where you can find them . or the most likely assumption is that you ' re just damn lazy .
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

18. even if this happens , we ' ll just move on to the next level of existence . do not fear . you we are infinite .

   (ID: afb250d177d47ce6467dfa3414d91e9e07eec6c4)

20. personally , i ' d save experimenting with new forms of weed for when you don ' t have anything else going on . you ' re paying for the concert and you ' ll want to enjoy it , so why take the risk that you ' ll be too high to fully appreciate it ? there ' s also the risk that you ' ll underestimate your tolerance or the dose and you ' ll just be spending the whole time waiting for a high that never comes . if you do decide to try edibles , just follow the normal advice and take very small doses with plenty of time in between .
