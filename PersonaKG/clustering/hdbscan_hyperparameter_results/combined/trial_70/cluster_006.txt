1. it ' s pretty well established that jesus did exist , i don ' t think that ' s exactly the point op is trying to make .
   (ID: 0fbaeef283f7b2090f763028c227ed73724f3e6c)

2. dude you are my savior thank you soo much . last two questions and i think we ' re done . where is hide ? last i saw he was working for the ccg as a news boy or something ? also why did furuta kill ghouls and ccg operatives ? is that why people think he ' s a spy ?
   (ID: 1cd062f77c729b2cea6d91996a2f94b1f5226415)

   (ID: 53aee34a0ceaafd2f3baaa01c94219ee83a7dace)

4. ok so how did those people kill them if they did not use a gun ? nobody ever tells me that part . i dont really care how because i kinda think dying by anothers hand is the issue . so to balance yourself before your audience could you please include the overall death rates ? its a sanity thing for me at this point . thanks .

6. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

7. i think they did a reality show about that . a homeless man was given a lot of money . can ' t remember how much , but apparently he didn ' t really use it well . but we should try again and again .

   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

9. i was not . my parents were presbyterian on paper , and i think at least my mother did does ? believe . i was taught almost nothing of religion , and only have the vaguest of memories of ever going to church . i think we went a handful of times when i was very young . maybe that ' s what allowed me to gloss over the religious context when i read the books as a kid .

10. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .
   (ID: 535c3113ba487b9152c4b0adbe8c36822bc45ca4)

11. i ' m in the same boat as you , friend . i ' m working on getting a degree in a conservative field but i really wanted to stretch my ears . so i did . mine are down to a 2g but they will still shrink back to piercing size . i ' d say the lowest you could go without irreversability is 0g but each ear is different .  i don ' t think irreversability is a word

12. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .

13. right ? i was so glad they played maud gone at that show , though i preferred their version at shaky knees the most . what did you think of the new stuff ?
   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

14. i recommend reading spiritual leadership by john oswald sanders . in the book it talks about the good and bad we experience when we are in a role of leadership . what you  re experiencing is normal trial and i don  t think you must be show joy all the time . after all , jesus did overturn the tables at the temple .

15. but he ' s an addict and i believe he was molested by his mother as a kid . he has done some nice things for his kid . he always apologizes or at least does something to get on their goodside . and honestly i think he did the right thing by telling fiona that sean still used .
   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

16. although technically not an actor or musician , i think the backpack kid shouldn  t be famous . he didn  t invent the floss , but he claims he did .
   (ID: 657111ddaa0e710ba768a3b9132b927482be7955)

17. lol me and my friends did something similar when a group of us were watching nightmare on elm street . i think it was the third one .

19. wow this was super interesting , you  re a good storyteller ! i don  t think you did anything wrong considering you were having your own experience and you couldn  t possibly read her mind if she was expecting more to come out of it but you didn  t do anything out of the ordinary . . in the meantime , don  t go into her restaurant until this is resolved
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

20. lmao seriously tho what did she think was gonna happen how could that possibly ever go good for her .
