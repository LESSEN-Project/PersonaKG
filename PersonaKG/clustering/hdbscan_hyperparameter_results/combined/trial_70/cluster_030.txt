14. from what i can tell in the demo , there are very clear reasons that it does not take place after dragon age  origins , so you ' re not missing out plot  wise if that ' s the concern . honestly , you say you like the demo , that ' s your answer right there . it ' ll be that but more complicated with inventory management and such .

17. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .

19. you need to find the right shampoo that ' s important . i generally liked aussie . a lotta girls like dove . invest in conditioner . now i ' ll tell you a secret . there ' s a bottle of anti static spray . its blue bottle with a women in a skirt spraying the skirt . i always use that before i brush . but i ' ll warn you , who knows what ' s in it , it ' s most likely flammable but your brush will have next to zero resistance

20. see it ' s hard to describe , but he ' s not one who likes to get embarrassed because he gets super upset and angry . he totally lashes out , so i figured with an instance such as this , maybe wait for him to come to me ? or is that the same as like we ' ll basically never talk about it ?
