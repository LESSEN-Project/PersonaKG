   (ID: 87921f4850625bbc1ea70e7a3027781ab887303e)

8. i highly recommend getting the nathan drake collection for ps4 that has the first digit games on it . you can decide for yourself which is your favorite but they all have a lot of great moments and it ' s worth playing from the start just to see how nate  elena met .
   (ID: a18adc4ad3b28b34dfa3063a1c77566b8681a79d)

   (ID: bd005ac438966eb1f8d6de10fcb1bb6fd4565782)

12. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

13. yea , i don ' t support it . you just can ' t change their mind by telling them these things , the only reason they are homophobic or racist it because they ' re ignorant , impossible to change their minds .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

   (ID: bfb28ccea698c3dc12ee1909c3188e266edbbb84)

17. why are they even working on this still ? they should just stop what they ' re doing , implement z2 and start fucking things up on that map . at least people will . have new bugs to find .
   (ID: 7ee28e75f6892a783098b002e4b064fa768322bc)

18. little house on the prarie , andy griffith show , the waltons . just regular good ol lessons about life . how that you have to struggle and suffer through things sometimes and not have anyone to ' save ' you . and you learn to be a better person because of it .
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

19. yea , i realize that , however , it was pounded into since i was digit . one of the few good things about my father is that he actually gave a damn about the environment . so little me was constantly told to sort the trash and whatnot . it ' s just something i never let go .
   (ID: 5ee4d4a98d2da62835d0e63abf8fe5bbfa95111b)
