9. nah without knowing the details of the argument but generally if you want your aunt there , you should invite her . not inviting her will be mean and make it seem to her that you are taking everyone else ' s side . i wouldnt reccomend appeasment as your method of life , id reccomend talking to everyone involved and everyone that feels bad and talk with them about this whole situation and whether or not they can be adults and get over it for a day . i think if you like your aunt , would want to spend the birthday with her , the argument wasn ' t her fault and you proceed to not invite her you would be the asshole without a doubt . otherwise try talking to everyone involved

   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

12. i don ' t mean balance as in the character meta , but in the community sense . more people are on equal footing . and yeah i agree the prices are ridiculous but unfortunately i don ' t think it ' ll change to much . i wish they would do a system like injustice where you could buy most characters for the farmable currency , but some would be event based

15. i see your point but for an equal relationship where both parties are happy you need to care for your partner too , maybe it  s something you don  t really care about but i mean that  s how i do my thing and you do yours .
   (ID: fe4ddb52a6f20437e3f3c6003b775cb72c3d048f)

16. do extreme steps to stop yourself from gambling . that ' s the only way now . if you really have the mindset to change , go way way extreme . ban yourself from casinos , websites , or anything . cut your internet . find a therapist . call addiction hotlines . ask a friend , family for help . this will only get better if you make moves . i suggest do it now while your in the ' zone ' of making a change in your life .
   (ID: a3bc874aed8bb8421b25930723a7210bcd9b2aec)

17. lifetime powertrain ? is it honored at other shops ? what if the dealer changes owners or you move ? sounds pretty interesting though . i  d try to get the car for digit otd as i saw plenty of digit base s cars new for less than that when i was shopping for mine . i saw new base s models for digit . digit but they included a couple  digit discounts that very few would qualify for military  college grad so those were really digit . digit

   (ID: a443986595c715cd541cd3925619cb6f1e8ada83)

20. i suspect it the number of people who actively hate me might actually be much lower than i think  feel it is just because i ' m so damn boring anymore there ' s nothing for anyone to follow and hate , but plenty of people who don ' t like me . having asd doesn ' t help . i ' ve been told the malapropism " we ' ll burn that bridge when we come to it " is quite apt for me , because my capacity for dealing with people who make me uncomfortable is so low .
