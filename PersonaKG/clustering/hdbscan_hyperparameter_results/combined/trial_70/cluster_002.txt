--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 12

1. you are actually right but i think fumino doesn ' t fit that first girl image completely because most of the first girls usually harsh against mc and a bit annoying . fumino is pure and kind  hearted , not harsh to mc . it doesn ' t matter if mafuyu wins imo , i love both of them . thanks for your opinion .
   (ID: c41e4affc406bbc71e6c12aabf095d759b6dbec2)

   (ID: b481339e58c54d903a5bef6ed58d704163f4f9f3)

4. is there something wrong with loving back pets that show you their unconditional love ? what on earth do you think it has to do with being american ?
   (ID: 514a3ecd0d04716c9225352c4a3a5d5424dd8056)

5. its the same as when you ' re in a really bad mood you think fuck everyone and everything sucks . when you ' re on m everything ' s bliss ans you love everything . of course nobody means everything they say , they are extremely conditioned under the influence or the drug
   (ID: af764f37d4a75bdb762464b079f842d6af0847b7)

6. literally anything by frank ocean does . makes me think of the love life i never had
   (ID: ab5524e568131ce7cb4db227daae4d0f489838e1)

7. you think they should love you because you act , ' nice ' when everyone is supposed to do that regardless . you watch too much anime and are a creepy weeaboo loser . you don ' t share your cheetos . these are the top digit reasons .
   (ID: bfbfd4c4caa6b137f79275a24c99808ba3d2305b)

8. i think what  s happening is now everyone knows about the show so the typical applicant might br madly in desire of their digit minutes rather than madly in love . collateral damage is what worries me . there are people who would do whatever necessary to get on tv etc , when the shows  s over , their spouse and new families might be over too .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

9. why do you think we do ? i love my independent woman and am not threatened at all .

10. i think the trash wheel and water shark are symptoms of a larger issue we love to ignore . when was the last time you saw a cop write a ticket to someone throwing trash out the window ? yea me neither .
   (ID: 4ad10ae12cb226893a0aec21cddd0e791f57ede2)

11. yeah but at least you were loved . not ever being love by someone on the other hand i think is worse .
   (ID: be4c274bc118fc65202a843b71f43c10798b6eb9)

12. ok love . how about the cathedral in naples which holds a vial of blood from an early christian martyr , st . januarius . reportedly , the blood is dry most of the year , but mysteriously liquefies three times throughout the year , on days commemorating his life and impact . i think that one would be testable ?
