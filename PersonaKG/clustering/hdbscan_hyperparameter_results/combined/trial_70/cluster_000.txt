   (ID: 071de8843a9f6c2baf4f1a9eccd0700b9c6589a6)

9. i just read the other bit you posted , well in all fairness . it was his  her ? fault for not telling you straight away . you thought it was a woman , so your not exactly gay or bi or anything incase that ' s what your worried about , and it went no further than a kiss right . just count it as an unfortunate event and move on man

10. that  s not how it works , his powers are not brutal force , he has the powers to control everything that happened in the past , he is pretty much thanos with complete gauntlet or even stronger , he would  uncreate  pretty much anyone in any universe just with his thought . the only reason he couldn  t end everything in bleach is because he is too big of a ball of pride and protagonism
   (ID: d10c10d39129e1768465d09c5c492657be31ef47)

13. be aware that if you ' re caught and you probably will be , no matter which way you go about it , the consequences may be a bit more severe than them just saying " no , you can ' t do that " . you may well be ejected from the park , barred for life , or possibly have security involved . the only way for you to do it and feign ignorance and possibly get away with it and i am not condoning this at all would be to try going through hogwarts express or the main entrance and , if caught and chances are you will be , saying that you thought the parks were the same . but , if you try this , you ' re a bit of an idiot , and even more of a complete git .
   (ID: 2ac4d2cea574e655d7fdb1ab9b4886989929ca96)

14. nudes shouldn ' t really be required . when you ' re in a relationship , just the thought of em ' makes you happy . counting the days till you get to see em ' again .

16. seeing a lot of negative comments saying get help . guys , this is a game where you time and time again , without thought , shotgun blast mofos across the room . op was just descriptive and obviously has a unique play style . at some point we have all saved , committed crimes against humanity , then reloaded . to the op , optionally you can attempt to be a pickpocket expert and just take the gun maybe never actually have seen his inventory in that quest .

20. yeah , true . there are so many worse companies . just the first thing i thought of . it ' s great for talking to my friends and family all over the world as well as promoting myself , but i hate to see how people are addicted to it and over use it as well as whatever privacy stuff they violate .
