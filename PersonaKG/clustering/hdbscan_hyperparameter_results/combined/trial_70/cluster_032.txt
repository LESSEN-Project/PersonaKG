2. stark  digit ? heck no . the character he was more based on , ultimate spider  man ? yes very much so , though neither wanted to be a sidekick but an avenger disney  i prefer it to the other two because people like you have ruined them for me but i in no way think it  s this godsend tom is kind of accurate just not really digit accurate
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

3. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .

   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

7. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

8. oh boy , i do have a lot of ridiculous stories according to reddit . i didn ' t think i had really interesting or unbelievable stories but it seems like redditors just do nothing all day every day .
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

9. social studies . i can ' t stand sjw ' s that think everything is your fault just because you ' re a straight white middle class male . not everyone is like that , but there are enough to seriously rustle my jimmies .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

10. i see where you are coming from . like i said earlier i just don  t think this year is the year to do it . we really need an ace or two . other then mike do you really trust any other starter ?
   (ID: d5ff87b3b0a008d93a655ee4d43e9da3b5db7984)

11. look up " romantic bpd relationships . not saying this is what she has , and not trying to shame anyone with this diagnosis . i just think this may give you some insight and useful strategies you seem like a lovely , thoughtful person
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

12. i think you should have pride that you haven ' t slept around alot . but not in a way like you are better than any one else just i guess in a " i respect myself " type of way . which is why i don ' t think you should just fuck someone for practice .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

13. sounds like he has that " talking constantly " disorder . these people are insufferable but i dont think they can help themselves . their families put up w the constant talk but these people usually grate on their friends who almost always distance themselves . or ue could just be extremely selfish  wad probably catered to as a child .
   (ID: e3a7bbfa5fde0a706f721c3dc5055b3a8963f79f)

14. those kind of games have that " feature " but it ' s not what i meant . i think i just made some term up in my dreams or something like that . thanks for the answer though
   (ID: 9d412b0236e1db384766edb9df245de053d643ad)

15. other family members watched all of it , so i ' d be in the room through most of it . i think early on i just decided it wasn ' t for me . i get why people like it but it was marmite to me .
   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

16. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

17. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

18. main character wise they are standalones , but world lore wise they are heavily linked , specially digit and inquistion . i would hold on playing dai and start with origins . i differ from the general consensus and actually like da2 a lot and think dai is just an ok game aside from the tresspasser dlc , which is phenomenal
   (ID: 127d601df381c9f971eae1e3fd42953571015813)

19. you think that , and its not easy ofc , but its really just a case of finding someone like you . my husband and i can do ' nothing ' all day . even a week if he ' s off work .
   (ID: bfbfd4c4caa6b137f79275a24c99808ba3d2305b)

20. i think as a canadian this reflects how i feel accurately . it ' s not that i don ' t like america or americans , or that their ideals aren ' t the closest to ours . but if there is truly a superpower that is a threat to world peace , it is without a doubt america . i think just what transpired over the past year there , shows me that at some point an american civil war is a way greater threat to world peace than anything china or russia could do .
