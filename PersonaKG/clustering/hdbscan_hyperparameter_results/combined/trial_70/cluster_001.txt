8. ive found the best way to do a spellcaster is to take two paths  specialist or maker . specialists just focus on specific class of magic . digit . digit gives you bonuses for doing this . makers spend most of their time making magic items for the group . groups love you for it .

9. people saying i love you sincerely . i can ' t even say it to my parents because i find it so cringey . not even during movies that are super romantic and does it in a smart way . just no .

11. people lying to you about how great they are and how deep and full of significance and meaning their life is . nobody cares about how your grandmother grew tomatoes instilling your love of fresh produce , or how your mother ' s use of seasonings opened up your senses , or your soccer coach touching you filled you with a love of sausage . i just could not remember if i needed digit tbs or digit of flower for a basic roux . please put the recipe at the top and your poorly written life story at the bottom so i can choose to not read with out being annoyed by having to scroll through it .

12. i hate when people do this . just because you love and trust your dog does not mean everyone else does . the reality is that a loose dog running toward you or your children is frightening .

15. yep . it happens . i noticed that i developed a crush on someone else . nothing wrong with so , and i still care for them just no longer in love with them . it ' s heartbreaking to realize especially when there is no right thing to do that makes everyone happy .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)
