6. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

8. ummm . wow ! it wasn ' t the nazis who built that wall . yikes ! i correct my previous statement , you should have just learned history ! that was not such a wall , that was to keep people in . much easier to do if the gov ' t kills anyone you know if you escape . kind of puts a damper on escapes and the ability to plan them with others .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

9. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else

10. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

   (ID: 8797828a745ecd521e3b219ff004d26777b4f4f7)

   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

17. this might just be my experience , but with the younger crowd , jazz has really lost its seductive luster and now just sounds like you ' re trying way too hard to be suave . i don ' t know your situation and i ' m sorry i don ' t have any suggestions , but yeah , jazz sadly doesn ' t wet panties like it used to .
   (ID: 3994e1d32967dee02bf170d70c0ccc2d7dbd99d5)

18. completely ! i have a bachelors and masters in business and finance and cant find anything . i do the same thing to escape , video games , alcohol , etc . i dont have any good advice to give you because if i knew , i would be doing it myself . wanted to let you know you are not alone . same boat . all i get are people telling me to just be happy and what am i depressed about . can hardly get dressed in the morning and have digit degrees as well . youre not alone . wish i could give you more thsn comiseration .

19. tpms are horrible , especially in the cold . best bet is to look at the tires and if it doesn  t look flat , it  s not . it  s just a cash grab against people who don  t know how a normal tire looks
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)
