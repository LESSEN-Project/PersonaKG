12. yes , i think you should if transitioning is what you want to do . your primary goal should be self preservation , and keeping your dad happy shouldn ' t come before that .
   (ID: 08122a9a2a4681e85c950e276210d33c3d0a8f96)

13. make the difference between what you really need and what you want . for the want , don ' t buy immediately , think about it , would that really make you happy ? often it ' s only a happy boost at buying time , an instant gratification and nothing else . many would think it ' s miserable life but it ' s all the opposite , the want i end up buying are things i really want .
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

14. related  very nostalgic even about periods of time that came before i was born , want to and want others to adhere to traditionally prescribed rules for the most part , think society should be much more structured than it is , keep tidy and organized personal spaces unrelated  prefer the woman i ' m with to take the lead in relationships , easily initiate conversations with strangers
   (ID: 22f14b68675078048f36403bb14291f2d10864a3)

15. as someone else said , you need to go with it . two ways to do it  have a comeback . you said you ' re not good at it , but keep trying to think of some even after the fact . if they ' re falling into patterns with what they ' re saying , you should be able to use one of those . build off one of their digs and take what they said one step further . part of this might all be part of being low man on the totem pole , but you want to show you have some edge so you ' re not always that guy . good luck op .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

   (ID: f0cc6658fb97955562b5f1b7845c6141dd2eefdf)
