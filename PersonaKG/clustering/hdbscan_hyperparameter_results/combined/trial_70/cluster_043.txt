   (ID: d9e6e1ecc09dc9affbcc8ccb0191ff241370a782)

2. girls really don ' t have to try too hard . guys already like us . and since you ' re a girl , i bet you look way better than you think you do . get out of your own head and go for it !
   (ID: a2ac729ecf8bc4b4e5e9971a848e76d3b574e65a)

3. that ' s actually really aesthetically please . especially those flowers , almost like real life gardens . i think the simplicity is the best part .
   (ID: 419b67e0e2cdcb7bd8ea9a89d34d0747a1f5f620)

4. watch it again . its after he turns and runs . listen to them talk about it , as well . not even close . and if he had called it and thats what caused kozma to break off , why do him and holiday look at each other like a couple of bumbling idiots immediately after ? regardless of how you think of that particular call , instant replay would be of huge benefit to all teams in the mlb .
   (ID: 5452c32db6928ce9b53e7ed5109c3b875648debd)

5. no problem . hopefully there are more like you in the world . fair play to you for wanting to brighten up a strangers day . another thing would be leaving post  its on mirrors in public toilets telling the next person how great they look  have a lovely smile  fabulous hair . or if you are out to dinner and it ' s really good , specifically ask to see the chef and give them a tip . i don ' t think they get them very often .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

6. " dear death rows of reddit , what was your last meal ? " i think the question was like that
   (ID: 4b127841179d58078b4fbc1377158cb136f3156f)

7. i think it ' s a dessert , rather than ingredient , but yeah . interesting item . i wonder what it ' s like .
   (ID: 338e964d6f616e85c5b26cf7b63ec2dba22cf7ba)

8. currently they ' re being skeptical but haven ' t taken any further actions to both of you i mean like deducting pay or giving warnings , have they ? i think if they start to do so then present the records
   (ID: a04ffec23ab9c2af8d4ac433e06db2b5d1b4bf9b)

9. i constantly try and constantly fail to explain the meaning of " arrombado " to non  brazilians . the closest meaning i can think of is " what you would call someone who drives one of those trucks with testicles hanging , changes lanes without signaling , almost hits you and acts like you are the wrong one .
   (ID: 9a13b21f54717da1499379b5cb0e991e82d4c90f)

10. do you think they would still be missing parts of the brain ? it looked like the nodes would cover an inch diameter so there would definitely be blind spots .
   (ID: 7f5ac4f6e5058de85fb427076fffe8f6aa7ba618)

11. that  s wild , she  s either a sweaty girl or that bra hasn  t been washed in like literal months . op should be like  hey i  m gonna do a load of laundry , wanna toss your clothes in ?  . on that note i still think this is shp .
   (ID: 5b21cc135fb593212a5256d44f50dc5eda5d9947)

12. i would like to think that certain future events could be dreamt about occasionally . but that ' s a different story . i think that this time it is more likely subconscious thing . there is stuff bothering me . either that or i was visited by an evil entity at least i go to heaven ? lol .
   (ID: 7a3a98777bf2cebb6bd14409075a19b82035e535)

13. that  s too bad . once you find someone who you think is perfect except one thing and they don  t feel the same way or they take an endearing quality like memeing and throw it away it must be rough .
   (ID: f270f54ee5a501d23ceae23084513e682d0cfd32)

14. i think they can be funny with context , i don  t think people are laughing directly at rape when they make those jokes . ones that are like that are very stupid .
   (ID: cae6d1fb1a818280e66de4a71148560d2d217d70)

15. i think , this is woooosh inside of woooosh , cuz that comment looks like another joke . i mean , that dude seems to understand the irony and he replies it with another irony , because it ' s obvious that digit hours in settings is either softwaregore or some development stuff
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

16. i can understand grabbing raiga , it saved time to create the seven ninja swordsmen of the mist for the 3rd generation i think . even though hes like a clone of zabuza . answer to your question to my knowledge no . raiga is the only originally anime  exclusive character to be integrated into the naruto manga , along with his weapon , kiba .
   (ID: 9d6cadbef277b68098e82945a77678dbb2a079c6)

17. isn ' t that a power move ? for someone to pick a much younger partner ? they can do whatever they like and have full emotional and sexual control . that ' s what i think is happening .
   (ID: f042043ff04e1f2bd28d7c34b7937eb8bf31c76e)

18. maybe fairies ? i think that would be really cool . i like dragons more but i ' m afraid they might destroy the world .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

19. you can tell them all the reasons that you personally like it but at the end of the day that  s your opinion . many people think it  s a pointless holiday myself included and my mind wouldn  t be changed from one person telling me the reasons they like it i don  t think .
   (ID: 726d5aaac9472ccdcb64345cd6d082bee4eae6fa)

20. i think it ' s like disco domination where it ' s release is delayed but alot more worse
   (ID: 84a0b9e5d9e0e37c98f992c96c029f6ec99fb1ca)
