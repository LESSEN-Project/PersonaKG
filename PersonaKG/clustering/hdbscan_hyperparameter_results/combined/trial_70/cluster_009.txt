1. in the previous version of the app , if i clicked on a response in my inbox , it took me directly to that responsibility and showed the parent and grandparent comment . it did this regardless of whether or not the comment itself was hidden due to being nested too far . now if the comment is hidden it just takes me to the thread and it only highlights the comment if i open every hidden comment until i find it . edit  after further investigation i have found that i can no longer view the " community information " aka sidebar . this is an issue that needs dealt with because otherwise mobile users will have to rely on pinned posts to see the rules of the sub

7. not a comment , but an entire askreddit thread . it was about creepy , real life crime stories it was on the top page a few days ago . someone in the comments did some digging and found the exact same askreddit question from a few years ago , with the exact same question and exact same answers for top comments , just under different names .
   (ID: afb250d177d47ce6467dfa3414d91e9e07eec6c4)

8. most of the time the  sass  is unintentional and  talking back  is often just asking for clarification about what i actually did wrong and trying to explain my point of view .
   (ID: fa9acab3fbd86b1f64e6380ef31b49912dae0c74)

9. no , i have not read the book . it does sound interesting , but my question , however , is about the general populace . those who may not necessarily been implicated in anything specific , but still nonetheless turned a blind eye to what was going on around them . what was the psychology of their thinking  was it fear of retribution from the nazis , peer pressure , etc . that ' s the general nature of my question , the people at large who just , with only a limited few exceptions , did mostly or absolutely nothing to help or speak out for their neighbor . thank you , though .
   (ID: b22d67acc81c3e3bf700f9a159ec06062eb72fd2)

10. why did you take the time to question it ? were you genuinely curious or were you just complaining  either to degrade me or for the attention of strangers ?
   (ID: eab4b13c25e8e05018f7cb7159b0e36614341438)

11. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

12. did anyone else read in their head the way i just did ?
   (ID: 7c7d6a809e77ab08fc65ee63a1ab44c11bd6ab7f)

13. yeah apart from the signature in the book from our dear fred , which is digit , there seems to be no other date . thank you for your help ! any idea roughly how much it ' s worth ? i did buy to sell it , just saw it and grabbed without doing research .
   (ID: c06f82a9d6f502a9c5707645e6b0bc869ff37975)

14. those " weird looks " are just how wizards look at each other , jackass , which you would have known if you were a real wizard ! the important science question here is how did a fake wizard ever end up with a real princess ?
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

15. i ' m really sorry if this actually did occur , but it ' s just too thathappened for me to believe this . this reminds me too much of the stuff deviantarters with mary  sues post about their characters . maybe it ' s the format . maybe it ' s the fact their dialogue is just so basic this it pretty farfetched
   (ID: 28e24cb71e2c0068fef35890d39022b686e4215d)

16. did this repeat or something or did you really just happen to be there ?
   (ID: 93133d3335d1543505dad3ffd44a8411e6be2ea9)

17. fair enough . i was just trying to follow the guide i listed . he says wind lizardman is good for dots , which i ' m lacking in . my acasis isn ' t fully skilled up and doesn ' t have great accuracy to land her dots but i did get her third skill level ' d up which was great .
   (ID: bd951a475ac46323d867ac35ccf0cb4b3e756f83)

18. you might have seen this thing where people link theydidthemonstermath after someone links theydidthemath , as in , " they did the mash  they did the monster mash " the song idk why everyone ' s downvoting , maybe they just dont have a sense of humor
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

19. hahaha . i did this at work , simply tried to force a fart that wasn ' t a fart . ended up running home and yelling to my roommates " omg i literally just shat myself " . then i walk into my room and see my landlord showing some of my friends the house .
   (ID: 5d6cecafd26473d96b39b973965364f09d4d41f1)
