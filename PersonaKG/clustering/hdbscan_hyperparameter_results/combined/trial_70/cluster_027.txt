1. i still think it ' s pretty impressive for how long they survived considering that basically every single brit was hunting them down . the bismarck wasn ' t only about sea superiority , but it was also a psychological weapon . the big bad wolf , the bogeyman under europe ' s bed . i know it ' s easy to lose a ship at sea but it still amazes me .
   (ID: ad95cb68c3ea444630fedc23f3d4596fafc60464)

   (ID: 4136a1b6da64b3c5f49dfe23761d1a0ec8925dba)

5. i don  t think it would take that long . obviously some will not make it but most people know basic survival . people will gather in groups and survive together .
   (ID: 83ed088161a0acc5bb20774e9e10435e55e88737)

6. i think you mean more openly discussed . murder and violence should be discussed while at the same time nobody needs to know the details of someone ' s sex life .
   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

7. come to think of it you might be right . for all i know it could be some magical chinese wooden dildo in the shape of a fish !
   (ID: 0791967485c3fd08f13af7d16f986ab94fa30bb3)

8. yeah maybe with mammals and stuff but i don  t think snakes really understand the concept of help . from what i know they  re left on their own from the time they hatch and don  t receive any kind of assistance from mom . it  s possible but i doubt it
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

9. how do you deal with people like that ? i struggle with people already but when it ' s someone either not listening or think they know better i end up snapping at them
   (ID: f8771fc63bc4c52bb04b2e71d4aefe7bf406c65c)

10. all i know really is that if it doesn  t get better somehow , you should definitely think about moving jobs as shit and unfair as that is because my god happiness and good mental health is so so important !

11. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

12. the guy seems weird and i don ' t think you should bother with him anymore . btw . people who send nudes to people that they don ' t know well are not worth your time .
   (ID: ddd770a31dc9c8fa4ad153c94b4c0debc20cf026)

13. i see your point . i think it is safe to say that for the most part " they don ' t even know any better . ' they ' meaning everyone  rich , poor , middle .
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

14. think the quotes messed up , don ' t know if that ' s a mistake or not .
   (ID: 31010e05529816820e206497e04c189d0c81c647)

15. if you have doubts , don ' t do it . i think you already know that .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

16. you don ' t see the problem at all . you don ' t know any of the complexities or the implications of the issue , and that ' s why you think copy  pasting your own method would work . how offended would you get if the us told your own government  hey , our economy is the most successful in the world , you should copy it directly . of course you ' d be insulted . you should run your own country to your own circumstances , and we should do the same .  copy pasted from question digit mins ago
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

   (ID: 8764a223ca1af7d1792e76a58bf3b1209bf73ad3)

18. i hate when people call women hoes . what makes you think being a " hoe " is a bad thing ? what makes a hoe ? also how do they know you ' re a hoe ?
   (ID: c50abefedeeb0c19f834b1ebb28634054bccee26)

19. having my underarms touched . i don  t know why , but whenever i think someone is going to touch them or come close to them i freak out and hyperventilate .
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

20. how do you know after people go up that you can trust them ? think we have to go with the most probably explanation here .
