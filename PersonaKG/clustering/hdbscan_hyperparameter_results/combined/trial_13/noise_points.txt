1. part of the reason i wanna move to france is cause wow i get to go to a place no one knows me . the other reason is because when i went on a trip to france i lost weight due to everything having cheese on it
   (ID: 168d1161144e63a83a23f04ae4e64bd4b25684c0)

2. some things are just completely out of your controll . people get married , have kids , join the military or whatever . ive always said i would rather have one or two really good friends than a whole lot of acquaintances
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

3. shut the fuck up .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

4. never remembering names , just because it sucks to ask someone what their name is repeatedly
   (ID: 34784a4c9eca2e43db08bf9f548798a984337741)

5. that ' s a good theory , but i wouldn ' t discount him overpowering her so easily . i ' m not a small girl , but when i was sexually assaulted by a drunk man who was over digit years old and smaller than me i was barely able to fight him off . if i ' d been as drunk as kristin smart apparently was that night , i have no doubt that it would have been a rape i experienced rather than an attempted rape . it happened in the middle of a sunday afternoon , in a residential area and no one heard a thing , or if they did they didn ' t do anything about it . it ' s a hell of a lot easier to overpower a woman than we ' d like to think .
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)

6. the thing about weight , height , acne , etc . is that it will inevitably talked about . sometimes it ' s genuine concern , sometimes it ' s an insult . the best way to " redirect it " is to actually start being comfortable with your own self . learn to embrace your flaws , and no one will be able to use it against you . if someone does make a joke about your weight , you can also agree and amplify . and then after that , pull them aside in private and talk about how hurtful their comments were
   (ID: 3e7b07ddd384cb288bc529e6aeb73f840aa5a294)

7. One of my favorite things is cool hand luke.

8. when you speak does it smell like a fart ? i have an idea why .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

9. i definitely agree with that boss and the kotor characters . seems like a good time to implement them since no movies are coming out so they could be filler characters .
   (ID: 2a4bb889e40b61bb1755181c2b46750d3a082604)

10. first and foremost , be an example . then encourage and teach instead of criticizing .
   (ID: 0d77404b10744947bcd2c91d8c926021d4b8650f)

11. yup . today my extremely smart and logical mom said that maybe comey isn ' t as clean as he looks . she sent me an article that talked about how he didn ' t take notes during a digit hour clinton interview or something . i told her so what ? he said he didn ' t take notes except for unusual situations and trump put him in an inappropriate situation . i ' m finding one of the problems is that she knows how to use snopes to see through fake news , but a lot of this stuff isn ' t fake , it ' s just biased so much that it ' s lost all sense in reality . did comey attend a digit hour clinton interview and not take notes ? probably . does that mean he ' s not clean ? i don ' t understand where an idea like that would even come from . they just say the magic word " clinton " and all of a sudden any kind of association becomes magically worse than trump . i don ' t even particularly like clinton but the amount of hatred for her is insane .
   (ID: abbe051c76bbb939d8594349cac549cb5435920d)

12. answering this question . boom !

13. i think everybody should see it one time . one of those movies you wouldn ' t be able to guess the ending in a million years .
   (ID: 7bbefe3c73b49467552610b8dad9354ce8c09cde)

14. i think your problem begins when you state " i would be a good boyfriend , " and proceed to list off all these other reasons why you ' re supposedly " amazing . " i ' d say you ' re your own worst enemy here .
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

15. why do you even care ? let them do whatever , it doesn ' t affect you
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

16. yeah i  m aware how english works  i mean , i am english after all . my point is that it seems odd to us how american english appears to jump between plural and singular and i  m giving an example where the distinction seems to me ambiguous . if radiohead is nominated for an award do they win the award or does it win the award ? i know the answer to this , but again this is an example of the inconsistency which seems odd to english people .
   (ID: ed9fd9ff218602605c7fbdf8f02f658604680c61)

17. shame that the media has been doing his shit to pewds for years now , but seriously we need a plan

   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

19. yeah , he had a digit revolver i think , and a shotgun . police also found bombs in the area . people said this kid got bullied quite often and even by the coaches so he did it out of anger . the shooter also said he didn  t shoot anyone he liked .
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

20. haha ! so we are quite the opposite ! i always wear jogging pants and stupid ass t  shirts that say something like nanana boo boo stick your head in doo  doo . i try to go for the slavic style so i can blend in with all the polish and russian people in my area . hell even my car when i hit the throttle it will have diesel fumes in the entire street . i try to give more gas when i see mom ' s with strollers so the diesel will inject their bodies with microparticles . i dislike my family and will never go to " social occasions " but to really give an answer on your question . don ' t get caught in the first place ! watch every law and order episode . and one day you think to yourself he this is pretty easy .
