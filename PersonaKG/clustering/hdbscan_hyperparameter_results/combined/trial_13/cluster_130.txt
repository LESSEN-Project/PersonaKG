1. i don ' t think they believed i would go anywhere in life . i was never told exactly why but she lost interest and wasn ' t " attracted " to me anymore . not for looks but perhaps out of boredom or fear that there could be someone better .

2. hmm . i don ' t think it can see its own reflection from there .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

3. obviously you don ' t care if you ' re insulted . i ask this question for others . what do you think smells worse , that couch or the under boob sweat ?

4. i don ' t think the average gamer could even survive a week in the woods , let alone survive not being corrupted by the marker , or killed my necros

5. homosexuals are still able to pass along their genes , just not in the ' traditional ' sense . i think it was , but i don ' t think it is any more .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

6. i don ' t care if you have black friends . i think it ' s wrong to only care how a person looks and not take anything else into account .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

7. well i for one don ' t have children , have gone further in formal education nor do i have a substance abuse history . so overall i think i ' m okay
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

8. i ' m not following . in op ' s scenario , they ' re getting referred for a procedure  service not covered by their insurance . what about the solve . care platform would lead to the payment responsibility being handled similar to a pcp visit ? i can understand solve . care handling the referral for an hmo . but unless i ' m misunderstanding op , don ' t think that was the scenario .

9. these people are the definition of selfish . they don ' t think anything about their grandchildren , because they don ' t give a shit about them . they care purely for themselves .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

10. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
