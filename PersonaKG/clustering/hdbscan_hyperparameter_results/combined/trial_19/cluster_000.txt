1. they shook your hand and smiled at you because their religion instructs them to do so . if you gave a neighborhood party and a guy from down the street came and did something disruptive , i think you would consider it disrespectful in the same way people here think you were being disrespectful . i ' m finding it hard to believe you are actually this dense .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

2. in the long run , constant complaining may cost you more than you think . heyooooo . see what i did there ?
   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

3. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

4. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

5. i think you did , unless you gave me the wrong info haha
   (ID: 3cc393500aaac3a2ee1cd96955cee486bb062a46)

6. i ' m in the same boat as you , friend . i ' m working on getting a degree in a conservative field but i really wanted to stretch my ears . so i did . mine are down to a 2g but they will still shrink back to piercing size . i ' d say the lowest you could go without irreversability is 0g but each ear is different .  i don ' t think irreversability is a word
   (ID: 50e37e2011f73f739f76098c3c746e27b8422fd7)

7. ooh . touchy touchy . pushed the right button did i ? ready player one is definitely not a modern masterpiece . it ' s just the opposite of a king telephone book . fast paced , fun , entertaining . which one of sk ' s do you think is a " modern masterpiece ?
   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

8. yeah , he had a digit revolver i think , and a shotgun . police also found bombs in the area . people said this kid got bullied quite often and even by the coaches so he did it out of anger . the shooter also said he didn  t shoot anyone he liked .
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

9. right ? i was so glad they played maud gone at that show , though i preferred their version at shaky knees the most . what did you think of the new stuff ?
   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

10. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

11. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .
   (ID: 535c3113ba487b9152c4b0adbe8c36822bc45ca4)

12. think back to something you did or something that happened and figure out why it was done or why you acted like that . how it effected you or others . that reflection best way i can describe it .
   (ID: e982e025c0604997a6e2072eb87b9bb01bed38ae)

13. but he ' s an addict and i believe he was molested by his mother as a kid . he has done some nice things for his kid . he always apologizes or at least does something to get on their goodside . and honestly i think he did the right thing by telling fiona that sean still used .
   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

14. i sampled 1st chapter and part of the second . there are hints of effective altruism , but not much . also , this taylor is stupidly straightforward . one would think that utmost priority for a parahuman whose power stops working when she is seen would be ways to prevent being seen . the obvious idea is making a lot of smoke bombs , making suit out of them , igniting them all . if someone sees you , you turn into smoke  spewing teenager . as soon as smoke obscures you , you gain your powers back . once smoke dissipates , you turn into smoke machine again . that ' s the idea i got by thinking about cheats for a minute . taylor who lives this , whose life and death depends on it , would think of a hundred more cheats . she did not . i am disappointed . also , i feel compelled to ask the questions  spoilers about ending of worm  s " can taylor win ? if yes  why did simurgh choose this timeline ? why didn ' t contessa involve taylor in her path to victory right away "

15. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .
