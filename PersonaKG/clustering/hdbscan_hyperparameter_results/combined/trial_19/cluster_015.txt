   (ID: 9b41f9c0d7bce732d9af75c3b13bd58e9ce2a1e1)

11. op makes claim using vague terms , gets told to define term , provides definition , gets argued with or laughed at for mistaken assumptions . that ' s usually how things work around here . just substituting ' circlejerk ' for ' god ' or ' soul ' or ' spiritual ' or whatever the hell else . tell me exactly what you mean by it and i ' ll tell you what you have wrong . tl  dr whoosh

14. because you were obviously born here , have an excellent command of english and you ' re an aussie reddit user , so i ' d imagine reasonably well informed and educated and likely , left leaning . i ' m making assumptions here just as you make assumptions about these people and their situation . i ' m assuming you aren ' t working because you ' re picky about what you ' ll do to earn a dollar , consider yourself above physical labour and simply working hard , seeking opportunities where you can find them . or the most likely assumption is that you ' re just damn lazy .
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

17. his creator  owned stuff is fine . it ' s when you give him someone else ' s creation to play with that he can ' t be trusted . chances are he ' ll kill off your favorite character and replace them with a new one that either has zero personality or his just so annoying that you actively root against them . otherwise , he ' ll just spit on the continuity because it ' s getting in the way of the story he ' s trying to tell .
