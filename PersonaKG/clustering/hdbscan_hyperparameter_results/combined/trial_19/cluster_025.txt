--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 40

1. i think it was like digit days when i was around the age of digit or digit in the summer . i really didn  t care lol
   (ID: d9e6e1ecc09dc9affbcc8ccb0191ff241370a782)

2. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

3. no way . i don ' t think i ' d like to be a kid in this day and age . potentially everything i do would be saved for posterity somewhere on the internet
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

6. yeah the whole politically correct culture is pissing me off . and i think it ' s really a small group of people claiming to be offended . seems like outrage is like a currency these days .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

7. i think the proper analogy would be  a person who does not post  leave home won ' t get banned  mugged . the more often you ' re outside  you post , the more chances there are that you will be considered a mark  offend a mod . the more often you go to dark alleys  sb and sv , there more you risk , as the muggers  mods are more vicious there . one can give the mugger his valuables when confronted  be civil , follow the rules , and take his lumps when he and the mods don ' t agree , and then he probably wont be beaten up  banned .   x200b  see ? i too can make up loaded analogies .   x200b  i insist that " zoat asshole , zoat hissy fit " is a childishly simplistic view of the situation . to me it looks like  zoat is more active , so is at higher risk of ban all else being equal  zoat is a bit abrasive , so this also contributes to conflicts that may occur  sv and sb mods are power tripping , sb mods more than sv ones  you seem to think zoat is in the wrong and behaves childishly , completely disregarding that mods can also power trip and behave childishly .   x200b  also , at which odds are you ready to take a bet that zoat will receive next ban before eaglejarl does ? digit  digit ? digit  digit ?

8. my mother was an only child , she said it was very lonely growing up as an only child and she always wanted a big family . i have digit siblings , after seeing how expensive it is raising a child and all the other drama that goes with having digit kids , i think it is insane ! i personally would like to have two kids . maybe three .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

9. thank dude , but i posted this hours ago and there is like digit person registered on it . don ' t think this is going well .
   (ID: e3524b3478c664f2c6e8b00a4341ff0a26995fbc)

10. yeah i fear that a lot actually , especially since i watch hentai from time to time which is nothing like real life . think i should quit ?
   (ID: 1e6ea64fb15fb5b12b1d82a3a5bdced4e3a6559a)

11. i think everyone pronounces their ts like ds if its in the middle of a word
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

12. it  s more like you return to home . i think it  s a pun on peter being a kid like spider man get back home ! or the chancla !
   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

13. i think i found it ! something called " captain blasto . this article says that one of his lines is " honey i ' m home "  here ' s a gameplay video , though it looks ps1 instead of n64 . but this is definitely your guy , in space with a blaster with the wisecracks very much like the gex game i remembered
   (ID: abbe051c76bbb939d8594349cac549cb5435920d)

14. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

15. i think the question is asking what industries you ' d like to kill off , i think you ' re taking it as an insult
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

16. i dont think it works like that but ok
   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

17. cause trump would think of funny names for them like " beto the creepo " and " bad touch biden , " steal their thunder at every turn and make it hard to take them seriously . p . s . i didnt bother thinking up a name for bernie because hes too old to make it to digit .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

18. i would like to think that certain future events could be dreamt about occasionally . but that ' s a different story . i think that this time it is more likely subconscious thing . there is stuff bothering me . either that or i was visited by an evil entity at least i go to heaven ? lol .
   (ID: 7a3a98777bf2cebb6bd14409075a19b82035e535)

19. its more like they dont buy any plastic . they definitely dont use microwaves . even i dont do that . but i do think the plastic thing is ridiculous .
   (ID: 91dc65ba6eef536f17becface16989de7f988dce)

20. this card is basically a zero mana discover a spell . u can either play the discovered card or another spell but either way you are still paying full price it ' s not that similar to glyph because the discount doesn ' t last . it ' s not a true discount like prep because the card itself costs digit mana . personally i don ' t think it will see any play outside of hagatha .
