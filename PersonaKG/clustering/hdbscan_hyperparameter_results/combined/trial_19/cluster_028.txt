3. i get social anxiety too sometimes when i ' m in larges groups of people when i smoke . i don ' t know of a way to counter that , but alcohol makes me much more sociable , while when i get high i ' m just chill and spaced out . try smoking alone a few times to get used to the feeling of it , and try to smoke with people you know well i would suggest .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

5. i dont know if this is cheating since the official album version has vocals , but the anthology version of " eleanor rigby " with just the orchestra is amazing . better than revolver ' s version imo
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

   (ID: dc000fb877b86a0bbd3d65fe6040b512b4f5b042)

10. i know i know , but don ' t make excuses . someone can do it and so can you edit  " skate better " is just a joke my friends and i make at each when we can ' t land a trick
   (ID: b721d508c3e10f143c9836626787b26136faa266)

11. ummm . wow ! it wasn ' t the nazis who built that wall . yikes ! i correct my previous statement , you should have just learned history ! that was not such a wall , that was to keep people in . much easier to do if the gov ' t kills anyone you know if you escape . kind of puts a damper on escapes and the ability to plan them with others .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

12. i talk to people every once and a while they hate me at first then get used to me and friend me out of pity . i don ' t know why they do that they could just stop talking to me if they hate me but it ' s just what happens .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

13. the main flaw i see with many answers is threefold . negotiating will be difficult when you don  t know the language . even shakespearean english could be a rough adjustment . depending on whom you are negotiating with , they may just take it . and , if you bring back something that appears too shocking , threatening or evil , you might meet your maker rather quickly .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

14. " secret " , just go through all people who can cursive and you know
   (ID: 8eba9c7d48a60bfbded2227dacd3275ae756fcce)

   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

16. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

17. well , at least you know you can do it . it ' s just a pain in the ass to do .
   (ID: 535c3113ba487b9152c4b0adbe8c36822bc45ca4)

18. noobmaster , hey it  s thor again . you know , the god of thunder ? listen buddy , if you don  t log off this game immediately i will fly over to your house , and come down to that basement your hiding in and rip off your arms and shove them up your butt ! oh , that  s right , yea just go cry to your father you little weasel .
   (ID: 77a6bff8693a174b55d34fc32fdd8a87710fecb7)

19. so you keep telling me , i must have really made you angry with my opinion . didn ' t know it would shake you so badly . at the point you just parrot what i say while putting crying emojis in it i would really call it a conversation .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

20. don ' t let that bother you , i believe in you and know that you will do fine . just for fun you should look on youtube for tips and tricks on selling cars
