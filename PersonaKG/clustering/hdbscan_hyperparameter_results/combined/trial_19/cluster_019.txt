1. amlo is just another stooge that protects and propagates the interests of transnational capital . he provides cover and a nice veneer while the capitalists go in and loot the natural resources , markets and labor of the country . much in the style of an obama or trudeau . i have no idea why you think anyone would care what time the asshole wakes up at and why you find this at all admirable . it ' s funny you would leave out the chavistas and maduro . why do you have such little political imagination ? why do you think your liberal tendencies are at all permissible in this sub ? are you another one of these white latin american men that has no problem stomping on the rights of indigenous peoples so long as capital accumulation processes can go on unabated ?
   (ID: 77d0324af3e030bb9fb9365a16e870bd522fd275)

2. you think you wanna lose weight because your mind is already tricking you , but you really just wanna get toned . please tell somebody in your real life , it  s already slipped from your control ! it pains me to see how young you are
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

3. i think you ' re good as you are . never listen to these negative people , just ignore them . your hair looks pretty nurtured  normal , and your breasts might be smaller but that is completely okay , there is nothing wrong with you ma ' am !
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

4. just gonna throw this out there but i think the older brother is gonna be ippos first pro opponent , cant remember his name but its the one who quit and got fat  they just look similar imo , have similarly aggressive personalities and overconfidence in their under trained fighting strength , its just a feeling .
   (ID: 64ee30820164d5febf4618f35085fd26a3387cc9)

5. i just jiggle my belly and say " what do you think "
   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

6. i don ' t think there is any " one " for us . i think there are many potential people for all of us . if we just spend our lives bettering ourselves , being alert yet patient , we will find happiness . in ourselves and in someone else , if we so desire . all will work out . red  heart my two cents .
   (ID: 445ba4596e4bcff0c96b23f038cf784185970198)

7. i have one friend who knows but anytime i tell them they just go  oof  and if he comes round he buys loads of food and eats it and it ' s really triggering . also my other friend who i hang out with is going to latvia so i ' m kind of screwed . i think my plan of action is to get out of the house as much as possible so i can try and ignore my urges .
   (ID: 168d1161144e63a83a23f04ae4e64bd4b25684c0)

8. i think we got way of topic here anyway . the original question was well kinda why does gaming industry now day feels obligated to satisfy all those  pissy dickweeds  , can  t we have just  he , she , they  characters , maybe even white ones too ?
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

9. surely there are other avenues to take this information . you reported it to the police department of which luke murray is assigned ? nothing seems to have been done ? take it to another department , go get legal advice , take it to a lawyer , any of these options are better than posting it on reddit , and if this turns out to be a false report then you are committing an act of defamation . i ' m not doubting your honesty , just think you should find another means of having the law look at this accusation .
   (ID: 9e8a44f7c55ebce4785906436a033b33a1ccb949)

10. and if that small chance does happen . what are you going to do without a way to get help ? get yourself out ? what if you were just hiking in the forest and you find yourself lost , without a way home ? i don  t think the ability to pay taxes will help in that situation , imo .
   (ID: 93c3b3d523de0afd404d3bcb4acdf023866f9281)

11. yep ! i think we also see her mention it briefly in a season digit flashback to the red center just before she mentions the colonies and we see the picture of junes mom too .
   (ID: e387b7eddf8ab01e3dd767dc2f5ca52494fbe9b0)

12. you think you have a brain damage , then you kinda realize that you are asleep and try to start a self induced dream about pornography and it does not work , so you just hang back until you wake up
   (ID: 53aa6c267ff5eccf891e178786d41ca5df80a5de)

13. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

14. copy and paste made me laugh . can you not just type , what you think about the book and why will anyone read it ?
   (ID: 782311f0352356940fd2c1e77bc3cfa9f74b06fa)

15. just when you think it can ' t get worse , she keeps typing .
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

16. that ' s just statistics at work . if you have ever even glanced at the numbers to see how many planets are around how many stars around how many galaxies then the idea of any single phenomenon occurring once and only once becomes so unlikely it ' s borderline insane not to think there is life out there .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

17. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

18. oh hell yes . just the problem was that i was bad at swimming so i didn ' t really think about participating there not that i had a possibility tho
   (ID: 8487a8406f04273c554e2e578c3a667648916790)

19. if there ' s nothing i can do , i just think .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

20. just when you think it ' s gone you hear the eeeeeee .
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)
