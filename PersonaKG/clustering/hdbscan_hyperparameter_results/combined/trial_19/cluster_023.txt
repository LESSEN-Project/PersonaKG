   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

   (ID: 46a39b1131e50f9cc061bbaf88e15686e5c9359d)

6. i think it ' s more of a confidence issue for me . if he makes the first move than i know that he likes  wants me rather than me taking the chance and getting rejected . although i have asked out all of my past boyfriends so i don ' t require it .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

7. shipping anything to china is incredibly cheap . you know how much stuff we get from china ? milliions and millions of storage containers come to the us and aus from china . how do you think they get those crates back to china ? might as well fill up the crates before sending them back .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

11. i think it  s hit reg . as far as i know there aren  t any hacks that make you invincible but in the wake of the hit reg bug it  s entirely possibly it could have been developed since everyone would put the blame on hitreg

12. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

13. maybe school stress has added a little to it but i think it is mainly stuff that has been building up over the course of my life , i don ' t know what else it could be .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

14. sometimes i think that no matter how hard our life is , no matter how much we suffer or put others in pain , the people who have passed on are laughing because they know it doesn ' t matter and nothing matters in life because there ' s something else that ' s better for everyone once we pass on . as far as i know , death only affects those that are living .

15. kim kardashian . i dont think she has said or done anything to hate her . i think that her family have a succesfull business and know how to manage it and i never saw them make a scandal appart from kim ' s sextape . the only annoying thing is how much attention they get but thats thanks to media and people bitching for why are they famous every single day .
   (ID: 28b40f8090abf393e7d7a7cf1772fb2c16d434a1)

16. lol i didn  t really ask , but it is cute you think it  s worth flaunting over a teenager assuming you  re pathetically in your 30s as your name indicates . but i  m really not even a bad student at all which makes this hilarious . keep going , you can find more i know you can

17. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !

18. im waiting for kunimitsu and negan , and i know several pros and cons . pros are you know the most of the match up , move , what safe and what can be punish . cons are sometimes you do wrong input for example yoshi ender i always use with f3  digit but some times i mix that with miguel button input . also , having your brain expand the size of the entire roster , sometimes i found myself think of all the move i use when i fight those character , for example like if i fight yoshi , i would expect my opponent to only use what i also used but nope he use other tech so i find it difficult sometimes . sometime you you underestimate your opponent because you know most of the match up , and other than that , you can mix some move into other character for example yoshi didn ' t have savage but you think he has cause you play most of the roster . in short it can confuse you .
   (ID: cd4ad4cc67fcfb39fcb1f11e52709d863f1c0215)

19. i think it  s all of the facts that are not fiction . it breaks the fourth wall and if you  re the inquisitive type it kind of sucks you in and involves you . the book has a life of its own , but the reel world facts and history are there to be pursued further . you get this all the time with nonfiction of course , but when fiction does it too , especially a real page  turner , it  s really cool . you know of any others ?
   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

20. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?
