9. yeah ! digit . cube inside a cube isn ' t a tesseract . digit . according to marvel , tesseract is a stone  object which converts random energy into usable energy without wasting any energy . but here this is just a cube which observing energy and just emitting the same energy which is stored inside the cube . digit . it implies that 4d object can fit inside a 3d object , which isn ' t possible , which makes the whole tesseract thing a flaw and eventually rest of marvel creations . digit . so i asked why can ' t marvel build a tesseract which was a mistake , my question should be as you mentioned why can ' t the the company marvel build something like an actual tesseract instead of some random cube . digit . they could have choose another name instead of a tesseract , which itself defines as 4d model . but i guess marvel can do better than just a glowing cube regarding what their story is completely based on . it ' s like iron man made out of plastic . correct me if i ' m wrong !

10. nta just because they ' re customers doesn ' t mean they have a right to treat you like that . if there were some foul language then yes , yta but from the sound of it you were justified , in my opinion .
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

11. just off the top of my head . race is an optical illusion , bernie sanders doesnt like socialism as much as he likes attention , trump and chris christie are having an affair , and reddit is a cia project designed to gather psychological data on americans .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

12. it ' s not like you ' re even trying to communicate with the living . you ' re just trying to watch the match so you can get the digit at the end .

13. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets
   (ID: 0264eec5f9f9a43d83f3a82c46341e90961fa3b8)

14. well my friend you sound like a worthy gentleman . is this fair lass of yours isn ' t ready for the snorlax then it ' s her loss . sloth is the enemy of greatness and if she continues to drag it along , you certainly deserve better . apologies , i ' m so drunk that my atheist  heathen ass may have just quoted the bible . nonetheless , the point is the same . if she keep stringin ' ya along , you deserve better mate .

   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

17. do you work on an australian mine site ? it sounds just like working there . if you come across a piece of paper on the floor you can ' t just pick it up , you have to fill in a form first . " what is the hazard ? why is it a hazard ? can it be removed ? what are the dangers of removing it ? what will happen if i attempt to move it ? considering your answers what is the best course of action " once you submit your form to a supervisor they will read it and get back to you on what they believe the best course of action is .

18. i don ' t really buy that , as she ' s racing to the next interview , where she does the same shit . seems more like she wants to keep rolling on to the end of the hour and get the day ' s work over with . or trying to squeeze way too much into one show . why not just take your time with one interview . like literally everyone else on cnn ?
   (ID: a3c37892d1eb5776c9a4299ce29fc6200c20dd34)

19. funny how you haven ' t actually been able to make a logical counter argument . you ' re just saying " you ' re wrong " without the logical backing that i have . then the " boo hoo whatever dude ! you ' re , uh , just like , uh , a flat earther dude " really , i am ? i ' m literally just like a flat earther ? that is your brilliant counter argument ? that saying it is wrong to promote a lie is exactly as bad as lying ? that is what you ' re telling me ? do you . do you realize how incredibly stupid you just made yourself look ? you just made yourself look like a clown .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

20. if we ' re talking just the beer and to me they look like the 330ml kind , it ' s not even that much
