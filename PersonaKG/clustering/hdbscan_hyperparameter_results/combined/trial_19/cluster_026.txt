   (ID: f491028c794855d1611365b07d4525f7b98173ae)

3. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

4. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .
   (ID: 4422c1db26c9be5bec35694a448a490c2761d985)

5. haha it was a one time thing via tinder so i don ' t have it , but i would suggest you just be upfront and say you want that to happen .
   (ID: c6e395c03fa0151554baed67a84968066bfa9cf3)

6. yeah , i ' m waiting for my legs and arms to rot off , the cancer to spread , and my life to be completely be disassembled by people who i never meant ill  will for . even my family is going to be killed . strict . i just want to be father to my kid and have him have someone to look up to by living well with the short  trip i was given . maybe , too late .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

7. maybe ? i mean most of say you want to feel loved , you want a relationship that includes sex , this would just make it meaningless .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

8. fuck all this relationship shit , i just want a switch tbh .
   (ID: 064b68f55fd83de76c3cbc4f130670e6435e42a4)

9. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

10. yta , sorry to burst your bubble , but you can ' t make someone do anything to you . if she doesn ' t want to have sex , she doesn ' t . and making her give you a bj just fucked it up even more .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

11. i ' m turning digit next week but right now i just want to not be an asshole
   (ID: 79fc72ea72532d39a039ecb4e47a630a601ff4a8)

12. why would you want to hide your personality ? i see it as expressing your true self to people , because i have been liying to people for too long . on the other hand there is the argument that , well accourse it ' s just a hobby and that people shouldn ' t care what hobbies you have , but lets be honest , who ' s personality hasn ' t changed because of the fandom ?
   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

13. nsfw ! this post is definitely nsfw , just want to give everyone a heads up ! i just have to write a bunch of cramp so that the automate raptor doesn ' t just kill my comment because all i wrote was " nsfw . so , again  risky click at work , folks .
   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

14. mosquitoes . they cause the most human deaths compared to any other living thing . seriously , whenever i see one flying around , whether it ' s minding its own business or looking for a midnight snack , i get my zapper and dart to the other side of the room . i ' m literally fine with a spider , i even held a jumping spider to put it outside , with my bare hands ! but i can ' t even look at a mosquito without trying to reach for my zapper . i just realized that i made this a confession . sorry to those who didn ' t want to hear that .
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

15. depends on what your needs are . if you just want a hole to dump cum in , then yeah , a sex doll will work okay . if you want anything else , then probably not .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

16. digit , sick of life already , its so terrible , we work until we die and i just don  t want that .
   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

17. what do you want ? answer that first even just to yourself and then it will be clearer what you should do . i want hugh jackman to come over to my house and rub me with oil and roger me senseless . i can want all i want  nothing wrong with wanting . it is just that what we want is not always going to happen .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

18. your lie my dude . tell it how you want . over here in reality though this game needs a story to compliment the season or we  re just left with grinding weapons that will eventually get infused into something else .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

19. your flair made me chuckle . i want a note digit but just can ' t spend that right now .
   (ID: 6eec77fe98b9dc85ec1e5e7edc37cdb415794719)

20. you can smoke if you want to , just understand the ramifications for your actions .
