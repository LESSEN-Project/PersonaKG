Total from this dataset: 347

1. not too many . you just need to hit the right spots . for example , one explosion would probably set off yellowstone , which could cause a fair bit of trouble .
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

2. so true . i just can ' t really see how any of the other players can win , though !
   (ID: f179711c18514780c1b0257643d893ef1cf5a081)

3. it ' s not just that . this used to be a major spoiler , but since the recent update had a comic depicting it , i guess it ' s safe to just talk about it . during the process of creating a cephalon out of an individual , the orokin had a way of " leaving out " certain emotions or traits . usually this missing piece imbalances the cephalon ' s personality , resulting in the flaws we see now .
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

4. ah man i feel you . there would always be someone from my guild nagging to me about stuff . now i get you can take a game seriously , and i respect that . but by annoying me about it and being the little shit i am , i will do everything to just annoy the fuck out of you .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

5. just don ' t , be blunt and explain why , hopefully you ' re all adults and can understand the explanation .
   (ID: a911ed792d3b26b115aedaee6218a4a944c38521)

6. same at the other movies with superheroes , nothing against it , just not my thing
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

7. " nah . i ' m just gonna let it sit here until next christmas . "
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

8. no , of course not . but my ex left me for someone else so this has already happened . i ' d never dream of cheating on my partner or doing anything to hurt them , but apparently it ' s fine to do it to me . just makes me wonder why i bother having morals when i just get shit on anyway .
   (ID: b42bcbaed0ea1f011b4d8c42d4ad9df732ecc5d5)

9. they  re wrong and so are you , because there literally is not a correct answer . sorry if what i said stung , but i hear it all the time from fans who obsess over it instead of just enjoying the show .
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

10. you do need to take steps to improve your life , but a big part of cbt is just thinking positively . recognizing the way you ' re thinking now is irrational , that your problems aren ' t insurmountable , and that you have reason to be hopeful for the future . it ' s annoying that people expect you to be better instantly , but thinking positively is the cure .
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

11. can i ask why ? and i mean that genuinely , i just never found it to be very useful or interesting at all
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

12. this girl in my cafeteria was on crutches and trying to walk somewhere with a plate of food in her had and clearly needed some help and i was debating weather or not i should go help when another student offers to hold her plate and it just made me smile
   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

13. and they  re just going to put that on the internet ! what about the chickens family !
   (ID: 9ec97fcc6f16d54d7e24ba1cdb5ebe5785854536)

14. so guess his name is just rivers then ? despite not having any connection to the riverlands ? why are you so obsessed with this post ?
   (ID: e84ec39cf97c9609b6feb31cbaab5faf551f372d)

15. when you load up one of them , there ' s a setting that says " position " . you just have to change the value and it should move .
   (ID: 7d84a169d4ddae2aee36640f218ff2b5b534792d)

16. that ' s amusing ! do you do it for some medical reasons , or are there people who just use these casually ?
   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)

17. i am a really picky eater so there are so many foods i could put down here . but the number one thing i hate that everyone ' s else loves is ketchup . and yes , i have puked over it . hated it all my life and at this point i realize its in my , ind but i just can ' t over it . its toxic in my mind .
   (ID: e3a37ef234435ebde735894f98de2b3f90e3bbe9)

18. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

19. big bang theory , i just couldn ' t get into it and always wondered why it ' s so popular
   (ID: 199ca187d50b43aebb52968a5525289cb65a1520)

20. goldberry could do it , tom bombadil wouldn ' t let anything happen to her . she could just walk around casually killing filthy orcses till there ' s none left
