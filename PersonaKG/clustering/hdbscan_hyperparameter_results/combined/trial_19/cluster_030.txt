--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 50

1. as a kid , hell . i was the youngest , so i was constantly picked on , and my parents would tell me " don ' t provoke them " even when i hadn ' t done anything . they also acted like if one of us knew something , we should all know it , even though some of us had way less experience  education than the others . and yes , parents have favorites , and it makes the others feel inferior as shit . as an adult , we stopped fighting and now it ' s like we ' re friends that will never grow distant , even if we don ' t see each other for ages .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

   (ID: abbe051c76bbb939d8594349cac549cb5435920d)

3. pulp fiction . interesting directing but the plot as a whole was awful and the witty dialogue couldn  t make up for a lack of a sense of purpose . an issue i have with many nonlinear stories is that it detracts from the tension in certain scenes . it  s like when you  re reading a book and see that there  s still digit pages left , so you know nothing bad is going to happen to the main character .
   (ID: c418fa452eafbca022ce1c49b521d4574aa77cd1)

4. not a secret but i feel like everyone should know that moai created all . it is the only true god and being . we are all simply spectacles of moai .
   (ID: 88279b92dca36b3b3c236d960135a2afe2e68b33)

5. i do this , because it occurred to me one day to save the electricity . wife says it ' s weird every time she walks into the bathroom during my shower . it ' s not like i don ' t know where my body parts are .
   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

6. i feel like a lot people don ' t know what a neutron star is let alone how dense they can be . it ' s not common knowledge .
   (ID: 89e5ffcdc3b9c2cbc19f7274b7643ce26a8e2bbd)

8. shmukatelli would do well to get to know someone with genuine gender dysphoria , and shmukatelli might learn some compassion for those with the condition . getting a sex change is not something one goes through on a whim . neither i , nor anyone in my family is like this that i know of but if my children ever came forward as such , i would support whatever decision they might make .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

11. my point is that there may be a youtuber you like more and you would never know . sparklz is good tho but i stopped watching minecraft a while ago and now that i use reddit myself he doeant have any content that interests me .
   (ID: 0501bf1e5cd313190bb4590a1c677057b15a6e47)

   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

14. it ' s less about the frito pie and more about the discovering of it . i ' d had most of the others you mention well before moving here . that one i hadn ' t even heard of , didn ' t know it existed . you ' re right , there are southern foods i like better , and a lot of em . but frito pie was somehow a secret
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

15. i know you ' re going to get downvoted and are using hyperbole , but that may not be bad for them . not a " forced labor " kind of thing , but something designed to show them the value of work . maybe they could help build a park or something like that .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

19. i have time every single night when i rubber band my controller and go to sleep . yes i know banding isn  t necessary but i like my guy to stroll around carelessly , like andy dufresne
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

20. okay , this is really interesting question . i ' d like to know why the fuck dont you flush and give another person a huge anxiety and act so awfully . not the dude asking the question , but those who don ' t flush the shit .
