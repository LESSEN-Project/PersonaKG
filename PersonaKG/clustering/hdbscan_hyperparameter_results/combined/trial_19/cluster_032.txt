1. thank you for the response , i  ve been considering whether she  s really worth keeping around anyways . it  s just so hard to cut out someone who you  ve known your whole life .
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

2. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .

3. hey guys , great place you ' ve got here . something struck me , and i decided i need to go ahead and grow out what i can and see where it goes . most times i ' ve had some degree of facial hair , but anything of beard caliber seemed a far off dream . then i figured , " why not " any tips ? also , and this may be an odd question . based on what you guys see here , could you link me to a picture of a beard that looks similar to how you ' d anticipate mine coming in ? just figuring since you ' ve guys seen many beards start off here , you can kind of read where it may go to a degree . edit  my plan is to let it grow at least one month , sept . 1st .

4. always ask for a lawyer especially of you haven ' t done anything wrong . for example  cop  " where were you yesterday around 2pm ? you  " i was at walmart buying groceries " harmless right ? yea , until you find out there was a murder next door to walmart at digit  05pm and you ' ve just put yourself at the scene of a crime . congrats , by being cooperative , you ' ve just made yourself a suspect . and that ' s assuming the cop isn ' t just straight up lying to you in order to get you to say something incriminating .

5. most guys just go for it . if your super uneasy you can ask her first . i ' ve been asked before , it ' s not a total killer either . don ' t worry if it ' s not perfect !
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

6. here ' s another sv650 fan jumping in . bought my first sv650s after digit years of riding . best bike i ever owned in the " what a hoot to ride " category . i ' ve since had two more and an sv1000 which , while far more capable in most respects , just doesn ' t have the same just plain fun to ride character .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

7. be me , digit year old mexi boy , scared and tired of what i ' ve just learned my body could do . ' twas noon and the wall seemed hot . so yeah a wall .
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

8. i try to do the accents from whatever tv show i ' m watching . i ' ve just watched true blood so i ' ve been mixing in the occasional deep south phrase now and then
   (ID: 5dc1e0203cb86a245c4ede5cb73923b295b1fdc8)

9. you could ' ve just made it into multiple pannels , that would have made it easier to read
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

10. what i personally am afraid of are the open statements that mail won ' t be integrated any more . i ' ve never been a heavy e  mailer , but found out about the integrated mail and feed client around version digit and began using it just for the sake of convenience . it has been just fine as an integrated client , but as a stand  alone one is a big joke compared to thunderbird , for example .
