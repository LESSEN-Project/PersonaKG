1. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

   (ID: 73e90e443642babe17d8b9523bc123bb79b21e79)

   (ID: 3e510494aac4d4cfd98d8ee4e7b04dffd5534bee)

9. in all seriousness , like the most heartwrenching thing i could find at the moment . usually its anime cause they take some investing . in the worst part i watched how to train your dragon many times cause that one scene broke me , especially after such a heartwarming moment . for anime i recommend clannad then clannad  afterstory , that shit will break you .
   (ID: 97f042c151ad751b2811d75ae69fd7feae42ed77)

10. she ' s in town for a music festival . she would have to want to see me for whatever reason for me to be able to see her , and i ' m not leaving my house . i ' m going to work , i ' m going home , and that ' s it  i still think of her often and fondly , but i fear i might have made too much of an ass out of myself here , and no one would believe me in my ' pervasive delusions ' that i knew her , and was close friends with her at one point or another in our youth . i purposely don ' t go anywhere near her for fear of being labelled a stalker , or a fixated human being because no one would believe that i knew her and i blew my cover super  hard for about two years . she ' s got a famous boyfriend , they seem close . i ' ve got the wreckage of a marriage and nothing but free time , but i ' m going to just commute to work at some upscale mall , and go home . we used to split our meals because she couldn ' t afford to eat when she was busy trying to make it big , and now that she ' s big  i ' ve seen her around , but i ' m not going out of my way to create any kind of turbulence in either of our lives because it wouldn ' t be right , and i just wanted a friend and companion . i think of her often like a companion because she was who i used to meet at coffee shops and take long walks with on the beach . she was the one who showed me the chirping that the local harbor ' s stone circle makes when one claps in the center of it . she showed me around my own town , and she was who i took on my first serious date . we had wine with dinner , and the waiter never carded us . we used to get each other into all sorts of trouble , and that dynamic wouldn ' t fly well because she ' s very high visibility and i don ' t exist because i never made the effort to stand out anymore than a regular guy in a small town with a penchant for words . i ' m a coward . i spend my time here dreaming of clouds in her coffee , and making love to her like i used to  i will not reach out .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

11. if i ' m a guy and i do nice things for you , will you still suck my dick ?
   (ID: b721d508c3e10f143c9836626787b26136faa266)

12. i  m sober too and sometimes say politely  i  m sober  when someone offers me a drink and i  m trying to head off or end a conversation about why i don  t want a drink  prevent a future offer . sometimes people don  t take  no thank you , i don  t drink .  as a full answer without follow up questions which i may not be opening to answering . i  ve had many first dates where i  ve had to say i  m a recovering alcoholic to get people to stop questioning me about why i don  t drink . for the record i  m not saying op was going to question her thusly or that the coworker was polite , but , just that  i  m sober  can have a more valid , less self righteous context versus a simple  no , thank you .  .
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

13. i was told they were rubbish but  digit  fall damage and digit  poison resist but i could be wrong , i haven  t played in a while
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

14. downvoted . freaking touchy feely blah blah blah . it ' s ok to not fix every relationship or make good with every person that you simply have no time for in life or you feel has wronged you or just generally been shitty . op came to reddit to have their position reinforced which it largely is not to get your brand of love  the  world advice . bro  sis was an asshole and doesn ' t get a free pass . if the real sisters in this family can ' t be bothered , why should they be made to appease other people ' s needs ?
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

17. do you enjoy getting fingered or licked ? woman can do that , are you gay ? now that is a little atypical but assuming he likes to fuck you , he ' s not gay .
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

18. it really sucks when things don ' t work out with someone you love . people make mistakes , but cheating isn ' t a mistake . you don ' t accidentally dip your dick in someone . it ' s a choice . a choice someone who fully loved you wouldn ' t make . i ' m sorry , you probably could ' ve worked things out if that hadn ' t happened . but he did it and you shouldn ' t let him get away with it . it sucks having to live without someone you love , but people make their own choices regardless of what anyone else tells them .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

19. dating someone in your class is far worse . i was digit when i decided to date this girl in my class . she was digit , ofcourse it didnt work out because we were little kids . she was a stalking bitch and i wanted space . anyways . after we broke up i spent digit more years with that bitch in class . after finishing high school we both wasted studying the wrong thing for a year . and i shit you not , we end up in the same fucking class together again . we still dont like each other but luckily nobody knows about it she is smoking hot and i look like a big fat sack of potatoes
   (ID: 4beccb79954eaf4ba6b69b6ac31b148b48f4f579)

20. sounds like it is doing you good . both of you . despite how  shallow  some people will think it is , health and weight are an issue in a relationship . no one wants to see someone slowly kill themselves , its absolutely defeating , especially when they refuse to listen at the cost of losing their loved one . so i personally at least think the choice was good and it shows that its going well for you both . i hope you can get back together .
