   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

3. if anyone ever said they knew how to do it themselves i ' d let them , but i would always always always double check the harness and make sure they were clipped properly . after every attempt too . when it comes to safety , it takes a lot to be " too careful "
   (ID: 2e464b2732570f16afced14ab79d30fa92622627)

4. ask him if there ' s anything he wants you to help him with . i ' m sure his doctors have given him plenty of information . diet and exercise are part of the usual therapy prescribed so maybe you can partner with him on one or both of those . you can ' t force him to do anything and sometimes suggestions aren ' t that welcome but support usually is . if the idea is his .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

5. never been to one yet that  s why i  m looking for suggestions im sure their pricing is listed in their websites . not sure about teams if you go in by yourself but usually people do it in groups
   (ID: 7c96bac704435347f721cc9a3056b8d7be16cc06)

6. talk to him about it . if he seems to dislike it as much as you do then i  m sure you can find a common ground of when in the hectic schedules it  s more likely to happen if either of you initiate .  dry  spells happen in every relationship at some point and it  s important to talk about it and reassure him it  s not a guilt trip rather seeking open feedback because you feel so strongly about it .
   (ID: e7516540d2045135f43a4a7c61f0bd88856c8ff4)

7. i ' m not sure how you can ' t find rez scrolls , essentially every vendor has them . in regards to improving , you haven ' t given any detail as to what exactly you ' re doing now . what level is your party ? what ' s your party makeup ? what skills are you using ? what ' s going wrong ?
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

   (ID: 1f135ff98983a673a19c956d41be6fdeca8513e4)

14. not sure how many there are beyond implosion for non  japanese players . monster hunter is good , but only in japanese so probably not an optimal purchase unless you are either fluent in japanese , or can have the played the original release on the 3ds why buy it then though ?
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

   (ID: 7008f149db59fea91167255eafa8bc84beab0f01)

16. school textbooks in vietnam are amongst the tightest controlled , most heavily censored , and most unyielding to change of any " permitted " writing in vietnam . they are gone over with a fine  tooth comb by the party to make sure that the content fits in perfectly with their desired ends . education ' s end is to make the model citizen as they see it , to fit in with the big picture that they promulgate .
   (ID: 5b02e2fd29e743c4c80de2b0919a03d95400c23a)

17. haha , this too . because weapon durability . her dragonstone had digit uses and i ' m pretty sure you couldn ' t repair it . once it broke , she couldn ' t transform anymore and she would effectively lose a lot of stats .
   (ID: 89e5ffcdc3b9c2cbc19f7274b7643ce26a8e2bbd)

18. i  m pretty sure it  s not paraphernalia if it  s clean and never been used so you would only get in trouble for whatever amount of green you have on you . scales though , that i  m not sure about .
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)
