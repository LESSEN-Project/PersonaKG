1. it was a whole group . digit people and we were great . but we grew apart and i try not to think about it
   (ID: 41ecb08cd807b953da29a82cba9ddfcf32745fc3)

2. i have mixed feelings about this . i would say once a month would be fine  however , it  s not right that she treats your oldest child differently than the other child . this could possibly be because digit month olds are a little high maintenance but if it  s simply because the eldest child is the favorite child then that  s not okay and i would personally tell her no just because of that . it  s either spend time with both kids even if it is separately or spend time with none .
   (ID: b40d1d3ae1e77bcbdcb98e62deea24396d4b4d40)

3. brush your teeth and wash your face , like mom and dad taught you .
   (ID: a31ab3f3ccb2d987e0948a7a8ed52f5d74b72960)

4. wow this was super interesting , you  re a good storyteller ! i don  t think you did anything wrong considering you were having your own experience and you couldn  t possibly read her mind if she was expecting more to come out of it but you didn  t do anything out of the ordinary . . in the meantime , don  t go into her restaurant until this is resolved
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

5. same reason you know how to suck a tit . no one taught you that .
   (ID: 2ad50e702ea7ef4cc62a34ca116f658d564c0474)

6. airpods , or any high  quality headphones for that matter .
   (ID: 26831d6557d17492ae3b0b54585b32e08055f834)

7. hitler joined a meeting with a new home and the company of a great time of course to help us out and about how we can decide on the right things and then i  ll get to the next one and i see it again soon as possible and we will be leaving here in a little while so i  m going on to the meeting with my parents and i have a lot to say about it and then i can come over there to see if i have any other ideas i would love for me haha is that way i would like you and then i  ll get it done for sure .
   (ID: be9f60605270d73ac3a4e5b587575b1f65df15f5)

8. i was excited for fo4 because i have tried to get into fo3 many times before and always failed to enjoy it . i was hoping that fo4 would fix the problems but i was disappointed . other people may be able to overlook the issues i found with the game and enjoy it for its other merits , but i found the same flaws in digit as in digit  the most significant point  clunky combat . i can ' t really describe what " clunky " feels like exactly but the movement and the shooting feel " slow " and unresponsive , and they don ' t feel like they really have an impact . i found these same issues when playing skyrim and this seems to be a trademark of the elder scrolls and fallout series . the movements don ' t seem to really connect to your enemy , if that makes sense . perhaps it ' s an issue with animations ? a polar opposite to this would be games made with the source engine where all your actions feel more " precise . " again , i can ' t really describe what i mean as it ' s a subjective feeling . the ui , in addition to the combat , felt extremely clunky . everything from equipping items to switching weapons to navigating the menu to using vats felt like a chore . it seems like i could never navigate the menus consistently . i also wish they could have implemented a good minimap instead of the linear compass thing not sure what it ' s called . having to access the pip boy again , navigating menus to look at the minimap which turned out to not be helpful at all was a nuisance . optimization . i may be wrong here but i feel like i should be running the game better than i am . i have an i5 digit and an r9 digit . i have everything set to high or ultra except for god rays , which i set to medium . i set aa and af to low . i occasionally dip into the digit  digit range . i realize my graphics card isn ' t top of the line but i get better performance on games which are more or equally as visually demanding . i never dip below digit fps in games such as fc4 , gtav , and dying light , and i have the graphics also set to high  ultra with low aa and af .
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

9. i know it ' s someone else since you replied with decency . just find it comical how my own view and something that should affect no one still offends people . it ' s a pathetic culture we have going on .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

10. maybe it ' s just my screen , but i can ' t tell for the life of me what the hell those are .
   (ID: 4d17a8a4d7907bba6d158e8a0b9c3504d69be003)

11. i try to remember this  if a person is making me upset , they are directly controlling me . and that doesn  t sit well with me for very long , and i eventually get back in control of myself . sometimes it helps to turn the other cheek and look at the offender with pity instead of rage . and if you think it  s not possible to do this , you  re wrong . my wife cheated on me with at least two people while i was in my third deployment to iraq . she even got knocked up and had an abortion before i came home . we  reconciled .  seven years later , she did it again , only this time she  s keeping the baby , moved out , and now i am a single father raising three kids , two cats , a dog , seven chickens and a house that needs a little love . it  s easy to say and difficult to practice . but sometimes , if you tell yourself that you don  t give a shit enough , eventually you will convince yourself . i struggle . i  m sure i will continue to struggle . thank god for places like this where we can support each other ! feel free to pm me if you ever need to vent with someone . i don  t get out much , and having a conversation about this sort of thing with someone who truly understands makes all the difference in the world !
   (ID: c2097b63bc9ef8216809570b6fc2ffc70e406b32)

12. would you ever like to visit countries in the west . if so which ones and why ?
   (ID: 96ea4e7f6c3452a58ef71fc7276006fdbf2ccb01)

13. that would actually explain a lot , come to think of it .
   (ID: 5fe12b36dc6d3370836c6683997c005efb656c99)

14. this is the conversation i usually have with myself in my head . man its quiet . i ' m not tired just close your eyes and try to fall asleep anyway , you know when that alarm goes off digit hours from now it ' s gonna suck and you aren ' t going to want to wake up . i wish i had a girlfriend to hold right now . you have a body pillow just cuddle with that . but the feathers stick out and poke me ! stop being a bitch . why do i itch all over ? is it time to buy new sheets ? do i need silk sheets or something to not itch this much ? i must have really sensitive skin . i hate having sensitive skin did my phone just make a notification noise ? it ' s probably a candy crush request or something stupid just check it in the morning you need to sleep . yeah but what if it ' s something entertaining or someone trying to talk to me ? you know it ' s not . rolls over . that fucking notification , what is it ? fuck it . gets out of bed and walks to phone somebody commented on a post that you commented on . see i told you it wasn ' t important . nobody is thinking about you right now enough to make your phone make noise . checks time . shit ok digit hours until i have to wake up . we ' re still good i can handle that . i can ' t sleep . take some unisom . if i take it now i ' ll be extra tired in the morning tho . anyway i continue to think about stupid shit and it only usually gets depressing , until i fall asleep knowing i have to wake up in like digit hours
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

15. i love introverted conversations . we just get other introverts and it ' s not a problem because we know it ' s awkward and we can just ignore it and not judge each other . so tell me , what did you eat today ? was it tasty ? what ' s your favourite name for a cat ? what colour eyes do you like the best ?

18. so what ? that ' s a rude thing to say i don ' t care how good of a guess it is
   (ID: 183a5eea32f2c73a87c734920d3188862433e411)

19. i  m not a troll . you think anyone who isn  t asian can immediately relate to what you go through ? that  s why i  m asking this sub for perspective . i really just don  t understand why it  s such an issue . economic success will get you practically anywhere you want . on average , you all have money . if you think you  re too ugly to land a date , get plastic surgery . you  re too fat ? hire a personal trainer . dress poorly ? buy better clothes . you can afford it . who gives a shit about how your race is represented in the media ? you think other races are drooling over black guys because hip hop is the most popular genre in the country ? nah bro . economic power is all that matters
   (ID: 2401680976bbdfe87278659ff11173d22161b22d)
