5. i can answer this despite being an english speaker . it ' s because you haven ' t been taught that cuss words in other languages are just as bad . we never snuck around our parents to say " mierda " , unless of course you ' re spanish , so yeah . it ' s just that it wasn ' t drilled into your head like it is with your own version of the word . like americans using bollocks

11. i  m getting one that isn  t a full controller but offers triggers so i can switch my shoot  aim button on pubg to be where they press . i  d say your best shot is to just search game controller for phone and see what would fit you best
   (ID: cd907372aff0871825a64e977822586e3bb0ecb7)

12. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

13. there is a kid in my school who is like this , except he singles me out for food and if i say no he tries to just take it from me .

   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

15. then replace the coil unit and spark plug wire . before you do , insure yourself with some flywheel marks so your timing doesn ' t become skewed , though that should not be a problem . i have just learned to never say never .
