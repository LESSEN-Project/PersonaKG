1. i don  t think they are ugly , i just think it  s interesting to see something marked on someone and think what was the motive behind the tattoo and what  s the story .
   (ID: c5e877ff3be5d3571f5fe899f55887a6f608ee98)

2. why do you think i automatically support it because i don ' t smoke it ?
   (ID: fddeeaa11799939dfe96bc7fae74a22b474aaf20)

3. well i for one don ' t have children , have gone further in formal education nor do i have a substance abuse history . so overall i think i ' m okay
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

4. i don ' t think so . you could shoot your something else off too .
   (ID: 98df62eadd0a0c80a6084d5e352985209b46cce9)

5. yeah , everyone knows you don ' t wear a donald trump inside . come to think of it , i wouldn ' t wear that big asshat anywhere .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

6. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

7. hmm . i don ' t think it can see its own reflection from there .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

8. i don ' t care if you have black friends . i think it ' s wrong to only care how a person looks and not take anything else into account .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

9. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

10. i don ' t think the average gamer could even survive a week in the woods , let alone survive not being corrupted by the marker , or killed my necros
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

11. if you don ' t care for my ideas you could provide one of your own . why do you think a gender gap exists ?
   (ID: f3657f57aa348caf1c32ec21ef139ea41a45dc29)

12. i don ' t think they believed i would go anywhere in life . i was never told exactly why but she lost interest and wasn ' t " attracted " to me anymore . not for looks but perhaps out of boredom or fear that there could be someone better .
   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

13. i ' m not trying to defend him but don ' t you think someone might have already redeemed it and you later decided to check it out only to find out it ' s gone ? it ' s happened to me many times for free steam keys in discussion tabs
   (ID: 43361d3d352286328dcb058ec017ca0e2d364601)

14. don ' t think that ' s the case . this mentions nothing about an injury here , just the marine ' s takedown and then how he was restrained . the robber was put in handcuffs , with no mention of needing medical attention .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

15. considering that the atmosphere on pandora is carbon dioxide i don ' t think firebenders would be able to do much .
   (ID: 395865cc8932d0b3d13214bce052e8915f32835b)

16. homosexuals are still able to pass along their genes , just not in the ' traditional ' sense . i think it was , but i don ' t think it is any more .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

17. i honestly don ' t think he needs any rework , if you are looking for a counter , hold still during the duration of his drone . it ' s that simple . if you get rushed and have to move then that was probably the point of the activation of the done .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

18. you don ' t . you just think you do .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

19. obviously you don ' t care if you ' re insulted . i ask this question for others . what do you think smells worse , that couch or the under boob sweat ?
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

20. losing partial  full control of myself is a scary concept that i don  t think is just limited to me . you do you tho
