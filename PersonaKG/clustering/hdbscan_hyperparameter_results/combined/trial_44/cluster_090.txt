1. well , thank you for actually fucking answering the question instead of just going on to call me retarded . so the " ghost story " might still happen . so i wasn ' t entirely lied to .

2. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

7. whilst browsing hentai porn as a horny teenager i was popping in and out of various categories looking for something fapworthy when i spotted ' loli ' without yahoo or altavista ' ing the term . ' pre google ' i clicked it and instantly felt sick , turned my computer off and worried for almost a week that someone was going to find it on my computer and think i was a pedophile . iirc i reinstalled windows thinking it would hide it . heh bad times .

8. i can  t mind his name but the guy who heads a movie studio and he  s on the run , you think he  s going into circulation ? america is built on bribes

9. go , why the hell not ? just be smart and have a plan to gtfo if everything goes south midway through . i think you should tell someone you ' re going , a friend an adviser or someone you can count on if it goes to shit . you will regret not going .
