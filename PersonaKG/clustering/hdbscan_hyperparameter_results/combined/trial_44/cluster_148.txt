1. or it ' s a bullshit made up story , hoping that they will be one of the first to receive it . reminds me if some guy who demanded to receive his kickstarter shit faster than other people because of some condition . think it was shiftware .

4. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .

   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

9. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it
