6. toah is by far the most time consuming " chore " you have to do every month and it ' s not even that rewarding , along with the fact that there ' s already terrible pulls from the rewards . most f2ps find it much better to just stop at the devilmon cause everything above is just not that worth it anymore .

8. even in this sub . last time some dude stole a pic with the oops tag on it the entire sub ripped on that dude so bad . all memes should have a mark somewhere imo just to give credit where credit is due .
