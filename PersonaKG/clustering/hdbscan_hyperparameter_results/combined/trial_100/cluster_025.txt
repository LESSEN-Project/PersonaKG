3. for the most part , you have the freedom to go or do whatever you want . whereas , in a relationship , you have not just yourself but your so to consider . as far as what ' s the worst thing in relationships ? that ' s more or so subjective . everyone will tell you something different .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

   (ID: f491028c794855d1611365b07d4525f7b98173ae)

   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

7. i  m really open to anything , preferably something light  comedic and from stage . i want to do something that is not over done . the only requirement is that the piece is not something overdone , for example i wouldn  t do something from meryl streep just as her pieces are constantly being used by students similarly , i wouldn  t use a monologue from a chorus line . i want something that my professor hasn  t seen before or something rarely done .
   (ID: 589a27cacaffb5126785db9f91c141a3cea2daae)

8. this question always surprises me . women want what men want according to personal preference . in other words  just don ' t be a dick . both genders , duh . no one cares about your stupidly expensive tricked out car , or if you ' re willing to wear a party dress in january . its dumb . just be people ! holy shit , i ' m frustrated now !
   (ID: cca2db8a0bcb7aff323abdba1f381d7388c9f713)

9. what you really want to do is find out what exactly is the source of your back pain . it could be a rib out of place , a rotated hip , twisted tailbone , bulging disc , etc . then you can start exercises to target those . if it ' s just generic sore muscles , then you would benefit from strength training to keep those muscles in shape .
   (ID: 6b04f3448a053338b902c242d1883da1e90dc7bb)

10. i always post that i want to eat various things . i ' m not a cat , i just never grew out of that ' explores world with my taste buds ' stage . ftr , i don ' t want to eat this moth  it ' s so fluffy !

11. that whole  shoot your brains out  answer might have been the one you wanted but it  s still a answer , you won  t want to whip out your cock and beat it to death if your brains are all over the room it  s just an solution not saying he should i  m just saying that would stop the sex drive
   (ID: cd907372aff0871825a64e977822586e3bb0ecb7)

12. yta , sorry to burst your bubble , but you can ' t make someone do anything to you . if she doesn ' t want to have sex , she doesn ' t . and making her give you a bj just fucked it up even more .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

13. do you want her to just sit on your face or do you want to eat her pussy while she sits on your face ? if its the second option just say " hey baby why dont you sit on my face and let me lick your hoo hoo dilly "
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

14. well it  s not a mean nickname so she  s not making fun of you so possibly she likes you or someone dared her to call you that , maybe she  s just being playful  goofing around or sending obvious hints that she digs you , its hard to tell since i haven  t met her . she could also just want to be your friend
   (ID: 5b1553b6a517f6dfee19019582f0bb534a60ae0a)

16. ya i want to have sex . not hurt anyone just use their mortal vessal to accept my genetic material and have hehim make a decent chunk of change for a few moments of his  her time . and that way theyd be regularly tested and deemed fit for service . untill they have to " get service " so to speak , then they take some time off till they ' re ready again if they so chose .
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)

17. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)
