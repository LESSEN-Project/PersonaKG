1. i am using the word can as a verb the second definition of being permitted to do something . now i was using it in the way to ask someone to allow me to do something and not the first definition of can . so please read a dictionary and come back to me when you have educated yourself . or just say , " you ' re an idiot "
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

   (ID: 28b40f8090abf393e7d7a7cf1772fb2c16d434a1)

3. judging by your response , youre probably a terrible parent who doesn ' t take the time to enforce standards of good behavior in children , and instead says ' thats just the way kids are ' and lets them run around batshit crazy being a fucking menace .
   (ID: 20b71c431f98b1f88ec1b3e7ada79d31df65a8c2)

5. is that fact or just a quote from the bee movie though ?
   (ID: bef3bdf131cc9dbe9d33343a3b9988680236cf9d)

6. tbh you have a very good class for pvp right now . i just leveled my stamblade up to digit this past weekend and jumped into cyrodil on him . lots of success . i have played a mageblade and i have cp cap so i have a slight advantage over you , but with the gear setup there are plenty of good combinations and the right skills slotted you shouldn ' t struggle too much . just avoid jumping the 531s all buffed up , pick off the 100s and 200s cp guys riding their mounts or oblivious on siege . once you get a good rotation picking on the little guys , then move to the big boys . if you are running 2hand always keep rally up ! it will save you !
   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

7. totally disagree , and frankly idk how people can agree , i mean when is it too much ? is notifying digit million people too much ? what about digit million ? why not just notify the whole planet ! digit  digit  digit we should all just be neighborhood watching for missing kids !
   (ID: 203253ab73b19e5cd1d950c82537271605475cea)

8. very good point . i wasn ' t suggesting that the work itself would cure all of them problems , just that it might be a good " quick " way to show that hard work can have beautiful outcomes . edit  it could also show them that planning ahead and delaying gratification can pay off as well .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

9. if it ' s theft , it ' s wrong . if you are comfortable stealing something , you have moral issues . just my opinion .
   (ID: 725e5a3de682f359cfb87481ec457a2f78867ef3)

10. wait i have another question , sorry for bugging you , but should i just say  hey  or should i open up and go straight to the problem ?
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

12. just in case anyone is looking . i mean , if they are more proper they probably won  t try to show it off . same way i adjust my pants to not show my butt off to people , unlike how some guys let you see a replica of the grand canyon .
   (ID: 6710bef520e10a3963d2983d4b36ef411e442f22)

13. now i ' m not gonna downvote just because i completely disagree with you , just could tell you in a couple years there could be some other group of idiots who don ' t even eat vegetables because would also be killing and say everyone should only drink water . whatever your ethics are , good for you , but don ' t try and force them into people .
