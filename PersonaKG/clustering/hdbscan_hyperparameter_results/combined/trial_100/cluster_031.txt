5. pulp fiction . interesting directing but the plot as a whole was awful and the witty dialogue couldn  t make up for a lack of a sense of purpose . an issue i have with many nonlinear stories is that it detracts from the tension in certain scenes . it  s like when you  re reading a book and see that there  s still digit pages left , so you know nothing bad is going to happen to the main character .
