1. quite the opposite . if they attend i will not . the idea that you think i have so much power within my family is interesting though .
   (ID: 03e00c6684f9fe5cb2996bc794372ee9a7a2aea8)

2. right next to my wife ' s incoming fist .
   (ID: 720bf2762acb0f756492e6e40ae840126dae87ce)

   (ID: d34dab0dded997c6aa6e6d2792ea9d8a26881a2b)

4. thing is i wouldn  t call it a debate if we were to go by the textbook definition . i could almost guarantee that if i sat down with lorinbassnectar he wouldn  t want to have a debate about policy he would simply shut me out . i  m sure , and maybe i  m making an assumption , but i  m sure that we could both agree that a lot if not the majority of his fan base has no knowledge about policy and simply follows what is posted . that  s what i find dangerous . when so many people look up to an individual they treat his words as facts , and this applies to both sides of the aisle . i also call it dangerous because it is a sure way of not only ostracizing a large portion of your fan base who listens to your music to escape reality but it could even pose the problem of many people losing hope in one place where they thought they could find it , and that is dance music . that  s just me and i can tell from the many downvotes that  s it  s not a very popular opinion .
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

5. i love my own personality , so yes , i would . it looks selfish .
   (ID: 4dd03f320502247ea725348e21fe67168d7cf5f1)

6. deserving something means they ' re worthy of it . i personally don ' t think anybody is worthy of leading an entirely bad life . sure , we make mistakes that can negatively impact our lives for a period of time . however , i believe people are trying to have a good life to the best of their ability . their best may not be seen as such  for example , people who intentionally inflict harm on others . there ' s some pain they feel that is relieved by doing so . of course there are other outlets yet they don ' t know that . i also should clarify that i don ' t agree with using harm to heal personal wounds  there ' s very few i downright despise . maybe i ' m just too nice though
   (ID: a2291731ea6532473dc0e3f9275ce68c86abfad6)

7. this one is interesting , kind of similar to romanos digit to digit that basically says that we should fight the enemies with goodness , feed the ones who are hungry and give water to those who are thirsty so they will be ashame of their behavior when seen yours . i kind of paraphrased that one but , indeed it is beautiful .

9. different people react in different ways , dude . not everyone goes right to fight mode , and that ' s probably a good thing for humanity . the only bad thing in the video is the people doing this to her .
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

10. no . it literally gives me zero satisfaction . i gain nothing from the interaction . seriously . i hate people who hug each other like it ' s such a waste of energy , space and time . if you ' re going to interact with me , at least make it worth my time .  s
   (ID: 7d84a169d4ddae2aee36640f218ff2b5b534792d)

11. honestly , i don ' t know . i ' m agnostic myself so i believe that there ' s just no way we can be sure of anything one way or the other . i wish i could suspend my sense of reality enough to fully believe in a heaven . i would seriously love to just know for sure i was going to see my grandma again one day .

14. i went to england earlier this month . first time outta the usa . i concur w many of your observations . the rural countryside was ever present when looking around  seeing farms everywhere . london was great . those crazy bicyclists ! watch out . the signs though along the highway needed leaf trimming as some words were obscured . everyone takes their well  behaved dogs everywhere . i found everyone to be polite  caring . even staff in mc donalds ! dont really see that in the us . parking wxpensive  hard to find a spot . castles breathtaking . small villages everywhere . row houses ubiquitous . but kinda small , no ? seashore quaint . lots of pretty shells in sutton on the sea . wanna move there !

19. do people who smell bad really get pulled out of places ? i  ve never heard that before . how would you propose keeping it out of social settings without legislating it then , if you don  t want to make those actions illegal .
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

20. they say the best weapon is the one you never have to fire . i disagree . the best weapon is the one you only have to fire once . that  s how dad did  that  s how america does it , and it  s worked out pretty well so far . find an excuse to let one of these bad boys off the chain and i promise the bad guys won  t even wanna come out if their caves anymore . i give you . the jericho   iron man  digit
