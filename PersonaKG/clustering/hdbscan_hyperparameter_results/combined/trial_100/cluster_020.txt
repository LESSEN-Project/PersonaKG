   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

2. all depends on your background and motives . empathy of someone is a must . for me , as a nice guy trust me please . you need this one thing , secret tip . you need to process that every person , even at worse has had a different situation to you in the past and you do not know where , or how they became who they are . you look at yourself , and your traits and be thankful , postives overcome negatives if you think that .
   (ID: f4ccc689474985c0e4cb0900bd2a946257f83dc3)

4. in a month i  m going to be a groomsman for my beast mate who is marrying my high school sweetheart , who broke my heart  i couldn  t be happier to know that i have been on this journey with both of them for almost digit years . so yes i think about her , and i think about how lucky i am to have her as a friend . you know who i do think about  the ones that there we something that i never pursued . they appear like flashes , the moment when i should have kissed them etc .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

   (ID: a8d677a357cabd8cb6d9bfa06e041b5b173582d8)

6. shipping anything to china is incredibly cheap . you know how much stuff we get from china ? milliions and millions of storage containers come to the us and aus from china . how do you think they get those crates back to china ? might as well fill up the crates before sending them back .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

7. i think you misunderstood what i meant , i meant that gbay knows what every other veteran player already knows . so he knows what to tell us , because he is a veteran player he knows what we know . for example this , most veteran players already know these things , but because gbay is a veteran player he knows what information will be new to us . sorry , the way i worded this isn ' t the best .
   (ID: 20fef7b83cf9ae51924e5491cac2f90901d833e0)

9. have you read the epic of gilgamesh ?   x200b  what consistencies do you see in the bible that you don ' t find in gilgamesh ?   x200b  i think my more general question is still , why do you take the bible as an authority over any other book ? muslims will say that the quran has more consistencies than the bible , and in truth , science textbooks are much more consistent than both of them .   x200b  how do you know the stuff in the bible is true ?
   (ID: 00b878c3a1ec656c05e2872b35fdccfcfda3baac)

10. please calm down it ' s a trailer and the film has an emphasis on dancing , if you know his stuff then you should also know there ' s a lot of hideous shit that ' s gonna occur . i don ' t think anything on his resume warrants a mocking use of " dark "
   (ID: 1d327d2812dfee71bf8ef77d36ffd5eb70efd55b)

11. how cute , you think you know a thing about what people go through . try being bullied and shunned to an extent at digit different schools , 3rd grade until i went to college . oh , and you would all collectively call me a normie because i have an intimate relationship . don ' t assume you know a damn thing about any person who posts here because you simply dont .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

12. honestly that sounds pretty expensive to me . i dont know the prices of the parts off hand , but i really dont think it should be 2g to do such little work
   (ID: 46a39b1131e50f9cc061bbaf88e15686e5c9359d)

13. i know this may seem crazy and scary but rehab may be something to look into . you seem super smart and aware , and with this kind of drug use , that will eventually disappear and you will be powerless . think about it and best of luck to you !
   (ID: e8fea87ced4a86b7ba9c50ae33cf5b3dda99af88)

14. i think my dad trashed that computer more than digit years ago , so i don ' t know if i can find the original art work .
   (ID: a283688fea41e1110e58705ec74d4e325e46d87e)

15. i think you know well and good what it is and you ' re deliberately being obtuse .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

17. sometimes i think that no matter how hard our life is , no matter how much we suffer or put others in pain , the people who have passed on are laughing because they know it doesn ' t matter and nothing matters in life because there ' s something else that ' s better for everyone once we pass on . as far as i know , death only affects those that are living .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

18. i see your point . i think it is safe to say that for the most part " they don ' t even know any better . ' they ' meaning everyone  rich , poor , middle .
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

19. i think it  s all of the facts that are not fiction . it breaks the fourth wall and if you  re the inquisitive type it kind of sucks you in and involves you . the book has a life of its own , but the reel world facts and history are there to be pursued further . you get this all the time with nonfiction of course , but when fiction does it too , especially a real page  turner , it  s really cool . you know of any others ?
   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

20. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !
