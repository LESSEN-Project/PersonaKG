1. i was not . my parents were presbyterian on paper , and i think at least my mother did does ? believe . i was taught almost nothing of religion , and only have the vaguest of memories of ever going to church . i think we went a handful of times when i was very young . maybe that ' s what allowed me to gloss over the religious context when i read the books as a kid .

   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

   (ID: 3e906e06d59fb5c2993270f0b4efed5b9ab122f7)

4. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

6. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

7. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .

8. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .

9. wouldn ' t everyone be a little bit suspicious , do you think that some people might assume you did something and go after you or at least heavily question you ?
   (ID: 1476398f6c778fb461539e3f78b07720d4ceee83)

10. it may be a little unclear now that i think about it , but if you look at the timecodes , i also won the first lost run i did ever .
   (ID: c9b1e924c86788c982ec59df3d5704354a2a4ae1)

11. i think they did a reality show about that . a homeless man was given a lot of money . can ' t remember how much , but apparently he didn ' t really use it well . but we should try again and again .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

12. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

13. i think we ' re in agreement ? or by ' yep ' did you mean you would stop loving your mother for money reasons ?
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

14. i think you did , unless you gave me the wrong info haha
   (ID: 3cc393500aaac3a2ee1cd96955cee486bb062a46)

15. dude you are my savior thank you soo much . last two questions and i think we ' re done . where is hide ? last i saw he was working for the ccg as a news boy or something ? also why did furuta kill ghouls and ccg operatives ? is that why people think he ' s a spy ?

16. well you seem to be correct about the cities there and i realize i failed to account for population growth earlier however the industrial revolution happened and that likely led to a large decline however the brits did do a lot of harm however india might have not developed as quickly . oh and btw the british raj was not a collony untill the 1850s so yeah that kinda changes the argument by a lot . now i have to make it clear tho i don ' t think what the brits did was moral meerely that it may have had possitive consequences .
