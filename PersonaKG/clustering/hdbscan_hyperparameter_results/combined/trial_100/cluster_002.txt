10. correct me if i ' m wrong , but i thought that this sub was for ads on reddit , not on outside sites . especially not a financial site talking about the financial success of a company . which is their job . i mean , just look at this page
   (ID: 73a501f273781aa2c0deb878ecb02dcab3a9d4d3)

14. that  s not how it works , his powers are not brutal force , he has the powers to control everything that happened in the past , he is pretty much thanos with complete gauntlet or even stronger , he would  uncreate  pretty much anyone in any universe just with his thought . the only reason he couldn  t end everything in bleach is because he is too big of a ball of pride and protagonism
   (ID: d10c10d39129e1768465d09c5c492657be31ef47)

   (ID: 8062cc5726628ea3a4b448436c6c6956263ea6cd)

18. i need to collect my bags up top , which on many occasions were either attempted to be stolen or people thought it was theirs . i should note i  m one of those people that likes to wrap their handles in every color of the rainbow , just to avoid exactly what i mentioned .
   (ID: 071de8843a9f6c2baf4f1a9eccd0700b9c6589a6)
