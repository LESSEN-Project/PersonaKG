   (ID: e6c4a2b8e8c999b54ade342babc3d7b48868cc6d)

   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

   (ID: dc639446b154d74c8655191b5a755643abd00c2d)

7. i can understand grabbing raiga , it saved time to create the seven ninja swordsmen of the mist for the 3rd generation i think . even though hes like a clone of zabuza . answer to your question to my knowledge no . raiga is the only originally anime  exclusive character to be integrated into the naruto manga , along with his weapon , kiba .
   (ID: 9d6cadbef277b68098e82945a77678dbb2a079c6)

   (ID: 7e58269155b84bc057025d5066e661ba2eb934ba)

15. ahhh , so its more of a terrence mckenna thing that you ' re into ? i get that totally and feel like a dick for my earlier comment . isn ' t it funny how how  trees  trees and  marijuana  marijuana have evolved . makes me think it was a giant trick to all get the memes and rage comics off mj . omg conspiracy !
   (ID: 8d969746b3d4e6e130957387edb6a2fef0ec54cf)

16. i think a lot of this comes down to the definitions of coercion and seduction . yes , in seduction the idea is to do your best to be enticing to someone . however , this should not be confused with a bending of their will or a manipulation . coercion is doing whatever is necessary to achieve a desired response from someone else , including putting extra pressures on them , which can be easily done if the coercing party is in a position of power , whether that is physical strength , employment , or status . seduction is like giving someone all green lights , coercion is like trying to take the steering wheel .
   (ID: df28c2a39b633ca418192316a199668289382292)

17. no way . i don ' t think i ' d like to be a kid in this day and age . potentially everything i do would be saved for posterity somewhere on the internet

   (ID: 54920691b1e05863de734f0444f66749700c4331)

19. i do find it girly  " gay " to not be weirded out by a stranger covering you in lotion and rubbing up on you . how is that exclusive to those who are girly or gay ? that ' s fucking ridiculous . what do you think women and gay people are like ?
   (ID: 372e357e1e3acd2a4dea24aa56a5900a539a9e59)

20. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
