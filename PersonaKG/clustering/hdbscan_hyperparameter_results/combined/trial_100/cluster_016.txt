5. but reincarnation is a supernatural occurrence that ' s only based in religion . the closest to what you are describing is jainism . it ' s still a religion though . i ' m just busting your chops though . all great fictional stories use selective liberties with facts . don ' t let my nitpicking screw with your story ideas . if all authors did that nothing would get written .
   (ID: 25ac51284c94eb6c58e189bbefc7f2bb9bb9e1b5)

6. you might have seen this thing where people link theydidthemonstermath after someone links theydidthemath , as in , " they did the mash  they did the monster mash " the song idk why everyone ' s downvoting , maybe they just dont have a sense of humor
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

   (ID: 7c7d6a809e77ab08fc65ee63a1ab44c11bd6ab7f)

8. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

   (ID: db1ffea2a957f19bfc0fffdbd89a6d65be91fd5c)

11. fair enough . i was just trying to follow the guide i listed . he says wind lizardman is good for dots , which i ' m lacking in . my acasis isn ' t fully skilled up and doesn ' t have great accuracy to land her dots but i did get her third skill level ' d up which was great .
   (ID: bd951a475ac46323d867ac35ccf0cb4b3e756f83)

14. not a comment , but an entire askreddit thread . it was about creepy , real life crime stories it was on the top page a few days ago . someone in the comments did some digging and found the exact same askreddit question from a few years ago , with the exact same question and exact same answers for top comments , just under different names .
   (ID: afb250d177d47ce6467dfa3414d91e9e07eec6c4)

15. well here is where you went wrong . you jumped into water with sharks ! what else did you expect ? these arent dogs , cats , or any other animal human have domesticated . this shouldn ' t be news , just a reminder if you take a risk expect to get bit .
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

16. makes sense . just funny how all ' s i did was make an observation which is most likely correct and instead of either acknowledging it , or moving on , they have to be so salty for some reason .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

17. depends how fresh . if it just happened , you say sorry and then might wanna give them space to process whatever it is you did .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

18. those " weird looks " are just how wizards look at each other , jackass , which you would have known if you were a real wizard ! the important science question here is how did a fake wizard ever end up with a real princess ?
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)
