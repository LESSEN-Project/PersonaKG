10. let ' s run a hypothetical . you claim a card to send to me for much higher than i agreed , and i ask you to cancel . you say no , and puca backs you . you are now obligated to send me the cards in the listed condition , within digit hours of sending . did you track the package ? no ? well , alright , then i wait digit weeks , tell puca i never received the cards , wait until they refund me points , and then ship you back your cards . what is your recourse now ? what did you accomplish aside from wasting weeks and tying up both of our points ? you did track the package ? okay , great . the cards arrived moderately played , and i will not accept them . i send you back the package , and you receive your cards in mint condition . what now ? ask puca to force me to allow you to send them a second time ? so correct me if i ' m wrong but you ' re basically saying  " if trades do not go in my favor i ' m willing to go to dishonest lengths to get my way . " ?
