1. i ' m actually still just on the side of liking it , but it ' s getting tougher . gaping plot holes , uninteresting storylines , painful characters , terrible dialogue , such poor consistency of any in  universe tech that i have to call most of the sci  fi elements one big continuity error . and that ' s not limited to the newer films . just started watching the original trilogy after tlj , and think i have to accept they ' re just sci  fi films for kids . i think they have some really great core concepts to work with , but then the actual stories that are told in the setting get ruined by the issues above .
   (ID: 1b160a23109a802786ef06d0b2abff0841f4eb37)

2. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

3. here again people being so racist on the others , i ' m singaporean and those words really piss me off , do you think your nation is the best ? your people is better than indonesians ? who do u think you are ? that ' s not even a joke nor sarcasm , that kind of words are pure racist just in case you dont own the knowledge . better get off from this sub , your existence doesn ' t even matter here
   (ID: e4e6a770eda3d8a5505365978baee4568affe531)

4. i don ' t think others are wrong , per se , mine just works for me . the whole " faith " thing .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

5. that ' s just statistics at work . if you have ever even glanced at the numbers to see how many planets are around how many stars around how many galaxies then the idea of any single phenomenon occurring once and only once becomes so unlikely it ' s borderline insane not to think there is life out there .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

6. maybe it ' s just because i have a bad sense of smell due to allergies and other stuff , but from experience i think the tournament smelle memes are a lot more joke than truth . any group of human beings being together for several hours will have a smell . but it isn ' t that bad or anything . i think how bad it is at tournaments is quite overblown . then again i don ' t think gyms smell that bad either . it ' s just not something that bothers me i guess .
   (ID: 7cf18036f93dc6fc68e7a501c52e0ff5501b36e5)

7. i think so but just my opinion .
   (ID: 3e906e06d59fb5c2993270f0b4efed5b9ab122f7)

8. it ' s sad that because of my name everyone thinks that i ' m just a stupid person that is going to argue that communism is the greatest ideology in the world . but if you think that it ' s okay people have their own opinions . it ' s funny how you think that i didn ' t read the question but it ' s fine i guess . you can call me commie and tell me to fuck off if you wish . if that makes your day better
   (ID: be642743472cdef9445edc6dd55beb3c2a8a1258)

9. while you are correct that i lack empathy , i am not a  nice guy  at all . just courteous . i don  t understand people who aren  t . and aren  t you a dude ? didn  t you just ask me if i smile at dudes in public too ? i give basically anyone who makes eye contact with me a quick smile . if they don  t return it , fine . if they actively attempt to be nasty back , i think they have some kind of problem . regardless of gender .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

10. as long as you don  t tell anyone about the crush whatsoever , i  d say it  s not cheating . and i also don  t think you should have to completely cut off contact with the other person . you liked them for a reason so just stay good friends based on that friendship
   (ID: d53ad0bccb6d6f62bf1a4957708759d7b446498b)

11. yep ! i think we also see her mention it briefly in a season digit flashback to the red center just before she mentions the colonies and we see the picture of junes mom too .
   (ID: e387b7eddf8ab01e3dd767dc2f5ca52494fbe9b0)

12. to answer you directly . i think no . just get gifted the money and you do the paying of debt .
   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)

13. i think you ' re just bad at it , it ' s fun
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

14. if it makes you or them uncomfortable there ' s nothing wrong with it , but if it ' s more of a " i think it bugs them " you should just ask if it does then go from there .
   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

15. hmm . good point . my argument seemed to be a bit flawed . i guess it  s just down to the amount people use and nothing else . or is it . i guess imma have to come back to this topic at a later date and think about it a bit more
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

16. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

17. wow well look at you being all happy . how dare you ? you think the rest of us are gonna be as lucky as you with our crushes ? no need to rub it in , christ ! nah just kidding , congrats man
   (ID: 1cd062f77c729b2cea6d91996a2f94b1f5226415)

18. i see what you are saying . i don ' t think people should treat people badly at all . i always am in the middle of a lot of hate . some of my friends hate some other of my friends and it just gets really complicated . i don ' t think you are a bad person at all . i think you are one of the funniest , kind , most sincere pesron i have ever met ! just do what you find happy the most and you will succeed in life .
   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

19. you think a decade and a half of blacklisting , effectively destroying his ability to have a career and a prosperous life , is a just reactioon to what you classify as dumb mistakes ?
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

20. i think it  s pushing your luck not to get two fish . often they stop eating and just lie there and give up on life if they are all alone . my piggiest boy went on a hunger strike for a week when he was in his own for his friend had to go to the fishy vet tank .
