   (ID: 5603c8fcb517a4b5745afb8c3f46248974edebe3)

5. because you were obviously born here , have an excellent command of english and you ' re an aussie reddit user , so i ' d imagine reasonably well informed and educated and likely , left leaning . i ' m making assumptions here just as you make assumptions about these people and their situation . i ' m assuming you aren ' t working because you ' re picky about what you ' ll do to earn a dollar , consider yourself above physical labour and simply working hard , seeking opportunities where you can find them . or the most likely assumption is that you ' re just damn lazy .
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

6. your argument is therefore  " there is one candy in the shop . i have a penny . some guy comes along , and tells the shopkeeper he ' ll pay a dollar for that candy . shopkeeper sells it for a dollar . " so , i can complain about why should i not get candy just because some rich people decided it ' s worth a dollar ? that ' s called socialism . the real question then is , if the city is getting richer and more propserous , why are these poor people still poor ? something wrong with wealth distribution here .

   (ID: e09cddf2452184c83537d2d4e8a36f0ba7c3fae9)

10. you still need a police report to prove it ' s not a hit and run , or that you didn ' t smash someone to death with it in the middle of the night . if its a write off you normally just get a pay out . if you try to fix it you ' ll have to pay the deductible .
