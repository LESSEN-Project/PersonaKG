   (ID: 85ae0ed5db316dbe8f48f61c8bb40a68799195fc)

3. serious question from a tech person . why can ' t i uninstall edge  ie ? i like to make minimalist systems stripping software down to just what the programs need to run and recover which is why i enjoy windows which is often not done through a gui browser . why can ' t i throw it out .
   (ID: 03d15a94c7d0f2138a5e5c0cf7e503c341abbf78)

   (ID: 76442d997e7f64c10223aeac0f4ff8af70ff9dde)

5. i like leafy kinda , but some of the stuff he says just strait up makes me cringe . like in his apology video digit  was " thanks for the support . i mean i guess he couldn ' t have known but still . i swear in some of the videos he says " literally kill myself " way too much . and it ' s just too much cussing , i swear it ' s like i ' m listening to encyclopedia dramatica in a manifestation in a human sometimes .
   (ID: a73b0dda35d389b4f74e47db6574e0f71738b683)

6. sell me this pencil  like oh wow really letting me strut my stuff here . hey do you need to write something down ever ? well do i have just the thing for you ! a pencil with no context ? fuck you
   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

7. i failed to see an argument for why rancid is good . while people can like what they like , there is some objective measure to what is good and bad . simply put , rancid is just not special in any way . rubyrubyrubyrubysoho
   (ID: 5c9dd67e95ee5403b2bd9a6848c017674d46396b)

8. i don ' t really buy that , as she ' s racing to the next interview , where she does the same shit . seems more like she wants to keep rolling on to the end of the hour and get the day ' s work over with . or trying to squeeze way too much into one show . why not just take your time with one interview . like literally everyone else on cnn ?
   (ID: a3c37892d1eb5776c9a4299ce29fc6200c20dd34)

9. it was the subtle art of not giving a fuck that really opened my eyes and kind of organized the thoughts i was having . it brought me to a next level and helped me improve the quality of my life . all those other self help books or books with complicated theories about life may be interesting , but such heavy reads or just straight up bullshit is nothing for me . i feel like saongaf is a light read on this heavy life .
   (ID: 3ee5f4db2879b83a843467f289ac369565b8b3ae)

10. he will find his own way . my sister still has a relationship with them but i am nc with my parents . it  s weird sometimes . but that  s what works for her and this is what works for me , and that  s ok . just give him hugs , and be there for him , because we have to choose our family very carefully  we were given such crappy ones ! sounds like you both are on the same page . and don  t ever give your ssn to anyone who asks . god , so many horror stories of nparents stealing their children  s identities and ruining their lives ! aack ! protect yourself !
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

11. i feel like ever since digit took over everything halo has severely dropped in quality apparently that includes text on a box which would be so easy to spot and cheap to fix that they just really must not give a shit anymore
   (ID: 6b1a5069121a216d43b11b6d5c61b018eb668aaa)

12. i ' m a small child again , like digit or digit , i ' m just doing my shit playing in the back yard , then out of fucking nowhere three dinosaurs are resurrected . but not just any dinos , the three from fucking power rangers dino thunder . they start eating shit and obviously since i ' m a small child in this dream i ' m powerless to stop them , and children can ' t run very fast what the fuck am i going to do if one decides to eat me . and obviously power rangers aren ' t real so none of them every show up . so here i am trying to find some place to hide from these rampaging dinos when suddenly one spots me usually the pteranodon and the last fucking thing i see before i wake up is that fucker staring at me like a hungry bird .

   (ID: aa8abed66c32a0519ab922c1a606563d97de28fc)

14. seems like just a worse flame imp . something like a digit mana digit  digit would work better . i like the concept of discarding them getting the cards back and silence wouldn ' t feel as aweful if u had a digit  digit
   (ID: a5abb0fc49ef940b208bd33b46b6b669a13fc83f)

15. i can ' t remember anyone complaining when the fbi was taking down a whole lot of websites with al  qaeda shit on them , but now it ' s white supremacist stuff the yanks are all crying " muh free speech " like the world is going to end . guess they ' re just showing their true colours .
   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

16. you shouldn ' t you shouldn ' t hit anyone , but it ' s worse when you ' re obviously a lot stronger than them and it ' s not a fair fight . just like you shouldn ' t hit children as an adult .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

17. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

18. no ma  am you are not worthless and even if nobody notices you have a lot to offer . it feels like nothing can get better or that nothing will ever change but it can . just hold on . you just keep holding on and you can get through this .
   (ID: d28c94c02761dbceb7bd64e3288f28eeef3a75cf)

19. yes . exactly . seems like you ' re really just wanting to be a victim here . just go out with the girls .
   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

20. they give me a reality better than my own . i get to feel like i matter . or like i ' m a badass . or hell , just plain feeling relaxed . it ' s just something for you to look at like hey , life can suck , but at least i ' m a hero to hyrule .
