4. people didnt come from the soul stone . they reappeared from where they died . you see wakanda in the background of one portal and titan in another . t ' challa died right in front okoye so theres your answer . he obviously knew to come back to the point of time where he left . bucky ' s past is super  shady . brainwashed or not , cap is the symbol for america and the public wouldnt accept bucky for political reasons . look how retarded america is in reality with their politics . refer to point digit . they were never in the soul stone .
   (ID: 5fa74a7d6a70c6f2f8a149864f494ac72eefd3e4)

5. those " alternate life  dimension  reality " dreams always just feel like the " regular life " , but . enhanced . let ' s say everything smells and sounds more accurate , more intense . no unusual sounds or smells whatsoever . on another note , i can ' t recall what specifically happened in them , but i do remember they ' re some sort of " alternate dimensions " , where i made different choices or some things directly concerning me went a different way . e . g i ' m a drug dealer in some slums . when i wake up from them , i don ' t feel my body at all  i don ' t feel anything , i just see . i slowly open my eyes , and i ' m unable to recognize where i am , feeling like i ' ve been moved somewhere else , while it ' s just my regular , real  life bedroom . it takes me a good couple of minutes to realize i ' m conscious and awake in reality . what intrigues me the most about this is that maybe death is just a transition to another reality . i don ' t know . sorry for the poor grammar . it ' s pretty difficult to put this in words .

8. i have this problem too . my trans best friend and i refer to each other as " tr    ies " all the fucking time because we both understand that we ' re doing it to take the piss out of actual transphobes . but then i really have to try hard not to refer to other trans people like this . it ' s really bad lol basically , you ' ve just gotta surround yourself with people who aren ' t going to use that language . we automatically pick up and appropriate the language of those we surround ourselves with something something egotistic in  grouping .
   (ID: fe56409176d2a6089f323227d5b07061f851d63b)

12. these people should be taking some goddamn responsibility instead of trying to get outraged at the broadcaster for their lazy parenting . this right here is probably the one quote to rule them all . parents seem to shirk their responsibilities endlessly nowadays . it is not the job of the mass media or school teachers to bring up children . if a person is so uncultured that they have no damn idea what watership down contains , perhaps they should get morally outraged at the fact that they are clearly a fucking moron first . i do hope that channel digit just responds with " lol , no " and is done with it .

18. it depends , honestly . were the charges nolled because you did some type of ar  jail diversion program ? how far is your army recruiter from you ? if they ' re local just bring all your documents if you still have them . if not give them a call , and explain the situation . they ' ll probably tell you right off the bat . i don ' t have my regulations in front of me at the moment , plus i recruit for the national guard so we have our own regulations on top of the army ones .
