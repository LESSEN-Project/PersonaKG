1. how do you know that you are coming at me without facts
   (ID: 23df46bdba3eb265d08b02c9ec5f365cf45ae5fd)

2. " when you find someone you really like as a person , tell them that you hope it grows into a closer relationship . if they don ' t feel that way . all is not lost , platonic female friends are a good ally when you ' re in the dating scene . " i actually don ' t have very nice experience with this thing . once i confessed to a girl that i want a close relationship with her . she said she didn ' t want it . i then decided to continue platonic friendship with her . i was now looking after other girls . one of whom was showing some interests in me through her body language . i was now interacting with this new girl on regular basis . she was sending positive indicators to me . my platonic friend asked me about my interests in that girl . i told her that yes i ' m interested in this new girl . i was also thinking about getting some female perspective  thought my platonic friend would be good wing  girl . i confessed my feelings to new girl . she accepted . i was a happy dude . but my winggirl started telling me that my new girlfriend is not the ideal girl  that in her words " she sleeps around " . i said that i ' ll be careful . i was on a trip to family for a week . when i came back , my new gf was ignoring me . i felt something is wrong . i just didn ' t know what . i then went straight to her  asked her what is wrong ? she didn ' t answer me . i asked again . this time she said that she didn ' t know i was sleeping with my winggirl . i asked her about who is telling her such things . she said the name of my wing  girl . i was shocked to hear that . i don ' t know why she did it . if she didn ' t want a relationship with me , why was she ruining my relationships with others . i know i shouldn ' t use this blanket thing to stereotype everyone . but now i feel its far better to get rejected  move  on than choosing to remain friends .

3. i feel like you don  t really have a right to be angry at her in that regard since as you even said you cheated on her digit times due to bad friends so why would she not be concerned about you going out doing certain things ? in this case i think it  d be healthier to break up so that you can use the lessons you learned in a new relationship where there  s not so much trauma to undo . you  re a better man now , you won  t do the shitty things you did in this relationship again , but getting your gf to trust you completely again will be at best a monumental task , at worst impossible . if you don  t wanna go through with all that entails , then i  d really recommend breaking up .
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

4. i experience this even now . i think it ' s fine to think every now and then about your situation . it would be impossible to never think about it , but don ' t stay focused on it for a lengthy period , it ' s unhealthy . when i had a job in retail i caught the train home every night . friday and saturday nights were almost unbearable . watching groups of people your age socialize and have fun hurt bad because it would remind me how i ' ll never be able to experience it for myself . you can still find some people to hang around with , maybe from work or education . but i think we should agree that looking forward is the best thing to do

5. i feel your pain . i was told a week ago that my wife has wanted a divorce for over a year . it hurts like hell when one minute you think your life and relationship are going well then the next minute you find out your partner does not want you anymore . it no doubt crushes your world . and i know what you are thinking and feeling . everyone keeps telling you the same things , and they are the right things but you don  t want to hear . you believe that there has to be someway to stop this and correct , but we can  t . the heart loves , hurts , grows and loves again . we just can  t control it . so good luck with your situation , we both know our lives will get better in time . take care .

6. ok , so the post in question was  what evidence is there that male privilege exists ? i am in no way saying we should put out a bad product . but i am saying that none of you or i are biologists and really don ' t know how hard it is . regardless the fact that they didn ' t start until later is bad . how is that so hard to get . i ' m literally not bashing . why are you even defending it ? it ' s not your fault or anyone ' s here . is it that bad to get the word out ?
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

7. oh god you are fucking stupid i already answered that dumbass question before you answered it . also , quit projecting i  m in between rolls on a machine i operate so sometimes i have to hurry typing . but back to your stupid question , you  re just so sheltered it  s unfathomable for you to actually be in a situation where racism applies . you just wanna be like everyone else , huh , lil puss puss ? i got a question for you , how about you pm me your address  an adress where we can meet up so i can show you what it  s like to suffer real racism , bitch boi .

8. i  m arguing because you say stupid things and can  t accept the fact that your post is not fun , smart , or helpful . you argue like a child and need to learn that not everything you say matters . you don  t want to argue , don  t respond . your the one who posted a garbage post with moron comments . you get off reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

9. i don ' t know about the falling in love and all that . but if you ' re looking for advice take it from someone digit years older than you . forget about her . don ' t even think about it anymore . you ' re young as fuck and there ' s plenty of women out there . and don ' t fall in love .

10. ooh boy heres muh story freshmen year , i lived in a hick town for the last digit years and i was always sad , usually because the rednecks hated me and my two hick friends that did like me shared digit of the same interests , or it was because i  m somewhat of an idiot and say shit i  d regret all the time say dumb shit you  d see on 4chan , not edgy , but embarrassing enough sophomore year , we move to a much bigger , more diverse town and school with more classes and opportunities for me . i made a ton of friends , my grades were tip top , and i had an amazing significant other . also , i wouldn  t act as stupid anymore . junior year , parents decided to pack up and move me one thousand miles west to the devil  s armpit az . girlfriend and i mutually broke up , super sad all summer , alone and very warm . school year was pretty much the same . anyway , in the fall of that year i bought a ticket back to visit for the break , and i spent the next four days as happy as i can remember , i hung out with my friends , saw and said hi to teachers , and spent an entire night out with my lady friend we went out to see a movie and went to barnes and noble and other fun things but after that visit things went downhill fast . still super sad in az , i started arguing with my parents more often , lady friend stopped talking to me , for various reasons , and i couldn  t get my shit together . i ended the year with one c , knocking my gpa down and my chance to get a full ride to nau . i decided to pack up myself and move in with some friends back at my previous school for my senior year , and while it  s been fun , i  ve been kind of emotionless the entire time . i see great things happening all around me , but i can never quite grasp the moment . i think my lingering relationship with my parents has to do with part of it .

11. wow a trumper yeah if you voted for him your a racist moron weather hillary was a bad candidate is imaterial and if you think democratic socialism and socialism are the same thing just shows how out of touch with reality you are . hopefully one day you ' ll go back to school and try again
   (ID: 0def2b70456d7a000d0e2b3611ac80cd2990e21c)

12. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path

13. nta . you would be the ahole if you keep leading her in . just be honest with her . it will suck for a little bit , but she ' ll get over it
   (ID: 73c241755308e15ea272f3060f9c0a430c541f1a)

14. and by taking these other people into consideration you make a problem where no problem was . let them be what they want , not victims .
   (ID: 9425493e0ea7469367495f8e5947330e536cafa9)

15. fair point and i fully agree with you , but you " should  have hidden paxter redwyne ' s username , or seek him out in the forum and inform him that you have exposed his opinion here . because as it is he sounds like an ignorant and may not even know . he deserves a right to reply and clarify his opinion  correct his mistake .
   (ID: 67ef96fb30756c49a9ffdff2579058eb2a3c1398)

16. yes yes your right i ' m wrong . have a nice day .
   (ID: dceaf5128ce079240dc5048df74d704163edc3a5)

17. ahh , now you ' re playing stupid , huh ? way to show intellectual honesty . really . well done . thanks again for displaying what fucking liars you all are . way to show , again , that you have to lie through your teeth just to feel like you aren ' t a bunch of fucking rats . seriously . thank you .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

18. thank you for your comment , you  ve made a lot of sense to me . it  s like a switch gets flipped whenever i begin to think about doing something for me . study , art , meditation , even my last therapy session i struggled to keep myself present and awake . having been in therapy for a year now , my therapist has only recently begun talking about dealing with my cptsd so i  ve got a long way to go . hopefully i can begin unpacking my terrible coping mechanisms soon because they really are disabling in so many ways .
   (ID: 8b7590cb8502d6abd38b320b842aa7642186b6d8)

19. i guess i did make some assumptions . i apologise . thanks for explaining . like i said , everyone is entitled to an opinion . thanks for sharing yours
   (ID: bb403667518ffc82f0508e3aee8741ea63cec050)

20. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
