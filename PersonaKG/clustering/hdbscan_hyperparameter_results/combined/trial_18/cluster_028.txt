   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

3. okay , you ' re trolling . you got me . i give up .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

   (ID: 3fb1292a0bd26711d797fe1a61e6229794c21b68)

6. if they understand everything else i said , then they understand the last part too , they ' re just in denial .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

7. i add comments instead of editing , because i doubt people will re  read my comment . worried , maybe not , but you were the one who wouldn ' t take my word for it . sources dont usually help people that already have their minds made up .
   (ID: d8014467041b98317d9f1dec2b0dae4ff9405b91)

8. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

9. huh ? i did not say that . were you answering to a deleted comment ?
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

10. oh come on . we all know that  s not true
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

11. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

12. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

13. i mean hey , different people , different opinions . i ' m not taking that away from you . i don ' t wanna force my opinions and ideas down on people that do not show signs of wanting to .
