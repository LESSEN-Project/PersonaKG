1. seems like he has a lot of baggage going on . he ' s sexuality interested in other people and is likely cheating , or going to cheat outside of the rules . if you have rules like you do , you shouldn ' t be together . it ' s gonna get ugly if you stay .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

2. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .
   (ID: 8285a776fd60b145ed2afc145cdf2b926b93ed8b)

3. most people have some form of guilt built up especially if it ' s a recent occurrence . if you raised the concerns and genuinely wanted to unfold the truth and try to fix things i can ' t see a reason he would continue the affair .   x200b  if you ' re that concerned once you ' re together , get him in a quiet space where you both have timesomething like a car and ask if you can take a look at his phone . straight up , no gimmicks , just say " may i go through your phone to make sure we ' re both on the same page . you should be able to tell right away if he has something to hide .   x200b  however , be careful because this could stir something up that wasn ' t there in the first place . this brings us back to the main point , that being straight forward is always better than snooping . no questions asked if i was dating a girl and she snooped through any of my personal effects the relationship would be done .
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

4. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

5. if that was my sister i would do the good old " listen here you little shit . " talk . i broke many people ' s bubbles this way . i would tell her off , break everything into her face about how embarassing she actually is . you do everything she says and ignore her tantrums , try to not accidentally push her buttons etc and expect change . it ' s not happening and you ' re giving her more control over you . iron fist for people like your sister !
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

6. some things are just completely out of your controll . people get married , have kids , join the military or whatever . ive always said i would rather have one or two really good friends than a whole lot of acquaintances
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

7. hey there , i know you have gotten some good advice and i know you have gotten some sketchy advice . im about to give you middle of the road advice . lol . i dont think you need to have some long drawn out serious " come to jesus " talk with your boyfriend . a simple statement like you made should suffice . if you say no more sex without a condom that should be fine . you dont even have to be mean or demanding about it , just make the statement , as i think you already have and then just make sure that the penis never touches the vagina without a condom . you can put it on for him , you can have one ready or close by , or just ask him to put one on . i think if you make too big of a deal about it that it will kinda of put the blame on him and it is digit  his fault but its digit  your fault too . not that i am trying to make you feel bad , that kind of stuff happens sometimes . if for whatever reason he doesn ' t want to play along then a more serious talk is required , but i don ' t think the first conversation about it needs to be too over the top . i know as a male that if i were told no more sex without a condom , i could take that at face value and move on without a big long discussion about it . i ' m hoping your bf is the same way .

8. you gotta get out , this is the tip of the iceburg . if you want a red flag this is a huge one . as a matter of self preservation you get the hell out . been there it does not get better with time . don ' t be a schmuck

9. man no one is being helpful in this thread . sorry mate . not everyone is mean just find out if she ' s trying to keel the kid and you may lose things in the process but you gotta figure a plan out my best wishes to you . i wish i was in your situation because a three way sounds dank af rn . best case scenario , you have three people raising that kid , two ladies and you . thats a win in my book
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

10. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .

11. i mean you could just ask if he wants to hang out just the two of you , and if je suggests more friends to bring take it as a hint he doesn ' t like you like that .

12. i had a similar face with lsd , where i just wanted to trip at every occasion . because i never had a single bad experience , only beneficial ones . thsi phase ended after digit or digit months , my mind needed a break and i didn ' t want to trip even when there was a great opportunity . for me the craving for acid feelt different than to any other drug , it wasn ' t like wanting to recreationaly better my mood like with any other drug . it feelt more like having discovered something new , where you can ' t wait for your next time doing it . it feelt like when i got a new video game for christmas as a kid and after an hour , when my parents made me go to bed , i couldn ' t wait to explore it more the next day . but after some time this always stoped , only to be rediscovered years later . the same feeling was attached to lsd after my first spiritual experience . and the same way it got more and more unexciting until i stopped using for a year or so . and this wasn ' t hard to do , it just felt right to stop now . when the spirit of adventure came back i started tripping again . even if lsd helped me a lot to learn about myself like nothing else could even come close . thinking about my usage in honesty is only possible during times of abstinence . your post sounded similar to my concern at times of frequent use and your concerns are important and nothing you should be avoiding , especially when using strong psychedelics . i could understand my frequent lsd use after it ' s ending and also be ok with having those phases because i never feelt my frequent use was damaging . i would even say such phases are welcomed by myself , when they feel right again . do not rely on what i wrote . this surely isn ' t the only reason for somebody using lsd so often . if you think your desire exists because lsd lets you be happy when you feel depressed , confident when you are shy or just lets you be the person you want to be , but aren ' t capable of otherweise . thats how damaging and addictive behaviors start . lsd may not be addictive in the ways other drugs are , but it surely will make you dependent , if used to escape your sober self . i can ' t tell you what ' s best for you , just go with what feels right for you . just be sure to honestly think about your consumption . when you understand your behavior better , it comes easier to stop or continue . since lsd does not have a physically addictive side , the reason for an addiction arises from your mind . stopping or continuing depends on the reason why you are consuming in the first place . but if you are in doubt , its better to take a break . you probably wouldn ' t have asked here if there isn ' t something worrying you about your usage . i can only tell you that i personally say that frequent lsd use , is one of the least damaging drugs , if not pushed beyond what feels good . just take some time to really organize your thoughts , minds and goals . be honest , follow what feels right for you . lsd is exhausting for your mind , some time to think may offer you what you hadn ' t capacity and time to find out during the time of constant tripping .

13. hum , talk to him and tell him how you feel , your fears , what you want and what you expect of the future with him , that you live him if you do . and ask him if he ' s willing to be there and take the compromise with you to make it work . depending on the answer just do what it ' s best for you and the baby . it ' s better to leave on time than stay and get more hurt . good luck !

14. i don ' t really feel like he holds me back , but my life isn ' t the way i want it to be living with him . i ' m gonna say the same shit everyone else says , i do love him and i enjoy being with him . but lately it doesn ' t feel the same . he ' s a good person but i feel like i don ' t really like him anymore . maybe it ' s my mindset but i feel like we don ' t have fun or enjoy each other ' s company . but if i leave i know i ' ll miss him and be sad . i ' m not going to go jump on another guys dick .

15. ask something like ' so i heard you ' ve wanted to know whether i ' m single ? well i am , so what ' s your next move ? '

16. yes she is very close to her stepmother . you asked about our relationship , we have been in a de facto relationship for about digit . digit years now . i have been doing what i can to comfort her and be there for her . i took her out to lunch today i actually wrote this post on the drive home to take her mind off of things and get out of the house . at the moment she is ok then bursts into tears at random times so all i can do is hug her , tell her i love her and let her cry it out . when she was told she cried and then asked to be left alone for a while so if she needs some space i think she will tell me . thank you for the advice , there is a lot there to take in so i will have to read it a few times . her stepmother still might pull through and beat it , but all we can do at this stage is hope for the best . thank you again for helping me understand and giving me pointers on how to approach this .

17. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

18. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

19. why are so many people telling this guy to get a lawyer ? no lawyer needed . just don ' t do it ! it ' s illegal as hell . also , stop paying for your brothers car . tell him it ' s transferred into your name or you stop making payments . also , also  move out ! i have to be brutally honest , your mom sounds shady as fuck . you don ' t want to be around when it all comes crashing down on her . stay at a friends place or rent a cheap room . just get out of there !
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

20. how do you deal with people like that ? i struggle with people already but when it ' s someone either not listening or think they know better i end up snapping at them
