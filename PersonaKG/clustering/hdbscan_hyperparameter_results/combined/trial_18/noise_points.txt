   (ID: f2ddf323cbf1466909e7e09f048b5e781f523d4a)

2. but how would you know they are a monster ? because you are told ? or because you understand what act has been commented and how that act affects the others around you ?

   (ID: a911ed792d3b26b115aedaee6218a4a944c38521)

4. tbh that ' s probably your friend being low on energy and overwhelmed by trying to reply in a genuine way to all those messages . i honestly don ' t see the point on commenting on it at all instead prehaps try regulating the amount of messages you send at once , and if you feel you are being ignored don ' t send more right away to test the theory , because it won ' t help . just wait till she feels like replying . not everything is personal . as for me , if i get a lot of messages i tend to do exactly this , i try to reply to as many as possible but in general it feels non genuine to me to reply to all of them when the other person texted them a while ago . hence i tend to reply mostly to the things i perceive as important or at least are most interesting to me . if i get frustrated i know it ' s nothing to do with the other person but only the way i prefer interacting with people . i never actually get mad at someone for doing this . unless it ' s excessive .

   (ID: 34de9309a5c02867b676757fa019c58a66bad300)

17. it ' s kind of difficult to judge , because some people are not comfortable expressing emotions verbally . but if you guys were having the talk , and you directly confronted him , and his response was that he " doesn ' t know how he feels , " then my bet would be that he is not in love , and just having a good time . if you ' re ok with that , then there ' s no problem . but if you ' re looking for a future and marriage etc , you very well might be wasting your time . another talk might be in order . figure out what it is exactly that you expect from the relationship . what your goals are , where you want to end up . in the end , if you want two different things , it might be a good idea to part ways before you get any more attached . best of luck op .
