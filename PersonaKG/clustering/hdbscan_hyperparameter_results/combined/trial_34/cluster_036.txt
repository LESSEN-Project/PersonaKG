2. sure do . and then you also risk having someone see that you haven ' t touched that juicy last bite yet and assumes you must not want it . they might try to steal it from you . this causes table fights . but ofc i wouldn ' t be brining no spoon to a knife fight . especially if its my last bites i ' m fighting for smiling  face  with  horns

5. it seems rather unlikely that a full  scale war will happen . no one knows for sure of course , but north korea ' s ultimate goal is state survival beyond anything else . the us will respond to any attack with the destruction of the regime , which is something they don ' t want to deal with . the concern is that if the us strikes thousands will die , and we will be left with a major refugee crisis .

7. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .
