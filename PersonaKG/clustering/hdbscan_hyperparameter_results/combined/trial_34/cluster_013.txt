   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

6. when you are ready then talk to him about it or seek a professional counselor . it seems to me that you are not open with talking about these  obsessions  and that can start to impact your relationship or life because your not willing to open up . it  s just going to eat you up inside . he may be patient , but is this healthy for the both of you ? . probably not . anyway , i hope everything will get better soon .

9. it was on reddit and someone said to some innocuous comment i wrote ,  i hope you die .  i could not see anything offensive or rude or even that opinionated in my comment . so i didn  t care . if anything it helped me . that comment reminded me that i shouldn  t take anything online to heart . if i offended or upset someone i would not like that  and i would apologise but if someone just wants to be a rude little fucker it has no impact on me .

11. yeah . it added up . it ' s hard , and unfortunately will probably happen multiple times in the next decade or two . by all means i hope you can find the right one early on . just basing that off the " typical " run .

12. even if things go horribly worst case scenario it literally does not matter and wasn  t meant to be . anyone involved will forget about it quickly . if it goes well , it goes great ! and will only get easier . just trust yourself to get through it . also , i carry a small bag when i  m feeling anxious  nauseous so i can throw up in a clean manner in an emergency if i need to . i hope it goes well ! good on you for taking difficult steps , be proud !
