   (ID: f031a6829326f9097d63f90ad77c7cac6d8319bb)

2. you need to find the right shampoo that ' s important . i generally liked aussie . a lotta girls like dove . invest in conditioner . now i ' ll tell you a secret . there ' s a bottle of anti static spray . its blue bottle with a women in a skirt spraying the skirt . i always use that before i brush . but i ' ll warn you , who knows what ' s in it , it ' s most likely flammable but your brush will have next to zero resistance

   (ID: f7713e4cd0a5245097f9f45a1194222bda369b48)

4. see it ' s hard to describe , but he ' s not one who likes to get embarrassed because he gets super upset and angry . he totally lashes out , so i figured with an instance such as this , maybe wait for him to come to me ? or is that the same as like we ' ll basically never talk about it ?
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

   (ID: b29114e3d39ee1086f5eb2abbe6cbec33bc7749f)

6. but to act like by being born you ' re entitled to anything more than life is something i ' ll argue about all day . . unless you ' re rich .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

7. anywhere . i don  t like being touched at all . i  ll do a hug if i  m close enough with you but unless you are dating me , do not touch me
   (ID: 4e784da799782c45d8883de53e87a533129a3b8e)

8. it ' ll be fultz . if we miss out on him , i also like jackson  dsj . some days i like dsj more than ball , but other days i prefer ball over dsj . i ' ll be happy with either of those guys though
   (ID: 52630a8de60c1fa7b1adc6ce63b9b05563b7b9f2)

9. i  m loving it but it  s not for everyone . d2 is really a game that you have to realize that if you get hooked you  ll be playing it until it either dies or d3 comes out . i  m having crazy amounts of fun on pc . my friends and i have created a clan and been running strikes and stuff like that . the entertainment is subjective but it  s much more fun with friends .

10. are you somewhere weed is not totally legal ? if so , i would say mailing joints would be an unnecessary risk . i suggest you give them to a stranger that looks like he smokes weed and maybe you ' ll make a new friend .

11. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .
