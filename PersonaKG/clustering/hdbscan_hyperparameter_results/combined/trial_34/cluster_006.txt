4. when you say to attend , you  re speaking with a bit of certainty that you  ll be getting into those programs . how confident do you feel on those chances ? even if the chances are low , i do believe it  s up to you and what you  re looking to do in the future . what do you really want . if academia is more important to you than becoming a clinician , declining an acceptance may not be the worst idea . but it is ultimately up to you and what you see for your future , and that is what will give you the most fulfillment later on in your life .

5. it ' s very simple , if i say i want to be a vegan because all i eat is fruits and veggies but like me i ' m also a bow hunter i will be denied entry . why ? because i ' ll be breaking a tenet of the cult .

6. no matter how bad you want to , i doubt you ' ll be wooshing anyone in this thread .

7. oh great , now we ' ll have to go through scanners and get groped if we want to go through a tunnel or cross a bridge .

8. oh geez , i totally forgot about it . id imagine it ' s still in the earth , considering it can ' t really leave . all the corrupted gems want to stay together , so that ' s that . hopefully , though , they ' ll all be cured in the movie . i loved being able to see all of the corrupted gems as how they should be .

9. look at the sun first . then look at the data of the other planets in the solar system . you may find that there might be something similar going on ? you may also want to look into nasa ' s current observations on sunspots and solar activity and the average temperatures since this sun cycle ended . either your suv is reaching and has changed the heat of pluto  or . well , maybe i ' ll let you be the observational scientist . meanwhile , all the climate projections have been wrong since mr . gore ' s power point presentation . why ? it deals mostly with carbon dioxide , not the sun   and not a single climate projection that i have reviewed has ever taken in account of the heat sync ability of the earth ' s oceans .

10. why would you want to drink rocket fuel ? once you try the rb  v you ' ll understand !  the first step to dealing with a problem is admitting you have a problem  jase robertson the jase roberton quote reminds me of another , though i am unsure originally uttered it " i have a serious drug problem , the problem is i don ' t have any " but jase had another good one with " you can see the true heart of a man when you ' re out in the woods with a weapon . dick chaney must have had a similar philosophy about ' getting into someone ' s head '

12. i play online vs exclusively . i ' m not saying this to piss you off , but i can poke check and stick lift all day long and hardly ever get a penalty . my poke checking could arguably be considered poke spamming i do it so much . it ' s all about proper positioning and timing for those poke checks , and never poke from behind . as far as stick lifts , they work very well during puck battles , especially along the boards . if your opponent gets possession , lift that shit right away you have to be fast and it ' ll almost always come loose and back to you . i ' m not saying it ' s perfect far from it , but if you ' re getting penalties on poke checks and stick lifts either your timing or positioning is off . go ahead and downvote me if you want , but i hardly ever get penalties for pokes and lifts . almost all my penalties are checks into the boards that ea will randomly call boarding or charging .

13. i was raised hindu and was always interested in religion so i have a lot to speak of ! another one is that hindus in india will often put a lime and chilli peppers on a string  pin outside of a home or business . this is because lakshmi goddess of wealth and prosperity has an older sister alakshmi goddess of the opposite of those . lakshmi likes to eat sweets  milk  fruits , so if you keep them inside she ' ll come in and you ' ll have good luck . alakshmi likes to eat sour and spicy food , so keeping the lime and chili out there will keep her satisfied outside without coming into your life .   x200b  in a related story , when a sage was asked who is more beautiful between lakshmi and alakshmi , he said that lakshmi is more beautiful when walking towards you because you want good luck to come into your life and alakshmi is more beautiful when walking away from you because you want bad luck to leave your life .

14. argue all you want hahahaha . that ' s the answer . they sign up thinking they ' ll " serve their country " , get used to hurt other humans instead , then get unhinged because of it . a great package of stupid from the veto  go , too cowardly to refuse to hurt others during , and weak minded afterwards .

15. for canadians i  m a conservative but compare to americans i  m probably a centrist . i describe myself as a proud member of the  here  s a fair percentage of my money , now fuck off  party . i  ll pay taxes for important shit like infrastructure , education , and health care but i don  t want my money going towards bullshit like art departments or foreign aid . i also don  t want the government deciding what i can or can  t say , or what i can and can  t do in the privacy of my own home so long is doesn  t hurt others physically . basically i  ll pay taxes , let me decide where they go , then fuck off .

16. i didn ' t want to make a full post about this but i see you a lot in comments . so i ' m doing my first dosage of 600mg i ' ll be doing 300mg and than waiting an hour and doing the next 300mg , i think ill be fine . my friend on the other hand is doing 800mg for the his first trip , should i try and get him away from that idea ?

17. esh leaning on nta provided you used protection . anyway you can send him a message and tell him whatever you want if you think it  ll make you feel better but i doubt it  ll have any affect on his behaviour what so ever .

18. yes , and i think it ' s generally an unhealthy identity thing to boot . not enough gamers take a step back and consider if a objective will really help them enjoy the game more . for example , right now i don ' t even begin to bother with the puzzle rooms on lua , because i don ' t want to play myst . i don ' t do plains because i ' m not keen on fishing simulator digit . if the occasion arises where i ' m in a mood to enjoy that sort of thing , i ' ll do it . ivara is another good example . i see complaints from people that spend hooooooours farming for her . my question is . why ? if you don ' t enjoy farming for her , do something else . eventually you ' ll get her , or you ' ll get stuff to sell to outright buy her . don ' t waste your precious time on crap you don ' t like .

19. i ran around like a crazy person on my honeymoon in new zealand and have no regrets about trying to see digit different places in digit days , but we had a campervan .   x200b  consider how frequently you can handle  want to pack and unpack and carry your luggage to a new location via public transit . using luggage shipping carriers is useful but they don ' t transport it for you in the same real time you ' ll need your stuff . what are your top priorities for this trip ? do you like crowds or nature or a mix ? will it be obon stuff is expensive , closed , and japanese people are all on vacation ?

20. sounds fake and generic , but if it is real , good on you man keep going and you ' ll get yo where you want to be eventually
