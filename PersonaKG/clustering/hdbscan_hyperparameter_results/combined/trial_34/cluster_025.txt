   (ID: 932561c7cc5f0c280d4b6b0c7824dbd5aed5f350)

6. its from mashiroiro symphony , i don ' t remember the exact quote , i don ' t care , but its something to the effect of  having pets is scary because you know they ' ll die before you , but when they do its important to remember the fun you had while they were alive not the pain of losing them .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

   (ID: c1c3bee034ba3e70e4bd22d7987533e43f2b424b)

9. certainly not a bad idea to let at least someone know where you are especially when you  re a female . if you do go missing , someone can call the cops as soon as they notice you  re gone and it  s much more likely that you  ll be found .
   (ID: a815d9b5c98aef3203b8f4f74528072fb989f0b1)

10. definitely , if you could let me know where to send it here or by commenting on the pic , i ' ll get it to you .
   (ID: 664b365f80ff1d51db95866fada8009f14d8e9b1)

11. the only way you ' ll really know is if you ask them . it could be because of doing work months food , it could be a green house , it could be a secret lab .
   (ID: 7632dd7ebcb664bfada5fff420a436f42e3721d5)

12. yeah i wasn  t going to tell anyone , but the ones who already know about it cause then we  ll never really find out
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

13. never heard of this before . do you know anyone that does that ? if so i  ll help you jump them .
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

14. do i drop everything and everyone i know to work with a major producer and make my dreams come true or stay and throw it all away knowing i  ll never get an easy opportunity again and be a dad my ex was about to have our kid at any moment
   (ID: 4e784da799782c45d8883de53e87a533129a3b8e)

15. depends on how random the words are that i ' ll forget . if they ' re ones i can learn again , i ' ll take it . if they ' re names and identities of people i know , no . also i ' m cracking up thinking of a scenario where a person tries to use this in an interview to one up the interviewer .
   (ID: 8a0d7d262d95d9c10d914ff3b70f342e066aee23)

16. mario kart . no one wants to play with you if they know they ' ll lose the whole time , so i throw to keep the game fun .
   (ID: 43a6fe9c16d7a48abeb6832518a650a445974a7e)

17. i don  t know if your neighbor could do anything about controlling outdoor cats . could you put up a chicken wire fence around the garden ? idk how big your garden but you could even frame up a chicken wire lid and door to really keep them out . it  ll take some work but that would also keep other animals out too .
   (ID: 59c651a5c06af5a1be40c3866fad09e7ac4c78f2)

18. so i saw earlier that your president caved . guess my read of the situation was correct . care to discuss the other foolish parts of your viewpoints or are you waiting for hannity to tell you what to say ? i ' ll wait . i know he doesn ' t come on till later .
   (ID: f15c79447707a6e701285e8c59cc3aa25d54daa6)

19. yes , you never know what we  ll find once we go looking .
   (ID: a6171234e1a4ec65a39ad55aa0aa058eb98dff83)

20. you would know better than i would about anything related to those serving in the vast majority of government so i  ll defer to your expertise . the skeptic in me comes out a bit sometimes . i appreciate the reassurance . i can absolutely get on board with your plans . it  ll never be perfect but we can certainly strive to improve . and you are right that regulations have certainly been beneficial to human kind in the past . personally , large scale public health risks probably need regulating but we  re getting into regulating the minutiae of the day to day life of the citizenry . and that  s where i have to draw the line .
