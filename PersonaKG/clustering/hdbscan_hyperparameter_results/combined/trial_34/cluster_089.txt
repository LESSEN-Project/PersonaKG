3. this whole article is about one thing . censorship . there is also footage of the same maga hat kids harassing girls before to confrontation but let ' s just ignore that for now . this article doesn ' t care about any of that . they are just looking for a way to justify shutting up any opposing voice . the have picked up on a recent event and put a spotlight on it and are saying " look look ! the lefts are actively deceiving us ! " take away their internets !

   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

17. you ' re gonna get camped one every dozen , dozen and a half or so games during the start of the season , it ' s just people hungry for their old rank . it is a trade off because if he literally facecamps you and you do the right thing draw it out as long as possible then the rest of the team will basically secure a victory in the meantime , but that ' s not a huge relief for the guy getting facecamped . just incentive to learn how to evade better ! as for the rank reset , it happens every month so this isn ' t exactly the moon and sun aligning to screw you personally over . there ' s just a couple days of weird ranking while stuff gets figured out , not a big deal . it ' s gonna happen again in october and november and december and so on so it ' s not really worth complaining about
   (ID: 8df56ee782672f11aeb0f19bf7978b1b1c04e678)

18. let ' s be real tho , how many times is a centurion gonna charge his heavy from neutral ? if we ' re talking about casuals , then yeah that probably works , but if we are talking high level duels then most often than not the centurion starts with a kick or a feint . btw i ' m not talking about just dodging the kick , almost the whole cast gets some sort of guard break or cc after dodging one but kensei doesn ' t , he just dodges because the recovery is so slow to do anything .
   (ID: fc02053133b0aa8d444b95ed56c24999ae82879b)
