   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

3. that  s too bad . once you find someone who you think is perfect except one thing and they don  t feel the same way or they take an endearing quality like memeing and throw it away it must be rough .
   (ID: f270f54ee5a501d23ceae23084513e682d0cfd32)

   (ID: d02dbb1cf70aa95df2b9f1bbd0a0c5bf0a966933)

8. artists do far more than criticize community norms . if anything , they emphasize the feelings that people share in those communities . the better question is , and the one i think you ' re trying to ask , is  is there a place  allocation of resources for dissent ? absolutely , it ' s democratic . artists see the world in a different way and i value that viewpoint . national endowment at the community level . i would fund that so hard . i ' d like to think that a majority of people would feel that way .
   (ID: 4751dd6f6e1bc0e55d1193f8d9e0a104d87e9e98)

10. i ' m not a doctor but i believe opium is in its own category of opiates . i don ' t think it ' s considered a depressant except in higher doses . kind of like alcohol . in addition , opium then is not nearly as refined as say heroin . maybe there were other items being smoked . from personal experience i had back surgery like digit years ago . if i took one opiate painkiller i was pain free , calm and chatty . more would make me tired .

   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

   (ID: 080eedcfaabe8f67b2c0a8da33a3a401906822f2)

19. true , but to me , i think it seems like a question they should be answering rather than asking . that ' s why i ask several questions about working conditions and technologies used , etc .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

20. disliked infers general distaste . there is almost always a few diamonds in the rough . i think i can say i persally dislike a genre that has like digit artists total that had the poetic real life stuff . there is nothing real in rap or hip hop these days . hell nothings real in any music . it ' s all pre recorded , written by old white guys and remastered to hell and back . or conversely shouted drunken stoned out ramblings of people with more fame then brains .
