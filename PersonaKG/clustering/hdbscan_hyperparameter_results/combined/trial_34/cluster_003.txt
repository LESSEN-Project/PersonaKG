1. that was my first thought too , but as long as you clean it and get it prepared like you do wool it ' s actually not bad . i ' m not exactly sure how it ' d work since dog hair is a lot different from a sheep  alpaca  llama . i ' d need the final project before i could truly judge it gross or not .

2. mortality . i thought of mortality as a distant subject which happened to only others when i was younger . i was a naive kid for sure . lately i ' ve been surrounded by loss and it ' s readjusted my attitude to some things .

5. lmao how pretentious are you ? you write like a child found a thesaurus and thought it would make him cool . i understand the historical context . slavery wasn  t ok , slavery doesn  t justify genocide . white people were awful  brutalized slaves , doesn  t mean you should go and murder everyone with a drop of european blood . but sure , go ahead pretending you  re smarter than everyone else  justifying genocide , bud .
