12. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .

   (ID: 8712de543372bc5f398d43ea5b918c85efc5dda7)

19. i had a friend . my best friend . i accepted who he was , whenever he has a girlfriend he begins to be on a high horse and judge everyone . he wasn ' t the greatest . college dropout , dead end job , but our clique of friends still loved him . then he started to have girlfriends and began to judge people for what they do . he judged my friend with benefit and so on . eventually he had his third girlfriend and essentially stopped picking up all our calls and invites to boardgame night and beer night . something we been doing for digit years , all cause a girl thought it was lame to have boardgames . eventually we started to do other stuff like go out and take trips . we never spoke to him ever again and from what i heard , he has two jobs just to support his gf ' s party habits . oh well . i cared . once .

20. seeing a lot of negative comments saying get help . guys , this is a game where you time and time again , without thought , shotgun blast mofos across the room . op was just descriptive and obviously has a unique play style . at some point we have all saved , committed crimes against humanity , then reloaded . to the op , optionally you can attempt to be a pickpocket expert and just take the gun maybe never actually have seen his inventory in that quest .
