10. getting offended and correcting others everytime from your horse doesn ' t make you superior over others . i know he did something wrong and hasn ' t repeated that since but the media should understand that they can do something better by raising awareness on what ' s happening around the world rather than attacking a man over petty issues
   (ID: 43361d3d352286328dcb058ec017ca0e2d364601)

   (ID: 1ebb4643f7e1e4d41ee2503d9b5d94ed0224c96b)

17. i did some research and i found a couple technical service bulletins on the spark plug wires being faulty . these bulletins are specifically for the original wires . however since your car is over 300k miles , id assume they arent stock . ill keep looking for more and let you know if i find anything

18. you know what you did .

19. if an intruder did it , they have to be about the dumbest criminal in the world . now , i ' m not a criminal but if i was and planned to kidnap a child from an occupied dwelling , i wouldn ' t be hanging around to write a long ransom note . i ' d bring a prewritten one with me so i could be in and out as fast as possible . secondly , if something did go wrong and my victim was injured or dead , i ' d take them with me anyway . the family isn ' t going to know that the child isn ' t alive or conscious anymore . i ' d take the kid , leave the note , get the ransom and dump the body . leaving the body behind means no payout . leaving the body behind and molesting it is even stupider . why run the risk of leaving dna or other evidence ? i can ' t think of a single reason for an intruder to leave jb and a ransom note that they had to know would be utterly useless since they ' d left their leverage behind .
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)
