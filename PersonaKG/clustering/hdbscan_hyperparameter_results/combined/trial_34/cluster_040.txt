1. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?

2. but he ' s an addict and i believe he was molested by his mother as a kid . he has done some nice things for his kid . he always apologizes or at least does something to get on their goodside . and honestly i think he did the right thing by telling fiona that sean still used .
   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

3. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .
   (ID: 535c3113ba487b9152c4b0adbe8c36822bc45ca4)

8. i ' m in the same boat as you , friend . i ' m working on getting a degree in a conservative field but i really wanted to stretch my ears . so i did . mine are down to a 2g but they will still shrink back to piercing size . i ' d say the lowest you could go without irreversability is 0g but each ear is different .  i don ' t think irreversability is a word

9. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .

10. dude you are my savior thank you soo much . last two questions and i think we ' re done . where is hide ? last i saw he was working for the ccg as a news boy or something ? also why did furuta kill ghouls and ccg operatives ? is that why people think he ' s a spy ?
   (ID: 1cd062f77c729b2cea6d91996a2f94b1f5226415)

11. wouldn ' t everyone be a little bit suspicious , do you think that some people might assume you did something and go after you or at least heavily question you ?
   (ID: 1476398f6c778fb461539e3f78b07720d4ceee83)

13. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

15. ok so how did those people kill them if they did not use a gun ? nobody ever tells me that part . i dont really care how because i kinda think dying by anothers hand is the issue . so to balance yourself before your audience could you please include the overall death rates ? its a sanity thing for me at this point . thanks .
