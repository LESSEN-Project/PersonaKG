--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 29

1. i ' ve always find that if you maintain eye contact and say their name during the conversation reaffirms to them that you respect and appreciate them . also , sometimes it ' s nice to just give them a hug once in a while and maybe throw in a hand job to make them feel relaxed . little things .
   (ID: 39ba9a65a55c27b50eef7c5cecbc66cc866c4a4c)

2. i gotta be honest , i ' ve spent way too much time on this on the past and mentally still assumed it ' s digit in digit odds . somehow i always just overlook the assumption that the host will always open a door with a goat behind . guess just my own fault for overlooking that detail
   (ID: 1cf567904675ac1ca7b5a90612e5479a5b6c9bef)

3. i ' ve seen lots of cover  ups , but this video is new to me ! i do intend on getting a sleeve someday when i have the money to do so . some of these people incorporate the scar as part of the art , but i would rather just totally obscure that there ' s even tattoos there . i have keloids on my leg though , which are harder to cover . still thinking about what to do with those
   (ID: 43a6fe9c16d7a48abeb6832518a650a445974a7e)

4. what i ' ve always heard isn ' t that the digit , digit is a literal number of beta access or vip access . it was equivalent in the time the book was written to saying a zillion . just with extra meaning . digit tribes of israel , squared , times digit so a lot .
   (ID: aac80ac9ebef70ab8fe6bc14a8fcccb472099b84)

5. here ' s another sv650 fan jumping in . bought my first sv650s after digit years of riding . best bike i ever owned in the " what a hoot to ride " category . i ' ve since had two more and an sv1000 which , while far more capable in most respects , just doesn ' t have the same just plain fun to ride character .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

6. i ' ve heard it helps to start cleaning up something small , and then grow from that . even if it ' s just putting a fork into a drawer , it ' s important to start somewhere .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

7. thats what i ' ve been trying to tell people , except the op part . i mean 1shot kill within digit meter ? well i gladly take that in exchange for bipod ads and slow . also , all this time sniper can just digit shot you because of attrition lol .
   (ID: cd4ad4cc67fcfb39fcb1f11e52709d863f1c0215)

8. literally just aaaaaaaaa road so that you  d have to scream it every time . you  ve also gotta pronounce all digit a  s  so next head down main st . and take a left on to aaaaaaaaa road
   (ID: 6710bef520e10a3963d2983d4b36ef411e442f22)

9. i grew up on a pig farm . my chores when i was digit were harder work than any job that i  ve ever had as an adult . pig farms are highly sustainable because they can eat just about anything , including communists . if the shit were to hit the fan , that  s exactly what i  d feed them . this guy !
   (ID: afb309c0f8d875957ab1e2c406a762b6127668b6)

10. i  ve been engineering for years and it still happens every now and then . you just realize it faster . this is how you learn .
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

11. wow thanks for this review ! i  ve been dying to get my hands on this bag but am trying to be less impulsive as part of my new years resolution weary  face i just messaged her and am planning to put an order in . i saw you took a digit  digit point off for the g being wrong . what exactly is wrong with it if you don  t mind me asking ? i don  t see anything sticking as bad , but it  s probably just my inexperienced eyes that i  m missing something !
   (ID: 8d5aac58a9c3a7e883f9e90df39dc5ab7c36de53)

12. not that i ' ve ever heard , this is just bizarre . it could just be an excuse to leave faster , if they don ' t get along  he doesn ' t get along with your brother . sounds super weird .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

13. i ' ve never met a person in my life who looks down at circumcision babies can ' t speak or do anything besides drink and shit , it ' s the right of the parent to decide whether or not they should circumcise their kid . you just sound really stupid considering there ' s no problem in having or not having it the difference is immaculate .
   (ID: ab5524e568131ce7cb4db227daae4d0f489838e1)

14. always ask for a lawyer especially of you haven ' t done anything wrong . for example  cop  " where were you yesterday around 2pm ? you  " i was at walmart buying groceries " harmless right ? yea , until you find out there was a murder next door to walmart at digit  05pm and you ' ve just put yourself at the scene of a crime . congrats , by being cooperative , you ' ve just made yourself a suspect . and that ' s assuming the cop isn ' t just straight up lying to you in order to get you to say something incriminating .
   (ID: 8f7369c6ebb47df350fec663be46dfd8481ee2db)

15. if the only reason you can find for still doing something partners included is that you  ve been doing it so long why stop now ? just try to stop and move on . it  s most likely just holding you hostage with your on sentimental emotions .
   (ID: 411b23f3d2a1f254c1c92c17670bb02c191a1301)

16. ok so this is the first year i  ve told my self no goals just go with the flow . every year i have high expectations of myself and end up disappointing myself , not this year . i  m not gonna take life so seriously and just see what happens .
   (ID: 5763816fca04febe03a678f8e19c39daaa876bd4)

17. most guys just go for it . if your super uneasy you can ask her first . i ' ve been asked before , it ' s not a total killer either . don ' t worry if it ' s not perfect !
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

18. you could ' ve just made it into multiple pannels , that would have made it easier to read
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

19. you  re right ! the movie would have been much better if they actually filled on location instead of just making it cgi . you  ve changed my opinion on this movie .
   (ID: a154763d4a1c7d2d412ab13eeed4849772817d9a)

20. i ' ve noticed a couple people pulling more dps but for the most part hasnt made a huge stink . i play a prot warrior and i was expecting alot of change due to the rage nerf but im just as tanky as ever . just made me change the way i play to be more patient .
