5. animal abuse , because if you think its ok to do it you will get murdered within digit week . note  i love animals
   (ID: 4beccb79954eaf4ba6b69b6ac31b148b48f4f579)

6. huh . i never romanced tali but i figured he would say it at some point , maybe you missed it ? i don ' t think shepard ever says it first though , i remember him answering " i love you too " to most of them , but not the other way around . i guess it ' s usually the love interests who confess their undying love and stuff , shep tends to show more with actions than words .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

7. i think what  s happening is now everyone knows about the show so the typical applicant might br madly in desire of their digit minutes rather than madly in love . collateral damage is what worries me . there are people who would do whatever necessary to get on tv etc , when the shows  s over , their spouse and new families might be over too .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

8. you are actually right but i think fumino doesn ' t fit that first girl image completely because most of the first girls usually harsh against mc and a bit annoying . fumino is pure and kind  hearted , not harsh to mc . it doesn ' t matter if mafuyu wins imo , i love both of them . thanks for your opinion .
