1. no . i meant the gap between the back of her ears and her head . i was just trying to think of the weirdest place you could stick your dick on a person .
   (ID: 7a396588993d687f5528f10b200dc9d6db769270)

   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

   (ID: b22d67acc81c3e3bf700f9a159ec06062eb72fd2)

4. they think that being different and being superior are the same thing . " i listen to music less well known than you therefore you ' re a pleb that just does what everyone else does "
   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

5. i see what you are saying . i don ' t think people should treat people badly at all . i always am in the middle of a lot of hate . some of my friends hate some other of my friends and it just gets really complicated . i don ' t think you are a bad person at all . i think you are one of the funniest , kind , most sincere pesron i have ever met ! just do what you find happy the most and you will succeed in life .
   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

6. that ' s just statistics at work . if you have ever even glanced at the numbers to see how many planets are around how many stars around how many galaxies then the idea of any single phenomenon occurring once and only once becomes so unlikely it ' s borderline insane not to think there is life out there .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

7. i ' m actually still just on the side of liking it , but it ' s getting tougher . gaping plot holes , uninteresting storylines , painful characters , terrible dialogue , such poor consistency of any in  universe tech that i have to call most of the sci  fi elements one big continuity error . and that ' s not limited to the newer films . just started watching the original trilogy after tlj , and think i have to accept they ' re just sci  fi films for kids . i think they have some really great core concepts to work with , but then the actual stories that are told in the setting get ruined by the issues above .
   (ID: 1b160a23109a802786ef06d0b2abff0841f4eb37)

8. the planet or just life on it ? i think it would be cool if we explored to other planets and earth became obsolete .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

9. don ' t think that ' s the case . this mentions nothing about an injury here , just the marine ' s takedown and then how he was restrained . the robber was put in handcuffs , with no mention of needing medical attention .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

10. you think you wanna lose weight because your mind is already tricking you , but you really just wanna get toned . please tell somebody in your real life , it  s already slipped from your control ! it pains me to see how young you are
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

11. you really think someone would do that ?               just             go             on             the             internet             and             tell             lies ?
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

12. she invited you to her house , showered while you were there and was willing to let you see her in just a towel ? i think you missed some signals , buddy .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

13. i think this is so amusing just because it doesn  t require physical exertion . actually having to do it isn  t entertaining whatsoever .
   (ID: 5b59b30ecdf3a93e4634d1600b3020fd8e9dc7e2)

14. why is everything here with centurion ? i dont have a problem i just think its weird out of all characters cent is used in all the posts
   (ID: db49a30ced23a0e386b799d5f970489f11a53f7a)

15. you think a decade and a half of blacklisting , effectively destroying his ability to have a career and a prosperous life , is a just reactioon to what you classify as dumb mistakes ?
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

16. just saying , i should have a featured flair . i think you remember can it be ai this time around please ?
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

17. i see what you mean , and it actually is a normal thing yeah . personally , it doesn ' t feel normal or nice to do things alone for me not just going to the movies so for me its a tiny small victory . andddd i think if more people will go alone to the movies , then more people will become less anxious about it . therefore i started a casual conversation about it , make it more   casual lol
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

18. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

19. i don ' t really think you can call it the type of thing that " just happens "
   (ID: 5218a6fd3b7d990775fbaa39249c20beea16f741)

20. the game is too big to die . with all those mods , you can even play just terraria for your entire life . maybe the hype might die and player base will be lower but i don  t think it will die .
