1. one of my pet peeves is that here in oregon the signs say " motorcycles use extreme caution " that they can craft a sign with four words that has two mistakes  okay , one definite mistake and one iffy word choice  just makes me want to bang my head against a wall .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

2. this post is too much for me . i can relate in this shit and want to post some original shit that i just created . these seals holds me back from taking over the world of memes .
   (ID: 6b8a83db666de3b1a44e69862b384efc9e8eaad7)

   (ID: 016485853897f1b9f422dd4da7d83e7e4a5261b0)

4. no , not just free stuff . you want to force the wealthy to work for free for you .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

5. i agree with the fact local news dominates the subreddit . i also thank you for saying my opinion is well  worded good and bad aside , i just want one of the few subreddits i frequent to stay good  by " good " , i mean engaging in material , conversation and people . i genuinely don ' t mind the one or two puns that show up , but when it gets out of hand ? that ' s a different story .
   (ID: 9d1e879011bb23fa9a0cff4c99a536feb2705b86)

6. but if you want to build up , that ' s fine . just send me your trainer code .
   (ID: 7542c8a6be5a118bef67d9539deb69c131fb4fbc)

7. why are so many people telling this guy to get a lawyer ? no lawyer needed . just don ' t do it ! it ' s illegal as hell . also , stop paying for your brothers car . tell him it ' s transferred into your name or you stop making payments . also , also  move out ! i have to be brutally honest , your mom sounds shady as fuck . you don ' t want to be around when it all comes crashing down on her . stay at a friends place or rent a cheap room . just get out of there !
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

8. well that just sounds lazy to me . is that the only reason people want illegals is so we don  t have to do the jobs nobody wants to do ? what job could be so terrible that somebody wouldn  t take it ?
   (ID: 89a759866debf6704efa0f603c1b9c4476abd731)

9. just quit . they don ' t own you , you can do whatever you want with your life . i can understand you may have a tough time with her personality , so just simply send an email or write a note and attach it to your timecard or whatever , and simply say you are giving your two weeks notice as you have been given an opportunity to do something new and exciting in your life . thank  you and good  bye !
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

11. " you can have whatever you want " , that means they ' re just buying friendship
   (ID: b29114e3d39ee1086f5eb2abbe6cbec33bc7749f)

12. yta , sorry to burst your bubble , but you can ' t make someone do anything to you . if she doesn ' t want to have sex , she doesn ' t . and making her give you a bj just fucked it up even more .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

13. we don  t want it but you are bringing it and we  re just getting ready
   (ID: a778c9b10000a3e15377e87997ef5bea46cfe33f)

14. digit , sick of life already , its so terrible , we work until we die and i just don  t want that .
   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

15. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

16. so you haven ' t actually told the guy you ' re not interested ? seems this guy doesnt get the hint and can ' t mind read , but he seems harmless from what you described . just some guy who was interested and you are not . just tell the dude you don ' t want anything to do with him . he ain ' t psychic . and your account is a couple days old , what ' s your alt account that you used to post on letsnotmeet ?
   (ID: dceaf5128ce079240dc5048df74d704163edc3a5)

17. my time with my three older brothers . with two of them on opposite sides of the country and one in college , i just want those good old days of consequence  free video game binges , lego city projects , and k ' nex machine building . now i just feel alone sometimes because i get the feeling they don ' t miss it all as much as i do .
   (ID: 37aa751f14bbf132fc2f76d2c2c79142318c3e31)

18. i guess you ' re right . the only issue is that when i get along with a guy have a lot in common , instant click , share similar goals  values  etc there comes a point where he tells me just doesn ' t want a relationship . after a month or so he ' s dating someone this has happened three times now , hence why i believe i ' m the reason
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

19. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

20. this question always surprises me . women want what men want according to personal preference . in other words  just don ' t be a dick . both genders , duh . no one cares about your stupidly expensive tricked out car , or if you ' re willing to wear a party dress in january . its dumb . just be people ! holy shit , i ' m frustrated now !
