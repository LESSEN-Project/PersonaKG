13. sign it up with superrewards and their network of advertisers so that even at 3am they ' ll get cold calls from numbers that are bogus or whose caller id appears as " not available . even better if the mark is already paranoid , they might think the man is keeping tabs on them .
   (ID: dc123ff47fa4f2e85bbecd444342fe7d8fcb7db5)

15. don  t try and spare his feelings now if you  ll probably destroy them later . do you think the relationship could end because of this ? or that you might get so attracted to another man you could cheat on him ? either of those would be worse than saying  hey , the baby talk weirds me out , could you stop ?

   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

18. are you suggesting euthanizing all the animals that belong to the unemployed ? what would happen in reality to those animals if the panhandler gave them up ? do you really think they ' ll be adopted by a rich and loving family ?
   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

19. i mean you could try to have a long distance relationship even if you think it won ' work . and if it does work out , you ' ll be happy that you tried it .
   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)
