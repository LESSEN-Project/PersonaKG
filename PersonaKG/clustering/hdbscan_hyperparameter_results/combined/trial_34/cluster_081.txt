   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

9. i was born with something called microtia type digit . if you search it up you will understand , it is not gross it just looks like a bunch of extra skin and bone
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

11. it just seems like if i bought a share right now , say for  digit , i could always get my money back and possibly even more if the stock rises . it just seems like i ' m missing something because i can ' t imagine what could cause disney to lose value any time soon .
   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

13. you shouldn ' t you shouldn ' t hit anyone , but it ' s worse when you ' re obviously a lot stronger than them and it ' s not a fair fight . just like you shouldn ' t hit children as an adult .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

17. well that ' s just peachy , you killed my variant on this that was going to be for creating convenient holes for boarding parties , you fiend .  d i really do like the idea of making a weapon that causes the universe to just go nope , and make a gigantinourmous explosion to fix the problem we just made . atoms really don ' t like being inside each other .
   (ID: 8360c6d04ba11da7a727532482d78505e52a4150)

18. honestly didn  t read the body just the tdlr cause you  re digit and you just need to do you for a bit . seriously young people are on here constantly asking so many questions like this but you just need to find yourself and not listen to strangers opinions on your choices in life . why not just try to meet new people and not worry about who is your  most compatible  . have some damn fun
   (ID: 238316960c030f561912bd63e9f572a4170f991b)

   (ID: 3a16ba639560d155caf77e9cfc21f6a1df031d4f)

20. i understand intersex . i get transgender . you wanna be the opposite of what you are . you identify with being the other sex . i ' m talking about people who claim they are neither . no , you were born with a vagina or a dick . you can ' t be neither just because you fucking feel like it .
