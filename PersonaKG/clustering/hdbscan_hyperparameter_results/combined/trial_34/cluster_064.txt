1. no such thing as too much technology . just gotta make sure to keep the ai in line .
   (ID: 7ebdc00c75f6f836557e13d39a9efb279ed2ef7a)

2. that makes sense . i have bought stuff for team fortress digit before , but they were weapons to be used in game . it ' s just hard for me to justify more than a  digit for an iphone game that you will get bored of in a few days . but i am sure there are many dedicated app gamers out there . someone has to get to the top of the leaderboards .
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

3. if only . i ' m still not sure whether to sell it , take someone else , or just see if i can get any kind of money back .
   (ID: b42bcbaed0ea1f011b4d8c42d4ad9df732ecc5d5)

4. every break has to be done where both parties can see each others faces , next time youre on skype or something where you see his face , show him he ment something to you and just rip the bandaid . never ever text im breaking up with you . that will destroy a person . also make sure hes fully aware of whats going on , and explain why youre breaking up with him
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

5. if you had to pilot a plane that locks up in any form of dive and randomly just gets pushed due to ping i ' m pretty sure your awnser would be different .
   (ID: 1160c0c34e8b0184126a6e35a5fa982003442bde)

6. are you sure you just weren ' t hoping it would ? i doubt it , but just in case .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

7. they were trying to get rid of child porn on their site , but doing a blind generic sweep of just nsfw content with a weak bot didn  t do them any good . porn bits are still around , countless nsfw blogs , and i  m sure there are still pedos lurking on that site . i heard if they had been deleted off tumblr that they migrated to twitter
   (ID: 44eba9a0cf089ec615a77db5d42a2c01b63cb259)

8. for some reason i pulled on the wrong side of my wrist and . life just became endless waiting for death i guess . i ' m not sure what wouldn ' t change .
   (ID: be642743472cdef9445edc6dd55beb3c2a8a1258)

9. ok , just scrolled to make sure . no mystogan ? at all ? come on guys . is he really that forgettable ?
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

10. i ' m not sure i see how that relates ? fat acceptance , in my understanding , is just accepting people for what they are and not judging them . there ' s no expectation at least no reasonable expectation that we should have to find fat women attractive . could you elaborate on what you mean ?
   (ID: f3f34b7b903c833de2625265da4585abdc86ab7c)

11. i was just thinking about this today ! i am a feminist through and through , went to a local resist rally stoked , even went with my boyfriend . it was not empowering nor have hopes to ignite feminism and create allies . speakers were talking about punching men in the face and laughing about it , about taking our rightful place above men . i was disgusted , sure self defense , take care of yourself , but breaking a guys nose because he disagrees does not look good for feminism nor does it inspire more men to be stronger allies . i don  t understand this reasoning , it doesn  t empower women , it shamed them .
   (ID: 46cf1fc2a9c8dec12fa16589117be75cf1571e1d)

12. well the highlight is definitely the game of chicken , if you end up filming it make sure it very fast paced to keep the tension building . overall the dialogue is good and realistic and helps build character . the twist worked for tone purposes but felt a little weird for logic he just owns a psychopathic dog ? overall i liked it and it has a lot of potential digit
   (ID: a62b69d15e6c81a1a1acb2d0dd4bf9119038ff09)

13. sure you can also just text the news number when everyone is all done ruining it
   (ID: 5b1553b6a517f6dfee19019582f0bb534a60ae0a)

14. i just realised i gotta do this in survival mode on a top of any of my minecraft houses . and probably using posters or something , but i ' m not sure .   .
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

15. for the international muppets it ' s 4am in italy . for an article and tweet from different sources to be taken down or edited right now is just weird . i mean i can see night editor having access to the article but the twitter as well ? do journos share their twitter access ? i wouldn ' t . i don ' t have twitter so not digit  sure how it works
   (ID: 5ea29f01c8cdade4f178fd446d00647edc5fc70e)

16. just hide the entire game collecting mats and maybe find a treasure chest then sit in a baller and wait for all the other players to kill eachother . if you get lucky , they might die in the storm . gliders are nice to stay above someone without the worry for dying from falling . an rpg from above would be good . make sure you are rotating into the new safe area quickly and get established there . tldr  just camp lol

17. after reading some of the comments ive come to realise people find some of the magic eyes difficult . i assumed you could either see them or you couldn ' t . although this image is quite shallow in depth it resolves itself just as easily as any other . not entirely sure what point i ' m trying to make only that it was an eye opener so to speak
   (ID: e982e025c0604997a6e2072eb87b9bb01bed38ae)

18. i ' m not sure how much it has to do with the time and how much it has to do with who your parents are . kids around me were doing plenty , i just had an overly controlling parental situation .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

19. hello troll i see you have been active tonight . just tank the cunt . i ' m sure every boss was the easiest boss for you . i would venture out to say witches are easiest for everyone . but it ' s more fun to just say it was easy for me and git gud . scrub
   (ID: d5ff87b3b0a008d93a655ee4d43e9da3b5db7984)

20. she ' s only snored while i was conscious at least every few months before , last few weeks have been rough . i just sleep on the couch if it becomes a big issue . that sounds rough i guess , but i actually sleep at least as well if not better on the couch than in bed . i made sure to talk to her about it and make sure she knew there were no hard feelings and it was just a practical matter . i never start out there , and make a point to spend time talking to her and the bump before she goes to sleep every night , we just agreed i can bail if i need to .
