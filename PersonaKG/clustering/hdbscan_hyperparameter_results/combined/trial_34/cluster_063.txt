   (ID: 229018d265fee53903659270acea70a8c7f46caa)

2. i didn ' t imply that , you inferred that very incorrectly i might add . all i said was they matter , and you twisted my statement around to make it something it ' s not . you really don ' t know how mental illness works , do you ? tell a suicidal person to just buck up and see what happens . most likely , it ' s not gonna do a damn thing for them .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

   (ID: 280643182527d573e119c7952a08fea10d62edd8)

5. tpms are horrible , especially in the cold . best bet is to look at the tires and if it doesn  t look flat , it  s not . it  s just a cash grab against people who don  t know how a normal tire looks
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

6. i often play hide  seek with my maturity . at times , i ' m the most mature person alive  other times i ' m the clown . do you know what is the funny thing ? i cannot control . it just happens .
   (ID: 5ec957438fa111872baaa0871df8459459cc2519)

7. i mean if it ' s installed properly it should be in there pretty well but if you pulled any out i would have it looked at just to be safe . you really don ' t know how well it was installed
   (ID: a3982a84363698446960e86a440ed3314f4325a3)

8. i don ' t know the first thing about getting fitted ,  you don ' t need to just do some investigating in your area to find a place and they will help you out . hopefully it will be in your price range .

9. if you ' re talking to a doctor about this then my input is completely invalid . of course go with your doctors advice and ignore the internet . always a good method . the reason why bitcoin is dangerous is that it is designed to be untraceable . in a technical sense it is not purely anonymous but it in a realistic sense it is entirely anonymous . you have no method at all of knowing who you are really sending money to . it is also irreversible . there is no way of demanding a refund if you do not know who you sent the money to . the technology of bitcoin does not include a " charge back " or refund feature like a credit card does . if you use paypal or a credit card , yes you can still get scammed , but you at least have a paper trail leading to whoever scammed you . also most credit cards and paypal have a dispute resolution mechanism so that if you do get scammed you at least have some method of recourse . the major reason why it ' s a red flag is that if someone only accepts bitcoin then it screams " this is not a legitimate business " because they are choosing to only engage in untraceable transaction . some people are just like this . so it ' s not an automatic " you are being scammed " , it ' s just a red flag . some people simply like bitcoin and maybe that ' s all this is . but it is suspicious . if you ' re only spending  digit then what the hell , right ? at least you get to learn how to use bitcoin . coinbase simplifies bitcoin for you . it is bitcoin " easy mode . you don ' t need to be aware of what the hell the blockchain is or even what a wallet is . you can conceptualize it as simply an online bank account but the currency is bitcoin .

12. is it weird that i have no idea what spotify is ? i mean i know it ' s a music thing but that ' s it . i don ' t know what it actually does . is it a social networking thing or do you just buy stuff from it ?
   (ID: 5147e830e7cfa538d6990a8699ad6462b57cfb52)

13. it was sarcasm , and the woman i was bantering with seemed to get that . i don  t know why you didn  t . as for  maybe read the news  , i know about all that and just because there are some people out there exploiting the me too movement doesn  t mean everyone  s lying . to imply differently is crass and misogynistic . we  re done here .
   (ID: 256407c5e6c8d9342d8aabf5c9c392fc179ba9f3)

14. just like this . you don  t know me , you don  t even know what my beliefs are . you just assume that i don  t have a happy , fulfilling , good life because i don  t believe the same as you . you are wrong . stop being so arrogant and pushy about your religion . i already know just about everything there is to know about your religion , and i don  t believe . let it go .
   (ID: 8583c2f8118c4b3f3d00c452df3ca410a605ac45)

15. just play the game and focus on those viewers who are chatting . the truth is , you will never know why people leave , they just do , for a wide variety of reasons . you will never retain digit  of the viewers who join your stream . focus on what you do well . watch your vods . improve on things you feel need improvement . growth will come .
