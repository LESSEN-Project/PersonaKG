4. you ' re an idiot who clearly hasn ' t lived in very many countries . welfare is not what builds the nice parts of town or the transport channels to get a coke into the hand of any person in earth . rich people do , for their own benefit and the benefit of those who work for them . just because a few assholes kill the farm and pocket a tax break instead of giving you personally a job on a micro level doesn ' t mean trickle down economics doesn ' t elevate everyone on a macro level . i repeat , go live somewhere not built by the rich if you disagree .

5. my mom once told me she didn ' t understand why god allowed me to live . little backstory . i was born nearly digit months premature . i technically died twice . the doctors told my parents not to get attached cause i wasn ' t going to make it . fast forward to the incident . my mom accused me of stealing her digital camera . she had just returned from a stay in maryland and couldn ' t find it . for hours she berated me and topped it off with the " god shouldn ' t have let you live " comment . the next day she found the camera in a box she had yet to unpack . she never told me she found it or apologized for her comment . she just pretended the entire situation never occurred . my dad apologized on her behalf .

6. digit  . hardly any difference , then just live off the interest and fuck off the rest of my life

7. it sucks . we have created a sick system where it is inappropriate to have personal relationships in places where we spend most of our time and are most likely to meet new people . you could just take a chance . worst case scenario is a scandal and you quit . best case scenario you live happy ever after .

8. it also has always been a dream of mine to study there and then maybe even live there . it ' s just a beautiful country

9. great show , excited to see where this goes in a month when we get by all the obvious games starcraft , cs , ext . do have one suggestion that might already be true but has to do with twitch . could you produce this show inside the " game " category and not the " gaming talk shows " category . since this talk show is digit  just about a the single game and not a of variety game talk show . if you do it inside the " game " i would guess you would get more people checking out the live stream . twitch might have rules against this but its my idea .

10. nta judging by the fact you could pay off all her debt , plus buy her a new car it was obviously a decently large sum , that i agree with you i would not just randomly hand out to a girlfriend of digit months that you do not live with or are engaged to . maybe you could of helped her a little if you really wanted to , but you have no obligation to give her that money , or justify how you spend your hard earned money .

11. i understand full well what the symbolism behind all that stuff is intended to mean , i just strongly disagree with it . it ' s not about false patriotism ? dude , what world do you live in ? i don ' t care what your reasoning is , having kids recite the pledge to a flag every morning is brainwashing . they ' re basically being forced into patriotism without being given a chance to decide tor themselves as to whether or not they even agree with it .

12. thanks for this post , it ' s very informative . i can ' t imagine having the fbi on my tail for just doing what i would consider normal . what a terrible life to live .

13. nta . this is what long term compatibility is about  being on the same page about how you live your lives . it  s clear that this is an area in which you may not be simpatico and if it  s one that is of high importance , it is not just okay but good to step back and evaluate any forward motion . if this is a dealbreaker for you , don  t settle . it likely won  t work out in the end , anyway .

14. dude , if you are serios , don ' t do it , there are plenty of reasons to live , even if you have difficulties . if not , then i will just leave an f

15. just curious , is there some sort of " vesting " in the canadian system , to prevent folks from moving to canada and getting benefits from others paying into the system ? for instance do you have to live there for a period before receiving benefits ? it may be something you need to consider .
