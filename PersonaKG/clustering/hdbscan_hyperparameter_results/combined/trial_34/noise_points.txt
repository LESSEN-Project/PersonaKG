   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

2. anything related to anime  waifus , it ' s fun to see what  who people dislike and what  who people will defend to the death . seriously though as a weeb i know how violent some can get online .
   (ID: 0ff3db030062a58f30958a7a7b74373cf4f7cbd6)

3. my gut reaction to this question is that reddit is for digit year olds .
   (ID: 6b04f3448a053338b902c242d1883da1e90dc7bb)

4. they are not quite playmates since they are pretty much ignoring each other . i am just happy i can have them in the same room and can spend more time with each of them . condescending karens are everywhere lol
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

5. with your husband ' s permission , you could start a blog and write about your experiences or just post here every monday and tell us about it . you could spend time researching ideas for next weekend . maybe learn to deep throat or other creative skills he might appreciate . shop for some sex toys . i like the blog idea , though .
   (ID: 0d77404b10744947bcd2c91d8c926021d4b8650f)

6. this is probably impractical , but i thought it might be cool if it was like the raid equivalent of ditto , since they both know transform . like you defeat a common raid boss like magikarp or something , and one out of every digit times it transforms into mew probably before the catch , so it ' s still a tough throw and you don ' t accidentally waste golden razz on a magikarp .
   (ID: fc70415de2435c629ec792dbd90c954786c0bd16)

7. plenty of the extra stuff is from tolkien ' s works , and is actually why i support the existence of at least a second movie . lord of the rings is actually digit novel , divided into digit books , often published in digit parts , and erroneously called a trilogy because the movie adaptations are . book digit  the shire   rivendell . book digit  rivendell   amon hen . book digit  aragorn , gimli , legolas , gandalf , merry , and pippin ' s parts of two towers . book digit  frodo and sam ' s parts . book digit  the first group ' s parts of return of the king . book digit  frodo and sam ' s parts and the denouement . i mention this , because i compared page counts . the copy of the hobbit i own is about digit pages , and the copy of lotr takes about digit pages for each book , but at a larger page size . back to the hobbit , it ' s comparable to any of book digit  digit of lotr , in that it follows the actions of one group . but , like two towers , there ' s a whole second side of the story you won ' t hear if you just read one of books digit and digit . so if you take gandalf ' s adventures with the white council into account , you already have material comparable to any of the lotr movies . except it ' s not quite that simple . sure , by a page count , the hobbit with gandalf and the white council is comparable to any volume of lotr . but they have different writing styles . if you ' ve read both works , you ' ve probably realized that the hobbit moves much more quickly . for instance , in the writing style of lotr , i could imagine their stay at rivendell taking multiple chapters . or especially with some of the events like anything happening in mirkwood or at erebor . so yes , a lot of the " extra " material is from tolkien ' s other works . it ' s just expounding on what was happening with gandalf while he kept disappearing , drawing from other sources where tolkien explained that . and , to me , it ' s enough to justify at least the second movie .
   (ID: aac80ac9ebef70ab8fe6bc14a8fcccb472099b84)

8. i do this as well . if you ask your vet about catch and release services you can find places that will loan you traps and fix the cats for free . i ' ve been feeding  fixing feral  stray cats for years . i hate seeing animals that have been abandoned go hungry .

9. One of my favorite things is christmas games.
   (ID: f296ca909e75f5e7a28f054f4937f3c6eccb6a56)

10. you say that but if there is one thing russia gets right it ' s science education , they don ' t fuck around when it comes to that , unlike nearly everything else in the country .
   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

11. it seems like a lot of the venomous stuff comes from the forums more than reddit probably because we can downvote the garbage away . i won ' t argue about things needing fixed in the game because i don ' t disagree and the frustrations make sense , i just know that a , " good job " from time to time is good for the community as well as the devs , remembering that we generally like each other .
   (ID: 05ea8ab3980e7e9b17e008954c8e6b0d7355612a)

12. not really , but if you don  t like your life change it . take a step and talk to someone my dude doesn  t hurt i was a shy dude but still had a lot of friends . i wouldn  t think of your teenage years wasted because you e spent time with yourself either you probably know more about yourself than a lot of others . stay strong home dog and go talk to someone about how you feel .
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

13. thanks for the calm response ! i was half expecting much worse ! i think that people quitting when they ' re about to get interrogated is bad , but i wouldn ' t exactly describe it as cheating . does that make sense ? if it was in my hands obviously not but just in theory i ' d probably give disconnecting on purpose from a match regardless manually not alt  f4 as that could cause issues with crashes a temp ban .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

14. One of my favorite things is bigger towns.
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

15. not going to lie your comment gave me the existential creeps a bit , and just to confirm , i definitely never thought i would be engulfed in fiery sun  lava ! but no , i don ' t think it would do anyone any good to call you or anyone else blasphemous etc . lol i think we ' ll have to agree to disagree about whether the effects of climate change exist or not , and whether or not it is fulfilling or not a prophecy , as you call it . and obviously it ' s good to see that you still think taking care of the planet is important even if you do not think it ' s important for the same reasons as i do !
   (ID: 91fce15f80cee843edc2c92559e78e027c94f5d0)

16. yeah , she was my neighbor . there ' s a whole movie about it .
   (ID: 95f6209d0c49920f0309625c4cec2ea88e4ae469)

17. digit   hardly noticeable , and i ' d be set for life .
   (ID: a31ab3f3ccb2d987e0948a7a8ed52f5d74b72960)

18. i think maybe he ' s referring to the fact that in the rpg rules , sponsored magic is something you choose whether or not to use , and you take debt every time you do . in the novels , pretty much all of harry ' s spells were enhanced with hellfire involuntarily the whole time lash was in his head .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

19. One of my favorite things is titty juice.
   (ID: 3510b342268f3bc4c3f1e402201d7c565dfb7648)

20. as someone who puts up walls like it  s my job and also someone who  s last relationship crumbled because of it , the best thing i can say is to try . also , be patient , it takes time and you have to let the person get comfortable with you
