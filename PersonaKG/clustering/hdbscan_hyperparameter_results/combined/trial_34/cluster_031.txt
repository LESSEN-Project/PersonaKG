1. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .

2. when i broke my smartphone ' s screen in a contest in our schoolin that point that half of the screen is black while the another half working perfectly fine . after i broke it , i ' m starting to get ready for myself to be scolded . few minutes later , i was called on the stage and awarded as the winner of the contest which i ' mso happy about i literally forgot that i did broke my smartphone ' s screen . then coming home without me still not remembering about what i did , my mom noticed that i was not using my phone , then i remembered that i just broke it i just said the truth about what happened to my smartphone and after that i said that i atleast won the contest while i ' m handling her my medal . then she hugged me and said congratulation and it ' s okay . the clutchiest and luckiest time of my life .

3. hahaha . i did this at work , simply tried to force a fart that wasn ' t a fart . ended up running home and yelling to my roommates " omg i literally just shat myself " . then i walk into my room and see my landlord showing some of my friends the house .
   (ID: 5d6cecafd26473d96b39b973965364f09d4d41f1)

4. makes sense . just funny how all ' s i did was make an observation which is most likely correct and instead of either acknowledging it , or moving on , they have to be so salty for some reason .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

5. my mom did some things that made me have really low self  esteem , and i can ' t just seem to fix it .
   (ID: 2f03a8d589defb9434044b9ef9bfffc676e2b49a)

6. lol what , did it take you the full digit hours to come up with that shit spray ? you couldn ' t be more wrong about everything you just slammed your ass on the keys to write out . what a waste of my time reading such garbage .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)

7. wow this must be one of the most arrogant things i ever read . so basically you are saying that grrm and d  d are not good enough story tellers plus us hard core fans are too stupid to pick up hints in the show unless you the leaker god start a discussion about them in order for us to be prepared for the bad writing and wouldn ' t get it without your help ? how many people did you just insult with this arrogant comment .
   (ID: 5ea29f01c8cdade4f178fd446d00647edc5fc70e)

8. what the hell happened to jeff ' s face ? did he get plastic surgery or is it just extra make up ?
   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

9. yeah . sorry about that one thing i did that one time at that place . it was a rough year for me too and . and . i just couldn ' t keep it together any more . you deserve way better than these pricks doing those things .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

10. but reincarnation is a supernatural occurrence that ' s only based in religion . the closest to what you are describing is jainism . it ' s still a religion though . i ' m just busting your chops though . all great fictional stories use selective liberties with facts . don ' t let my nitpicking screw with your story ideas . if all authors did that nothing would get written .
   (ID: 25ac51284c94eb6c58e189bbefc7f2bb9bb9e1b5)

11. " alex what the fuck are you doing " " did you just cum in your sister  " " tiffany is not on birth control " " lexi do you ever shut the fuck up " " they ' re just kids "
   (ID: db1ffea2a957f19bfc0fffdbd89a6d65be91fd5c)

12. i ' m really sorry if this actually did occur , but it ' s just too thathappened for me to believe this . this reminds me too much of the stuff deviantarters with mary  sues post about their characters . maybe it ' s the format . maybe it ' s the fact their dialogue is just so basic this it pretty farfetched
   (ID: 28e24cb71e2c0068fef35890d39022b686e4215d)

13. yeah but why tf did you decide to post this on here . i support the lgbtq community but jeez man , chill out and talk about that stuff someone else . it  s just a meme
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

14. i ' d imagine a vast majority of people attempting to get this skin did it in the first few days of it being released , and we saw zero proof of it being unboxed during a time where most superior packs or packs in general were probably being opened . i ' m less likely to believe it actually existed during that time than i am to believe that they simply waited less than a day before notifying players of an increase . as much as i hate to don a tinfoil hat , it ' s also possible that they purposely delayed the tweet just to make it seem like it was actually obtainable before . if anybody went as far as to take some sort of legal action against them for falsely advertising an item as a possible reward in a virtual lottery , delaying the tweet is one way for them to prove themselves innocent .

15. merch is not a fanbase , but again my point about the underlying story has to make some sense to you . also america is obsessed with junk media , not all but the majority pushes this fanbase towards fringe . i apologise to those who didn ' t get that . if you have ever looked at tik tok or whatever for more than digit minutes you are probably going to still be offended . also just being extra anal , those two stores do nothing but by merch for new games so i would be curious how well kh sells compared to something for scale . i ' m not doubting it did well , just curious .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

16. lol you are a joke .  she was the best i could looks  wise without paying for it , this is why my brain tricked me into thinking i loved the bitch . so you treat a woman like a commodity and are with her for her looks and then spew your bullshit hateful rhetoric when she does exactly what you did  or would do ? you  re telling me you wouldn  t have traded her up for a hotter piece of ass if you could ? the hypocrisy runs deep with you people . your though process is extremely flawed and pathetic but hey go your own way  women are so much better off without a little boy like you . you  re right life is unfair and unjust you  re just crying because you feel you aren  t good looking enough or rich enough to get what you feel entitled to . pathetic .
   (ID: b4052c69cfd7bf0df0101b2dcc97fc007ad28841)

17. this is enlightened . complaining is not the same as soliciting advice . so often a child ' s minor complaint about something gets a response telling them what they did wrong , just making the kid feel bad .
   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

18. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

19. what the hell did i just watch ?
   (ID: f4588f2a476206e602fe5b84647a1e777eaae604)

20. we must not be talking about the same deku . why does he like bakugo ? they are childhood friends . too unrealistic ? you can believe that a dude ' s sweat can cause explosion but having deku be too forgiving is unrealistic , yeah ok . risking his life to save other ' s ? bro did you not see episode digit , " my body just moved ? deku at his core puts others before himself , thats the reason why all might chose him .   x200b
