19. if done right , a collection of vignettes can be incredibly engaging . suttree by cormac mccarthy is a prime example of this , or steinbeck ' s cannery row . one of the things that makes it doable is how the vignettes tap into the reader ' s humanity  there is something they can connect with . i think it ' s a cool idea . who cares if it ' s the in thing right now .

20. eating smaller amounts isn ' t the hardest thing in the world if you eat the right stuff . things you " can ' t live without " you will still miss most likely but will find other wonderful things instead . rip pizza eating right in a controlled environmental is easy , eating right elsewhere is hard . so the restaurant put fries on your plate even though you asked them not to ? not an excuse to eat them . meat is awesome forever . ok i knew that already but it ' s still true .
