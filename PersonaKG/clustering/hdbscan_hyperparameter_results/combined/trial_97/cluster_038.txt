15. the best frozen pizza is the one that gets you laid . here ' s my story  i was wandering through wal  mart when i came across a rather attractive female . as we passed , i shot her a smile and noticed a frozen pizza in her cart . thinking quickly , i made my way to the frozen pizza section and grabbed a freschetta pizza . i made my way over the sharpie markers , opened a pack , and wrote my name and phone number on the pizza box . i then tracked her down , told her freschetta was a better pizza and handed her the box with my digits on it . two days later she calls and invites me in for pizza . although we never had any pizza , i did get immediately introduced to her bedroom . freshchetta gets the ladies wetter .

18. same here . my study of religion led me to conclude they were all manmade . the way that i see it we all have certain drives for meaning , for purpose , for morals and certain emotional needs getting over the fear of death , wanting to reconnect with dead loved ones , wanting a sense of meaning in life , etc . and religions each navigate a way in which they can fulfill these human desires . and i think that the religions out there today are still in existence because partially they tended to fulfill these the best .
