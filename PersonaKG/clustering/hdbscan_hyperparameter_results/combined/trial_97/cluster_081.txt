1. learning shorthand could be an option . also  no idea where you are from , but in some european countries if not all , recording lectures or meetings isn ' t frowned upon . i ' m a teacher and when i demonstrate some technique my students are allowed to film me , just as long as they focus on my hands and promises not to share it online .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

2. portkeys are a fairly common spawn if you have inventory space , just walk around a bit and they will come . as for the map , what you see is what you get . depending on how active local players are , there may be a discord group where you guys can get organized and share nest locations , ideal grinding spots , etc .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

   (ID: 7df89b558f49c9f710c5f928f61dae67f52229c7)

   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

12. no , but the stereotype is filled and this movie seems to be leaning very heavily in girl power bo peep not a soft woman any more . they didn  t do that with jesse , they just introduced a great character that was female . this is forceful feminism and it  s achieving the opposite affect . that  s what he  s saying . now stop being defensive .

17. let ' s be real tho , how many times is a centurion gonna charge his heavy from neutral ? if we ' re talking about casuals , then yeah that probably works , but if we are talking high level duels then most often than not the centurion starts with a kick or a feint . btw i ' m not talking about just dodging the kick , almost the whole cast gets some sort of guard break or cc after dodging one but kensei doesn ' t , he just dodges because the recovery is so slow to do anything .
   (ID: fc02053133b0aa8d444b95ed56c24999ae82879b)

18. i never stated as to it being the best , it is just a well written piece , as was batman noel and a death in the family . it is all about perspective
