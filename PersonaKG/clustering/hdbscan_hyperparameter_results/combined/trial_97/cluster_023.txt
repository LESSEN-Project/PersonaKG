7. yeah i  m aware how english works  i mean , i am english after all . my point is that it seems odd to us how american english appears to jump between plural and singular and i  m giving an example where the distinction seems to me ambiguous . if radiohead is nominated for an award do they win the award or does it win the award ? i know the answer to this , but again this is an example of the inconsistency which seems odd to english people .

13. there was a mom in michigan whos kids starved to death because she said they wouldnt eat what she made for them . the old adage " they ' ll eat when they ' re hungry " isn ' t true for all kids . it doesn ' t mean they jave autism , either . doesnt mean you have to give into junk , but they should at least have milk or vitamin shake . kids usually like those . sustenance is important for kids especially .
