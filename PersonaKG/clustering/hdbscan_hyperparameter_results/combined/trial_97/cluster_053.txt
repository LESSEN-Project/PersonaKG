5. that whole  shoot your brains out  answer might have been the one you wanted but it  s still a answer , you won  t want to whip out your cock and beat it to death if your brains are all over the room it  s just an solution not saying he should i  m just saying that would stop the sex drive
   (ID: cd907372aff0871825a64e977822586e3bb0ecb7)

6. what do you want ? answer that first even just to yourself and then it will be clearer what you should do . i want hugh jackman to come over to my house and rub me with oil and roger me senseless . i can want all i want  nothing wrong with wanting . it is just that what we want is not always going to happen .

   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

8. some woman supposedly .  i  m not saying this didn  t happen but fuck me . you won  t listen to the fucking fbi but this is a credible source for you ? at what point will you realize that you just hear what you want to hear .
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

9. esh your boyfriend sucks for not trusting you to go to a specific gym , which is crazy , you kind of suck for agreeing with him and telling him you won ' t go , but then you go anyways . this should of been nipped at the butt by you when he first brought it up . it ' s just a gym , and it saves you from driving an extra half an hour or whatever when you just want to get a quick workout in and get it done with .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

10. so you pointing out that it ' s about race and gender implying that you want it to be true just because she is a woman and an african please provide a valid counter argument or fuck off with your faminazi sentimentality .
