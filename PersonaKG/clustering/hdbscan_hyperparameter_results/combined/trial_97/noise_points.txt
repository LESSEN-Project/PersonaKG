1. shadow assault is unquestionably the least desirable . it ' s not a ' bad ' , heroic in reality , vp is just fantastic . most of the other less than desirable heroics i can think of niche use for , but that ' s the most difficult one . the other two that come to mind are rain of chaos which is decent for zoning during a push , and mind control can be used for picks in some cases . i wouldn ' t recommend picking them most of the time , but you can come up with situations where they are pretty decent . abby ' s construct blanking out on the name , is good and bad in so far that if not stopped it can do a lot of damage . it limits his team  fight potential though , so unless your team can compensate in some other ways it can be difficult to use properly . it has high potential though , and under the right circumstances is arguably superior .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

2. the best suggestion i ' ve heard on the subject is , ask your pizza delivery guy . start with cheap chain places like dominos , because their drivers are more likely to not give a fuck . a driver for some local shop might be the son of the owner or something . so you order a small pizza in case you have to try this more than once in a night , and tell the pizza dude your situation . you are new to the area , and could use help finding bud .
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

3. is an extremely thorough examination of free will . a short summary of the link above would be   we have the intuitions that   the sensation of the primitive of actions , is incompatible with their physical determinism  a decision can only have a single " true " source  what is by the past cannot be determined by the present  if no single psychological factor you can see is perfectly responsible , then there must be an additional something that is perfectly responsible  when you reflect upon any single factor of your decision , you see that you could override it , and this " you " is the extra additional something that is perfectly responsible but these intuitions are mistaken , and make our intuitive idea of free will incoherent . however , the feeling of free will corresponds to a real thing , and there is a meaningful distinction between a man having free will say , choosing to eat chicken or pork for dinner and a man lacking free will say , choosing to eat chicken or pork for dinner while in presence of religious fanatics that would kill him if he dared to eat chicken .
   (ID: fae28587bce17296589bf92d656ad68ee32601d6)

4. i ' m really sorry to hear that . as someone who suddenly lost his dad , aged digit , digit years ago whilst he was working abroad i can understand your frustration and know how this uncertainty gnaws on you . repatriation was a bitch and everything took a lot longer than it should have . everything worked out eventually , but it was a bad time for us all . i wish i could donate to your campaign , but unfortunately my financial situation won ' t allow it at the moment . i hope you and your family stay strong and i wish you all the best .
   (ID: 5fe12b36dc6d3370836c6683997c005efb656c99)

5. sloth . i have shit to do , but there ' s just no way i can motivate myself to do anything .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

6. ah i see , i would be lying if i said i hadn ' t done similar things in the past aha . do you actually enjoy the music  dress sense you are " rocking " at the moment ? haha , or is the sole purpose of it to please this girl . because i know it sounds cliche , but you are better off just being yourself man
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

7. One of my favorite things is mass effect   reason.

   (ID: 80d504f68f5028edc4d8e5926e3a2a93b0c84d8f)

10. i ' ve done nothing . i see these posts online about people who ' ve murdered sex offenders , and the comment section is filled with people who applaud the murderes actions . though i dont completely agree thats the way to go about it , i always think what if one of my friends or family members was a victim of assault .
   (ID: 199ca187d50b43aebb52968a5525289cb65a1520)

11. i went to a convent school so promoting unrealistic standards of feminine beauty and teachers body shaming teenage girls was quite normal there .
   (ID: 25a3a19690cf520ebb090d792f9aab864cc59254)

12. the best advice i can give to you is to either talk to your friend , let them know how you feel and give them the chance to become aware that their behavior is bothering you , or do nothing and slowly back away from the friendship . i am in a similar boat myself . as friends we should be able to voice our opinions and concerns within our friendships and not worry that the other will become defensive or misinterpret our motivations , but sometimes it just doesn ' t work that way because of bias or prejudice or just plain ol ' human error and that ' s when it ' s time to step back . good luck !
   (ID: d51e2f0207b67be3748f59fc0b78f82cd1e47a1c)

13. oh , you mean mean you don ' t know ? so you decided to comment on a scientific subject despite not knowing what the fuck you ' re talking about ? and now you need the information spoon fed to you because you ' re too busy jacking off to animal cartoon characters to do anything intelligent or interesting with your time ? well nope . see , i don ' t like people like you . you ' re an ignorant , boring , loud mouthed piece of garbage , and i don ' t want to help you . i don ' t want to explain a single thing to you . you ' re fucking repugnant to me . so go back to your sticky , disgusting little animal fuck fetish subreddit and shut the fuck up about subjects you ' re too stupid and too fucking lazy to understand . stay in the corner with the rest of the nauseating degenerates who literally want to fuck cartoon animals since normal humans have rejected them outright . as well they should . fucking gross . blocked . because i really never want to encounter you again . wow . just . wow . absolutely disgusting .

14. thank you so much for sharing these awesome pictures ! they really show how diverse and majestic the states are . i ' m from new jersey so i ' ve never really seen anything like this . i have a few questions  what state is this in ? was that your campsite in the pictures ? how long did you camp ? did you see any wildlife ? what was that body of water in the last photograph ? again , awesome pictures , thanks for sharing . i definitely want to visit for myself !
   (ID: 50e37e2011f73f739f76098c3c746e27b8422fd7)

15. i didn ' t imply that , you inferred that very incorrectly i might add . all i said was they matter , and you twisted my statement around to make it something it ' s not . you really don ' t know how mental illness works , do you ? tell a suicidal person to just buck up and see what happens . most likely , it ' s not gonna do a damn thing for them .

18. there should really be a like  dislike on their news feeds , and a comment section too . i  d love to see what goes through the minds of people who actually watch this mind  numbing bullshit .
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

19. yeah i ' m really sorry dude . this is often how it happens with something prescribed . it works really well to treat a symptom , but then it turns recreational . the only way i can put this is that you have to allow yourself to suffer . i ' m not sure if you have to be absolutely miserable during your break while your throat is healing but you have to give yourself permission to feel worse before you start feeling good again . as with lots of medicines that treat the symptom well , ironically they don ' t tackle the cause . without alcohol , do whatever you can to knock yourself out . use valerian , or make a pot cookie . do whatever you can to sedate yourself and don ' t use uppers . then , when you are all healed you can use recreationally without such a large concern for your health . you do need to stop though , strep is horrendous . you have to get out of your own way .
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

20. hrm , yeah i do want to do that for refining but the phase i ' m thinking of is concept writing   rehearsing . right now i ' ve been writing my bits like . so anybody here like joke set ups ? make some noise !  point to loud person  there ' s my people ! i ' ll tell you something about joke set ups ,  pause and grin  the best part is  snidely  the punchline ! then i practice till i don ' t need the notes , but i find if i let a bit of time go by between writing and rehearsing happens when bits come to me during a busy moment or in the middle of the night i often stumble over my clumsy notation . just wondering if anyone had a better way of putting the extra stuff on paper .
