4. has cassar ever done anything similar ? i can ' t think of a time . for me , petke has a pretty long leash right now . i don ' t have high expectations for this season , and maybe not even next . we need to rebuild in a big way , and it ' s going to take some time . the biggest thing i ' m looking for this season is change . i want to see something different from what we ' re used to with cassar . formations , tactics , in  game decisions , personnel , etc . i want to see that we are working to fix things , even if it isn ' t leading to wins just yet .

7. also , most people in the states are apolitical  depoliticized and best praxis would probably be to date them and radicalize them . we all have long and winding political developments and it ' s good to meet people where they ' re at and engage with them . this could also be applied to liberals  conservatives , but probably not with reactionaries . although you never know ! i wonder if any communists have converted a reactionary

8. from your post i ' m guessing your australian ? are you casual or part time ? i have one of those managers too but luckily he doesn ' t do rosters and i ' m pretty close with our rostering manager so he normally puts me on shifts where he is working and i don ' t have to deal with the bitchy guy , or if he ' s there as well the rm just tells him to piss off nicely of course only real advice i can give you is if they tell you off for doing something wrong , ask they how to do it right and try get them to show you . firstly if your not actually doing it wrong they get completely defeated . even during rush or whatever just ask them . i know a girl who the bitchy guy at my store was doing this to , she just annoyed him so much he stopped telling her they she was doing stuff " wrong " she wasn ' t because every time he did she made him waste digit minutes showing her how to do it the way she was already doing it .
   (ID: ced909c5cb6ff0568a08e4114fa46116da622fa1)

9. thanks for this post , it ' s very informative . i can ' t imagine having the fbi on my tail for just doing what i would consider normal . what a terrible life to live .
   (ID: d1e274dbfcf8ed1af55bb50c57e00046b961b6fd)

10. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

11. something that always gets me is i ' ve tried talking about this to friends . their typical response is " you sleep with lots of girls ! any guy would want that " these are usually friends that are in relationships . they don ' t know just how envious i am of their situation and they don ' t seem to want to understand .

13. you know you don  t have to follow a guide right ? one thing about majority of the players playing this game is that they don  t bother to adapt , they just mindlessly play and when something kills them , they think it  s bullshit or the build is trash .

19. you should see his previous speeches where he essentially generalized the population of mexico as a bunch of rapists , murderers , and thieves . i can ' t figure out the exact reason , but this has to be a smoke screen . someone , somewhere is doing something diabolical , but we ' re fixated on trump and what he will say next . tl  dr illuminaughty touched my body .
