2. you might be right . there probably was a cause for the big bang . just because we haven ' t figured the specifics , however does not mean we should invent a religion around the mystery . scientists have figured out the causes of many things . so far magic is not one of them .

6. what she is doing does not seem particularly troublesome . i mean it just seems like she is changing in ways that are really freaking you out . from what you have said i would let it slide as long as he isn ' t violent , extorting money or raping her . i mean as long as she is happy and not getting hurt right ?
