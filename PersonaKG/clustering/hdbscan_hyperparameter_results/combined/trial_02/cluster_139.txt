3. is there a difference between transgender and transsexual ? is transsexual considered to be an insult ? i ' m genuinely curious . all this gender talk frustrates me sometimes , there ' s so many genders and no one talks about sex  what ' s in your pants , or whether its there naturally or artificially . that ' s the thing i care the most about when it comes to romance and sex as a gay guy .
   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

4. i imagine it ' s normal to homogenize your peers , if they like the same things as you , logically they are similar to you and probably around your age , but realistically there is a huge age span of the old nerds who were on computers before everyone else along with those youngsters just discovering reddit . yeah , i do the same thing

   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

10. if someone doesn ' t wanna be in a relationship the worst thing you can do is try to talk them into staying .

13. in all seriousness , like the most heartwrenching thing i could find at the moment . usually its anime cause they take some investing . in the worst part i watched how to train your dragon many times cause that one scene broke me , especially after such a heartwarming moment . for anime i recommend clannad then clannad  afterstory , that shit will break you .

   (ID: c69ba20c8286f807f6219a451e4448f951938f31)
