1. since it ' s under the table , i ' m guessing the money your parents give you can be treated as a gift . as such , there would be no taxes owed or paid since it ' s not on record at least i ' m assuming your parents did not note it in their business expense report . since it doesn ' t sound like an actual " job " job , then i ' m also going to say that this isn ' t something you plan on writing on your job resume in the future . if that ' s the case , pocket the money and save  invest wisely .

3. hmm . personally , i ' d say that it ' s less our intelligence and more our savagery . we destroy everything in our path if we have to , and we are the most versatile animals on the planet . we also hold a long , long grudge against other species if they harm us , going as far as killing off entire family units to get revenge  not because of territory , or food . because we ' re angry .

4. while i agree somewhat to the fact that hispanics like to fuck . i find it a bit distasteful to say that the problem is with hispanics . not with retarted white christians . who are too dumb to realize that their children are going to fuck regardless of what they ' re told . so hey lets get them to put on a jimmiehat
