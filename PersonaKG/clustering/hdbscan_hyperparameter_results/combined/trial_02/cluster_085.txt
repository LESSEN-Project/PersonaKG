   (ID: 8f7369c6ebb47df350fec663be46dfd8481ee2db)

19. i actually want to hear from guys who have been married . since commitment in both marriage and with owning a vehicle go hand in hand . if your car doesn ' t work anymore , do you just get rid of it and find a newer one that works ? or do you stick with it and try to repair it ?
   (ID: 2e30252ab6ce4c1807bb315c6103be324b841909)

20. why does what you do in your free time have any bearing on what you do at work ? in your mind , is it impossible for someone who likes to get high to refrain from doing so at work ? if you drink beer or alcohol , how is that any different ? should having a beer at home disqualify you from driving a forklift at work the next day ? these are genuine questions .
