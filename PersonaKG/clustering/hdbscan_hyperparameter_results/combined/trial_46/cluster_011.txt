1. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

3. my initial reaction to this was anger and confusion which means i can learn from it if i try to understand you calmly . please expand on why you feel wealth inequality to not be bad .

4. it ' s just that you refused to address my points or say anything but lol you are stupid , since you are so far beneath me and you lack the intellectual capacity for rational discussion i have moved on to doing something better with my time . you know it as well as i do that socialism will when you ' re watching it happen on tv every day and you ' re burned up with impotent rage . i don ' t give a shit what you say about me because i have people in my life who actually love me and care about me unlike trump supporters who are disowned by their own children do to how awful they are .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

5. i  m not talking about your initial comments , i  m talking about the whole conversation . and during this conversation , you  ve been all over the place . you  ve told me that you  re just giving me food for thought and i shouldn  t actually change what i  m doing , then you blatantly told me you  re telling me to change what i  m doing . you  ve called me apathetic , then you  ve told me i  m taking it personally . i should stop reading into your comments , but you get to interpret mine however you want . now you  re saying you enjoy disney movies , but you draw the line at writing quotes on the board . that  s not where i draw the line , and i  m sorry you feel that  s wrong . we could discuss the meaning of that song and why i specifically chose that lyric , but i  m not really wanting to open that can of worms with so many other things already on the table . what you  re not seeming get is that i  m not trying to do any mixing . i  m not making grey , as you suggest . i  m keeping the two issues entirely separate . and the definition of apathy is showing a lack of emotion or an indifference . i am telling you that i have thought a lot about my stances on these issues and am far from apathetic .

6. they are facts as you see them . your need to mock makes you an asshole and is a mistake i am trying to correct i a way you understand . further mockery . who ' s denying the facts , anyway ? to me its not what your doing its how your doing it .
   (ID: f15c79447707a6e701285e8c59cc3aa25d54daa6)

7. never asked for your pity fuck face nor did i ever suggest i was a good guy you did suggest however that i was a bad guy . blindly follow orders ? really guy are you for real ? there is a fucking huge difference between blindly following orders and doing a fucking job without bitching like a pampered millennial cum dumpster . i ' m sick of asshats like you making assumptions about the intentions of a fucking soldiers enlistment . my job pointless i ' m pretty sure quite a few families would be proud to know their lives are pointless . maybe we shouldn ' t be there but people are being killed but that doesn ' t matter to you because they are not americans right ? so me stopping tali from murdering husbands raping wives and kidnaping children and turning them into sex slaves is pointless ? irregardless of why i was sent there in the first place it ' s still pointless because it ' s not your family . ok thanks for the clarification .

8. wait . i never which side someone is on . please tell me if you are stupid or have common sense ?
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

9. ahh , now you ' re playing stupid , huh ? way to show intellectual honesty . really . well done . thanks again for displaying what fucking liars you all are . way to show , again , that you have to lie through your teeth just to feel like you aren ' t a bunch of fucking rats . seriously . thank you .

10. why does it matter how i respond to you ? your argument is invalid .
   (ID: 4126a6a9d5a548a6bed5e0c4992792b1c10f2b92)

11. i ' m confused on your stance on racism . in another comment you claim you were denied into a committee of sorts based on you being white . so you understand what racism is . yet you make a statement like only asians and jews are good at math . sounds to me like you ' re delusional . a stereotype is formed from ignorance and ignorance comes from not understanding or not wanting to understand  which fuels racism . so unless there was a misunderstanding , i think you and i have different definitions of what racism actually is .

12. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

13. lol ad hominems are a sign that you ' re triggered . calm down and see it for what it is , humor . if you cannot i certainly can ' t help you . i ' m not going to respond to you after this reply you ' ll just have to stew in your misguided anger . have a great day smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

14. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .

15. except for my very first post where i said lgbtqwhatever , because that  s what those napoleons like to be called , please , show another one of my post , where i was arguing ? i simply stated what i strongly and firmly believe . now back to people , who like to suck dicks , being fuk in the ass , licking each other  i don  t care what they like to be called and what they think they are . they are mentally ill people to me . i could make myself more clear .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

16. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

17. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .
