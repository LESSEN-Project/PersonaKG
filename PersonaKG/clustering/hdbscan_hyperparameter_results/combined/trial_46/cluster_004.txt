1. no ma  am you are not worthless and even if nobody notices you have a lot to offer . it feels like nothing can get better or that nothing will ever change but it can . just hold on . you just keep holding on and you can get through this .
   (ID: d28c94c02761dbceb7bd64e3288f28eeef3a75cf)

2. i hate to ask , but i feel i have too . at what point in your moms illness did you realize the fight was over ? or did you never come to that point ? i ask because i ' m dealing with some stuff and would really like to know . when do i stop " pretending " and start preparing for the inevitable . i ' m at a loss .
   (ID: 96ea4e7f6c3452a58ef71fc7276006fdbf2ccb01)

3. i don ' t think the issue here is that you asked for his last name . maybe you should just take his words at face value  that it ' s taken so long to actually meet up , that he ' s lost interest . but to answer your question  i personally don ' t usually like to give out my full name to someone before meeting them because of social media stalking . i mean it ' d be pretty hard for anyone to stalk me anyways because i don ' t use my full name anywhere besides facebook and my setting for that is pretty restricted , but still . also why did you feel the need to know his full name anyways ?
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

4. admitting there is a problem is hard . fixing it even harder . your kids are likely in school full time . perhaps there is a way that you can find an after school program instead of a daycare . or , a dayhome . an hour or two in the afternoons probably won ' t affect your children negatively as a they are more connected to you by this age and can identify right from wrong and tell you , and b an after school program is guided by professional people and c less costly than full time care . i am a mom to a half day kindergartener digit and a digit mornings a week preschooler digit . i would need to find evening or weekend work to save myself from childcare costs being enormous , so i choose to wait until they are schooled full time . do you have any flexibility with your job ? perhaps you could drop off and pick up and return to work if necessary when she returns home . i ' m getting off track . i can ' t think of anything you ' re doing that isn ' t gentle , kind or thoughtful and coming from a place of love . i know my husband works long hours for our benefit and i appreciate the hell out of him for it . you are a good person and it sounds like she does need help in the form of a doctor or counselling for ppd . just keep coming from a place of love when you tell her you miss your partner in crime and that you want her to be happy , and all that growing old together stuff . i would beg and plead with my husband to come to counselling with me if i thought he needed it , but if that ' s likely to make her angry i just don ' t know . maybe if you guys are close with her family you can discreetly discuss with a trusted family member that you are worried . maybe they are worried too .

5. sounds like a rough situation , if s is really obsessed i guess not doing anything don  t help , so you got to take action . i would suggest telling s you don  t like her , and hope for the best .
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

6. feels like a one side of the story . i could see how you weren ' t one that missed an opportunity to point out in the last digit . digit years to tell john he ' s a loser as often as he said you ' re a drone . i can ' t imagine someone would constantly harass you like that without anything coming back . but if he ' s truly the only " bad guy " in your stories , which i kinda doubt , then your reaction would be more justifiable . however , it was still incredibly childish and a dick move . just talk about the issue you have with him like an adult ffs . you guys are 27yo  is it so hard to talk about how you don ' t think it ' s productive to constantly harass each other ? what ' s the point ? and if he continues to be a child about then talk to your friends about it in a way  " look , i respect and want to support john in what he ' s doing and wish him all the success in the world  however he can ' t stop harassing me for what i am doing and is very insultive about my way of life  i don ' t see any other option than not interact with him anymore because he can ' t be an adult about the situation  then see what they have to say  might suggest . do that than rather making a fool out of yourself and completely escalate the situation in a childish way in front of your whole social circle .

7. as much as i empathize for your situation , i think you should consider the symbolism of the tattoo to your girlfriend . that tattoo symbolizes a huge part of her life , many memories , the birth of her kids etc . to her , it may come across as if you want to erase that part of her history from memory . i know it would be horrible seeing her ex ' s name every time you see her , but if she won ' t get a cover up tattoo for it , then maybe try to change your view on the tattoo its self . it ' s not her ex , it is a stage in her life that has contributed to the person she is today . tl  dr the tattoo is representing a part of her life . you can ' t change it , so change what you can . your perspective on it .
   (ID: d4912bd11a6aaa98c91794eda03e9fafdfcf5c43)

8. one of the biggest errors our little human brains make is assuming people we know are the same from day to day . many people do not understand the episodic nature of depression . i strongly encourage you to mention to a friend of parent something like " this may be out of left field , but between you and me , i ' ve been feeling kind of blue lately . i know i don ' t show it , but i guess i could use a little extra support at the moment " say it in a way that feels like your voice . saying it out loud is scary , but surprisingly therapeutic in and of itself .

9. if i make plans then sometimes she asks if it  s ok to invite other people along . sometimes i say yes , sometimes no . if i say no she strops and hangs out with them instead .
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

10. i used to be an extreme example of this . i ' d assume intercourse meant he loved me and ultimately wanted to marry and have kids with me . thank god for guy friends setting me straight . main reason to disclose and have some sort of talk is to filter out girls who think the way i used to . they may not be stalker psychos but were simply raised with a certain set of beliefs and have peers who share them .
   (ID: 5bae960970112f75742b080e45f735ad64949805)

11. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

12. could just be an awful texter ? if you  re worried about getting your hopes up , perhaps try not to think about it too much and if they want to take it further they  ll let you know ! or you could even let them know what you  re thinking and if they don  t respond then you know where to go with it . good luck !

13. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

14. there ' s no reason to havs regrets in the first place . regrering something isn ' t going to erase it from the past , it ' s not gonna do shit . you ' re not a slut for having sex with people . you ' re normal .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

15. fair enough . " the one that , all things being equal , i would readily choose in a heartbeat " this is why i like that i got to live with her for a year . to sort of back up your point though , the grass on my side is so brown , anything is greener . if i was the type to generally ' jump to greener shores , ' i wouldn ' t have kept my mouth shut , during that year , or the year plus after . the one who is ' relying ' on me , is the one that treats me far worse  the one with no real need to , and in fact had much to gain by befriending my wife over me , treated me much better , with nothing to gain from doing so .

16. parents should never love their child or anyone else ' s any less , simply because that child is gay . it saddens me to think of your struggle . i come from a conservative family , and was raised very much anti  gay , but you know what ? when i grew up , and learned to think on my own , i realized that the bigots are the true evil in this world . i told each of my children that if i ever found out they were gay , that i would be digit  cool with it . as a parent myself , let me tell you that you need nobody ' s approval to be who you are .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

17. if you have low self confidence it ' s probably because there are things about you that you don ' t like . if having a girlfriend is the only thing about you that you don ' t like and you expect another person to love you without loving yourself , than you ' re going to have an unhealthy relationship . find out what you need to do to love yourself before looking for someone else and when you succeed the right person will come around . and if she doesn ' t , it doesn ' t matter , because you ' re happy .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

18. i am so sorry for your loss . it ' s ok to be thinking of yourself right now . death is hard to deal with even if your not in touch anymore . perhaps this can be a moment in your life that makes you learn and reminds you to keep people closer . don ' t blame yourself for anything life is short . red  heart
   (ID: dc0783c6951122c6edfc85430901cf133c146b32)

19. yasss , i ' ve been asked out by girls twice big pp energy and said no both times . it ' s not even all about the girl tho one time it was just about where i ' m at and weather i want to be in a relationship at the moment . in terms of physical appearance i honestly can only think of two girls i even know of that i like okay she ' s not that cute . the rest are all cute , still wouldn ' t go on a date with digit  of them though just cause of differences in personality and all that . girls don ' t have some magic power , but neither do guys . asking anyone out is a chance . saying that however i still think girls should start asking guys out more . not under the assumption they will definitely say yes , cause they wont . but just because who should guys be the ones always asking girls out .

20. move out . do you know how many people have problems like this because they live together first ? he has no incentive to marry you . you ' re probably sleeping together and living exactly like you ' re married . so either you need to take all those privileges and perks away to motivate him or let go of being sensitive . not trying to be harsh . but you got yourself in a pickle here . honestly ask yourself if you ' re in his shoes , why should you go through the risk and trouble of getting married when you can have what you want ? why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free ? old saying
