8. in watching my replays over this past year i ' ve noticed that for some reason a good amount of people seem to only press one button per input . i laugh at those people . i laugh at them because only an insane person would put even an ounce of faith in this game when it comes to online connections . if you ' re doing locals than you ' re gonna have to play like that or at least you ' d find some benefit to it . but online you ' re not only fighting your opponent but you ' re also fighting the connection . at any moment some frames could drop and completely cancel out your single button press . at the very least you should double tap or triple tap everything you ' re doing . triple may be too much in some situations on some characters but double tapping seems to be pretty solid on everyone in this game aside from the few digit hit combos in this game but you won ' t even be able to do those reliably online even if your execution is perfect anyway . tl  dr mashing  bad , just relax , it ' s just a game . the more knowledge you have the more confident you can be in your play . however , if you ' re playing anything other than at your locals , double tap that shit . don ' t trust this games online connection with your lp . it will leave you a rookie for the rest of your life .
