1. jesus no we didnt need a whole other film but i thought they made some questionable choices for the last act . visually i thought the snapped heroes returning was pretty meh . it shouldve been strange leading them out of digit massive portal , instead we get t ' challa first . why ? and the whole assemble felt too spaced out . get rid of all the filler warriors and have the main heroes together and get a better run  up action scene , they shouldve used the angle that was in the infinity war trailer that had hulk running through wakanda .

2. darksouls was the most challenging game i ' ve played in past decade , and imo is one of the best games ever made , so hyped they might remaster it next year . as an emotional wreck of a human being and welding a heart so deep one could say it ' s . the dark , the game and stories of the npcs really hit me hard .
   (ID: 95c90f0b7430996843a42a4f365667a13e4c2eb5)

3. i ' d have to say ori and the blind forest . it ' s such a beautiful game with such a beautiful soundtrack . the story is told with few words and more visual story telling . that game never fails to make me shed a few tears , even on the 5th playthrough . it ' s not playing a platformer , its living the trials of ori and it just submerges you so well that i ' d have to say it ' s my all time favorite game .
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

4. some i like are  pbg star bound  it was not how i thought hr someone would go out . dean mc digit  he could have build a bridge but when you panic you panic . barry starbound  almost no one noticed instantly terraria digit ending  well that  s a sucky way to end jeff terraria digit and digit  just so similar

5. which is exactly why j . j . is trying desperately to change the dumpster fire that last jedi was . the reception from the fans was so positive that solo was boycotted by tons of people . that ' s why all you hear is how great the last jedi was and how the star wars properties plans and movie outlays were drastically altered due to the huge positive response to it . you guys liked it sure but the idea that a small minority did not like it is ludicrous . the facts show that it damaged the whole series .

6. the vampire diaries the first couple of seasons were great but then the storyline got all kinds of stupid , people just refused to die they ' d find some way to bring them back . disappointed because i loved that series at one point .
   (ID: 1f61921525978b0c5bcae6c0ab9c184a4d4c86a6)

7. world of goo . always a quality game as for other games , astroneer and terraria are great
   (ID: 507a68eb71bd6ad59b6eb966ab94fb9c2e599bc8)

8. my favorite was rise of the triad . i don ' t really have a solid reason , but i also played wolfenstein 3d and doom  doom digit .
   (ID: 47503483b65f94d9e176031a7c8a7bff26fdb36c)

9. the second trailer was better than the first by far . i think many can agree . i didn ' t get a " cod clone " feel at all from it and still wasn ' t impressed . that ' s cool you ' re hyped for it .
   (ID: ed8c4bb1975edb0f627baa6dac44e74cbc7237c6)

10. couldn  t agree with you more . yes it wasn  t a perfect remake but it was pretty damn close in my books . if people don  t like remakes , i get that . but i can  t understand why people on reddit hate on this movie otherwise . i  m not sure what people who didn  t like it would have changed . the video said jungle book was better ? how ? they were almost the same in turns of animation . i liked it . my friends liked it . like you said the original will always be number one in my heart . but this was a damn fine movie in its own right .

11. waaaaaaay too many blockbusters i know daredevil isn ' t a part of the cinematic universe , but it was much better than any of the movies minus the fillers and plot holes it didn ' t follow the same formula of intro , blah , blah , and buildup to the cgi fight scene at the end , yay everyone ' s happy now . it had depth . it had enough time to explore both the hero and the villian . i felt like if mcu took a page out of the netflix book , they ' d be a little better off . i don ' t understand how people are still so impressed by the same cgi anymore . it ' s gotten bland . also , the action was very organic .

12. i may be one of the few here who liked pnd3 . i honestly like it more than pnd2

13. ffxv . love gameplay , didnt hate the ending like other people , and new game plus is fun to be an overpowered god .
   (ID: e1cfe7e3bd4f78988caf9c6fd043691888e401c8)

14. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

15. i liked the books , but they ' re not great , i agree . they ' re easy to read , which is part of their appeal . i do like the large number of characters and how they keep crossing paths , often times without realizing it . i do find the plotting and backstabbing interesting , and the mystery of some of the schemes so you don ' t quite know who ' s is telling the truth or lying or is simply being an ass , it ' s more obvious in the show , so it takes away some of the mystery and guessing . i do like fantasy . i read the lord of the rings trilogy as a kid , and another couple series that i absolutely adore redwall , and the wheel of time but i consider those truer fantasy than got , but maybe that is the appeal of the show . it ' s fantasy , but also somehow more relatable , more realistic , in a way , so it ' s not as " hardcore " fantasy , if that makes sense .

16. i see what you mean . i ' ve never played reach ' s multiplayer so i can ' t say much about the problems you mentioned , though they do seem pretty bad . personally my main draws were more from the single player modes , especially campaign . i thought the alien invasion story was actually quite good , since it showed how massive and powerful the covenant was , and how ill  equipped the humans really were to fight them . it was definitely more grounded and military  based than the other games , but i personally liked that sense of desperation and scale the setting gave off .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

17. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .
   (ID: 95c90f0b7430996843a42a4f365667a13e4c2eb5)

18. that was a brilliant game . i remember playing that when it came out  2000ish ?  and thinking that video game graphics couldn ' t possibly get any better . still think that gp4 is the best f1 game ever made apart from possibly grand prix legends .
