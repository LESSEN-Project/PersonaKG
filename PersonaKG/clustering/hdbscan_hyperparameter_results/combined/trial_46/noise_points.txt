16. i am sorry if thats completely wrong what i am gonna say , because i don ' t have experience . but wouldn ' t it be possible to stretch your skin slowly before engaging in penetrativ sex . maybe take some extra 10min before , where you stretch and work the skin back slowly with some lubricant . sure this may not be the most sexy thing to do in the middle of a heated moment with you so , but a serious partner should be supportive when it just during the waiting period . if this doesn ' t work , you can also find sexual pleasures without engaging in something like penetrativ sex , where a retracting foreskin is required . a oily handjob over the skin could probably make me come even without having direct contact to the penis glans . and if you are into butt stuff , this could be the time to explore some new ideas .

   (ID: a69486a9dd78d1ba9533599ba57eac9079ca3c8d)

20. i  m not whining . i proposed that we make the world a better place while asking people if they can help me get a foot in the door so i can prove myself on my own merits . if you  re lifestyle and career aren  t making you happy than i empathize with you . you are my brother and you deserve better . you  re capable of so much more than they  re paying you for . your life has meaning , your time is limited , and your purpose unique .
