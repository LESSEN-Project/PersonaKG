1. that wasn  t me who said that lol . i played the shit out of the first destiny . every dlc , did every raid , all of it . the game is absolute shit . i understand that that  s my opinion , but i truly do not get how people like that game . didn  t even waste my time buying the second one . so disappointing that bungie abandoned halo for this garbage

2. no mans sky always were a good game . you suckers just say it is  was bad because the creator overhyped it and lied about some features . blame the creator . not . the . creation . thats not just about nms , its about every fucking thing  your wife died giving birth to your child ? blame yourself for making her pregnant or dont blame anyone thats just one example . and also the game became really good after those updates . fuck you . haters gonna hate .  digit

3. strong story and a solid world is all i want , took a chance to play battlefront digit recently and while it plays well and everyone is dressed up like they ' re in star wars , it doesn ' t feel like star wars

4. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

5. first off bud , i  ve played since alpha . secondly i didn  t say anything was over powered , you do know how to read don  t you ? they asked what we thought was the best character offensively , it  s an opinionated post , the  competitive  aspect of the subreddit has nothing to do with options or thoughts . your assumptions and negative responses are the exact reason this game is dying .

6. i like it , may just be me but i ' d like a version with a little less " action " going on it in . it ' s really good though don ' t get me wrong .
   (ID: 064b68f55fd83de76c3cbc4f130670e6435e42a4)

7. i have not played the first game . but i hear the second one is a massive improvement over the second one . it has gotten some pretty nice reviews .

8. darksouls was the most challenging game i ' ve played in past decade , and imo is one of the best games ever made , so hyped they might remaster it next year . as an emotional wreck of a human being and welding a heart so deep one could say it ' s . the dark , the game and stories of the npcs really hit me hard .
   (ID: 95c90f0b7430996843a42a4f365667a13e4c2eb5)

9. i completely agree . it ' s always the first game i let new players try out . everyone loves it . it ' s also the game i that i first tried that convinced me to get the vive . such a great vr experience .

10. how rock are we talking bout ? i personally think back in black is such a great album , i still play it every now and then .
   (ID: 5bb6e2d4db1d5ccf3a1f430564735551dfb4c28b)

11. lol ! i liked it a lot , especially the sense of isolation and vulnerability you had playing as a regular soldier rather than a spartan . it also reminded me a bit of metroid prime , which is one of my all  time favorite games .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

12. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .

13. i think the movie is better than the series mostly because the movie used the lyrics
   (ID: 2e2a44cdfc726423ec202a2fe420543af441d1ad)

14. it does a good job at being a shooter , the single player is just an after thought , i really hate when games don ' t have a worthwhile single player mode to them because some weird reason most develpers probably don ' t even know but just go along with it because everyone does it . i am not a fan of multiplayer especially not online i don ' t know i just don ' t like it . so splatoon went in my opinion from interesting to it is a good concept . it is just focused on multiplayer and the single player seems to have no replay value

15. that was a brilliant game . i remember playing that when it came out  2000ish ?  and thinking that video game graphics couldn ' t possibly get any better . still think that gp4 is the best f1 game ever made apart from possibly grand prix legends .
