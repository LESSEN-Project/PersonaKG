1. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself

2. you gotta get out , this is the tip of the iceburg . if you want a red flag this is a huge one . as a matter of self preservation you get the hell out . been there it does not get better with time . don ' t be a schmuck

3. that was quite shitty of her . lots of people use others as kink dispensers and then get mad when they ' re not comfortable with what ' s going on . you did the right thing in stopping .

4. in my limited experience  it ' s best to set boundaries clearly , but one issue at a time . you walking up to her mother and saying " you need to back off " immediately sets you up as the adversary trying to cut her off from her baby girl in the most important time . you ' ll be treated that way from that point forward . instead , you need to talk about the individual things with your wife so you have an agreed stance the next time they come up with your mil . it ' s way less likely to lead to war if you can hold your wife ' s hand and speak up for her saying ' we ' ve decided it ' s best if it ' s just us and the medical staff in the delivery room ' , ' we ' ve done the research and want to do x ' , etc . than if you go in by yourself and try to lay down the law to a mother about her child . you can be the one to make the statements , but they need to be phrased as joint decisions with your wife ' s clear if silent support . if your wife doesn ' t want to have those conversations alone alone , that ' s fine . her part becomes to deflect , i . e . " we ' ll talk about it next time we see you " , or just not respond when the mil isolates her on an issue . her backtracking or bargaining alone will kill any progress you make by standing strong together . talk to her about that , too . also , congrats and good luck !

5. you have the right to be upset or angry , or any other emotion you are having right now . your wife needs to know exactly how you feel and take ownership for causing it your wife should be willing to do anything for you that would help you build that trust back up . no more expectations of privacy , no more hidden anything in her life . she needs to be an open book . look at her bank account , check her on  line presence , monitor her calls , get all of her passwords , and  or whatever you feel is needed . then you need to work on regaining that trust . if this is going to be a life sentence for her , then end the marriage now . you need to work toward her having privacy again some day . just not right now . there is no such thing as too much communication in smarriage .

6. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !

7. move out . do you know how many people have problems like this because they live together first ? he has no incentive to marry you . you ' re probably sleeping together and living exactly like you ' re married . so either you need to take all those privileges and perks away to motivate him or let go of being sensitive . not trying to be harsh . but you got yourself in a pickle here . honestly ask yourself if you ' re in his shoes , why should you go through the risk and trouble of getting married when you can have what you want ? why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free ? old saying

8. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .

9. he ' s digit years older than you and you ' re gonna have a miserable life ahead of you if you stay . you gotta worry about yourself first . you do what you think you need to do .

10. dont worry i gotchu fam , see im digit myself and i have a gf who likes to show off skin obviously not nude . anyways if it was a real concern id explain to her one last time that if makes you uncomfortable seeing another guy is getting pictures of her with only a towel on . if shes sending you spicer pics then id see this as less of a concern anyways if this still continues ask for her friends what they think try to get them on your side and from there just ask them to help you convince her to stop . if this still doesnt do anything ask for an ultimatum this is a last resort . ultimatums work digit  of time because it makes the other feel trapped and stuck with an a question thatll change the course of the relationship . if the ultimatum succeeds be extremely nice to the other person otherwise theyll think they made the wrong decision . if otherwise then there are plenty of fish in the sea . let me know what you end up doung because im actually interested

11. i totally understand . i have add and many times my parents at mad at me for stuff and i don ' t know why . then later it hits me and i ' m like shit this is totally my fault i ' m an idiot . i don ' t blame my parents at all for getting mad . many people with mental illnesses don ' t recognize there ' s a problem and that just makes it so much worse . all i can say is i hope everything turns out of for you and your brother eventually

12. oh it is several things . the first thing you do is completely cut off all of the energy vampires in your life . try to figure out if somebody is making you feel bad . maybe they aren ' t trying to . that being said , many people are subtly abusive and you might not know that what you are feeling is not you , it is somebody else ' s toxic emotions that they have projected on to you . learn about adaptogenic herbs and supplements and start an adaptogenic stack . loneliness sometimes is just stress , fatigue or a chemical imbalance . i recommend , n acetyl l tyrosine rhodiola rosea , ashwagandha  ksm  digit , tumeric  curcuminoid with pipeline , magnesium citrate , fish oil and vinpocitine . make sure you are listening to positive people , positive music , positive messages and are engaged in plenty of self affirmation . then you want to reach out to people . being lonely means that you have to project onto others what you wish to receive so you have to give the right people your time , love and attention . loneliness sometimes isn ' t helped by being around more people even though i recommend this but is more ameliorated by improving your relationship with yourself . maybe you need to be a better friend to yourself ? do you think you should read more ? maybe exercise  jog  lift more ? do you think you should listen to more music or get out more ? do you need to clean or decorate your apartment ? do an all the above approach and remember that you can always give yourself permission to feel loved and cared for without a material manifestation to validate it ! often people feel warmth , generosity , compassion and admiration first , and then the outside world reflects that feeling . try to exercise your mind with meditation and being to dim certain thoughts and emotions . if you can fake happiness , after a while it becomes a muscle that builds over time .

13. sounds a lot like my story , honestly . your best bet is to talk to her about it . don ' t do what i did and hide it , it ' ll probably come back . digit divorces , digit years old , a ton of self esteem issues later and i ' m just starting the transition process now .

14. i know you guys are gonna tell not be with someone who i can ' t trust you ' re goddamn right .  but hear me out . maybe we ' re just doing something wrong ? mmmm nope . you shouldn ' t date someone you can ' t trust .  i just wanna fucking know who she ' s talking to lol . bit controlling but okay . ask her if its that big of a deal .

15. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .

16. i  m not sure if he loves you but i would tell him to stop when he does something you don  t want , be honest with him that you  re not ok with what he  s done  doing but be open to talking , and if you think he could help your friend then yes , ask him . i  ve never been in a situation anything like yours so i  m not sure my advice is any good but believe in yourself and you can find a way ! live strong red  heart

17. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

18. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .

19. i can think you should be honest with your feelings . i say with experience and to ignore or overlook it can be more destructive than anything else . if she genuinely likes you , she ' ll come back . if it ' s just the physical stuff the friendship will fizzle out . that ' s the worst part though . fwbs ruin good friendships most of the time .

20. bad break up ? if so you got to let it go . if not , then go outside and explore somewhere where people are accepting , like a sports bar or social clubs or something where you can add to peoples conversations
