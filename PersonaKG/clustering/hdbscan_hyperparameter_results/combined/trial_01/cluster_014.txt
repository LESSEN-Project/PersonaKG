1. imo when you say you believe in something , you stand up for it even when it doesn ' t benefit you . if you believe in freedom , then you have to protect people ' s freedom to do things you don ' t want to do . otherwise you were lying about valuing freedom .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

2. oh , i still say israel shouldn ' t . but you wanted a answer from the left so i gave you one . me being from the right doesn ' t mean i ' m unable to give a left answer .
   (ID: a61db1f2f0a3d15376fd168a1637c028f25100e1)

3. okay , you ' re trolling . you got me . i give up .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

4. you ' re right . no one should be able to force you . my point is that you should choose to do the right thing anyway . if you have the chance to do right , and you choose not to , then you have done evil through inaction . you have the right to disagree . but for me the greater evil has always been the taking of an innocent human life . i can ' t deny that an embryo is innocent human life . and that is why i am pro  life .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

5. did you read the question ?
   (ID: 1afb7597077681179430af152997f04fd73ba0ee)

6. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

7. if they understand everything else i said , then they understand the last part too , they ' re just in denial .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

8. i mean hey , different people , different opinions . i ' m not taking that away from you . i don ' t wanna force my opinions and ideas down on people that do not show signs of wanting to .
   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)

9. fuck that . women who don  t let men have an opinion on abortions but expect child support are something else . it wasn  t the immaculate conception ladies , his sperm made the baby too . i don  t know how to make this situation work for both men and women . however , simply ignoring the fathers opinion is completely unfair .
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

10. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

11. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

12. huh ? i did not say that . were you answering to a deleted comment ?
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

13. lets take a moment to appreciate how much you assumed i implied from my accusations of your implications . have fun with your lesson in reading into things
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

14. how can you seriously say that ? it was pretty much men who fought on the frontlines in both world wars , and almost every war after , you are being completely disrespectful towards the people who risked and gave their lives just so you could live comfortably and be able to write this comment . get a life and show some respect for the people who , i dare say , saved the world . and about the raping and murder , can you give me a study or report about it ?
   (ID: 93c3b3d523de0afd404d3bcb4acdf023866f9281)

15. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

16. then what is the joke
   (ID: 4ae54d4dcad6354406284af9bc07ffc708ce92a2)

17. i add comments instead of editing , because i doubt people will re  read my comment . worried , maybe not , but you were the one who wouldn ' t take my word for it . sources dont usually help people that already have their minds made up .
   (ID: d8014467041b98317d9f1dec2b0dae4ff9405b91)

18. except for my very first post where i said lgbtqwhatever , because that  s what those napoleons like to be called , please , show another one of my post , where i was arguing ? i simply stated what i strongly and firmly believe . now back to people , who like to suck dicks , being fuk in the ass , licking each other  i don  t care what they like to be called and what they think they are . they are mentally ill people to me . i could make myself more clear .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

19. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

20. i mean if the government told me it was to help stop a world wide war and you weren  t going to get hurt and you believed them ? bull crap jumping on a bus hurts you and other things don  t and are debatable whether it  s a bad thing . that  s why i always hated that compassion that parents like to do . theres a difference between hitting someone because they told you to and jumping in front of a buss . for example in middle school once we were allowed to walk around by a teacher in the classroom this is important and a guy was pinching me and was chasing me so i kept walking away and he kept walking faster and so i ran and got in trouble . but would you really say did i deserve to take the blame for running ? look at it from the women  s point of view . if all of society and every authority figure told you your life and that of everyone you care about is in danger and the only thing you can do to help is hand out a feather . you would do it ! you gotta understand the whole context and the thing being done and the relative morality of it . individuals are not always responsible for there actions . there are always factors involved that take away the choice .
