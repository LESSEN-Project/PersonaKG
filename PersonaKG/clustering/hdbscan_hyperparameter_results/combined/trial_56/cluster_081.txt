Total from this dataset: 5

1. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

2. if you know anything about ceo ' s we have plenty of time to kill and this is more fun than playing golf . i don ' t care about helping your numbers . any complaints you get are your fault for hiding the merchandise while it devalues so you can buy it below cost and resell it on ebay . you are the reseller . i am just the advisor .

3. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show

4. i mean , i get it . we grow up and suddenly we ' re responsible for our own survival , when we only exist because someone else wanted us to . why do i have to get a job and pay bills and all that shitty stuff , when my parents are the ones that put me here ? don ' t know that you can really win in a court of law , and maybe you should suck it up and just deal . but i get it .

5. so you keep telling me , i must have really made you angry with my opinion . didn ' t know it would shake you so badly . at the point you just parrot what i say while putting crying emojis in it i would really call it a conversation .
