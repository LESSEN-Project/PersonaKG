1. look at the sun first . then look at the data of the other planets in the solar system . you may find that there might be something similar going on ? you may also want to look into nasa ' s current observations on sunspots and solar activity and the average temperatures since this sun cycle ended . either your suv is reaching and has changed the heat of pluto  or . well , maybe i ' ll let you be the observational scientist . meanwhile , all the climate projections have been wrong since mr . gore ' s power point presentation . why ? it deals mostly with carbon dioxide , not the sun   and not a single climate projection that i have reviewed has ever taken in account of the heat sync ability of the earth ' s oceans .

3. that is just too random . i mean , the caves themselves seem huge , no matter how far , i still see areas of darkness . so i ' ll try and fully explore the area , i guess . i don ' t want to die and respawn , since i mined up lots of ore .

4. do you want cell service on it ? i bought a  digit tracphone at walmart for my toddler to watch netflix on during a trip . it has all the things you mentioned . it ' s locked to their network so you ' ll never be able to take it essential l elsewhere , but it seemed to handle what i required of it .

6. i play online vs exclusively . i ' m not saying this to piss you off , but i can poke check and stick lift all day long and hardly ever get a penalty . my poke checking could arguably be considered poke spamming i do it so much . it ' s all about proper positioning and timing for those poke checks , and never poke from behind . as far as stick lifts , they work very well during puck battles , especially along the boards . if your opponent gets possession , lift that shit right away you have to be fast and it ' ll almost always come loose and back to you . i ' m not saying it ' s perfect far from it , but if you ' re getting penalties on poke checks and stick lifts either your timing or positioning is off . go ahead and downvote me if you want , but i hardly ever get penalties for pokes and lifts . almost all my penalties are checks into the boards that ea will randomly call boarding or charging .

13. forget about how you ' re supposed to act to be a man . just be you . for example , you ' re about to be of legal drinking age . you want a sherly temple at the bar while everyone else is doing shots and chugging beer ? fuck them . get your sherly temple and drink it with pride . trust me , it ' ll work out .

15. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .
