2. you know you don  t have to follow a guide right ? one thing about majority of the players playing this game is that they don  t bother to adapt , they just mindlessly play and when something kills them , they think it  s bullshit or the build is trash .

3. god , i hate all of the rock fans . from the gatekeepers to the lewronggenerationhttps    type people . it makes me ashamed to be a rock fan . i can hardly wear a nirvana shirt without someone saying " oh i bet you don ' t even know that ' s a band and think it ' s just a brand " . bitch , you can fuck right off .

4. hahaha no , i ' m sorry ! i think i know what ' s happening . i didn ' t object to you using the term pseudoscience , but to you defining as science with shaky bases . it ' s just flat out not science of any kind , only posing as such . that ' s the distinction i was trying to make you understand . i think i might have been a bit clearer , but i ' m on the phone , so i was perhaps too curt . sorry again .

5. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .
