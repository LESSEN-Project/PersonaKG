1. last  minute entry ! kellie had been feeling kind of down , but nobody at the castle had a clue why , not even the digit problem fixers emmettthe summoner , king , prism , and stan knew why .  maybe a trip to the beach will cheer her up !  sharena suggested , the others agreeing .  if anything could cheer her up , it  s emma in a swimsuit !  prism said , the others groaning at that statement . one hour later   okay kellie , you can take off your blindfold now !  alfonse said .  i can kind of understand the blindfold , you guys did say this was a surprise , but why the tissues in my nose ?  kellie questioned , taking of the blindfold and finding the answer staring her in the face . emma , in a gorgeous bikini . the tissues immediately went red .  hey kellie ! the others told me about how you were feeling and their plan ! so , is it working ?  emma asked . kellie didn  t respond . why must i never have any ideas at the worst possible times ! well i hope you enjoyed this mini story !

2. i definitely understand that . i felt the same way for a long time . then i realized that i shouldn ' t change my life because of what someone else might think , especially since i was not intentionally doing anything to anyone . it ' s a tough thing to deal with but i hope you can come to terms with it before i did . it took me way too long .
