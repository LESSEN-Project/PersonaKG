5. if we are quiet in a group setting it does not mean we are having a bad time . although it ' s a nice gesture , you don ' t have to constantly check on us . it makes us feel insecure and like we ' re doing something wrong .

6. exactly , no way to win . only thing to do is avoid the situations with people who are like that and try to have worthwhile conversations with people who are more reasonable . the stuck up sjws aren ' t worth you time
