Total from this dataset: 7

1. what i ' ve always heard isn ' t that the digit , digit is a literal number of beta access or vip access . it was equivalent in the time the book was written to saying a zillion . just with extra meaning . digit tribes of israel , squared , times digit so a lot .

2. always ask for a lawyer especially of you haven ' t done anything wrong . for example  cop  " where were you yesterday around 2pm ? you  " i was at walmart buying groceries " harmless right ? yea , until you find out there was a murder next door to walmart at digit  05pm and you ' ve just put yourself at the scene of a crime . congrats , by being cooperative , you ' ve just made yourself a suspect . and that ' s assuming the cop isn ' t just straight up lying to you in order to get you to say something incriminating .

5. thank you for the response , i  ve been considering whether she  s really worth keeping around anyways . it  s just so hard to cut out someone who you  ve known your whole life .

6. here ' s another sv650 fan jumping in . bought my first sv650s after digit years of riding . best bike i ever owned in the " what a hoot to ride " category . i ' ve since had two more and an sv1000 which , while far more capable in most respects , just doesn ' t have the same just plain fun to ride character .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

7. " not unconventional " doesn ' t make sense , and no it ' s not strange to wear plain clothes but it ' s just hard to believe that every single item of clothing you have ever bought is digit never had a logo , brand name or been designer of some sort and digit you ' ve never been asked by anyone you ' ve ever come in contact with where you have bought your clothes from .
