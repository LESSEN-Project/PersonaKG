2. tbh that ' s probably your friend being low on energy and overwhelmed by trying to reply in a genuine way to all those messages . i honestly don ' t see the point on commenting on it at all instead prehaps try regulating the amount of messages you send at once , and if you feel you are being ignored don ' t send more right away to test the theory , because it won ' t help . just wait till she feels like replying . not everything is personal . as for me , if i get a lot of messages i tend to do exactly this , i try to reply to as many as possible but in general it feels non genuine to me to reply to all of them when the other person texted them a while ago . hence i tend to reply mostly to the things i perceive as important or at least are most interesting to me . if i get frustrated i know it ' s nothing to do with the other person but only the way i prefer interacting with people . i never actually get mad at someone for doing this . unless it ' s excessive .

3. i just say hey to people i know , try to make conversations of needed , this avoids awkward attention , because i just look like a normal human , talking and laughing , but little dot hey know

4. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .

5. oh , believe me , noah aint the worst shit you could have gotten . i have a name that only two other people have in my country , so . its pretty embarrassing . and well its just a one crush . i know it feels like shes the one , but let her make a decision , and accept it no matter what it is . you can try taking her out on date to show that you aren ' t some random retard . good luck man , waiting for the best news from you !

8. i know its not so easy to do when shit like this happens but . do people who do this not train themselves to get out of this situation ? as i understand you are supposed to roll onto your front , get your ice axe thats tied to you and kinda use it as an anchor ? i mean there were parts there where it seemed like he was just sitting up like he was on a slide

9. i completely understand . i just imagine my inner meaner as something ridiculous or someone i disrespect  don ' t like so i can tell it as sassily as possible to shut up . sometimes goals take time . its important to remember that no matter how smol the steps are , you are taking them one day at a time , and it should be celebrated . you will get there ! i know it ! just hug your stuffies and dream big lovely  digit

10. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .

11. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted
