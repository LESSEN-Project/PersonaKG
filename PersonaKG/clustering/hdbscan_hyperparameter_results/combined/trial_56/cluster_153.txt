1. are you just trying to make friends with kids on the street , or are you seeing them for a medical visit , because if it ' s the latter , you probably aren ' t going to have much luck . they ' re afraid of you because you ' re going to poke and prod them and give them a shot .

5. this one time me and two of my friends were all hanging out on a weekend off school . we went down to the basement of the place i was staying at , a little before noon to play horde mode on gears of war digit which had just come out a little while later we decided to come back up and see about ordering a pizza or something for dinner somehow it was digit  digit in the morning and we  d just completely lost track of time  there were no windows in the basement and no clocks , so when we were expecting to come up in time to see the sun getting low , we got hit with the really bright morning sun . all three of us just kinda went  oh damn it  s late  and wandered home

6. i have not even the slightest clue what is going on in this video . he is playing a custom game where the projectiles digit shot you , he goes into the cinematic view then blink dodges a projectile and hits his own . it ' s just impressive because of how hard it is to do anything in that view , including basic walking .

7. lol yeah , i enjoy myself also . it  s just that sense of dread of something going wrong . best i could describe it is being young and with your peers at the time .
