1. they looked amazing for the first month but they really didn  t last long . i knew that going in but i was really disappointed . i paid  digit for digit syringe so i loved them but can  t afford the upkeep . it all depends on what look you  re going for and what product the doctor uses

6. i arrived at this conclusion when i was about digit  i was in a health class at school and they showed us a video of a woman going through pregnancy , labor , and the aftermath . and that was enough for me to nope out entirely . up until that point i was on the fence about the whole thing , i figured i ' d probably have kids someday but not anytime soon  but the video showed me how invasive for lack of a better word the whole process of giving birth is , and i already dislike going to the doctor  so nope . not for me . oh btw  i was married digit years he died a few years back and he was completely fine with us not having any kids . secondly , the old folks home is full of people who either outlived their kids or whose kids abandoned them there  so much for them taking care of you in your old age .
