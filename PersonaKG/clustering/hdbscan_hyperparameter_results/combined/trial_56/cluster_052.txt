2. plenty of the extra stuff is from tolkien ' s works , and is actually why i support the existence of at least a second movie . lord of the rings is actually digit novel , divided into digit books , often published in digit parts , and erroneously called a trilogy because the movie adaptations are . book digit  the shire   rivendell . book digit  rivendell   amon hen . book digit  aragorn , gimli , legolas , gandalf , merry , and pippin ' s parts of two towers . book digit  frodo and sam ' s parts . book digit  the first group ' s parts of return of the king . book digit  frodo and sam ' s parts and the denouement . i mention this , because i compared page counts . the copy of the hobbit i own is about digit pages , and the copy of lotr takes about digit pages for each book , but at a larger page size . back to the hobbit , it ' s comparable to any of book digit  digit of lotr , in that it follows the actions of one group . but , like two towers , there ' s a whole second side of the story you won ' t hear if you just read one of books digit and digit . so if you take gandalf ' s adventures with the white council into account , you already have material comparable to any of the lotr movies . except it ' s not quite that simple . sure , by a page count , the hobbit with gandalf and the white council is comparable to any volume of lotr . but they have different writing styles . if you ' ve read both works , you ' ve probably realized that the hobbit moves much more quickly . for instance , in the writing style of lotr , i could imagine their stay at rivendell taking multiple chapters . or especially with some of the events like anything happening in mirkwood or at erebor . so yes , a lot of the " extra " material is from tolkien ' s other works . it ' s just expounding on what was happening with gandalf while he kept disappearing , drawing from other sources where tolkien explained that . and , to me , it ' s enough to justify at least the second movie .

3. wanted to ask this to my best friend ' s girlfriend who is also my best friend what she likes and doesn ' t like about me . i have trouble talking with her anyway because i ' m an awkward person . i ' ve tried to gain confidence , but it just never works out

5. i ' m confused what you ' re upset about . a gunslinger who understands how to use his class to its full effectiveness ? much like a titan putting a bubbleshield directly over a control point and sitting there with a shotgun , or titansmashing everyone at a control point ? haha , as a fellow hunter , i have to say , i ' ve tripped my own tripmine grenade and killed myself more times than i ' d like to admit golden gun gives hunters zero shields , nor does bladedancer . all they had to do was go in one of the two other entrances , double team him and he would have been gone . instead , they filed in the same door over , and over , and over again . edit  just watched the second video . derp . yeah . this is why i always roll my eyes when titans complain that hunters are op .

6. from what i  ve heard , they  re still exercising at least once a month which is the same as before . they were all pretty excited when the  no more war games  thing was announced , but we don  t call any of our exercises  war games  so we just assumed it was a way to seem like we were giving up something without ever doing so . if anyone was to bring up the fact that we haven  t stopped exercising we could be like  we gave up the war games , but we didn  t stop our training exercises  . hell , i  m in japan and even we were hoping that maybe we  d luck out and they  d let us quit exercising as well . no such luck .
