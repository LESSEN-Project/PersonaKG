Total from this dataset: 10

1. don  t assume anything . ask for clarification . in my workplace , people sometimes assume they understand a vague assignment and we wind up doing unnecessary or unwanted work because someone was too shy to ask an executive some follow up questions . please , just politely and confidently ask .

2. judging by your response , youre probably a terrible parent who doesn ' t take the time to enforce standards of good behavior in children , and instead says ' thats just the way kids are ' and lets them run around batshit crazy being a fucking menace .

3. assuming they both use the force they could probably counter it , there is a reason they don  t just use the force to unarm people in a fight .

4. totally disagree , and frankly idk how people can agree , i mean when is it too much ? is notifying digit million people too much ? what about digit million ? why not just notify the whole planet ! digit  digit  digit we should all just be neighborhood watching for missing kids !

5. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .

6. may i ask what system you play and what rep you are ? because there is no way in hell you ' re playing high level duels and landing a mix of lights and heavies consistently as kensei . its most likely mid tier at best . people don ' t parry in high tier . they just block . and kensei is left useless at that point .

8. i ' m not talking about that sort of camping . that ' s the proper way to camp and it still involves looking for fights so i have absolutely no problems with that at all . i ' m just referring to the people who sit in one spot for a long time hoping to catch players by surprise .

9. i was just all  out the whole way through . pedal to the metal , take no prisoners , digit  isn ' t good enough kind of stuff . overloads every semester including summer sessions so i could graduate sooner , plus working digit  digit hours a week . i was fucking insane .
   (ID: a31ab3f3ccb2d987e0948a7a8ed52f5d74b72960)

10. i  m not a bootlicker , i just have mad respect for the people that risk their lives to keep my county safe . i see the sacrifice that these people make for my country and i give them the recognition that they deserve . my grandfathers were in the military and they always told me to show respect to those who risked and gave their lives for my country , i guess it carries on
