2. are you somewhere weed is not totally legal ? if so , i would say mailing joints would be an unnecessary risk . i suggest you give them to a stranger that looks like he smokes weed and maybe you ' ll make a new friend .

3. there was a mom in michigan whos kids starved to death because she said they wouldnt eat what she made for them . the old adage " they ' ll eat when they ' re hungry " isn ' t true for all kids . it doesn ' t mean they jave autism , either . doesnt mean you have to give into junk , but they should at least have milk or vitamin shake . kids usually like those . sustenance is important for kids especially .
