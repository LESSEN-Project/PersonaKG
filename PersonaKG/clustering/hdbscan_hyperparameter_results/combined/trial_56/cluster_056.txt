--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 14

1. i think you mean more openly discussed . murder and violence should be discussed while at the same time nobody needs to know the details of someone ' s sex life .
   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

2. sometimes i think that no matter how hard our life is , no matter how much we suffer or put others in pain , the people who have passed on are laughing because they know it doesn ' t matter and nothing matters in life because there ' s something else that ' s better for everyone once we pass on . as far as i know , death only affects those that are living .

3. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .

   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

5. how cute , you think you know a thing about what people go through . try being bullied and shunned to an extent at digit different schools , 3rd grade until i went to college . oh , and you would all collectively call me a normie because i have an intimate relationship . don ' t assume you know a damn thing about any person who posts here because you simply dont .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

6. fuck , i think i know him ! well actually i know his mother . intimately .
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

7. i think it ' s more of a confidence issue for me . if he makes the first move than i know that he likes  wants me rather than me taking the chance and getting rejected . although i have asked out all of my past boyfriends so i don ' t require it .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

8. i know several people who think that is the funniest thing ever on family guy .
   (ID: 627809b826e1a364fb65664e0749e9e9eb90081d)

9. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

10. i think it  s hit reg . as far as i know there aren  t any hacks that make you invincible but in the wake of the hit reg bug it  s entirely possibly it could have been developed since everyone would put the blame on hitreg
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

11. i don ' t know if i ' m ready for the next chapter . i don ' t think my heart can handle it .
   (ID: 8764a223ca1af7d1792e76a58bf3b1209bf73ad3)

12. i think being loving first and getting to know them can permit the conversation about jesus to go more smoothly . they may even come to see god through through tour loving relating as the candle shown for all to see . if we don  t tell our co workers at our jobs about hell digit  digit why should we do it to homosexuals ?

13. im waiting for kunimitsu and negan , and i know several pros and cons . pros are you know the most of the match up , move , what safe and what can be punish . cons are sometimes you do wrong input for example yoshi ender i always use with f3  digit but some times i mix that with miguel button input . also , having your brain expand the size of the entire roster , sometimes i found myself think of all the move i use when i fight those character , for example like if i fight yoshi , i would expect my opponent to only use what i also used but nope he use other tech so i find it difficult sometimes . sometime you you underestimate your opponent because you know most of the match up , and other than that , you can mix some move into other character for example yoshi didn ' t have savage but you think he has cause you play most of the roster . in short it can confuse you .

14. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .
