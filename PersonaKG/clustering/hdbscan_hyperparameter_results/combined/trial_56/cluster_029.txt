2. wow this must be one of the most arrogant things i ever read . so basically you are saying that grrm and d  d are not good enough story tellers plus us hard core fans are too stupid to pick up hints in the show unless you the leaker god start a discussion about them in order for us to be prepared for the bad writing and wouldn ' t get it without your help ? how many people did you just insult with this arrogant comment .

3. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .

4. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?

5. this is enlightened . complaining is not the same as soliciting advice . so often a child ' s minor complaint about something gets a response telling them what they did wrong , just making the kid feel bad .
