1. if it ' s true that you made a mistake in development ad set the bar too low , why on earth would you reveal that information with digit races to go ? it makes you appear clueless and incompetent . i don ' t get what there is to gain from revealing this .

2. the post clearly says the point . 400ms lights , in response to consoles extra delay with frames and guard switch makes the lights unhealthy for the game , it promotes spamming and ' lucky ' interruptions of combos . i didn ' t go from " this to that " , it ' s all apart of the discussion , if you ' re not following it don ' t comment ? and as i said before the party for lights arent consitant enough to keep up with the dmg that lights do . i mentioned orochi because his lights are nasty , you can whiddle and opponent down in digit light combo strings , let alone if you mix anything in .

3. sometimes i  m asked to judge science fairs . it  s so disappointing to see that teachers approve projects that have zero scientific merit and allow kids to waste their effort pursuing meaningless  findings .  the kids are so proud of their display and project and i  m put in the awkward position of explaining how it  s flawed . yet , if you don  t tell them , you  re no better than the adults that mislead and misinformed them .

6. do you value your marriage vows ? because if you don ' t then maybe it would be better to leave your husband sooner rather than dragging out a relationship where you fundamentally disagree on some major aspects .

7. they show up at your house and basically tell you not to do it again . if they don ' t see you , there ' s not much they can do . unless somebody has proof obviously .

9. are these people and their one sided twitter beefs a joke or something ? this phd person has to be satire . then there  s the troll who keeps trying to stir up stuff with rackets for attention i guess ? maddox needs better foot soldiers on social media , the cringe is unreal .
