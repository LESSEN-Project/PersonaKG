1. the other comments are kind of mean . you aren ' t obligated to be friends with anyone and it doesn ' t seem like you guys are being mean to him . as long as you continue to be polite you won ' t be an asshole . i also don ' t think its clique  y to have a group of friends you regularly hang out with . i would just continue to be polite , and maybe if he keeps signing up for your breaks say that " actually his name , we usually all eat lunch together . we aren ' t asking for you to switch the time you take your break at all ! but because only x amount of people are allowed break at once , could we coordinate a little better so that i can still eat with your friend ' s names ? "

2. i imagine a good relationship , and i think about all of the happiness that will come from a relationship . i mainly feel like society doesn ' t accept me , based on how i look . it ' s frustrating how people don ' t look for personality in relationships , and i have a good personality . it just , sucks .

3. i don ' t think that ' s what i said , getting a perfect on someone doesn ' t make them lose more points , it makes you lose less . so say you ' re ultra silver and get tap ' d by a bronze rog , and it kills you meaning he takes the game . you ' d lose digit  digit points for that . but if you perfected him once then you ' d only lose like digit or something . in terms of closer ranked matches like ultra silver vs silver , you ' d lose digit  digit or so . so if you perfect them once then you only lose digit  digit or something . in this game where one good hit can lead to a crazy snowball , i feel like there should be some point buffer for getting cheesed out . so , again . i was not saying if you land a perfect on someone that they lose more . you just lose less should they win and they still gain the same amount .

4. i feel like i need to say something here so i will . all three games are phenomenal . when i think of a souls game i think of challenging gameplay . dark souls digit was my first game and i loved the shit out of that game , still do and plan on getting the remastered when it comes out . tried demon souls but it would constantly break on me so i just quit . played through dark souls digit and due to the changes in combat was given the chance to better myself and git gud again . it had a beautiful world that made you question wtf was going on . it had a plot that was there only if you took the time to look . these things to me are what make a souls game a souls game . i just started playing three recently and i  d guess i  m about digit  digit of the way through the game from what i know about it . its fucking awesome starting out already knowing how the combat works . but because of this , i can  t git gud at it because i was already good at it when i started . i beat gundyr first try . dark souls digit took away what i wanted from a souls game , to be able to proudly say that i got good enough at the game to beat the everloving shit out of it . don  t get me wrong i  m absolutely having a blast playing it , and i definitely wouldn  t call it a bad game . digit and digit feel like adventures , while digit , much like its predecessor demon souls , feels like i  m just playing a game to get to the end , kinda like chores almost . finally , how in the actual fuck are you gonna say digit isn  t a souls game ? have you fucking played it ? have you beaten it ? it  s just as much a souls game as demon souls and bloodborne . in fact dark souls digit is more a demon souls remake than a dark souls digit sequel , they just threw in the same item descriptions and a couple characters from digit . if you think dark souls digit is the purest form of souls which it is than digit , being totally open with a vast array of ways to start is more like dark souls digit than digit is . there it is , my thoughts on the matter . downvotes welcome here smiling  face  with  sunglasses

5. scum ? idk i started a brand new map the first day i popped it up and i got digit bears to hit and run me lol best day of my life . but i think it  s a really good game , they constantly keep it updated , then again i think there  s a lot of steam games that are good and under the radar , i just feel like some people are d  ks at times because it  s starting up

6. stop arguing with your brother , and have a calm conversation with your mom . listen closely to her , without interruption and without formulating any rebuttals . try to understand her views , and verify you understand by repeating her exact words back to her . when you think both of you feel like you understand her point of view , then ask her questions . an example  if you could dictate your children ' s futures , what would they look like ? do your current actions help put that in place ? what do you think dad would say about this ? how can i help to alleviate your worries or whatever negative emotion she shares . next step , request a certain amount of time for you and her , but don ' t say that to think about what was discussed , and schedule when you can meet privately again . do the same process as above , but allow her to change her stance without confronting her about the change . just make sure you both understand how she feels and why she feels that way . now you can share with her your feelings and opinions , just keep it calm . i bet you two are not as far apart as you think .

7. i don  t think it  s women that like you less , it  s just not the best women who are acting like this with you . i mostly have female friends i knew before and after transitioning and they were all really supportive , same with any male friends i had . they are good people , so they accepted me wholeheartedly . i suggest finding those types of people in your life , regardless of gender yknow ?
