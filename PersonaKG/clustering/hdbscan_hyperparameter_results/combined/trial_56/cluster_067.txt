1. i haven ' t heard of that book . i wonder if even if they read it if they would realize what they ' re in for . they are such amazing , hard  working people that are in it so deep that to admit defeat . well . i just don ' t think they could do it . wouldn ' t it be so embarrassing to say you tried and gulp failed . it really really makes me so sad for them . and i agree , it sounds like a book that could be quite dry , but i bet it would actually be quite interesting if you know someone personally involved . i would probably cry for them .

2. hey there , i know you have gotten some good advice and i know you have gotten some sketchy advice . im about to give you middle of the road advice . lol . i dont think you need to have some long drawn out serious " come to jesus " talk with your boyfriend . a simple statement like you made should suffice . if you say no more sex without a condom that should be fine . you dont even have to be mean or demanding about it , just make the statement , as i think you already have and then just make sure that the penis never touches the vagina without a condom . you can put it on for him , you can have one ready or close by , or just ask him to put one on . i think if you make too big of a deal about it that it will kinda of put the blame on him and it is digit  his fault but its digit  your fault too . not that i am trying to make you feel bad , that kind of stuff happens sometimes . if for whatever reason he doesn ' t want to play along then a more serious talk is required , but i don ' t think the first conversation about it needs to be too over the top . i know as a male that if i were told no more sex without a condom , i could take that at face value and move on without a big long discussion about it . i ' m hoping your bf is the same way .

3. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .

4. we never see the other people of the game world  they don ' t actually exist and are just artificial memories and illusions to the characters that are actually modeled . the game has an incredibly limited amount of locations , people , and things . she would have no future there except to continue living through the same experiences over and over . even besides that , we know that natsuki ' s home is not a comfortable or safe place for her . as for the matter of jobs and such , any of the dokies even monika would have the same problems with qualifications and paperwork . monika would be the least initially shocked at the transition , but i think any of them would end up being grateful to have been given the chance to make more of their lives than was allowed them within the confines of the game .

5. i feel like the incident had nothing to do with the lasagna . if he is stressed out he may have just taken it out on you because you were an easy target in the moment . which isn ' t cool . can you sit down with him and simply say " what ' s going on , something is off now and if it is because of me i would like to know . i don ' t think you are being an ass , or oversensitive to something that shouldn ' t have been a big deal or resulted in a cold shoulder . anything in hindsight that may have been leading up to his change ?
