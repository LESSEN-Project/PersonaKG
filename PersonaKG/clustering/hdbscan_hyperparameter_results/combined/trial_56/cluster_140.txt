1. i don ' t understand how a person can allow their kid to act like a wild animal in public places . when i was a kid , we had " crazy time . when we were at the beach or playground or whatever , my parents let my sister and i go absolutely bat shit crazy . it ' s what kids do best . but when we were in restaurants or shops , we knew damn well it was not crazy time . how can parents just let their kids have total crazy time all the time ? inb4 " obnoxious people have obnoxious children . you ' re right , of course , but still . god damn

2. i am sorry if thats completely wrong what i am gonna say , because i don ' t have experience . but wouldn ' t it be possible to stretch your skin slowly before engaging in penetrativ sex . maybe take some extra 10min before , where you stretch and work the skin back slowly with some lubricant . sure this may not be the most sexy thing to do in the middle of a heated moment with you so , but a serious partner should be supportive when it just during the waiting period . if this doesn ' t work , you can also find sexual pleasures without engaging in something like penetrativ sex , where a retracting foreskin is required . a oily handjob over the skin could probably make me come even without having direct contact to the penis glans . and if you are into butt stuff , this could be the time to explore some new ideas .

3. thanks friend . i liked your poem . i am in the general habit of cutting much . i say lose traveled because life traveled nowhere fast is cliche and doing something so simple as i suggested freshens the idea and can challenge a reader in a good way . i also don ' t like a poem laden with prepositions , hence the absence of between . these are all just opinions from your readers , which after some trolling , i feel this subreddit lacks at least quality opinions  input

4. i mean it just objectively does , a signal , a loud one at that , that you can  t turn off ? when does it end ? why not just give a signal for any and every crime , look at it like this if the average person has digit , digit days alive and you ruined . digit peoples sleep , digit , digit , digit is it worth it ? there has to be some end , i don  t care . don  t amber alert me , i  m not going to pay attention to it either way .

5. fuckkkk , this digit  . when it is my time to finally tell a story and they just have to interrupt every digit seconds because they have to say something or cant wait digit minute to ask whatever they wanted to ask . like for real shut the fuck up for once and let the other person speak .

6. yeah , my biggest is not the spoiling . i spoil my daughter a lot too , but i also make sure she is aware of the fact that what you have doesn ' t make you who you are , it ' s in your heart and how you treat people . my biggest pet peeve is the parents that are like , no honey don ' t scream , ssshhh , it ' s ok , and there is their cld having a stage digit temper tantrum in the store  zoo  park wherever and they are just so passive . drives me crazy .
