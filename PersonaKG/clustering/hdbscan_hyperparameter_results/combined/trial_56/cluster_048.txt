1. the human mind is extremely suggestable and memories are pretty easy to make up . go ask one of your friends about that time you went to the gas station to grab a drink and they where out and the cashier was a dick about it . then ask them what color the cashier was . odds are they will give you details about something that did not happen . now picture you are a tiny person with a steady stream of incoming information you can ' t fully process come and your understanding of the difference between real and imaginary is still pretty fuzzy . kids can make up some wild stuff that they believe this way .

2. ok i have a query , because something isn ' t right here and before everyone gets all got under the collar , no , i am not a holocaust denier , so keep your poison to yourselves please  why did this guy decide in digit to break into auschwitz to report on events there , when killings didn ' t begin there to any meaningful extent until at least the following year , and the wannsee conference without which auschwitz wouldn ' t have become what it did wasn ' t until digit ? either the dates in the historical record need revisiting or someone is bullshitting us about something . edit  in case i haven ' t made myself clear  the title of this thread mentions " atrocities " but at the time this man is said to have decided to get admitted to auschwitz the atrocities for which the camp later became infamous were still quite some time in the future . so why would he feel the need to do what he did ?
