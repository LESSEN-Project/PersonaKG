2. make the difference between what you really need and what you want . for the want , don ' t buy immediately , think about it , would that really make you happy ? often it ' s only a happy boost at buying time , an instant gratification and nothing else . many would think it ' s miserable life but it ' s all the opposite , the want i end up buying are things i really want .

4. yes , you need to tell someone . school nurse might help . but it may come down to child protective services . do you want to be pulled from your home and placed somewhere else ? it could come to that . is it really as bad as you think ?

5. as someone else said , you need to go with it . two ways to do it  have a comeback . you said you ' re not good at it , but keep trying to think of some even after the fact . if they ' re falling into patterns with what they ' re saying , you should be able to use one of those . build off one of their digs and take what they said one step further . part of this might all be part of being low man on the totem pole , but you want to show you have some edge so you ' re not always that guy . good luck op .

8. i think ugliejosh makes an excellent point and is not delusional , but rather rational and insightful . if there would ever be a hypothetical pre  revolutionary rupture within the imperial core , however unlikely , sympathetic elements within the u . s military  intelligence apparatus would be crucial for success . i would highly , highly recommend listening to the ' it could happen here ' podcast . it ' s essential listening for leftists of all stripes . also , eyes left is a very well produced leftist military podcast made by two socialist military veterans . there are many military veterans that are well seasoned activists and organizers that have participated in wto , occupy , standing rock , ferguson , etc . are you sure you don ' t want their help in fighting fascism , building dual  power , and maybe one day capturing the state ?
