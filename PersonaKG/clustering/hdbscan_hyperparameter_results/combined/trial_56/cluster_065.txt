7. i am inclined to agree with most of what you said , and i ' ll look at the studies , but i suppose it ' s partially what i was trying to say , no drugs are safe , legal or illegal , if done wrong . i tend to indiscriminately tell people not to do the illegal ones though , since they can destroy your life , in fact it can have nothing to do with the drug and everything to do with the social situations illegal drugs tend to put people in . though i ' m sure you know that much too .

8. i ' m not an atheist either but the more i learn about space , the more i can ' t believe that our earth was created the way the bible says . because w t f there are over digit billion galaxies in space that we know of . the bible has all these answers about how god created everything and our one planet and who even wrote those ? are they oc or were they added by one of the million people who have translated  rewritten a bible ? but has nothing to say about the massive expanse full of billions of other galaxies that stretches further than any one person could travel in their lifetime ? i wonder if i ' ll ever figure it out .

9. i know i ' ll never get one so i ' m not really worrying about that . however i do carry some so my breath doesn ' t smell when talking to people

10. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .
