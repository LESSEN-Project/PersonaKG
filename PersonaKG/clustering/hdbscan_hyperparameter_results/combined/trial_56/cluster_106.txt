1. thats cool . it does really depend on the girl . i think we all probably have little things we like  dislike about women . its not that one is right or wrong . for example i like it when i can see the impression of a girls ribs some people would say the idol os anorexic or too skinny but i like it for some reason
   (ID: 4679181760b739d302b80a7e08480575bf4d30bc)

   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

   (ID: 3b45915d58b20f0e2abb6b26d4534980a5d3aa68)

7. you make it easy by jason aldean it used to be my favorite song in the world , now it makes me feel like dying . i think that should sum up why .
   (ID: 2168250be01c43791f88e7c8ad875c0396307047)

8. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

9. my mother was an only child , she said it was very lonely growing up as an only child and she always wanted a big family . i have digit siblings , after seeing how expensive it is raising a child and all the other drama that goes with having digit kids , i think it is insane ! i personally would like to have two kids . maybe three .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

10. i think i speak for most atheists when i say that i cringe hard when i see fuckheads like this .
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

11. it cost you  digit to build the whole thing from start to finish ? or is that not including the case and wires and all that ? if it was digit bucks total that ' s pretty good . it cost me i think like  digit  digit or so to buy my te2 chun stick although it is an amazing stick all ways around so i like it a lot .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)

12. i dont think it works like that but ok
   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

13. you  re making it seem that everyone who plays video games or anything like that is a lowlife piece of shit , my dad  s an avid gamer , is about 240lbs and could probably bench press about 250lbs , i  m not that far behind him and i play video games as well . maybe don  t generalize when you say that every gamer is lazy or is weak . and the reason that men don  t think that women should get it into their minds that hitting a man is okay is because , what if that man retaliates ? the woman could die , and it  s hard sometimes not to fight back , especially if it  s really bothering you . men don  t like to feel pain , neither do women , so why benefit one at the other  s expense ? double standards are bullshit .

14. no problem . hopefully there are more like you in the world . fair play to you for wanting to brighten up a strangers day . another thing would be leaving post  its on mirrors in public toilets telling the next person how great they look  have a lovely smile  fabulous hair . or if you are out to dinner and it ' s really good , specifically ask to see the chef and give them a tip . i don ' t think they get them very often .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

15. i laid mine out in chunks like front left  front right , back bottom , back left  right , shoulders , etc . basically , as icreamboy said , plan ahead . also , with the enthusiasm of buying patches , you may end up with some patches from bands you enjoy . then realize you don ' t enjoy them enough to have them stitched to your back . so think about the patch before you put it on , and if it ' s something you will feel comfortable with for a while . sure , you could remove it later , but as said before planning makes a visual difference . i have maybe digit patches that i bought specifically for my vest that , upon laying them all out , i decided against using for one reason or another .
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

16. maybe fairies ? i think that would be really cool . i like dragons more but i ' m afraid they might destroy the world .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

17. except for my very first post where i said lgbtqwhatever , because that  s what those napoleons like to be called , please , show another one of my post , where i was arguing ? i simply stated what i strongly and firmly believe . now back to people , who like to suck dicks , being fuk in the ass , licking each other  i don  t care what they like to be called and what they think they are . they are mentally ill people to me . i could make myself more clear .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

18. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

19. yeah the whole politically correct culture is pissing me off . and i think it ' s really a small group of people claiming to be offended . seems like outrage is like a currency these days .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

20. haha ! so we are quite the opposite ! i always wear jogging pants and stupid ass t  shirts that say something like nanana boo boo stick your head in doo  doo . i try to go for the slavic style so i can blend in with all the polish and russian people in my area . hell even my car when i hit the throttle it will have diesel fumes in the entire street . i try to give more gas when i see mom ' s with strollers so the diesel will inject their bodies with microparticles . i dislike my family and will never go to " social occasions " but to really give an answer on your question . don ' t get caught in the first place ! watch every law and order episode . and one day you think to yourself he this is pretty easy .
