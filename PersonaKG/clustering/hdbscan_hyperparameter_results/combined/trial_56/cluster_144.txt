8. well i always walk into a room with my head held high and with purpose so i start off looking like i belong  have confidence . really watch how you present yourself , use your body language to exude confidence . one thing i try to do but is so hard is to make eye contact when speaking with others . when interacting with people , i try to stand still and not fidget with random shit like my hair , phone or whatever because that comes across as being anxious . one thing i do which isn  t the greatest is i act cocky and borderline conceded . it makes me feel better and people who know me know that i  m not being serious . but sometimes you really do start becoming this person you  re channeling .
