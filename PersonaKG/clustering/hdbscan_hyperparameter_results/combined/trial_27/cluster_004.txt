Total from this dataset: 11

1. i think a lot of people who are at that point don ' t think anybody cares to listen to them , and they have thought that for so long , that it is very hard to reach out to anybody
   (ID: 4d69affb6415148eda5d5103b282ce15476169d5)

2. i think you should correct your behaviour . if your first thought when something happens is " im completely faultless " and then after everyone else says you ' re the asshole you still seem to think you ' re in the right . yta taking out your anger on others and racist comments are never valid . dont kid yourself

3. oh i thought there was a different aspect too , where the more boxes you open he more likely you are to get a new brawler . i think that part applies to all rarities

5. just started my second year and my old friends ditched me cause the thought i was weird , and they didn  t have a good rep so people think i  m a douche
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

6. true at the time i didn ' t connect it , but afterwards i thought the same thing . he sort of just disappeared . the only other person i could think of being " the american " would be brenner , but i have my doubts about that .
   (ID: 36314aee005a03517f2446ec0da2834fe0f712d6)

7. wow . for some reason i thought i was trying to think of the digit year old virgin and can  t believe how far off i was .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

8. yeah , i thought as much , but my friends think otherwise .
   (ID: 75ca79d6c5cfc50533ff56cde25edfb593ae8568)

9. that ' s you being afraid because you are creating thoughts in your own head about things possibly going wrong . if you were to do any of those activities you mentioned and at any point during them something made you feel nervous or that something is wrong , it ' s your gut feeling . think of fear as a thought process and your gut feeling as a natural reaction .

10. yepp , i thought i just didn  t have the time or motivation to finish them but after the 5th drama i started seeing a trend . i think it also has to do with the fact that there wouldn  t be any more twists or plot development because the drama is essentially wrapping up . so subconsciously i don  t think i  m missing out on anything .
   (ID: 1f61921525978b0c5bcae6c0ab9c184a4d4c86a6)

11. sometimes when i look at a person with really skinny arms , i think about how easy it would be to break them . then i immediately cringe and my peepee shrinks back into itself because i can  t stand the sight  thought of broken bones . seriously , why fuck do i think of these things ?
