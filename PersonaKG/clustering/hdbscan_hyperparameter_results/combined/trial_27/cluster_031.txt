   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

2. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

3. do you think he supports negligent homicide investigations for miscarriages ? either a fetus is a person , or it isn ' t  if you push hard enough , i bet you ' ll find that ryan ' s beliefs have the same inconsistencies as most republicans . it ' s not about preserving life . it ' s about punishing sluts .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

4. are you suggesting euthanizing all the animals that belong to the unemployed ? what would happen in reality to those animals if the panhandler gave them up ? do you really think they ' ll be adopted by a rich and loving family ?
   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

5. thanks for sharing what you think ! when i get the courage to come out i ' ll keep this in mind !
   (ID: fd9a89336fd3cad9dd1a173e01055683165a532e)

6. jack handey v  o  if you ' re in a war , instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy , throw one of those small pumpkins . maybe it ' ll make everyone think how stupid war is , and while they are thinking , you can throw a real grenade at them .
   (ID: 2988ee1cd7a2bcf8e2d215c795ee2d06a985665a)

7. i never understand what people think will happen if lowe is gone . i ' ll answer that question , nothing . nothing will happen good or bad .
   (ID: e3a37ef234435ebde735894f98de2b3f90e3bbe9)

8. i think it ' s because half the time you keep talking to the wrong end . pick the side that ' s not blowing hot air , and you ' ll have a good conversation . if you do pick the wrong side , run , for it will soon be smelly .
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

9. i also care . think of all the people he ' ll be having a conversation with whose eyes will lock on , realize what they ' re seeing , and wish it were a boob . those are precious microseconds of their lives that none of these suckers will get back .
   (ID: dc123ff47fa4f2e85bbecd444342fe7d8fcb7db5)

10. do you think he  ll go anyway ? no matter how you feel about it
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

11. glad we ' re on the same page in this technological age i think more people are looking into names and most people will check what they mean , but they ' ll always be some .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

12. another good strategy is to have foreknowledge of whether or not they say " shoot " at the end of the phrase , and then do the opposite of what they do to disrupt the round to give them more time to think , and generally they ' ll not choose rock since they had to think for a longer period of time , and will digit  of the time choose scissor , allowing you to choose rock and beat them .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

13. i ' ll do you one better . what do you think ? but nobody ever asks how is you think .
   (ID: 1476398f6c778fb461539e3f78b07720d4ceee83)

14. the book is pretty cool , some good tips and a good little side story , don  t think it  ll help you game any though but i think you  ll enjoy it
   (ID: a6171234e1a4ec65a39ad55aa0aa058eb98dff83)

15. i don ' t think you should feel embarrassed . as far as i understand , you didn ' t really have a choice back then and your friend will probably understand this . i think he ' ll mainly be glad you ' re doing fine now .
   (ID: bfc2e9a6e5f84327293fa1a1fd0287066782bcec)

16. i  m a big decepticon fan , and these guys are an inescapable purchase for me . even moreso because i  m in canada and the wait sucks , so i  ll go stateside for it online . one of the thing i think some people have overlooked is that since there are digit bots for devestator , in order to make the star math work , we see the firsts 4pt filler bots .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

17. i think as comments flow , you ' ll realise this may not be so much of an unpopular opinion . nevertheless i must say you articulate yourself well . a  from this stranger .
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

18. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

19. no clue tbh , that stuff is really leathery but i dont think the sun ' ll be too kind on baby bruce there .
   (ID: 932561c7cc5f0c280d4b6b0c7824dbd5aed5f350)

20. i can draw pretty good i ' m my hand , so if i draw other stuff do you think they ' ll pass it off as one of my weird drawings ?
