1. i ' m sorry you hate dogs ? people coming together to save a life , or give more time , is somehow a bad thing because its not human life ? this makes zero sense to me . i know people who have spent just as much if not more on their pets . you do what you can for those you love .

4. lol . who ' s trying to save face . my original post was not meant to be taken seriously . other people understood that , or were less inclined to jump into a discussion with the " i know something about something obvious to anyone with a high school education   so let me ' correct ' you " vibe we all love so much around here . you also clearly didn ' t read the thread .

5. im a male and ladies if i am wrong please let me know . their dog will be there when you cheat , lie , and steal . their dog will love them on their darkest and brightest days . their dog will be by their side no matter what . a large number of the male population cant even accomplish one of those sentences that a dog can do without trying . does this make them  obsessed  ? nope . it merely shows their loyalty to those who are loyal to them .

6. it ' s just that you refused to address my points or say anything but lol you are stupid , since you are so far beneath me and you lack the intellectual capacity for rational discussion i have moved on to doing something better with my time . you know it as well as i do that socialism will when you ' re watching it happen on tv every day and you ' re burned up with impotent rage . i don ' t give a shit what you say about me because i have people in my life who actually love me and care about me unlike trump supporters who are disowned by their own children do to how awful they are .

7. and there ' s no reason for them to not understand it , they just mentally disconnect . ask if they know what a penpal is , they say yes . ask them if it ' s possible to fall in love with a penpal , they say yes . ask them to imagine having a penpal over the internet , they can handle that too . but ask them to imagine falling in love with an internet penpal , and suddenly they don ' t know left from right .

   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

9. oh yeah , stay hard at the idea of physically assaulting someone because you  re too much of an idiot to adequately represent yourself in an argument you placed yourself in but know nothing about . suck a dick you fucking lame ass poser . lol . i encourage you to seek me out . i always love watching keyboard warriors picking up their teeth .

10. relax and remember she is a little girl . you are supposed to love her , but not in that way . know that if you had tried anything , it could crush your family . relationships will break apart . your family will grow distant . your parents would be shattered . your sister would be scarred forever . as an older brother , please try to remember the role you are meant to play in her life and try to forget any thoughts you have about her .

11. i would say make it so that the readers know why he ' s doing it . what ' s driving him ? for relatable . but personally , i would love to read about a character on their way to their first victory . so yeah i ' d say that ' s brilliant .
   (ID: 79fc72ea72532d39a039ecb4e47a630a601ff4a8)

12. you know what , i  m gonna play devils advocate here and say if you really truly genuinely mean it and are willing to face the repercussions , say  in love with  . saying  i love      is thrown around far too much and has started to lose meaning
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

13. used to love watching epic rap battles . i don ' t even really know what i ' m looking for . i just know there ' s a lot of channels out there that don ' t get much exposure but have epic content . that ' s kinda what i ' m looking for .
   (ID: 52a73bb08e8d0c340dad3146d5a3b7b25137dfae)

14. cue the " lucid dreams " song y ' know , the one that goes " i still see your shadows in my room " " can ' t take back the love that i gave you "
   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

15. thank you , i just find it to be quite logical honestly . checking yourself in the best way you know will work to see if it ' s worth the wait , if your results were different emotionally you would know not to waste your and your so ' s time , which is better than starting the official relationship just for you to find out you don ' t really love her , now that ' s fucked up . goodluck with whatever you decide !

17. yall , vent about the stuff that makes you angry or anything to someone or to a journal listen to music take a shower jack off go for a run sign up for a boxing class where your punches are practices in a safe way don  t know if that sentence makes sense but i  m lazy but for the love of god don  t hurt yourself and don  t yell at anyone who doesn  t  deserve that just makes you a dick no matter how angry , also yes punching wood counts as hurting yourself
