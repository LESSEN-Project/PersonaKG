   (ID: de0709ad19c458ffff0b96aab8fcfa9c40b24603)

2. thanks for the calm response ! i was half expecting much worse ! i think that people quitting when they ' re about to get interrogated is bad , but i wouldn ' t exactly describe it as cheating . does that make sense ? if it was in my hands obviously not but just in theory i ' d probably give disconnecting on purpose from a match regardless manually not alt  f4 as that could cause issues with crashes a temp ban .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

3. i just don ' t see how you are allowing yourself to go through the torture of bible camp . maybe you don ' t think it so bad , but i cringe of the even thinking about being forced to go to a place where i ' m surrounded by people who have completely different ideologies as i .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

4. no . i meant the gap between the back of her ears and her head . i was just trying to think of the weirdest place you could stick your dick on a person .
   (ID: 7a396588993d687f5528f10b200dc9d6db769270)

5. to answer you directly . i think no . just get gifted the money and you do the paying of debt .
   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)

6. i don ' t think there is any " one " for us . i think there are many potential people for all of us . if we just spend our lives bettering ourselves , being alert yet patient , we will find happiness . in ourselves and in someone else , if we so desire . all will work out . red  heart my two cents .
   (ID: 445ba4596e4bcff0c96b23f038cf784185970198)

7. i don ' t really think you can call it the type of thing that " just happens "
   (ID: 5218a6fd3b7d990775fbaa39249c20beea16f741)

8. i don  t think they are ugly , i just think it  s interesting to see something marked on someone and think what was the motive behind the tattoo and what  s the story .
   (ID: c5e877ff3be5d3571f5fe899f55887a6f608ee98)

9. shadow assault is unquestionably the least desirable . it ' s not a ' bad ' , heroic in reality , vp is just fantastic . most of the other less than desirable heroics i can think of niche use for , but that ' s the most difficult one . the other two that come to mind are rain of chaos which is decent for zoning during a push , and mind control can be used for picks in some cases . i wouldn ' t recommend picking them most of the time , but you can come up with situations where they are pretty decent . abby ' s construct blanking out on the name , is good and bad in so far that if not stopped it can do a lot of damage . it limits his team  fight potential though , so unless your team can compensate in some other ways it can be difficult to use properly . it has high potential though , and under the right circumstances is arguably superior .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

10. i just think these videos don ' t need a story line , i don ' t care about the eggs or anything else apart from the bit we all came to see .
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

11. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

12. i think you ' re good as you are . never listen to these negative people , just ignore them . your hair looks pretty nurtured  normal , and your breasts might be smaller but that is completely okay , there is nothing wrong with you ma ' am !
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

13. if there ' s nothing i can do , i just think .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

14. i think it ' s normal that he should be the last one to leave the ship because the other are under his responsable si obviously he has a big big risk to go down with the ship . but the tradition of going down with it just for the principle just by honor or symbolism or whatever is really weird and stupid to my opinion but yes the valors in our time are very different than the ones at the time of the tradition so .
   (ID: a74790331386859adbbd886bd045a7391e95948c)

15. i think this is so amusing just because it doesn  t require physical exertion . actually having to do it isn  t entertaining whatsoever .
   (ID: 5b59b30ecdf3a93e4634d1600b3020fd8e9dc7e2)

16. just when you think it ' s gone you hear the eeeeeee .
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

17. while you are correct that i lack empathy , i am not a  nice guy  at all . just courteous . i don  t understand people who aren  t . and aren  t you a dude ? didn  t you just ask me if i smile at dudes in public too ? i give basically anyone who makes eye contact with me a quick smile . if they don  t return it , fine . if they actively attempt to be nasty back , i think they have some kind of problem . regardless of gender .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

18. i get that i ' m just saying in this specific case i don ' t think he has anything to worry about legally . but yes good points . edit it would still be a good idea to get command consent though could get njp .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

19. i think we need to stop this silly gossip . bruce wayne is a very respectable and charitable man around here , we keep these rumors up he may just pack up and leave .
   (ID: b22d67acc81c3e3bf700f9a159ec06062eb72fd2)

20. there ' s a reason " corporate drone " is a saying . eyes forward , yes sir . just shut off everything but your brain ' s section that stops you from telling people what you really think of them .
