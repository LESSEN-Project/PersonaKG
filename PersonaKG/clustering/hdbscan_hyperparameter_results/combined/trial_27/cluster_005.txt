1. that ' s good ! when i say as an avid moviegoer , i mean that the encroaching on space maneuver would annoy me even if it was an agreed upon date just because it can be distracting  if i go to the movies , i want to watch the movie . but i ' m glad he ' s found someone . he can ' t be faulted for explicitly being told it was a date . the virtue of it being valentine ' s day though isn ' t a defense i would hold up in court though . how did you end up liking deadpool ? did you see the second one ? do you have any thoughts about once upon a deadpool ?

4. i left months ago . i did it because my ex and i broke up and i didnt need to keep creeping on her social media . but also because i was noticing how much pointless bs people post on them . i didnt want to be doing the same thing , especially when no one really cares anyways .

5. what medium ? their website , that they own ? or the internet as a whole ? if it ' s the latter , then you grossly overestimate the reach of facebook . if it ' s the former , then you grossly misunderstand the meaning of private property . as for banning bernie sanders posts , they would have every right to do so . and if they banned trump , the same . or if they banned discussions about nascar or bob ross or apollo digit or star wars or anything else . facebook is not yours . you do not own it , nor do your opinions much matter to them . why ? because you are not the customer . the advertisers and shareholders are the customers . you and i ? we are an item on a shelf . our value ? the information we freely provide them that they then sell . why did they ban gun sales ? liability . if a madman buys a gun over facebook and shoots up a building , then the government will crawl so far up facebook ' s collective anus that they will be poking mark zuckerberg ' s brain stem . that is the last thing they want , so they are covering their asses preemptively .
