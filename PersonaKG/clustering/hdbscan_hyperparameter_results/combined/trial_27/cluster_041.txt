2. don ' t appease her for risk of breaking your lens , shes just being uncanny . let her come around , , , dont fold my guy its not worth damaging your lens . let her be passive , but when she comes around hold to your strong points you have in why you refuse to use it . but you realllllly shit the bed by using the word psycho ahahaha i mean like , its like if the story of rosa parks went way south ? like if people didnt have none of that sitting down shit . well , you just did that . ahah she will show you psycho now that you called her out . best wishes on that part .

3. i ' m just hating on the shows direction . they definitely took a lot of wrong turns and just did whatever made them famous for the time being . kill la kill made by the same studio was made better . i dislike that you like the show . but it ' s a cool tattoo

4. nothing ' s wrong with having a preference . i prefer neat myself . that ' s fine . but did you notice how i used the term ' really matters '  like  not just ' kind of matters '  more like ' important ' . sometimes you can misread the thrust of a post if you just skim  read it .

5. what do you mean by  backward  do you mean developing country because of so than this comparison wouldn  t make sense . also if you mean hostile country then your comparison also wouldn  t work because the british and french before the outbreak of ww2 were like  hey germany let  s just settle down now okay like you can take that but no more  and how did that work out ?

6. yup . today my extremely smart and logical mom said that maybe comey isn ' t as clean as he looks . she sent me an article that talked about how he didn ' t take notes during a digit hour clinton interview or something . i told her so what ? he said he didn ' t take notes except for unusual situations and trump put him in an inappropriate situation . i ' m finding one of the problems is that she knows how to use snopes to see through fake news , but a lot of this stuff isn ' t fake , it ' s just biased so much that it ' s lost all sense in reality . did comey attend a digit hour clinton interview and not take notes ? probably . does that mean he ' s not clean ? i don ' t understand where an idea like that would even come from . they just say the magic word " clinton " and all of a sudden any kind of association becomes magically worse than trump . i don ' t even particularly like clinton but the amount of hatred for her is insane .

7. i dunno why but i feel like when it came to naming these animals the people who did it had gotten bored and just went for the first suggestion .

8. ive been there man . several times . you get over it and you move on just as i did . i remember counting digit years with an ex and being like  wow  . i  m now with a girl and we have digit beautiful children together and its been nearly digit years .

9. you have every good reason to be annoyed and uncomfortable . on the other hand people have their preferences and we are led to believe those shouldn ' t include overweight people . so it is possible they just didn ' t have enough self respect to ask you out before if they did like you . i once had someone relay a message about me " she ' s smart and funny , too bad she ' s fat . the great thing is that i won ' t always be fat but the dude who said it will always be an ugly block head

10. but then you would just get people complaining about " waaa why don ' t you tell us how you are fixing the tracker , what are you doing about rural areas , what did you have for lunch " like we do now . that simple tweet would not appease anyone .

11. we must not be talking about the same deku . why does he like bakugo ? they are childhood friends . too unrealistic ? you can believe that a dude ' s sweat can cause explosion but having deku be too forgiving is unrealistic , yeah ok . risking his life to save other ' s ? bro did you not see episode digit , " my body just moved ? deku at his core puts others before himself , thats the reason why all might chose him .   x200b

12. i just said i like that term , how did you understood that as talking shit ?

13. i was just talking to my therapist about this . when you have the ability to do this and still get a ' s , it makes it hard to even be proud of the work you did . because it was so " easy " , and you receive high marks , it feels like false praise . it ' s a totally weird feeling . best of luck to you .

14. juul , the amount of kids im friends with who all regret it a month afterwards is just insane like you knew the risks why did you even start to begin with
