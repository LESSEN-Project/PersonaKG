1. i do not know how it would ever comes it with out some sort of lame humble brag from the casual braile reader . then i ' d be like " either this weirdo is into blindies or they somehow think this will get them laid . either way this is the last christmas party i ' m inviting them to . " yeah , i ' m a bit of a hardass .

2. btw , do you know any animes like nhk ? i mean , not necessarily it should be about hikikomori , but with similar psychological context that makes you think " wtf am i doing with my life " or something like that .  .

3. i think i ' m the only who is experiencing a situation where lately the servers which i play on i ' m from india btw have like digit or digit snipers and they alone obliterate my entire team landing perfect headshots or body shots . it ' s really discouraging to play tf2 lately when you know there ' s a sniper out there waiting for your head or body to pop up right out of the corner

4. i do not believe in the anthropomorphic view of god . i think that everything has a reason and the reason that the universe exists is god , but that god is likely nothing like what we could imagine , that it doesn  t listen to our prayers , and that there is likely no afterlife . perhaps god resides within the universal constants or something completely whacky compared to established religions . so theres a lot i don  t know or have an answer to , but i do think there is a reason that everything exists and that is what i believe . although i am hopeful that i am wrong and that there is an afterlife and some spirit in the sky that cares about us simply because its a lot less bleak then simply dying and decaying . i also have a lot if respect for the culture and morals that religions establish

6. what the hell are you even talking about ? i  outed myself  ? my comment about democrats was part of a response to someone maybe you , i can  t be bothered to go back and verify user names saying something like  spotted the trumptard  to me . there were other comments between those , but that  s the main premise . is the main point of your comment to basically say  hey , twist  digit is a republican !  ? because if that  s the case , you  re wrong . my original comment was to voice my opinion that kaepernick isn  t talented enough to ignore the media circus he brings with him . why you  re making it out to be more than that is fucking beyond me . also , i don  t know why you think i  m going to delete any of this . i stand by everything i said , kaepernick isn  t a great quarterback and he isn  t worth the media circus .

7. you are absolutely right . the question should not have been asked , but it was . it was asked to trump . you are not going to see questions like this one asked to hillary , bernie , or cruz . the media only targets trump with these questions because they know a lot of people after hearing the answer will get emotionally irrational and start hating trump even more . think about it for a second , if i hadn ' t commented to your post you might end up walking away from all this actually thinking that trump wants to throw into prison those who get abortions .

8. what makes you think i might not already have ? the dt should not be compelled to post the images , fine , but you either do or do not . all it takes is a few seconds to unblur that ridiculous compromise they went for . it makes as much sense as censoring swear words with asterisks and grawlixes , we all know what they are , don ' t treat all of us like children .

9. i think it ' s because people don ' t know themselves well enough before committing to a relationship . whatever they think they like about someone might turn out , over however many weeks or months or years the relationship develops , into incorrect assumptions , both about who their partner is , and who they themselves are . this could explain why many marriages among younger couples end in divorce , they might still be in the process of developing who they are as individuals and might literally become a different person through the ups and downs of various relationships .

10. how do you deal with people like that ? i struggle with people already but when it ' s someone either not listening or think they know better i end up snapping at them

11. i drew this in about an hour . i drew a background as well , but didn  t shade it in or bold the lines because i didn  t know if i would even like the finished product . what do you think of it so far ?

12. in a month i  m going to be a groomsman for my beast mate who is marrying my high school sweetheart , who broke my heart  i couldn  t be happier to know that i have been on this journey with both of them for almost digit years . so yes i think about her , and i think about how lucky i am to have her as a friend . you know who i do think about  the ones that there we something that i never pursued . they appear like flashes , the moment when i should have kissed them etc .

13. interesting . but i think the ' exposing to everyone ' sounds like kind of a mean threat that would cause more drama . but i wouldn ' t know .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

14. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?

15. i didn ' t know about the ice cap thing you mentioned , but i feel like governments should do what they can to try to minimize it , i think that we should work towards developing a way to harness fusion power and attempt to proliferate that around the world and that would solve nearly all of our energy problems and it wouldn ' t polute
