3. conspiracy theories . it ' s not as much a new trend , as one that has been blown up by every lunatic with a stray thought having ready access to millions of other lunatics . it ' s been my experience that two people can ' t keep a secret about where they ' re going that evening , much less god knows how many people keeping a secret like a fake moon landing , or wtc , or sandy hook , or all the other idiocies that abound .

4. the problem with dr . manhattan in injustice is the fact that first of all he has no  fighting  moves . he waves his hands or thinks of something and that  s that . secondly , dr . manhattan is seriously powerful . like , digit times more powerful than superman . he can literally have a thought and it can happen . anyone who fought him could be instantly destroyed without a battle . i personally would prefer rorschach over dr . manhattan as he is much more of a brawler and i believe he is a better fit for the game .
