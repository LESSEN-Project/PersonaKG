1. not everyone is created equally , that includes the mind . it  s just very sad , above everything else . you never really know what it  s like to have another person  s experience of life .

2. i completely understand . i just imagine my inner meaner as something ridiculous or someone i disrespect  don ' t like so i can tell it as sassily as possible to shut up . sometimes goals take time . its important to remember that no matter how smol the steps are , you are taking them one day at a time , and it should be celebrated . you will get there ! i know it ! just hug your stuffies and dream big lovely  digit

3. i know what you mean . as i said you really have to be disciplined when flying this plane . one false movement and you are dead . i somehow find it enjoyable . i just like the look of it and what its capable of but it is not an easy plane to fly by any means .

4. why are you assuming you are being friendzoned ? i mean you seem to be just friends at this stage . she hasn ' t rejected you , so you are not really " friendzoned . it ' s a bit hard to know if she likes you or not from what you have described . just be yourself and don ' t go in with the expectation of wanting her to like you because you are nice to her . dont assume anything , ever ! good luck !

5. if you ' re talking to a doctor about this then my input is completely invalid . of course go with your doctors advice and ignore the internet . always a good method . the reason why bitcoin is dangerous is that it is designed to be untraceable . in a technical sense it is not purely anonymous but it in a realistic sense it is entirely anonymous . you have no method at all of knowing who you are really sending money to . it is also irreversible . there is no way of demanding a refund if you do not know who you sent the money to . the technology of bitcoin does not include a " charge back " or refund feature like a credit card does . if you use paypal or a credit card , yes you can still get scammed , but you at least have a paper trail leading to whoever scammed you . also most credit cards and paypal have a dispute resolution mechanism so that if you do get scammed you at least have some method of recourse . the major reason why it ' s a red flag is that if someone only accepts bitcoin then it screams " this is not a legitimate business " because they are choosing to only engage in untraceable transaction . some people are just like this . so it ' s not an automatic " you are being scammed " , it ' s just a red flag . some people simply like bitcoin and maybe that ' s all this is . but it is suspicious . if you ' re only spending  digit then what the hell , right ? at least you get to learn how to use bitcoin . coinbase simplifies bitcoin for you . it is bitcoin " easy mode . you don ' t need to be aware of what the hell the blockchain is or even what a wallet is . you can conceptualize it as simply an online bank account but the currency is bitcoin .

6. yeah i get what you ' re talking about that ' s just how it goes . theres actually a commendation if you can capture all the control points and hold them at the same time , you can also fast travel to main missions , i know it sucks and i get what you mean it ' s annoying to run ecerywhere . i dont remember if you can do it at wt2 , but theres usually little " activites " close to the control points like a propaganda broadcast , or a hostage situation or whatever and if you go do those before the control point it will raise the alert level of the control point which in turn gives you better stuff and gives you a chance to unlock other mods .

7. luckily i haven ' t , and i pray that day never comes . just like my other " gun , " i don ' t pull it out unless i know i ' m gonna use it .

8. sorry but i know nothing about modding . do rtdl emulations exist already ? and if so are they laggy like you said ? or is it just laggy when trying to mod ? anyway , keep up the cool work !

9. my mom ' s exactly the same way , it ' s like she ' s in a cult . and she ' s not even a fan of trump , she just is against abortion and hillary clinton . today she said " well if they aren ' t vetting people and that happens he has a point . there should be middle ground happening here " i told her they are vetting people . in the past she ' s said that " obama likes muslims too much " and i ' m like " where the heck are you even getting that " i told her there ' s absolutely no policy that i know of that showed obama liked muslims a lot . she ' s a very intelligent person , kind hearted and not racist towards anyone and to hear her make a statement that the previous potus liked muslims too much without any kind of facts to back it up really disturbed me .

10. hate is such a strong word . let ' s say i just don ' t know you well enough to say i like you .
   (ID: 3de4b885645ecd39fdcb6a1daf410341eb118d2c)

11. yes , xhaka needs to go . and , yes , someone must take the blame finally . because with that kind of attitude we would have been sparred at least of some of those pathetic blunders . make a blunder like that just because you are not fully concentrated and you will be dropped . period . they know everything is fine whatever they do and that is mental edge our players are lacking for years and years .
   (ID: a7aa6341e1b57ce267a054932c0fecc933562532)

12. i don ' t even know what to say , like do you drink wine and read books all day explain please cause being in france on holiday and try to get someone to speak english is impossible just because they refuse it ? i myself prefer the very down to earth , high all day on herbs  tea mess around with chemicals dutch lifestyle .

13. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

14. you know what , i try to fucking talk to you like a normal human being , and what do you do ? well , i don ' t wanna say because it will just encourage you to partake in your sick practices even more . so why don ' t you do us all a favor , and fuck off !
   (ID: 6692d386ab188df76448f18f0e9d59c1e6d88c50)

15. i ' m anxious too and that would bring me super down . are those guys average looking or extra attractive ? it seems like a lot of work to have someone come over for sex and do an oh hell no rather than just getting off . not that that ' s a good thing per se but at least you wouldn ' t know . i ' d try and give you my honest opinion but i might be too nice to do so .
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

16. my brother found something and didn  t know what it was so i made a reddit account so i could post it on whatisthisthing and for the longest time i just checked that sub to see what random stuff people found lol . i use it more than any other social media now and i really enjoy reddit even though i still feel like a newb sometimes .
   (ID: b40d1d3ae1e77bcbdcb98e62deea24396d4b4d40)

17. that i do care that they eat meat but i don ' t tell them because i know it ' s not my place , just as its not their place to tell me what i eat . also , please don ' t feel like my food choices limit you to where we can eat  there is always something on every menu for me .
   (ID: 8797828a745ecd521e3b219ff004d26777b4f4f7)

18. twas a joke my man seriously speaking , that ' s just the way the world is right now . i ' d say every human being that is breathing right know is depressed , but on different levels and degrees . teenagers are a fucking mess . it ' s not weird for thing like these to happen
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

19. smoke . it ' s the weirdest habit and stupidly tough to quit . i know i just sound like a boring moaning guy but i always tell kids to never start it . don ' t even try it . after digit years of being a smoker it took a lot of effort to cut it out .
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

20. i can  t be the only one who wants to know who the hell they ate and also does anybody actually like this crap or is this just a huge troll
