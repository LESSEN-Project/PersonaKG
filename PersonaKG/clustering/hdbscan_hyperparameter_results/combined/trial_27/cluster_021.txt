1. ok love . how about the cathedral in naples which holds a vial of blood from an early christian martyr , st . januarius . reportedly , the blood is dry most of the year , but mysteriously liquefies three times throughout the year , on days commemorating his life and impact . i think that one would be testable ?
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

2. literally anything by frank ocean does . makes me think of the love life i never had
   (ID: ab5524e568131ce7cb4db227daae4d0f489838e1)

3. i think it ' s a bit soon to start looking for a label on this . give it another month of nonchalant behavior . if you still feel this madly in love for her bring it up to her then . i ' m fearful that if you ask her now what you two are that this may drive her away from you because it could come across as weakness . be an independent man and do your thing . quit being so clingy already .
   (ID: 8f33db98a9fa29c8f9e44012d79de72291a29519)

4. you are actually right but i think fumino doesn ' t fit that first girl image completely because most of the first girls usually harsh against mc and a bit annoying . fumino is pure and kind  hearted , not harsh to mc . it doesn ' t matter if mafuyu wins imo , i love both of them . thanks for your opinion .
   (ID: c41e4affc406bbc71e6c12aabf095d759b6dbec2)

5. i think the trash wheel and water shark are symptoms of a larger issue we love to ignore . when was the last time you saw a cop write a ticket to someone throwing trash out the window ? yea me neither .
   (ID: 4ad10ae12cb226893a0aec21cddd0e791f57ede2)

6. i think what  s happening is now everyone knows about the show so the typical applicant might br madly in desire of their digit minutes rather than madly in love . collateral damage is what worries me . there are people who would do whatever necessary to get on tv etc , when the shows  s over , their spouse and new families might be over too .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

7. is there something wrong with loving back pets that show you their unconditional love ? what on earth do you think it has to do with being american ?
   (ID: 514a3ecd0d04716c9225352c4a3a5d5424dd8056)

8. why do you think we do ? i love my independent woman and am not threatened at all .
   (ID: 4520a5ba79e39385d988ada973bf675eafa2fc5b)

9. animal abuse , because if you think its ok to do it you will get murdered within digit week . note  i love animals
