1. thanks for your comments , no worries at all , i appreciate your question a lot . in many ways , yes i " thank " myself for my life , in the sense that i respect myself and want to live my best life . as such , i have made good decisions , chosen my friends well and am surrounded by good people because i chose that for myself . but my gratitude goes beyond myself and those around me .

2. the people you ' re dating aren ' t worthwhile if they don ' t get tested . most seem to be willing to get tested and share asap . also , i live in a pretty liberal place where most seem aware that having an sti or getting tested is not a character indictment . male or female and dating online put in your profile you want to see recent results . no matter your gender or how you meet share that you need to see that .
