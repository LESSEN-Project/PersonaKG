1. did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise ? i thought not . it ' s not a story the jedi would tell you . it ' s a sith legend . darth plagueis was a dark lord of the sith , so powerful and so wise he could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create life  he had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying . the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural . he became so powerful  the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power , which eventually , of course , he did . unfortunately , he taught his apprentice everything he knew , then his apprentice killed him in his sleep . ironic . he could save others from death , but not himself .
