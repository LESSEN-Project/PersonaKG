1. i can understand why you ' re uncomfortable but i think the term rape gets thrown around too much sometimes and this is one of the times . would this have been such an issue of he didn ' t cum in you this time and just did what he normally would do ? i think the issue is more of him just not being careful about pregnancy not about the sex itself right ?

2. what actually happens if they think the way they did ? i mean yeah in some cases like at work , you should care what people think . but most of the time it just causes unnecessary anxiety with no real effect

3. and why should people listen to you instead of basically anybody else ?  your basic dumbed  down quests that a monkey could do after reading your post i would think this is just your speed . i appreciate you trying to punch up and take on monkeys , but what did they ever do to you ?

5. i think it would be cringy , they might be able to make it m if they just did a bunch of really dark hive stuff , but gore and language isn  t always good .

6. do you realize what day and age this is ? did you just get from , like , digit years in the future , where it ' s some utopia , and you ' re surprised that this sort of thing doesn ' t get the attention and reform it deserves , or something ? yes . we call the future europe .  if you disagree , we ' re literally going to have to break down the semantics of " intent " so that you can understand . yes , i do disagree . let ' s break down the semantics of intent . according to the oxford dictionary , " intent " means intention or purpose . purpose in turn is " a particular requirement or consideration , typically one that is temporary or restricted in scope or extent  " i think that fits rather well .

7. you fucking did a discrimination ! and wait , kid ? say it to yourself motherfucker , do you think you ' re mature when you said something like that ? and better get life rather than visiting subs you ' re not subscribing to , just to spread the hateful soul in you . better find your life , unemployed jerk !

8. my duo is incredibly good on combat pro , and id say he is better than me on builder pro . you just need to adapt to combat like he did , he pretty much knows by nature what buttons to press . usually on cp players tend to misbuild and panic . i can say you do definitely make less mistakes on bp . if you think your building is good just work on your aim . being the best builder doesn  t mean you are the best player

10. i think the worst part for me was afterwards . i was left wondering what i did wrong , and why i wasn ' t good enough . the important thing to remember is that you ' re not responsible for other people ' s actions , and some people just suck .

11. awww , did your mommy come into the store and embarrass you in front of the hot girl works as a cashier digit checkout lanes down . you ' re right , living through that ordeal deserves just as much respect as dying for your country . turn off your computer , i think it ' s past your bedtime .
