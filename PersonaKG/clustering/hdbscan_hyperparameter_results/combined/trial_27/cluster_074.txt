--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 37

1. i ' ve seen lots of cover  ups , but this video is new to me ! i do intend on getting a sleeve someday when i have the money to do so . some of these people incorporate the scar as part of the art , but i would rather just totally obscure that there ' s even tattoos there . i have keloids on my leg though , which are harder to cover . still thinking about what to do with those
   (ID: 43a6fe9c16d7a48abeb6832518a650a445974a7e)

2. what i ' ve always heard isn ' t that the digit , digit is a literal number of beta access or vip access . it was equivalent in the time the book was written to saying a zillion . just with extra meaning . digit tribes of israel , squared , times digit so a lot .
   (ID: aac80ac9ebef70ab8fe6bc14a8fcccb472099b84)

3. not that i ' ve ever heard , this is just bizarre . it could just be an excuse to leave faster , if they don ' t get along  he doesn ' t get along with your brother . sounds super weird .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

4. i grew up on a pig farm . my chores when i was digit were harder work than any job that i  ve ever had as an adult . pig farms are highly sustainable because they can eat just about anything , including communists . if the shit were to hit the fan , that  s exactly what i  d feed them . this guy !
   (ID: afb309c0f8d875957ab1e2c406a762b6127668b6)

5. thats what i ' ve been trying to tell people , except the op part . i mean 1shot kill within digit meter ? well i gladly take that in exchange for bipod ads and slow . also , all this time sniper can just digit shot you because of attrition lol .
   (ID: cd4ad4cc67fcfb39fcb1f11e52709d863f1c0215)

6. answered just the way it was asked . mom ' s been on different kinds of shit for awhile . last i heard she picked up a meth habit since my brother is out of the house now . i ' ve been no contact with the family .
   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

7. i  ve been engineering for years and it still happens every now and then . you just realize it faster . this is how you learn .
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

8. i ' ve noticed a couple people pulling more dps but for the most part hasnt made a huge stink . i play a prot warrior and i was expecting alot of change due to the rage nerf but im just as tanky as ever . just made me change the way i play to be more patient .
   (ID: 45768598053a5b3cdf1e6e286b99114b7acf5f3c)

9. it ' s boring , boring . served with a side order of boring . the stuff you ' ve included , involves too much , about your job , and not enough about you . get rid of your , you should message me section , it ' s just bad on a lot of levels " a nice guy in a stable job ! you should also include better photos . and smile . that half  smirk  smile thing , never really works , unless you ' re a super villain . the scuba pic is good , but a bit grainy . try to find some friends who will take your pix . outside of work .
   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

10. rip but that  s okay , my advice is have a look into some business . not school business but just start making something and selling it . i am now digit and when i was digit i managed to make myself  digit within a year making and selling protein balls . i  ve only stopped since cause i paralysed myself and been busy and exhausted to do it .
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

11. i ' ve heard it helps to start cleaning up something small , and then grow from that . even if it ' s just putting a fork into a drawer , it ' s important to start somewhere .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

12. it ' s a text message . if it was urgent , you should ' ve called , imo . we ' re all adults and we ' re busy living our lives . a text message just frankly isn ' t a priority .
   (ID: 5a15ed606a86674cb48abaf9fee4375ff6bbff09)

13. i gotta be honest , i ' ve spent way too much time on this on the past and mentally still assumed it ' s digit in digit odds . somehow i always just overlook the assumption that the host will always open a door with a goat behind . guess just my own fault for overlooking that detail
   (ID: 1cf567904675ac1ca7b5a90612e5479a5b6c9bef)

14. if the only reason you can find for still doing something partners included is that you  ve been doing it so long why stop now ? just try to stop and move on . it  s most likely just holding you hostage with your on sentimental emotions .
   (ID: 411b23f3d2a1f254c1c92c17670bb02c191a1301)

15. be me , digit year old mexi boy , scared and tired of what i ' ve just learned my body could do . ' twas noon and the wall seemed hot . so yeah a wall .
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

16. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

17. you could ' ve just made it into multiple pannels , that would have made it easier to read
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

18. in watching my replays over this past year i ' ve noticed that for some reason a good amount of people seem to only press one button per input . i laugh at those people . i laugh at them because only an insane person would put even an ounce of faith in this game when it comes to online connections . if you ' re doing locals than you ' re gonna have to play like that or at least you ' d find some benefit to it . but online you ' re not only fighting your opponent but you ' re also fighting the connection . at any moment some frames could drop and completely cancel out your single button press . at the very least you should double tap or triple tap everything you ' re doing . triple may be too much in some situations on some characters but double tapping seems to be pretty solid on everyone in this game aside from the few digit hit combos in this game but you won ' t even be able to do those reliably online even if your execution is perfect anyway . tl  dr mashing  bad , just relax , it ' s just a game . the more knowledge you have the more confident you can be in your play . however , if you ' re playing anything other than at your locals , double tap that shit . don ' t trust this games online connection with your lp . it will leave you a rookie for the rest of your life .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)

19. my son and i have been talking about a lego harry potter night ! you ' ve just motivated us to make it happen this weekend !
   (ID: 1b15fd08311192b471933a314f66dc758a923c02)

20. most guys just go for it . if your super uneasy you can ask her first . i ' ve been asked before , it ' s not a total killer either . don ' t worry if it ' s not perfect !
