   (ID: a18adc4ad3b28b34dfa3063a1c77566b8681a79d)

6. lived in a smaller town without very specialized care facilities because there just isn ' t enough demand in just one focus . friend was in rehab for his first long stay , for  i didn ' t ask and wouldn ' t tell the internet anyway  and another patient was making small talk and kept saying stuff . " you can ' t get addicted to this or that , or you cant have this sickness etc . " the staff can ' t really tell her how to make friends , so nothing got done until a veteran butted in . " hey , i ' m in here exclusively because i ' d rather literally do nothing , than eat or drink . stop telling people they can ' t figure their shit out and leave happier than you . " ' exclusively ' contextually so as to say no drugs , no addiction , no physical disease , its literally undeniably exclusively him as a person that shut them up for the rest of their stay . i use that all the time now " stop telling people they can ' t leave happier than you . "

7. the vampire diaries the first couple of seasons were great but then the storyline got all kinds of stupid , people just refused to die they ' d find some way to bring them back . disappointed because i loved that series at one point .
   (ID: 1f61921525978b0c5bcae6c0ab9c184a4d4c86a6)

8. yeah i checked his post history . kinda a attention whore but sometimes attention attracts people who will help . i had the same thing happen , depression is not fun . but i eventually got help and here i am . i can see your point but sometimes getting people upset just adds fuel to the fire .

10. maybe i am just bad at using them but my experience has been they don ' t help a lot with deer while bow hunting . if you can ' t get close with out one they are not a silver bullet for fixing bad sneaking , add to that they get caught on everything until you get used to moving in them and they get warm . that being said they are uncomfortably good for hiding from people . we had a rather large fellow bring his double xl curvy lady out to the woods for some public private time . they started getting undressed about digit feet from where my buddy and i where sitting in on a hill . they freaked out when we got up to walk away because , neither of us wanted to watch what was about to go down .

12. i was nearly going to leave my comment as " other than that " but i added " one event " to try and stop this sort of response coming . in no way am i saying that winning a major isn ' t much to do in a year all i ' m saying is to say he didn ' t have the best digit isn ' t wrong just because he got that event win .

14. id use google translate to speak mandarin so that a larger amount of people could hear me first and say " hey insert random name here stop doing that " and walk away with a smug look of success knowing that someone with that name just got pranked .
   (ID: 787f4a3fe31691883105c973a6b8e3df9df1436e)

   (ID: 01ce69fc209a030b404f270c5d5a650bbb706d87)

20. this one time me and two of my friends were all hanging out on a weekend off school . we went down to the basement of the place i was staying at , a little before noon to play horde mode on gears of war digit which had just come out a little while later we decided to come back up and see about ordering a pizza or something for dinner somehow it was digit  digit in the morning and we  d just completely lost track of time  there were no windows in the basement and no clocks , so when we were expecting to come up in time to see the sun getting low , we got hit with the really bright morning sun . all three of us just kinda went  oh damn it  s late  and wandered home
