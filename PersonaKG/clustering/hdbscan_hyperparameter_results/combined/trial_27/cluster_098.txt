1. hammers . you can just use other heavy stable things to bang nails into walls , it ' s not that serious
   (ID: 4f1b65a581332b9d19507ccf0e921d0967e013e7)

2. i highly recommend getting the nathan drake collection for ps4 that has the first digit games on it . you can decide for yourself which is your favorite but they all have a lot of great moments and it ' s worth playing from the start just to see how nate  elena met .
   (ID: a18adc4ad3b28b34dfa3063a1c77566b8681a79d)

3. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

4. oh , i agree they should probably return the items , but i ' m pointing out just how vulnerable these things can be in this world . it ' s a real concern .
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

5. fix the fear . they just have to be shown nothing is scary . good things should be happening . treats and whatnot .
   (ID: 23436d4a3b029dec718d52bd8f69b7b3bb78dd25)

6. i just recently began an unarmed playthrough on a kajiit . the unarmed damage is insane if you do things right , and it ' s lots of fun to use the wrestling move finishers . the youtube channel fudgemuppet has loads of ideas for new and interesting builds . i strongly suggest checking them out to find one that suits you .
   (ID: 0f8bca5cd80e9429ae58bb976857e3c5ab057290)

7. never cared to look into myself , people believe crazy things so i just figured there may have been some following behind it
   (ID: 89a759866debf6704efa0f603c1b9c4476abd731)

8. yea , i realize that , however , it was pounded into since i was digit . one of the few good things about my father is that he actually gave a damn about the environment . so little me was constantly told to sort the trash and whatnot . it ' s just something i never let go .
   (ID: 5ee4d4a98d2da62835d0e63abf8fe5bbfa95111b)

9. companies today are ruining the gaming industry by making low effort games , or just revamping a few things and calling it new
   (ID: 021c01b3e15fb3077444bd9abdbc0d7c390239b0)

10. nothing really . i was allowed to watch just about whatever and even if i was told not to , i would watch it anyway . i understood things a lot sooner than most kids as a result .
   (ID: 55510b17a4f0d7b5820e6f21287525ef6cd60994)

11. thanks a million ! just to pick your brain a little more , my flatmate has pokemon y , he told me there is a way to carry over stats when breeding . is this right . i may have misunderstood what he was saying though . edit  i am aware of nature and characteristics . but we were talking about defence stats and things .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

12. myself from the past . just to tell my self of the things that i shouldn ' t do
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

13. big baseball fan here  the scene in " digit " where the opposing manager is just giving it to jackie robinson , calling him all manner of horrible things .
   (ID: 2bb956084cb9bf79f58345d6cf6beca98e76bbb4)

14. so being playful is just a metaphor for doing things that is in your nature and not being afraid to go against social norms ? '
   (ID: 3e7b07ddd384cb288bc529e6aeb73f840aa5a294)

   (ID: 339d06087e421a1cf86d695af2a2088546f9dc91)

17. little house on the prarie , andy griffith show , the waltons . just regular good ol lessons about life . how that you have to struggle and suffer through things sometimes and not have anyone to ' save ' you . and you learn to be a better person because of it .
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

18. that ' s why when a couple of my friends do that all i say nowadays is " punching above your weight " and it gets a chuckle from those of us who see things in the way you just described .
   (ID: bf662bc559367d8b6475102fe891d5e4eb072ffd)

19. it ' s just a locker room . you are making things way more complicated than they should be
   (ID: bd005ac438966eb1f8d6de10fcb1bb6fd4565782)

20. no one is getting what i ' m saying tbh lol . people are just saying things without even reading descriptions on the game .
