1. don ' t work about it . that ' s pretty normal family stuff . also , it ' s normal to wake up during the night if you go to bed early . you ' ll fall back asleep . until then  there are plenty of pics of fireworks on reddit to look at ! be sure to have a look at sydney ' s fireworks . they accidentally put digit instead of digit ! imagine being that person .
   (ID: be9f60605270d73ac3a4e5b587575b1f65df15f5)

2. not sure about these specific parts , but something i always bear in mind is that official accessories hold their resale value far better than any third party parts do . if you do end up selling on your kit , it ' ll be a lot easier to sell it with the official grip .
   (ID: e2865528dd17e86320ca523d3db462efa29e7ca7)

   (ID: e5fd25110413c69853218bbcbb0169f73c8f06e1)

8. awesome , i ' ll be sure to innerfidelity out . i doubt i ' ll end up buying new headphones now , i like the hd599s and ill see if listening to them as you said opens my eyes a little . but the explenation of akg and beyerdynamic will be super helpful when i inevitably do decide to buy another pair thanks for the help , once again
