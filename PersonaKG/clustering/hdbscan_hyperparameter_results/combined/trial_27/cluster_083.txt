1. stark  digit ? heck no . the character he was more based on , ultimate spider  man ? yes very much so , though neither wanted to be a sidekick but an avenger disney  i prefer it to the other two because people like you have ruined them for me but i in no way think it  s this godsend tom is kind of accurate just not really digit accurate

2. what ' s been going on inside of my head ? been staring at the ceiling , for hours on end can ' t really think of anything else that i can do  maybe i can go out , and find my way , or maybe i can chill out , stay in today they sound like fun , but maybe another day  sorry , not sorry ! i couldn ' t help it ! just ignore this post , wanted to vent out .

3. well a ton of socially anxious people think of similar shit like this that happened years and ages ago so just add it to the end of the queue .
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

4. look at two people being able to civilly discuss a bit of a hot button issue on reddit ! while i agree about espn probably not wanting to put down too strong of a stance on an african  american for ranting about racism , she went beyond that with character attacks of someone specific just so happened to be our president in this case and seemingly contributing to an already boiling pot of emotions in the country . her hosting a sports show is debatable , i doubt many viewers are tuning into the digit for anything sports  related . that being said , espn has fired , demoted , or seriously disciplined sports analysts previously for less than what hill tweeted because they previously tried to portray an environment of " we are here for the sports , we don ' t have room for political discourse " ultimately , there is a much different atmosphere being portrayed coming out of bristol over the last few years . i don ' t think there was any place for what schilling said , like him or not . making statements like that about an entire group of the population the transgender comments is irresponsible and detestable , but just a few short years ago , statements like hill ' s would have been met with a very similar fate also .
   (ID: bd40d7bc2310ec67eb22f820945fdb7d0f6a2550)

5. oh boy , i do have a lot of ridiculous stories according to reddit . i didn ' t think i had really interesting or unbelievable stories but it seems like redditors just do nothing all day every day .
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

6. do you really think that " getting really big " is a problem ? seriously ? what , ya think you lift a few reps , go to sleep , and wake up the next day built like a gorilla ? like it ' s that freaking easy ? do you have any clue what it takes to generate mass ? it required dedicated , disciplined work , and strict dieting . it doesn ' t just fucking happen . what i ' m saying is don ' t fucking worry about " getting really big . you aren ' t going to have that problem if the level of knowledge you have is so low that you even ask such a ridiculously silly question in the first place . go to the gym , work as hard as you freaking can , and you will be absolutely happy with the results .

7. it could do although it isn ' t very likely i just can ' t really think of anything else that would click like that and freeze a pc
   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

8. unless your arm is as long as your leg or you can dislocate your should on command i don ' t think the thing you ' re attempting to do is possible . if you ' re feeling a barrier , you might still have some hymen left , but really , your vagina stretches . it can likely accommodate anything a dude has to offer . listen , there ' s no right way to finger yourself . the whole point is just to feel good and it sounds like you ' re freaking yourself out . either get a toy or wait until you have a person you trust enough to talk about this with and let them put their fingers up in you .

9. look up " romantic bpd relationships . not saying this is what she has , and not trying to shame anyone with this diagnosis . i just think this may give you some insight and useful strategies you seem like a lovely , thoughtful person
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

10. look i ' m not saying there isn ' t value in those studies , and that parenting style . it ' s just not exclusive like you seem to think it is . try raising children with different types of challenges , like autism spectrum disorder or oppositional defiant disorder , then tell me there ' s a one size fits all . also , confirmation bias . there , now i ' m really out .
   (ID: 445ba4596e4bcff0c96b23f038cf784185970198)

11. " you can just speak plain language to yourself " if you speak words in your head , like think whole sentences , you can change your mindset .
   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

12. i see where you are coming from . like i said earlier i just don  t think this year is the year to do it . we really need an ace or two . other then mike do you really trust any other starter ?
   (ID: d5ff87b3b0a008d93a655ee4d43e9da3b5db7984)

13. more like nothing will come of it even if they doanything . what can a poor person actually do ? i struggle to buy ramen noodles . you think any politican is gonna listen to me compared to the poeple bribing them ? no amount of angry phone calls will do shit . what am i supposed to do walk to washington and picket infront of the white house ? that will also solve nothing . the people in power get to make all the choices . we can vote , and i do , but that obviously does nothing in the long run when things are this bad . digit . digit percent just apathetic my ass .
   (ID: f46d1bfdfed7fc05bbe39789c092019944471e9d)

14. i don  t think it  s women that like you less , it  s just not the best women who are acting like this with you . i mostly have female friends i knew before and after transitioning and they were all really supportive , same with any male friends i had . they are good people , so they accepted me wholeheartedly . i suggest finding those types of people in your life , regardless of gender yknow ?
   (ID: 3510b342268f3bc4c3f1e402201d7c565dfb7648)

15. i think you should have pride that you haven ' t slept around alot . but not in a way like you are better than any one else just i guess in a " i respect myself " type of way . which is why i don ' t think you should just fuck someone for practice .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

16. i think at this point your just upset that a little american boy has a different opinion then you and your trying to make me look like a dumb homophobic nazi
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

17. sounds like he has that " talking constantly " disorder . these people are insufferable but i dont think they can help themselves . their families put up w the constant talk but these people usually grate on their friends who almost always distance themselves . or ue could just be extremely selfish  wad probably catered to as a child .
   (ID: e3a7bbfa5fde0a706f721c3dc5055b3a8963f79f)

18. i feel like the total opposite , swap almost everything you said the other way and thats me . im not edgy , i think my iphone is okay , idk what music i listen to but its not rock musichttps    billwurtz . com  , i like my parents , dont really care about anyone else . i dont use spotify , but instead just using a 3gb folder called " music " . i do use netlflix sometimes . i find that interesting
   (ID: 8eba9c7d48a60bfbded2227dacd3275ae756fcce)

19. kinda of an asshole ? i can see being concerned that your film might not qualify for the lgbt festival but if it  s just about you being straight  chill . no one is going to think you  re gay and it  s not like your gay colleagues don  t attend straight festivals you would feel more comfortable at . if you  re not experienced with the lgbt community , that  s cool , but keep in mind straight people are usually welcome to any event so long as they  re nice ! you might even have fun .
   (ID: 280643182527d573e119c7952a08fea10d62edd8)

20. the other comments are kind of mean . you aren ' t obligated to be friends with anyone and it doesn ' t seem like you guys are being mean to him . as long as you continue to be polite you won ' t be an asshole . i also don ' t think its clique  y to have a group of friends you regularly hang out with . i would just continue to be polite , and maybe if he keeps signing up for your breaks say that " actually his name , we usually all eat lunch together . we aren ' t asking for you to switch the time you take your break at all ! but because only x amount of people are allowed break at once , could we coordinate a little better so that i can still eat with your friend ' s names ? "
