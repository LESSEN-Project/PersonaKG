10. the main flaw i see with many answers is threefold . negotiating will be difficult when you don  t know the language . even shakespearean english could be a rough adjustment . depending on whom you are negotiating with , they may just take it . and , if you bring back something that appears too shocking , threatening or evil , you might meet your maker rather quickly .
