1. well if it were me i would definitely keep my solid plan a and atleast have the good job that you majored in . but at the same time don ' t just let your true love for writing die . i ' m not positive how to go about it but i feel like you could get your first book published and see how it does ?
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

2. you ' re not wrong . the hike to get there isn ' t all that easy though takes just under digit hours and covers about 600m in altitude . it was pretty dangerous at times due to the rain , yet you see people walking up there in flipflops . are they the real  life equivalent of someone driving around in winter without snow tyres on their car and putting themselves and others in danger ?
   (ID: 5fe12b36dc6d3370836c6683997c005efb656c99)

5. but all these things will still happen under socialism . tis is a problem of corruption and conflicts of interest of people writing the laws that enable things like this .
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

6. is it normal for your friends to copy you ? lol just kidding . imitation it is said , is the most sincere form of flattery

   (ID: a63ea1e6bf1e972229635648a0b3371aeddb4f3d)

8. i  m arguing because you say stupid things and can  t accept the fact that your post is not fun , smart , or helpful . you argue like a child and need to learn that not everything you say matters . you don  t want to argue , don  t respond . your the one who posted a garbage post with moron comments . you get off reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

9. i ' m proud to here you ' ve stopped and been doing your best to not relapse !
   (ID: fd9a89336fd3cad9dd1a173e01055683165a532e)

10. i work in product development and while i haven ' t had any moral dilemmas nearly as big as these , there are often issues to consider . what if i can design a better widget , but our factory can ' t produce it so we would have to outsource it ? consumer gets a better product , profit margin might even be higher , but we decrease internal production and hurt other employees . it is kind of funny how the phrasing of this could cause reddit to hate or love it . stifling innovation seems to clearly be a bad thing , but there is tons of hate when people hear about companies that close their factories and produce goods elsewhere . if your new product is different enough , it is possible that the current factory can ' t be modified to produce it without basically gutting the whole place . even then your workforce has no experience producing the new item , so if you want good quality right away , outsourcing the manufacturing of the new design is the only viable solution .

13. well i mean that  s your choice but . i think you should just have one round of jerking . just find a simple caption and stroke . get that last round out of your system and then you can stop . if you really want to .

   (ID: 6b89f03adeaf831281bcca46ec5a469e09e400c0)

18. i dont know as far as saying that cops would just let clean cut white kids go . drive through the ghetto of anywhere in my case chicago you clearly plainly see black people walking down the sidewalk smoking blunts standing on the corner of the street asking random people if they want to buy weed hanging out at gas stations asking random people if they want weed driving around with skunky smelling smoke billowing out of the windows . i think black peoples problem isnt completely racial profiling tho i do think it has alot to do with it but the fact that they arent nearly as sneaky when they break the law
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

19. tunes is a big one hey . what do you work on at home ?
   (ID: 9cfb696c79a211a1c5a060dfb2265f65983eeeec)

20. if you say so . you should take the time to get on google though because it ' s pretty mucb unanimous that either infinity is a concept and therefore the arguement is nonsense , or inifinty is a number and subtracting one is still infinity . when nearly everyone agrees on what i ' ve been trying to tell you , and you ' re the only one who seems to think otherwise , that usually means you ' re wrong .
