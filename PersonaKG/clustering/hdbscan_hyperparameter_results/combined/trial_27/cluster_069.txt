1. i ' ve developed the habit of just not openening my mouth as wide when i yawn . it ' s almost like muscle memory now although occasionally a wide one happens and it ' s mildly unsettling . lol . i recently had someone tell me to look down when yawning as you physically can ' t open your mouth as wide . good technique if you can remember it .

2. i just try to play how i  ve been playing the whole game , i usually rush and play aggressive so thats how i try to play in the end , changing up your play style to camp towards the end allows for you to get nervous and lose your touch . playing aggressive lets skill decide the winner not luck like camping

3. i feel like it ' s just hormones . i get this way too . i ' m too hesitant to put any labels on it because i ' m so young and so are you so this could totally just be a normal thing . for instance , i haven ' t cried in months and i ' ve cried more times than i can count today .

7. from what i  ve heard , they  re still exercising at least once a month which is the same as before . they were all pretty excited when the  no more war games  thing was announced , but we don  t call any of our exercises  war games  so we just assumed it was a way to seem like we were giving up something without ever doing so . if anyone was to bring up the fact that we haven  t stopped exercising we could be like  we gave up the war games , but we didn  t stop our training exercises  . hell , i  m in japan and even we were hoping that maybe we  d luck out and they  d let us quit exercising as well . no such luck .

8. i ' ve heard about this kind of thing , it ' s so strange to me . it ' s the most unhealthy expectation , not just physical but mental too , and it even affects personal  family life . like , wtf !

9. wanted to ask this to my best friend ' s girlfriend who is also my best friend what she likes and doesn ' t like about me . i have trouble talking with her anyway because i ' m an awkward person . i ' ve tried to gain confidence , but it just never works out

10. i ' m confused what you ' re upset about . a gunslinger who understands how to use his class to its full effectiveness ? much like a titan putting a bubbleshield directly over a control point and sitting there with a shotgun , or titansmashing everyone at a control point ? haha , as a fellow hunter , i have to say , i ' ve tripped my own tripmine grenade and killed myself more times than i ' d like to admit golden gun gives hunters zero shields , nor does bladedancer . all they had to do was go in one of the two other entrances , double team him and he would have been gone . instead , they filed in the same door over , and over , and over again . edit  just watched the second video . derp . yeah . this is why i always roll my eyes when titans complain that hunters are op .

11. yeh i gotchu , no worries . how happier are you now that you ' ve deleted them . to me social media just seems like highschool all over again .
