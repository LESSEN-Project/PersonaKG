1. let ' s not think of that . i ' m still reeling from all the major deaths from ' the walking dead ' i binge watched all seasons to catch up . not sure i can handle that for charlie .
   (ID: 45bf5c8227b94451beff1dce1059d0d2c683c40c)

2. i  m pretty sure one off exposure doesn  t do a lot i think it  s when people are exposed to it daily that is the real danger . not certain though
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

3. as far as changing faces go , i think the recent idea is political correctness run amok in regards to harriet tubman . if the treasury dept . really wants to honor this important woman , then create a much needed bill in a new denomination . and make sure she isn ' t frowning .
   (ID: 130fa156e7a286a021dcdff2492d6048231cb82f)

4. i ' m pretty sure it ' s before , because in lore it says that doomfist was defeated by winston and put in prison . saying that the fight scene ends with doomfist and winston about to clash i think it ' s pretty safe to say it ' s before prison . i might be wrong though , because the doomfist mentioned in the original cinematic could be a different one .

5. you insinuated that you were a member of avo . so you are a member or you think it would be cool to be one . either way i ' m sure there are better servers for you .

6. " yea , i already have three bikes , but none of them do what this bike does , so i ' m gonna get this one too . " " but that ' s so many bikes " " sure but would you ever take a ferrari off  roading ? how about trying to race someone while driving a cargo van ? would you take all of your laundry and groceries on a bitch  bike motorcycle ? " i still think that ' s too many bikes " " i still think you ' re an idiot "
   (ID: b073b7138186ccb7fa807af1158cb23d6b7c113f)

7. one of those books you think " think this would make a great movie " while your reading it . not sure about jackie chan in the role but who knows he might surprise me .
   (ID: 3f0409a6efb16c26d2f9f7a14f5e75b8945ba427)

8. well if you really do think so and you ' re sure it ' s not right for you , i ' d say call them and be honest . i ' m sure they ' d be understanding .
   (ID: 339d06087e421a1cf86d695af2a2088546f9dc91)

9. i think it is a system that disallows hidden identity . you will now have to go elsewhere to post anon or suck services someone else is paying for . other than that , those crap solicitor phone calls i keep getting can be blocked , and my competitors cant hack up my adwords account when they have no business and cost me money . i am sure its a problem though . somehow .
   (ID: 457d7d37e1181cc932693cd4220e6fbfd564a75d)

10. do a quick visual check to make sure , but i dont think its too big of a problem . check proper fluid level  color , check pad and rotor wear , and look for any leaks in the lines if you are worried .
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

11. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

12. how you get them is how you lose them . why would you think that he would be faithful to you ? i ' m pretty sure he ' s reassuring you the same way he reassured her .
