7. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

8. yup , i think this is the reason and actually this was the first reason i wanted to meet her . i didnt intended in first place to " date " her . but now i kinda like her " but you are right . let ' s see what happens .
   (ID: 9425493e0ea7469367495f8e5947330e536cafa9)

9. my mother was an only child , she said it was very lonely growing up as an only child and she always wanted a big family . i have digit siblings , after seeing how expensive it is raising a child and all the other drama that goes with having digit kids , i think it is insane ! i personally would like to have two kids . maybe three .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

10. to be fair i used to think this . i agree that some women are not funny . however some men aren  t funny either . usually if you don  t like vagina jokes don  t watch amy schumer . she is the female equivalent to louis c . k . i do recommend you watch catherine ryan  s special on netflix for you to change your mind .

11. you can tell them all the reasons that you personally like it but at the end of the day that  s your opinion . many people think it  s a pointless holiday myself included and my mind wouldn  t be changed from one person telling me the reasons they like it i don  t think .
   (ID: 726d5aaac9472ccdcb64345cd6d082bee4eae6fa)

12. oh okay , yeah i can see what you mean there but i think that there are more people then me that post stuff like this on here anyway . you never answered what makes me an attention seeking whore from this ?
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

13. i think it ' s more like when you go to pick up your kid from school but you forgot his name .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

14. guys his past posts are all like this , i think he is a creep
   (ID: d34dab0dded997c6aa6e6d2792ea9d8a26881a2b)

15. " hey mike , you ever think that shock therapy stuff could work on an incestuous fuck like me ? fire it up ! "
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

16. i do find it girly  " gay " to not be weirded out by a stranger covering you in lotion and rubbing up on you . how is that exclusive to those who are girly or gay ? that ' s fucking ridiculous . what do you think women and gay people are like ?
   (ID: 372e357e1e3acd2a4dea24aa56a5900a539a9e59)

17. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

18. true , but to me , i think it seems like a question they should be answering rather than asking . that ' s why i ask several questions about working conditions and technologies used , etc .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

19. currently they ' re being skeptical but haven ' t taken any further actions to both of you i mean like deducting pay or giving warnings , have they ? i think if they start to do so then present the records
   (ID: a04ffec23ab9c2af8d4ac433e06db2b5d1b4bf9b)

20. this card is basically a zero mana discover a spell . u can either play the discovered card or another spell but either way you are still paying full price it ' s not that similar to glyph because the discount doesn ' t last . it ' s not a true discount like prep because the card itself costs digit mana . personally i don ' t think it will see any play outside of hagatha .
