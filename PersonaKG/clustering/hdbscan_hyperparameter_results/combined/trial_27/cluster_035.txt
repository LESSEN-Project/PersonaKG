11. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .

13. see it ' s hard to describe , but he ' s not one who likes to get embarrassed because he gets super upset and angry . he totally lashes out , so i figured with an instance such as this , maybe wait for him to come to me ? or is that the same as like we ' ll basically never talk about it ?
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

14. i  m loving it but it  s not for everyone . d2 is really a game that you have to realize that if you get hooked you  ll be playing it until it either dies or d3 comes out . i  m having crazy amounts of fun on pc . my friends and i have created a clan and been running strikes and stuff like that . the entertainment is subjective but it  s much more fun with friends .
   (ID: 2657c8854c93e48c0bab9764c7904833e823cac9)

   (ID: c502154cdae9232a9351bdc0e55d2030d75a8094)

17. because as like everything else we don  t believe in hear say bullshit . if we believed every bullshit story someone from the past wrote down we would still be worshiping cats and cutting off virgins clits . so from all of us to your god i say this  all it takes is a two minute appearance and boom , we  ll all believe  .

18. for me , when i  m having issues i try and distract myself . i like to listen to music a lot , so i  ll listen to music and sing along with it and that calms down most of the time . when i can  t listen to music , i start reciting songs in my head and that works too .
   (ID: 69878cc2cc3e4fe974feb7f6bf5a69bf75cd4951)
