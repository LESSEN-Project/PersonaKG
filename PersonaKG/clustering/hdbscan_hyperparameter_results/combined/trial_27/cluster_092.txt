1. what you really want to do is find out what exactly is the source of your back pain . it could be a rib out of place , a rotated hip , twisted tailbone , bulging disc , etc . then you can start exercises to target those . if it ' s just generic sore muscles , then you would benefit from strength training to keep those muscles in shape .
   (ID: 6b04f3448a053338b902c242d1883da1e90dc7bb)

2. i don ' t care what they prefer , to be frank . shemale is unacceptable but ladyboy is . just imagine the logic in that when shemale is slightly more accurate . if you can ' t use logic to help facilitate your mental illness , then you probably shouldn ' t transition to begin with . i will say this though . trans chicks may be fast approaching the point of no return in telling their difference from biological women , but they still tend to be more humble than said women . i ' d sooner trust one of them not to steal from me than i would a natural woman . because they actually have to work to look how they want . a biological woman hasn ' t worked a day in her life .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

3. one of my pet peeves is that here in oregon the signs say " motorcycles use extreme caution " that they can craft a sign with four words that has two mistakes  okay , one definite mistake and one iffy word choice  just makes me want to bang my head against a wall .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

4. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

5. so you pointing out that it ' s about race and gender implying that you want it to be true just because she is a woman and an african please provide a valid counter argument or fuck off with your faminazi sentimentality .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

6. well it  s not a mean nickname so she  s not making fun of you so possibly she likes you or someone dared her to call you that , maybe she  s just being playful  goofing around or sending obvious hints that she digs you , its hard to tell since i haven  t met her . she could also just want to be your friend
   (ID: 5b1553b6a517f6dfee19019582f0bb534a60ae0a)

7. the restaurant i work at has a decent digit . digit on yelp . but our hours are wrong , lists us as having rooms we have inn in our name , but just in name , not in function , lists the wrong menus for dinner , includes a happy hour menu that we dont have , and mentions a weekly brunch we haven  t done for the last digit years . despite multiple emails and phone calls they refuse to fix this . and because of this we get people complaining that  your website says x , so i want x  pulls out yelp  see right here ! digit !   ma  am thats yelp , we don  t control them .
   (ID: e9bd2e5a75b03c2a8d39168be58f6bed5ed6ff39)

8. you can fake study , just put you book in front of you and put your phone in there or whatever . then you say that you already studied and you can do whatever you want
   (ID: f491028c794855d1611365b07d4525f7b98173ae)

9. she gave both of them the exact same treatment and even tried to get him to hang out at a different time . how is that playing favourites ? he doesn  t get to kick someone out of the friend group just because he  s not comfy around them anymore . everyone else is still friends with her . it doesn  t matter that he was around first , she  s here now and has just as much right to have friends as he does . it sucks that he missed out on game night because he didn  t want to see her , but that  s his problem , not op  s .
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

10. nsfw ! this post is definitely nsfw , just want to give everyone a heads up ! i just have to write a bunch of cramp so that the automate raptor doesn ' t just kill my comment because all i wrote was " nsfw . so , again  risky click at work , folks .
   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

11. yes for the stats , companies need to show that they have women . but the way to treat a woman vs a man is not the same at all . a woman isn ' t taken as seriously as a man . i don ' t want to victimize women , it ' s just what i see . maybe that we aren ' t at the same step . and when i searched my job it was very hard and i had a lot of negative answers even with successfully tests .
   (ID: 862cb85d93fa9b931c3c64cf2fd17ef592d48c50)

12. wait so your gay or you ' re not interested but want to talk to her . harem ? either way you should say no since it will only end in disappointment for her . just be kind .
   (ID: 6ea82786a74ccdc85dc1fddd809a575aa4e4efcf)

13. for the most part , you have the freedom to go or do whatever you want . whereas , in a relationship , you have not just yourself but your so to consider . as far as what ' s the worst thing in relationships ? that ' s more or so subjective . everyone will tell you something different .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

14. yta , sorry to burst your bubble , but you can ' t make someone do anything to you . if she doesn ' t want to have sex , she doesn ' t . and making her give you a bj just fucked it up even more .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

15. i just opted out . if i want to be back in , how do ido that ?
   (ID: 20fef7b83cf9ae51924e5491cac2f90901d833e0)

16. so you haven ' t actually told the guy you ' re not interested ? seems this guy doesnt get the hint and can ' t mind read , but he seems harmless from what you described . just some guy who was interested and you are not . just tell the dude you don ' t want anything to do with him . he ain ' t psychic . and your account is a couple days old , what ' s your alt account that you used to post on letsnotmeet ?
   (ID: dceaf5128ce079240dc5048df74d704163edc3a5)

17. she doesn ' t pick out any of my outfits digit . digit  of the time . she just hates how masculine i dress and i don ' t want any thanksgiving drama .
   (ID: 7e58269155b84bc057025d5066e661ba2eb934ba)

18. i just want to be able to piss standing up in the woods . so convenient .
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

19. yta you come off as an ungrateful leach and when they told you " hey this is how we do it here , its polite and shows respect , and we will still pay for it " you decide you ' re better than their culture and just refuse to be a part of anything they want to include you in . i can understand why they would be upset with you
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

20. i have no reasons . i just want one .
