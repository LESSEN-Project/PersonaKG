1. you would know better than i would about anything related to those serving in the vast majority of government so i  ll defer to your expertise . the skeptic in me comes out a bit sometimes . i appreciate the reassurance . i can absolutely get on board with your plans . it  ll never be perfect but we can certainly strive to improve . and you are right that regulations have certainly been beneficial to human kind in the past . personally , large scale public health risks probably need regulating but we  re getting into regulating the minutiae of the day to day life of the citizenry . and that  s where i have to draw the line .
   (ID: 8b20a772d1697ecc1b19f9f6451e7346e8b98987)

   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

3. the only reason a person goes to hell is if they choose to .   x200b  i  ll elaborate . there are two main things one can do to go to hell  commit a mortal sin , act directly against your own conscience and do something you know in your heart is very wrong .   x200b  the requirements of a mortal sin are  grave matter , and full knowledge . if you don  t know it  ll send you to hell , it won  t , unless you know in your heart that it  s wrong and do it anyway .   x200b  in the end the only answer to your question is  i don  t know  and anyone who says they do is either lying or delusional .   x200b  side note  there are other things you can do , but they aren  t really relevant to your question .
   (ID: f8a8648f114c1dd8984a809bd49816978d9970c0)

4. ah good to know . i  ll definitely look into this
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

5. yeah i wasn  t going to tell anyone , but the ones who already know about it cause then we  ll never really find out
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

6. its from mashiroiro symphony , i don ' t remember the exact quote , i don ' t care , but its something to the effect of  having pets is scary because you know they ' ll die before you , but when they do its important to remember the fun you had while they were alive not the pain of losing them .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

7. ok cool , thanks for the clarification frient ! i ' ll try a gram for fun if my local coffeeshop ever gets some , but now i know i don ' t need to expect something wildly different
   (ID: 932561c7cc5f0c280d4b6b0c7824dbd5aed5f350)

8. it can be frustrating when people use depression to excuse all their failings . as someone who myself is in constant battle with mental health , i know as soon as i use it as an excuse it  s game over for me . i  ll join the other failed victims . so many amazing people who succeed in spite of depression
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

   (ID: c1c3bee034ba3e70e4bd22d7987533e43f2b424b)

   (ID: 7632dd7ebcb664bfada5fff420a436f42e3721d5)

11. interesting . i didn ' t know there was a remake of that show  i watched the original when i was a kid . i ' ll have to check it out  have been looking for a new series to watch . limitless is pretty good , but it ' s only one season .
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

13. i know i ' ll never get one so i ' m not really worrying about that . however i do carry some so my breath doesn ' t smell when talking to people
   (ID: 1921dc07cd609c210cb71a0176afa3dfa4fa3772)

14. certainly not a bad idea to let at least someone know where you are especially when you  re a female . if you do go missing , someone can call the cops as soon as they notice you  re gone and it  s much more likely that you  ll be found .
   (ID: a815d9b5c98aef3203b8f4f74528072fb989f0b1)

15. move the painting out of the way and i ' ll let you know .
   (ID: 58245e8d537b9e7b6d76cc6a9919ea776e4ef6f0)

16. yes , you never know what we  ll find once we go looking .
   (ID: a6171234e1a4ec65a39ad55aa0aa058eb98dff83)

17. depends on how random the words are that i ' ll forget . if they ' re ones i can learn again , i ' ll take it . if they ' re names and identities of people i know , no . also i ' m cracking up thinking of a scenario where a person tries to use this in an interview to one up the interviewer .
   (ID: 8a0d7d262d95d9c10d914ff3b70f342e066aee23)

18. mario kart . no one wants to play with you if they know they ' ll lose the whole time , so i throw to keep the game fun .
   (ID: 43a6fe9c16d7a48abeb6832518a650a445974a7e)

19. do i drop everything and everyone i know to work with a major producer and make my dreams come true or stay and throw it all away knowing i  ll never get an easy opportunity again and be a dad my ex was about to have our kid at any moment
   (ID: 4e784da799782c45d8883de53e87a533129a3b8e)
