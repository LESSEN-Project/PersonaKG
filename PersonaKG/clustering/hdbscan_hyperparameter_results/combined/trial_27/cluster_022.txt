5. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .
   (ID: 45bf5c8227b94451beff1dce1059d0d2c683c40c)

7. cheers for not being aggressive in your response . it actually made me edit the post . this isn  t meant as an attack on people who use them but rather my thoughts on why the use of memes feels like a problem . if that  s what you love , then meme away my friend !
