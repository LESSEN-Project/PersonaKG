1. seeing a lot of negative comments saying get help . guys , this is a game where you time and time again , without thought , shotgun blast mofos across the room . op was just descriptive and obviously has a unique play style . at some point we have all saved , committed crimes against humanity , then reloaded . to the op , optionally you can attempt to be a pickpocket expert and just take the gun maybe never actually have seen his inventory in that quest .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

2. i can  t even . i  m trying to come up with a good joke , but there are none . just what . this had to pass through many people , who all somehow thought it was a good idea . lol
   (ID: e1cfe7e3bd4f78988caf9c6fd043691888e401c8)

   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

5. lol and i thought my own outlook on people was pretty bleak . just comes down to trust in the end here . yes a lot of people suck but there are good ones out there . gotta take a risk now and then for the reward .
   (ID: 1cf567904675ac1ca7b5a90612e5479a5b6c9bef)

6. nudes shouldn ' t really be required . when you ' re in a relationship , just the thought of em ' makes you happy . counting the days till you get to see em ' again .
   (ID: 8712de543372bc5f398d43ea5b918c85efc5dda7)

7. some i like are  pbg star bound  it was not how i thought hr someone would go out . dean mc digit  he could have build a bridge but when you panic you panic . barry starbound  almost no one noticed instantly terraria digit ending  well that  s a sucky way to end jeff terraria digit and digit  just so similar
   (ID: 54920691b1e05863de734f0444f66749700c4331)

8. i play a lot . as interesting and well thought out as it is , i wouldn ' t buy one for my table . sorry dude , just giving my honest opinion .
   (ID: 725e5a3de682f359cfb87481ec457a2f78867ef3)

9. i ' m not doing one for the same reasons . i ' ve had to go to wedding showers and always thought what ' s the point ? besides just showering the bride with more attention , which is something i never wanted . if you do end up having one , keep in mind that couples showers are becoming a big thing , so it doesn ' t have to be gender specific .
   (ID: 169c51cc138a4161080068ded4dcf87863ffee36)

10. hello . yes . yes . is that so . thought so well i just called bullshit and he says that is a fucking lie . don ' t you fucking hype me like that again .

11. i never knew that . i thought the deworming was more of preventing it , but obviously what you just said makes a lot more sense . til .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

12. hopefully  not what i just thought .
   (ID: df1ced988175856d5a5b468166271e5d777e4a3e)

13. coming from a girl who everyone assumed my whole life as " rich " sometimes it ' s not actual individuals that hold money , it ' s the family . my family has money , but they don ' t pay my bills . the only expensive jewelry i ever have received family bought  gifts  which is just likes purses , scarfs , etc . so she may be struggling just as hard as you are , her struggle just may look a lot more stylish thanks to her family . just a thought ! btw  i dont date " rich guys " because digit  are jerks so she could also feel that way !

14. i haven ' t been everywhere in the world but enough places outside of the states to come to the conclusion that minimal eye contact is an american thing . a lot of the places i ' ve been the social norm leans more toward staring . i thought maybe it ' s just cause i was a tourist i get extra attention but noticed how people interact with their other countrymen . i guess what i ' m saying is eye contact is fine and a simple smile or wave to acknowledge the other party makes it less awkward .
   (ID: 109fa004cbb85f6a703624f8b4393d7d7d685509)

15. you ' re in a shitty situation . yes it would be weird to get a text from someone you rarely hangout . you ' d basically be saying " hey i ' m depressed and alone on my 21st birth day come have a awkward night with me " do you have any hobbies ? this is just an example , if your in to biking plan a trip to a cool mountain for the day maybe try doing something you ' ve always thought would be cool but never had the nerve to actually do it !

16. that  s not how it works , his powers are not brutal force , he has the powers to control everything that happened in the past , he is pretty much thanos with complete gauntlet or even stronger , he would  uncreate  pretty much anyone in any universe just with his thought . the only reason he couldn  t end everything in bleach is because he is too big of a ball of pride and protagonism
   (ID: d10c10d39129e1768465d09c5c492657be31ef47)

17. i thought i heard something like that but i ' d rather not believe it because it just makes it so much better .
   (ID: 9c2d2fde31927b8cc3bc419049de8844ca720cb9)

18. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .
   (ID: b3497f72ed4462f0414951db6d9ee7aa4004b515)

19. oh wow i  m dumb as fuck thank you for the correction . id heard about that case long time ago and always just thought it was here thats the one where the killer fed one of the victims fried chicken , yes ?
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

20. this is one of those people new to tf2 who thought they would like to share a video with u , so lower those pitchforks , or just a kid who wants karma , in that case , shower him in downvotes
