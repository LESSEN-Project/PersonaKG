Total from this dataset: 63

1. my friend ' s brother found essentially what was cp on a classmate ' s computer back in high school . this classmate is someone who nobody likes to this day we ' re all in our digit ' s . everyone tolerates him but they can tell something is just ' off ' about him but they just can ' t pick what it is . as far as i can tell he has a girlfriend at the moment . i wonder if he ' ll ever be caught . no idea if he ' s actually done anything to any underage kids though .
   (ID: d1e274dbfcf8ed1af55bb50c57e00046b961b6fd)

2. his creator  owned stuff is fine . it ' s when you give him someone else ' s creation to play with that he can ' t be trusted . chances are he ' ll kill off your favorite character and replace them with a new one that either has zero personality or his just so annoying that you actively root against them . otherwise , he ' ll just spit on the continuity because it ' s getting in the way of the story he ' s trying to tell .
   (ID: 17d6f5fb6fdd1b0ceedb5ec118276bdbb72a462f)

3. that  ll just prove the point that they are lost before they go in the laundry . why would you kill an urban myth ? are you insane ?
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

   (ID: 04b12cbc989702ae4909382de2ac53409fddbbf4)

5. i could go on for hours . i ' ll just go through the ones that hurt the most " just cause your his daughter doesn ' t mean he loves you more than me " my dads ex  " i wish i didn ' t have to care for you " my stepdad  " i should just leave you at school someone will notice and take you " mother  " i drink cause you stress me too much " mother
   (ID: fd9a89336fd3cad9dd1a173e01055683165a532e)

6. so far only one of them caused problems . had that one removed around digit , but the rest have been fine so i figure i ' ll just leave em there .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

7. even if this happens , we ' ll just move on to the next level of existence . do not fear . you we are infinite .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

8. oh goodness that ' s rough . i ' ll just have to wish you the best
   (ID: 339d06087e421a1cf86d695af2a2088546f9dc91)

9. i ' ll just grab a full plate and take it to my room everytime we ' re having dinner
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

10. like with anything , just be as careful as you can afford to be . take pride in your gear and it ' ll serve you well . cases are a good idea but not essential  however , it ' s better to have one than not .
   (ID: e2865528dd17e86320ca523d3db462efa29e7ca7)

11. just go in expecting to die or not get any of the challenge done , then when it happens you  ll be pleasantly surprised it  s that damn lonely lodge chest challenge isn  t it ? i dropped there digit times in a row with no chests
   (ID: fe5860fea6be29c69501e1a97b1240375d594aa9)

12. i ' ll watch the first digit episodes with the rewatch . if i like it , i ' ll just watch it on my own .
   (ID: 622ae5e8e0ffe2c066a3d94dcee004b5696643bb)

13. you wont she ' ll most likely tell you she just wants to be friends and then if she was ever worth it at all will follow through with that .
   (ID: 0501bf1e5cd313190bb4590a1c677057b15a6e47)

14. it depends on the scenario . am i just trying to make it to the next paycheck and i will get my item back ? if so then i ' d pawn a gun . if i ' ll probably never see it again i ' d go with some of the random electronics i have . an old cell phone , video game console , etc .
   (ID: 238107f17ccd21a5cb87efbd00d55a861389ba26)

15. thanks ! yeah , i ' ll admit they can be useful , i just never memorized which enemies are weaker to them . i should probably do that .
   (ID: e09cddf2452184c83537d2d4e8a36f0ba7c3fae9)

16. triangulation would be , worse case , one parent and the child siding against the other parent re the same child . your marriage has to be rock solid and discipline and responses should be discussed and prepared for ahead of time . the child needs to feel safe . so , just like most little ones , if you  re not responding they  ll ll go to your spouse and vice versa . communication and open discussions with both parents and the child are essential . i can not recommend jarrett  s book enough . jarrett  s book gives specific examples
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

17. if you ask an average american to draw a school shooter , you ' ll get a collection of sketches of this guy right here . i ' m just kidding , bud . but seriously , stay away from my kids school . thanks .
   (ID: 191aa96179821ac46f9548541f04899c2adacec9)

18. if you pay now , then court is how you recover it . if you dont pay it will be shut off and you ' ll have fees to pay to turn it back on . paying it does not mean you admit some sort of guilt . it just saves you the fees later .
   (ID: 6b04f3448a053338b902c242d1883da1e90dc7bb)

19. everyone knows its not getting into the parking garage that is the problem , it ' s getting out . what ' s that ? you didn ' t get a ticket ? oh , that ' s ok , we ' ll just charge you for the whole day . that will be digit million yen .
   (ID: 306fcce176e83db604dac17838eed1e669cd5a90)

20. it happens to me all the time i ' ll have something i want to write down or search and it just leaves me it ' s very frustrating .
