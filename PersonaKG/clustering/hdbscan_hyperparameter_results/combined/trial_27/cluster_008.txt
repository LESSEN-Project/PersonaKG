3. because my friend isn ' t in reddit and he had texted customer care digit times and no reply from them . idk about that . just a tiny little hope that mods will see my post and reply . something is better than nothing

4. you can say that for every song on btcs . nothing put on the album to fill a space or bridge a gap between digit songs . every note on every tune f  ing kills . i only hope the new album can grab a just a little of this one .
   (ID: b8a837337ecbafd4a4c170d8fad76bd3de102f09)

5. as a guy , i can tell you , he  s not stopping . it  s not a matter of you or the other girls , it  s a change . i agree that the pictures over video is probably i  m the minority but to each their own . unless you  re always there to have sex when he  s horny , probably nothing you can do about it . the best thing to do is just what you have , express your discomfort and how you feel and leave it alone . let him work through and compromise for you , or not . its not worth starting a fight , not for either party . i hope your bf calms down on it though so you feel more comfy , good luck .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

6. i just hope we don ' t have a repeat of charlottesville .
   (ID: 841a375b464a5650f1c027d1c7ae73415228c6ab)

7. when you are ready then talk to him about it or seek a professional counselor . it seems to me that you are not open with talking about these  obsessions  and that can start to impact your relationship or life because your not willing to open up . it  s just going to eat you up inside . he may be patient , but is this healthy for the both of you ? . probably not . anyway , i hope everything will get better soon .
   (ID: 7f37f47fcf6439c13308caa3da8118ac14f861f6)

8. wow your right . let  s just hope they don  t fuck it up
   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

9. maybe you can join a new sport or some other fun activities , to spend the eveningsi joined mma . don ' t go for gaming though , it just makes you feel empty once done . hope that helps .
   (ID: a168763c82b90dc18ccbbd57533eec2e49d17dc7)

10. well i hope she has the same energy for herself and her actions because from what you say , you didn ' t really do anything bad . she just says so .
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

11. yeah . it added up . it ' s hard , and unfortunately will probably happen multiple times in the next decade or two . by all means i hope you can find the right one early on . just basing that off the " typical " run .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

12. pve upscaleds i ' m all for everyone wanting to try wvw but i really , really , really hope they are playing to win rather than playing for the achievement  loot  xp and karma train . i have seen people running back and leaving the zerg in the middle of a siege  clash just to pick  up a gaddam loot bag left behind .

13. even if things go horribly worst case scenario it literally does not matter and wasn  t meant to be . anyone involved will forget about it quickly . if it goes well , it goes great ! and will only get easier . just trust yourself to get through it . also , i carry a small bag when i  m feeling anxious  nauseous so i can throw up in a clean manner in an emergency if i need to . i hope it goes well ! good on you for taking difficult steps , be proud !

14. obviously , this argument doesn ' t hold and it  s simply a case of people being irked that non  whites are finally being represented in a larger way . i surely hope you aren ' t assuming that just because somebody is unhappy with one specific historically  incorrect aspect that they do not care about the others . just because somebody isn ' t actively advocating against every historical inaccuracy at any given point doesn ' t mean they ' re using it as a front to deny non  white involvement  most people do acknowledge the participation of smaller groups in the war , but simply find the representation to be statistically inaccurate . i would ask these individuals what they consider of other historical inaccuracies in the game before framing them with what is implied to be a racist undertone .
