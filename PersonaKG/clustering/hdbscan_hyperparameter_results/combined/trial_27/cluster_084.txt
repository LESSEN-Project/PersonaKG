1. the closer to the finale we get , the closer i get to thinking that we are and have been in both seasons seeing a lot of cr4  dl simulation relating to bernard and william  mib . i haven ' t fully fleshed out what that could mean , but i am not sure that we are seeing much in the way of " reality " when touching on some of the storylines we are following weekly . with that said , it puts me in a spot where i don ' t really know where they go from here besides some contingent of woke hosts infiltrating the real world , but with a less obvious twist of some kind .

   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

3. do kiwis even use that term ? i ' m sure they know about it from american movies and whatnot .
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

4. i see things a bit differently . no doubt your dad would appreciate a higher end and therefore more expensive turntable , but as an unexpected gift from his child , either of your options are priceless . go to the top of your budget and if your dad particularly likes audio technica , go with the best you can afford . i don  t know what other equipment you already have , but make sure that you have a pre  amp or integrated amp with a  phono  input or else keep enough money on one side for a suitable phono stage . good luck .

5. makes sense . would you happen to know of any good resources i could check out about setting up a vm that i could use for plex ? while i understand the concept and use vm ' s at work i have never set one up for this purpose so i ' m not sure whats all required .

6. it  s a common thing  not sure how it  s called but people get paid thousands of dollars to eat in front of cams or in clubs , you know , internet .
   (ID: cc15a2c089fadf84b135f1f61f9666baac04a6e3)

7. i ' m not entirely sure what happened all i know i someone broke the law and there is absolutely nothing we can do because my whole damn filthy town is courrpetd

8. i know for sure that it cost about twice as much to ship something from the us to canada than it does to ship the same thing to from canada to the us

   (ID: 97c35f21c6a14bb50b6faae9a7b18cd5968c350c)

10. i completely disagree . how can you rank something for this event when you know nothing ? you can rank best omegas , sure . but not the best ones for the event . the only reasonable thing to recommend is stockpile omegas and use whenever necessary for the event .
   (ID: a304d2b10646e73686547edafa852cc87a894eb5)

11. it ' s impossible to tell someone ' s religion by looking at them . at this time in my life , i ' m not sure i know any jewish people , because no one mentions what their belief system is to me . i can ' t remember when i last saw anyone wearing a yarmulke .
   (ID: 514a3ecd0d04716c9225352c4a3a5d5424dd8056)

12. you guys get a schedule ? damn lol . at the dc everything is word of mouth and if somebody didn ' t let you know that we are supposed to come in an extra day , you ' re fucked . make sure you have friends here lol

13. tell him and see his reaction . if he is such a great man that wants to be with you , he should have no problem sticking up for you and making sure his family understands that that behavior will cease . if he reacts in their defense and does nothing , you know it  s not worth pursuing . mommas boys are a serious no  no for me , good luck .
   (ID: f18b19a52bbf1505af84d01563a51626d4ae363f)

14. make sure you ' re there before him and don ' t let on that you ' re worried about it . if asked to move , firmly say no and gesture towards the other empty desks . let him know that your momma ain ' t raise no bitch !
