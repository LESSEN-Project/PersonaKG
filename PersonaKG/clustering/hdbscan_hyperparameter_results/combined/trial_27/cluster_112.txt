1. it sounds to me like you should be talking to a lawyer instead of asking the internet . you make one google about a cough and before you know it google says you have aids . don  t expect any different . at least i gave you ideal advice .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

2. what is letter for my wife ? feel like i should know , but .
   (ID: f90b0d899acf3c82adaa55fb250d0c7ea9eaeaf3)

3. i don ' t know if this applies to you but i ' m gonna throw it out there anyway . i work night shifts and day offs are on monday and tuesday . i don ' t get to hang out with people because of my work schedule . what i do cope up with the loneliness is i play mmos like guild wars digit . i get to be with people , albeit virtually , but at least i still get to talk with people which somehow lessens the feeling .
   (ID: 261413214c13676b8aee2ce20a47107c4ccfe6b8)

4. pre  teen to teenage years , perhaps , but there ' s no harm in doing it earlier . you can ' t really know if you like something if you don ' t do it .
   (ID: 618e7c681a628e6c6c5521926bf4d17deb5ed5d6)

5. i dont know why you ' re getting downvotes . this is fucking hilarious . and its not political shitposting to say that the former first lady looks like a man .
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

6. i know what you mean . sounds like prison was the cheapest date one could ask for !
   (ID: 354f69f9c6cf00a975f2f112bc11eaa79f843f63)

7. like i said i never went on vacation by myself , so i dont know if x country is cheaper than y . so if the kind people of reddit can point me in right direction , that would be great
   (ID: b4fb8e20516a28baa38075931e9715db2375a956)

8. leaves party gets gunned down by the rogue for leaving lmao but really , yeah they should have the feature to give someone like digit seconds to leave before also being marked . i enjoy going rogue but i know some of my friends are like you and dont so i won ' t go rogue if i ' m with them , but you never know when you squad up with a rando .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

9. you seem go be implying a very specific point by using vague examples . i don  t know if  giving money to stuff you like  is the same as  paying fobuying the things you like .  i feel like i can read your political affiliation based on this statement and i find it almost completely irrelevant to the question at hand . but hey , what do i know . i  m one of those fools who patronizes businesses , products , and services that i enjoy with money i earn . you seem to look at that as giving , i would call it spending .
   (ID: 237175707a16a7382ac8130de85ed85b63dc9442)

10. i know lol . she really is great . shes like a blessing in my life that came upon me when i was very confused and didn ' t know where to go . whenever i feel sad i listen to litterally any of her songs and feel better . i am not a robot has such a special place in my  . so does happy . especially becuase i have anxiety and depression so it makes it even better .
   (ID: 0ddaeffad510fe540496c0e0b97a1a85b13282eb)

11. yes , no problem . why wouldn ' t someone is what i ' d like to know .
   (ID: 8797828a745ecd521e3b219ff004d26777b4f4f7)

12. i know someone who keeps taking slefies with aston martins but the truth is he will never afford one so why try and make out like its your car . crazy
   (ID: 4679181760b739d302b80a7e08480575bf4d30bc)

13. life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you  re going to get .
   (ID: 60a31a4071ae4962f2a308822d53a634a3760fa1)

14. i ' m afraid that i really know nothing about the industry , except as a watcher . it seems like netflix is growing and is vastly expanding its home  grown content , so going that route would certainly be a valid one . best of luck !
   (ID: aa4c399e0083dd1bf730546e6c4fbd9b75104d67)

15. i don ' t know , but that ' s more of a philosophical question . maybe you could say an earthquake hit you by chance , because humans didn ' t make it happen . but calling the outcome of other humans ' decisions " chance " does not fit the word . like , " i didn ' t vote , so trump became president by chance "
   (ID: c978d968d1c4e9730afc6b7b09cbdd832546a06f)

16. i know you ' re going to get downvoted and are using hyperbole , but that may not be bad for them . not a " forced labor " kind of thing , but something designed to show them the value of work . maybe they could help build a park or something like that .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

17. like go online and comment  post your joke on an account that people don  t know is u
   (ID: 5b1553b6a517f6dfee19019582f0bb534a60ae0a)

18. like i own the xs and i taught that the price was worth it , but i was upgrading form the se , tbh the only person that know that answer is you grinning  face  with  sweat
   (ID: 87173aaf55980a77c94bd30c851c39fb0b52ff2e)

19. what it should sound like  you know , you should really go out and do something . you ' d be less bored . what it actually sounds like  get off of your fat ass and do something . like hell , it ' s so boring around here ! keep me entertained !
   (ID: d2e08e506c32ac85c9dc9c537b36b64fbe497359)

20. do you know where you have the most trouble in ? i found that the historical passages always hit me like a truck .
