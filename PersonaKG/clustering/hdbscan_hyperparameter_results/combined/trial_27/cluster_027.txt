1. i ' m in the same boat as you , friend . i ' m working on getting a degree in a conservative field but i really wanted to stretch my ears . so i did . mine are down to a 2g but they will still shrink back to piercing size . i ' d say the lowest you could go without irreversability is 0g but each ear is different .  i don ' t think irreversability is a word
   (ID: 50e37e2011f73f739f76098c3c746e27b8422fd7)

2. it ' s pretty well established that jesus did exist , i don ' t think that ' s exactly the point op is trying to make .
   (ID: 0fbaeef283f7b2090f763028c227ed73724f3e6c)

3. i think we ' re in agreement ? or by ' yep ' did you mean you would stop loving your mother for money reasons ?
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

4. for me it was oregairu , when i first watched i was at a point in my life where i acted very similar to the main character , and i hated that . the main characters actions never did anything but make me dislike the character , when i finally realized how similar i was to the mc i decided i wanted to be more positive and get better at making friends . while now i don ' t have a lot friends , i do have more than i used to and am a generally happy person . i think that if i never watched that show i would be much less happy with who i am now . tl  dr  oregairu made me realize the reason i wasn ' t happy is that i hated the kind of person i was .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

5. i recommend reading spiritual leadership by john oswald sanders . in the book it talks about the good and bad we experience when we are in a role of leadership . what you  re experiencing is normal trial and i don  t think you must be show joy all the time . after all , jesus did overturn the tables at the temple .

6. well  known fact that devs pay attention to this sub  where did you learn that well known fact ? we get bugs posted here and fixed within hours when they weren ' t submitted to the official forums . also big hint valve employees commenting on reddit posts about the state of upcoming changes  bug fixes  explanations about seemingly random changes .  how would it be more convenient for the patch team to sift through endless shitposts to find bug reports instead of reading them in a dedicated forum . logic ? because they obviously don ' t " sift through " reddit posts looking for bugs . they check reddit , and if they see a bug post then they check it , or don ' t see a bug post then leave reddit . it is more convenient because reddit has a much higher userbase and so they get a higher sample of issues from looking at comments and can help figure out what causes the issue . all this took less than digit seconds for me to think of so . logic ?

7. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?

8. but he ' s an addict and i believe he was molested by his mother as a kid . he has done some nice things for his kid . he always apologizes or at least does something to get on their goodside . and honestly i think he did the right thing by telling fiona that sean still used .

9. ok so how did those people kill them if they did not use a gun ? nobody ever tells me that part . i dont really care how because i kinda think dying by anothers hand is the issue . so to balance yourself before your audience could you please include the overall death rates ? its a sanity thing for me at this point . thanks .

10. well you seem to be correct about the cities there and i realize i failed to account for population growth earlier however the industrial revolution happened and that likely led to a large decline however the brits did do a lot of harm however india might have not developed as quickly . oh and btw the british raj was not a collony untill the 1850s so yeah that kinda changes the argument by a lot . now i have to make it clear tho i don ' t think what the brits did was moral meerely that it may have had possitive consequences .
   (ID: d7f47de640bd3d8659ad150b77fea8f843c60c26)

11. i think they did a reality show about that . a homeless man was given a lot of money . can ' t remember how much , but apparently he didn ' t really use it well . but we should try again and again .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

12. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .

13. in the long run , constant complaining may cost you more than you think . heyooooo . see what i did there ?
   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

14. wouldn ' t everyone be a little bit suspicious , do you think that some people might assume you did something and go after you or at least heavily question you ?
   (ID: 1476398f6c778fb461539e3f78b07720d4ceee83)

15. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .
   (ID: 535c3113ba487b9152c4b0adbe8c36822bc45ca4)

16. wow this was super interesting , you  re a good storyteller ! i don  t think you did anything wrong considering you were having your own experience and you couldn  t possibly read her mind if she was expecting more to come out of it but you didn  t do anything out of the ordinary . . in the meantime , don  t go into her restaurant until this is resolved
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

17. right ? i was so glad they played maud gone at that show , though i preferred their version at shaky knees the most . what did you think of the new stuff ?
   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

18. they shook your hand and smiled at you because their religion instructs them to do so . if you gave a neighborhood party and a guy from down the street came and did something disruptive , i think you would consider it disrespectful in the same way people here think you were being disrespectful . i ' m finding it hard to believe you are actually this dense .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

19. fallout digit super mutants . they think that they can roam the dc area and kill , capture , torture or   rape   make them more mutants mean they are the ' master race ' " oooh i am stronger than you so i can kill you ooh . how the hell did those assholes get out of digit and roam all the way to dc anyway ?
   (ID: 2731a84ac27fa3325bd3e2bf989471ffcb1456fe)

20. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
