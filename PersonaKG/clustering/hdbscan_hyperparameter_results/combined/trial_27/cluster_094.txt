6. they were trying to get rid of child porn on their site , but doing a blind generic sweep of just nsfw content with a weak bot didn  t do them any good . porn bits are still around , countless nsfw blogs , and i  m sure there are still pedos lurking on that site . i heard if they had been deleted off tumblr that they migrated to twitter
   (ID: 44eba9a0cf089ec615a77db5d42a2c01b63cb259)

7. just hide the entire game collecting mats and maybe find a treasure chest then sit in a baller and wait for all the other players to kill eachother . if you get lucky , they might die in the storm . gliders are nice to stay above someone without the worry for dying from falling . an rpg from above would be good . make sure you are rotating into the new safe area quickly and get established there . tldr  just camp lol
   (ID: 52e0e376c09b4862d8eea84ae547c3466a2aac4b)

   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

10. me too . but i stopped playing actively for about a year now just making sure i do my deadpool daily . just be patience and play hardcore with a good alliance and you should be fine .
   (ID: a1ba9b657b043ce2934cc0ae7b42c0a0bf3ba2fa)

11. i  m not really sure what an approved submitter does ? i mean , do they just focus on presenting content you are apart of that you yourself are not posting for us to enjoy ?
   (ID: ac0e0bfdedf04bf5199d4337ba10a43f13e1e49c)

12. i am not sure i do follow you . while i do not invalidate their experience , it ' s just that i mostly dislike how they say positivity will cure me of my illness .
   (ID: ab3c8c681660786b8cfd174d247a71a2d57b02b6)

13. no such thing as too much technology . just gotta make sure to keep the ai in line .
   (ID: 7ebdc00c75f6f836557e13d39a9efb279ed2ef7a)

14. just talk to everyone you can . sure you may have some weird convos that are a lil uncomfortable but then its done and you move on with life . the more comfortable you are talking to people the easier life will be
   (ID: 6eb8259d7d6b7ae101dda44ceaaf3b9edaab4fad)

15. she ' s only snored while i was conscious at least every few months before , last few weeks have been rough . i just sleep on the couch if it becomes a big issue . that sounds rough i guess , but i actually sleep at least as well if not better on the couch than in bed . i made sure to talk to her about it and make sure she knew there were no hard feelings and it was just a practical matter . i never start out there , and make a point to spend time talking to her and the bump before she goes to sleep every night , we just agreed i can bail if i need to .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

16. for the international muppets it ' s 4am in italy . for an article and tweet from different sources to be taken down or edited right now is just weird . i mean i can see night editor having access to the article but the twitter as well ? do journos share their twitter access ? i wouldn ' t . i don ' t have twitter so not digit  sure how it works
   (ID: 5ea29f01c8cdade4f178fd446d00647edc5fc70e)

17. if only . i ' m still not sure whether to sell it , take someone else , or just see if i can get any kind of money back .
   (ID: b42bcbaed0ea1f011b4d8c42d4ad9df732ecc5d5)

18. not sure what you meant by that ? i was just letting you dig your hole of assumptions until you finally called me a carnivore . felt good to throw that one back in your face .
   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

19. i ' m not sure how much it has to do with the time and how much it has to do with who your parents are . kids around me were doing plenty , i just had an overly controlling parental situation .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

20. that is not mainly what we are talking about . sure , occasionally you will wait on a foreign guest but that is not happening all the time . also , most people do tend to do some general research about a country before they just go set foot over there . the tipping culture in america is fairly well known and it  s depicted in their media regularly . but i stand by my original comment , if you are foreign and you come to america and learn about the customs and then say that that  s stupid and you  re not going to tip , you are a cheap asshole .
