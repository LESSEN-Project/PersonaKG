3. by the simplest and most accurate definition , it ' s a particular act that you personally sexualise more than just about anything else . it doesn ' t have to be innately sexual . just like sexualities and , closer in relation , fetishes , nobody knows why fantasies exist . but there is speculation that the reason they remain fantasies is because people rarely see themselves participating in real life .

6. no ma  am you are not worthless and even if nobody notices you have a lot to offer . it feels like nothing can get better or that nothing will ever change but it can . just hold on . you just keep holding on and you can get through this .

8. hey i mean if you like it all power to you , i ' m just lost on why it ' s so popular . maybe i just can ' t handle the neutron style

10. besides the digit  which are whales and the occasional anti  meta player , they are all going to look like yours . not being a party popper just don ' t see how this post benefits anyone at all . just my opinion .

11. yeah like it changed to the boy somehow being alive ? sorry if i ' m spoiling but the movie is shit so it just made no sense and the plot twist was just shit
   (ID: 09635643777fe30eb3750faad0e2ea7a607f855c)

12. yes . exactly . seems like you ' re really just wanting to be a victim here . just go out with the girls .

13. you cant really do anything about bad comms . in my experience , since console doesnt put you in chat automatically , the communication on there is awful . if they trash talk , just mute them . when i feel like shit in ranked i just either play other games or go to casual for a day or two and come back . its helps to just have a break for a bit . also , dont be super focused on you rank . its just a game after all so dont get super down if you cant get to your normal rank .
