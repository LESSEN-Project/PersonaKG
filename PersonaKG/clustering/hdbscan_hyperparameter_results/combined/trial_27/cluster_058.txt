2. not sure if you ' re being sarcastic or not , but it was just a question . i searched around and couldn ' t find much except what has already been mentioned . i figured i would ask the reddit community for their input . also i play on console , i don ' t think there are too many hacks out there to increase my magicka , but thank you for your suggestion .

3. i ' m sure this is true , even though i think a lot . my gf will sometimes ask what i ' m thinking about and i honestly say " nothing " or " just abstract shit without any meaning " but she always has words to describe her thoughts .

4. you seem to have normalized his shitty behavior at this point . there is no reason why you should be working full time  still taking on the domestic role . if you weren ' t working , sure . but that ' s just so fucking ridiculous and selfish , " tradition " be damned . it sucks you have kids with this guy imo . i think you should leave him .

7. i just think that people who get mad at trees and reindeer on government buildings are just getting mad at a part of christmas that pretty much the entire country celebrates , and isn ' t even remotely christian . gotcha . as a us citizen i pretty sure you ' re aware of our world champion status at getting butthurt . nothing official or otherwise will keep grumblers from grumbling . officially removing its religious status whatever that looks like would just provoke an even bigger response as i see it .  yeah , i ' m not trying to . i ' m starting to think i should have made my frame a little more concise as to what i meant by christmas being ' not christian ' . ya , this is the reason i think people are kind of lighting this idea up . it ' s what made me think the reasoning had an emotional basis   as stated it ' s a bit off  balanced .

8. the question was " what is the first thing you think of " . i didn ' t say that i was stating facts , it is just the first thing that comes to mind . i have never actually been there so i can ' t say anything for sure . that is just what i think of .

10. sure it would be creepy if the guys were random strangers . but op hasn ' t specified that . it could just be people she knows . in view that , i think it ' s alright . quick to jump to conclusions aren ' t we !

11. i didn  t find relief with omep  i didn  t find relief for the occasional heartburn but have the shortness of breath under control with zyrtec and singulair . which would make you think its just allergies . but i have every other symptom of lpr , and if i don  t watch what i eat the shortness of breath comes back . so it  s been a combo of avoiding my personal triggers and these meds are helping for sure
