13. well i didn ' t stop it because it was my own friends who did it i know they were terrible friends and i felt like if i did something to stop it then i would lose my so called friends .
   (ID: 480e1d5457cca32a54c00398823abca7aae20b86)

14. it ' s not a salty tyler fan . it ' s about the fact that we have all been watching , so we know exactly what he did and why he actually deserved to win . meanwhile the jury is blind because they haven ' t seen anything , and only get to vote off of what they hear in a digit minute speech .
   (ID: 169c51cc138a4161080068ded4dcf87863ffee36)

15. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

16. shit . that ' s a terrible thing to happen to you so young . if it helps , you ' re getting internet bro hugs from me . you should know that you ' re an absolute hero for talking her out of it . even if she ended up doing it later , you still gave it your all to save her . most people go through their lives without ever saving someone else ' s . most adults wouldn ' t know how to do what you did . you are a legend .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

17. you know . i ' m something of a scientist my self . and i wanna ask you  did you come to this conclusion after kowalski analysis ? no . you don ' t wanna tell me ? all right then keep your secrets to yourself . amen brothers . can i get digit likes . oops sorry , i guess we don ' t do that here .
   (ID: 4381fa1a63289663c5683187c0d07eadf81abfc2)

18. i have seen it and for all we know the kid attacked him first , thenkid did show his willingness to attack unprovoked and the video only started when the fight broke out so we have no idea pf the context behind it .
   (ID: d7f47de640bd3d8659ad150b77fea8f843c60c26)

19. i still remember back when this thing happened as a child while listening to that old song on this old device that nobody uses anymore . the last time i did this other thing was back when we still did this usual thing . these kids nowadays don ' t know what this thing is and how to do that other thing .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

20. getting offended and correcting others everytime from your horse doesn ' t make you superior over others . i know he did something wrong and hasn ' t repeated that since but the media should understand that they can do something better by raising awareness on what ' s happening around the world rather than attacking a man over petty issues
