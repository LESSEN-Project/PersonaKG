6. yeah people get so weird about it . when i came back after living a few years abroad and be asking my friends how much their casofa  etc cost i  d be greeted by utter awkwardness . i think it  s because in france there is a general hate towards rich people so people don  t want to come across as  wealthy  if they spent a lot on an item .

   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

11. related  very nostalgic even about periods of time that came before i was born , want to and want others to adhere to traditionally prescribed rules for the most part , think society should be much more structured than it is , keep tidy and organized personal spaces unrelated  prefer the woman i ' m with to take the lead in relationships , easily initiate conversations with strangers
   (ID: 22f14b68675078048f36403bb14291f2d10864a3)

   (ID: 7008f149db59fea91167255eafa8bc84beab0f01)

13. that ' s what they want you to think !
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

14. i think the division is really individual . i believe in a social democratic society which benefits everyone with some laissez  faire social spheres where there  s a general decorum . if a thoroughly studied , evidence based concept can  t be discussed or legislated without fist fights in the street , it  s not worth discussing at all ! but there are tonnes of people who want more autocratic , paternalistic state interventions on both sides of the aisle . i think all of them are crazy as individuals . face  with  tears  of  joy unlike what either extreme believes , becoming insular and being the loudest person in the room doesn  t make them the smartest or the most right .
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)

15. make the difference between what you really need and what you want . for the want , don ' t buy immediately , think about it , would that really make you happy ? often it ' s only a happy boost at buying time , an instant gratification and nothing else . many would think it ' s miserable life but it ' s all the opposite , the want i end up buying are things i really want .
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

16. yes , i think you should if transitioning is what you want to do . your primary goal should be self preservation , and keeping your dad happy shouldn ' t come before that .
   (ID: 08122a9a2a4681e85c950e276210d33c3d0a8f96)

17. i use my brain too much , in other words i think about what i want to say for several hours and then end up needing to do something else before i say it .
   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

18. this made me nauseous , not that i think it could happen but they fact that people actually want this to happen
   (ID: 23db574d60be3ebd64ccd49ceb2b7a6ca7eff040)

19. let it slide off you . why would you care whether someone thinks you are unmanly or creepy . if they think so , let them think so . it should have no influence on you whatsoever . aren ' t you a man going their own way ? exactly doing that ? not caring what people think of the choices you make and doing whatever you want to do anyway ? that ' s exactly what mgtow is about for me .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

20. that ' s arguable . think what you want
