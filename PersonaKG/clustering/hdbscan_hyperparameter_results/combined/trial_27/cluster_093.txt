1. well you are setting yourself up for a fall . you said she  s super religious , this will not end well for you . she will either make you go to some other crazy jesus freak that will attempt to rid these devils from you , lol , or she will blow a nut just like you said she does and call you a fag and want you to get out . now sit back and take all that in because you are heading down a path that has no positive outcome for you . sorry . you already said who she is . good luck dude .

2. its was my first one too , so i recommend you jojo ' s bizarre adventure , mob psycho digit and overlord . jojo ' s is a must have for anime fans . just watch it even if the first episodes are more or less bad . if you liked one punch man you will also like mob . that all i want to say to that . try overlord if you want something new .

4. they ' re just doodles i felt like sharing with the sub . there ' s plenty of great fan art out there , so go look at that if you want something more professional . don ' t gatekeep what other people can post .

5. honestly i could make the value whatever i want it to be since air is just floating out there and has no production cost . but i feel like i could single handedly crash the economy by charging people for every breath

6. also i am deleting this post now since it ' s just spamming up the sub and the mods don ' t want shit like this on here thanks for wasting more of everyone ' s time on here

7. it is but it ' s better like that , plus if i really don ' t want to continue i just break up and appreciate my privacy again until the depression comes back .

8. we don ' t want to stop killing each other , we just want to look like we care about people while killing them .

9. no offence taken , it ' s not just about the pvp , it ' s also about farming , which is fine if that ' s how others want to play . i was of the understanding that fw was about conflict and dominating the enemy , this can be pretty hard if the enemy just warps off when i turn up , if you ' re at ' war ' then be at ' war ' . i can understand why these ideas may not be for you in particular , but maybe , just maybe , a lot of others may be just as frustrated as me and actually want to have some gf ' s . i like different points of view as sometimes brilliant ideas can evolve , how  what would you like to see done to improve fw ?

10. all i really want out of an update would be the ability to buy an actual mansion , like michael ' s house or something like it . price it digit , digit million , whatever , i just want to work towards it

11. i feel the same way , i guess i just don  t want her to talk shit like , my sorry ass bf didn  t get me shit for md lol

12. you may want to play around with this idea  these gems are obviously powerful . there are many creatures in the world that want that power for their own ends , or simply just to acquire it for themselves . a powerful gem will attract interest from some people and creatures . a group of them being collected and held in the same area will attract them like a magnet . so just because your pc ' s are looking for them , doesn ' t mean there isn ' t someones else too .

13. i typically find it easier to show them a picture if i want a new style . if i want a trim i just say something like " a digit fade on the sides and just the tips off the top "

14. it was mostly just talk , and they acted like they were showing what the people want , even though a lot of people wanted pewdiepie to be in it , or the whole jake paul suicide forest ordeal .

15. no . none would even help me the day i left my debit card at home . i doubt they would help me out with anything else . i ' m just tired of living like this . i just want it to be over with already .
