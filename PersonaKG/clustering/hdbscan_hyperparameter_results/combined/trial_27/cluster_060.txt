1. i don ' t know what you mean by the second part of your question . some kind of inside joke i don ' t get perhaps ? in any case , i ' ve already said too much  it ' s her story and i have no right talking about it . i regret saying anything in fact .

2. mhm indeed . i ' ve been trying to get a reaction out of my doctor for years , she ' s not cared once that i ' ve yelled every obscenity in the book . i don ' t know how she didn ' t take offense to the " n word " , especially since she is black herself , but my doctor is , without a doubt , one of the coolest people i know .

5. if you  ve verified that then cps could be an option . it  s always possible that it  s starved for air . somewhere there  s an imbalance of spark , fuel , and air causing the no start issue . once you know the engine is getting all of them then you can go through and check sensors .
   (ID: e7516540d2045135f43a4a7c61f0bd88856c8ff4)

   (ID: b7515713c74346e74e6961342ed7324a056c09e6)

   (ID: e84ec39cf97c9609b6feb31cbaab5faf551f372d)

14. minnesotan here . why were you speeding in wisconsin and how fast ? i ask because , at least in the circle of people i know , everyone knows you don ' t speed in wisconsin . i ' ve heard too many stories of people on digit getting pulled over .

   (ID: 57566e418da3ba7bb3e33d1def44eaef175b88e9)

17. it ' s been implied that the infertility problems are due to pollution and bad farming practices . during the visit by the mexican delegates i remember either fred or serena talking about the improved pollution problem . also in flashbacks to the red center we see aunt lydia talking about pollution lowering the birthrate and she also pins some blame on women who can give birth but refuse by taking birth control or aborting . edit to add  i ' ve read the book too and know it was much more nuanced than that . my comment is based off what information they ' ve given us in the show so far .
   (ID: e387b7eddf8ab01e3dd767dc2f5ca52494fbe9b0)

18. what do you do when the kid realizes that you ' re a liar , and that they ' ve been duped by you and know that you can ' t be taken at your word ?
   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

19. first of all , a lot of people don ' t have online , so that ' s a factor . second of all , i believe the matchmaking system is based a bit on location , so that may be something . all i know is i ' ve never had a problem with getting people in a lobby , and i often find it hard because i invite my friends to my session , but the lobby is often full .
   (ID: 89c3606d2dfc5d2a2da97fb49ddc1894f8bf330f)

20. life has to take it ' s course . death is part of it . i ' ve watched all pet semetary movies to know that bringing back a dead person is no good .
