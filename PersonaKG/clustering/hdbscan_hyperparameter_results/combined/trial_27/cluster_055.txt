   (ID: 28b40f8090abf393e7d7a7cf1772fb2c16d434a1)

   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

6. lol i didn  t really ask , but it is cute you think it  s worth flaunting over a teenager assuming you  re pathetically in your 30s as your name indicates . but i  m really not even a bad student at all which makes this hilarious . keep going , you can find more i know you can
   (ID: 2401680976bbdfe87278659ff11173d22161b22d)

   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

8. how cute , you think you know a thing about what people go through . try being bullied and shunned to an extent at digit different schools , 3rd grade until i went to college . oh , and you would all collectively call me a normie because i have an intimate relationship . don ' t assume you know a damn thing about any person who posts here because you simply dont .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

9. none . i think it ' s ridiculous to cry over the death of someone you don ' t know .
   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

11. i don  t think it would take that long . obviously some will not make it but most people know basic survival . people will gather in groups and survive together .
   (ID: 83ed088161a0acc5bb20774e9e10435e55e88737)

12. i hate when people call women hoes . what makes you think being a " hoe " is a bad thing ? what makes a hoe ? also how do they know you ' re a hoe ?
   (ID: c50abefedeeb0c19f834b1ebb28634054bccee26)

13. i think it  s all of the facts that are not fiction . it breaks the fourth wall and if you  re the inquisitive type it kind of sucks you in and involves you . the book has a life of its own , but the reel world facts and history are there to be pursued further . you get this all the time with nonfiction of course , but when fiction does it too , especially a real page  turner , it  s really cool . you know of any others ?
   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

14. in what way ? wanting to know what specific thing you think makes it shitty .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

15. all i know really is that if it doesn  t get better somehow , you should definitely think about moving jobs as shit and unfair as that is because my god happiness and good mental health is so so important !
   (ID: 91fce15f80cee843edc2c92559e78e027c94f5d0)

16. sometimes i think that no matter how hard our life is , no matter how much we suffer or put others in pain , the people who have passed on are laughing because they know it doesn ' t matter and nothing matters in life because there ' s something else that ' s better for everyone once we pass on . as far as i know , death only affects those that are living .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

17. i think it ' s more of a confidence issue for me . if he makes the first move than i know that he likes  wants me rather than me taking the chance and getting rejected . although i have asked out all of my past boyfriends so i don ' t require it .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

18. come on now , you know what you " should " think , you ' re on the atheist site for goodness sake .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

19. i dont know about pudding because even if she becomes good she doesnt have any purpose in strawhat crew but saying that katakuri will be joining im thinking u are trolling otherwise he is the strongest after big mom and lets say her security guard and if u say about her realitonship with the kids i think is the same will all of them they fear her and they are tools for her acomplishments , so katakuri doesnt seem mistreated or anything .
   (ID: 28b40f8090abf393e7d7a7cf1772fb2c16d434a1)

20. i don ' t know if i ' m ready for the next chapter . i don ' t think my heart can handle it .
