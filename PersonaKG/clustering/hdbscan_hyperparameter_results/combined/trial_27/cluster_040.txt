1. this is enlightened . complaining is not the same as soliciting advice . so often a child ' s minor complaint about something gets a response telling them what they did wrong , just making the kid feel bad .
   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

2. hahaha . i did this at work , simply tried to force a fart that wasn ' t a fart . ended up running home and yelling to my roommates " omg i literally just shat myself " . then i walk into my room and see my landlord showing some of my friends the house .
   (ID: 5d6cecafd26473d96b39b973965364f09d4d41f1)

3. but reincarnation is a supernatural occurrence that ' s only based in religion . the closest to what you are describing is jainism . it ' s still a religion though . i ' m just busting your chops though . all great fictional stories use selective liberties with facts . don ' t let my nitpicking screw with your story ideas . if all authors did that nothing would get written .
   (ID: 25ac51284c94eb6c58e189bbefc7f2bb9bb9e1b5)

4. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

5. well here is where you went wrong . you jumped into water with sharks ! what else did you expect ? these arent dogs , cats , or any other animal human have domesticated . this shouldn ' t be news , just a reminder if you take a risk expect to get bit .
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

6. what ' s wrong with me ? is it possible that at the very same time you were putting your brother through college i was watching my uncle die from heroin addiction ? with zero resources to help him . none . at all . there is a very very clear difference here . why were you on foodstamps while your 8th generation family was gathering funds ? but yes , someone did give you something , you said it yourself , you fell into a lot of money . you ' re just pretending you didn ' t . again , because in your mind there is a economic difference , it ' s the same thing . it isn ' t but , we ' re done . i ' m not interested in convincing you of anything . i don ' t owe you anything
   (ID: cca2db8a0bcb7aff323abdba1f381d7388c9f713)

7. you might have seen this thing where people link theydidthemonstermath after someone links theydidthemath , as in , " they did the mash  they did the monster mash " the song idk why everyone ' s downvoting , maybe they just dont have a sense of humor
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

8. i ' m french and lots consider that we won the ww2 because the uk and the us did and they were on our side but actually . they just don ' t accept losing haha
   (ID: a74790331386859adbbd886bd045a7391e95948c)

9. yeah but why tf did you decide to post this on here . i support the lgbtq community but jeez man , chill out and talk about that stuff someone else . it  s just a meme
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

10. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

11. what the hell happened to jeff ' s face ? did he get plastic surgery or is it just extra make up ?
   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

12. good choice of song . it makes me wanna smash shit from excitement . in fact , i just did . a chair .
   (ID: 164327be87300906de16932661437c5b2b671c9d)

13. i just had three days off ! i visited my grandparents , met with a friend for coffee , did some baking , cleaned the house and played an unreasonable amount of stardew valley
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

14. did you read what you just typed ? if something has low odds and it happens it is generally considered lucky . doesn ' t always have to be , for example , two digit stars to be lucky . edit  yes i ' m aware that you could also be unlucky in this same manner . but i would not consider this to be unlucky .
   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

15. fair enough . i was just trying to follow the guide i listed . he says wind lizardman is good for dots , which i ' m lacking in . my acasis isn ' t fully skilled up and doesn ' t have great accuracy to land her dots but i did get her third skill level ' d up which was great .
   (ID: bd951a475ac46323d867ac35ccf0cb4b3e756f83)

16. what kind of real surprise did his parents have planned anyway ? just get on this plane . you won ' t need any clothes or money . don ' t worry , we ' re totally not selling you into human trafficking . well , see ya later . forever .
   (ID: dc639446b154d74c8655191b5a755643abd00c2d)

17. those " weird looks " are just how wizards look at each other , jackass , which you would have known if you were a real wizard ! the important science question here is how did a fake wizard ever end up with a real princess ?
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

18. wow this must be one of the most arrogant things i ever read . so basically you are saying that grrm and d  d are not good enough story tellers plus us hard core fans are too stupid to pick up hints in the show unless you the leaker god start a discussion about them in order for us to be prepared for the bad writing and wouldn ' t get it without your help ? how many people did you just insult with this arrogant comment .
   (ID: 5ea29f01c8cdade4f178fd446d00647edc5fc70e)

19. merch is not a fanbase , but again my point about the underlying story has to make some sense to you . also america is obsessed with junk media , not all but the majority pushes this fanbase towards fringe . i apologise to those who didn ' t get that . if you have ever looked at tik tok or whatever for more than digit minutes you are probably going to still be offended . also just being extra anal , those two stores do nothing but by merch for new games so i would be curious how well kh sells compared to something for scale . i ' m not doubting it did well , just curious .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

20. most of the time the  sass  is unintentional and  talking back  is often just asking for clarification about what i actually did wrong and trying to explain my point of view .
