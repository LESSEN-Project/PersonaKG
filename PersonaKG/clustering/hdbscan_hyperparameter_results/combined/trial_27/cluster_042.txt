6. a friend of mine was being a dick on a constant daily basis after a recent event happened . like he would criticize every thing i did like how i played a game or ate food or even laughed . it bothered him so much he had to say something harsh every damn minute . but his comments pissed me off so much after a few months that one day i snapped and screamed in front of all our friends " diego you became a fucking asshole ever since your dad died " and there my moment was .
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

7. i digit  agree , confidence is everything ! many times people didn  t realize how short i actually am hell , some didn  t realize i was shorter than them sometimes because i did the same made it a non  issue and where i lacked  i made up as well . the more you don  t care or act like you don  t care , the more other people will take the same attitude . i admire your attitude bro !

9. if you do something in an area , make it cleaner than it was before you did the thing . like if you cook , clean the kitchen so it looks a little better than before
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

   (ID: 9e8a44f7c55ebce4785906436a033b33a1ccb949)

11. if you don  t enjoy it and find no meaning from it at all from reading the book twice , then why are you attempting to force yourself to enjoy it through people who did ? if you didn  t like it then that should be the end of it , no ?
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

12. ' toilet ' is a lower middle  class thing to say . ' non u ' . if you ' re middle class , its a lavatory . if you ' re posh  its a ' loo ' . if you ' re lower class its a bog or a lav . its complicated . betjeman did a great poem sending up some horrible nouveau riche woman who said things like ' serviette ' instead of the more ' proper ' ' napkin ' . edit  not larkin  betjeman . as if anybody cares ! its that sort of thing .
   (ID: 54c02bf73569d6b7f5a88c3d841a214eee1a4d14)

13. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .
   (ID: 95c90f0b7430996843a42a4f365667a13e4c2eb5)

14. hey , that  s really cool . have you still kept your culture ? what was it like for your children growing up ? did they have to learn aramaic ?
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

15. did you forget the bit where canada has actual bears ? like the proper man killing and eating type ? canada is cold as fuck and it has bears . i will stick with the snakes thanks mate .
   (ID: fb5e95e954b3ee83c39276138f0fa3b854970db4)

16. that ' s pretty neutral , it ' s always best to be positive and not talk about what you didn ' t like but what you did like . for instance , your old boss might have been a real hard ass , riding you all day . instead of saying that you could say your old boss was really involved in my day to day tasks and was really focused on the job getting done . i learned a lot from him . this is not a lie and it spins the situation in a positive light .
   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

17. that ' s horrible ! law should protect people no matter what , not allowing to hurt them legally . i ' m from poland . my physics teacher is roasting and disrespecting whole lgbt  and other minorities all the time . he ' d better teach us physics but noooo . he ' s been teaching in this school for years and it seems nobody ever complained about him to the headteachers , or they did but it had no effect . i guess there are multiple teachers like him here . even wort ones
   (ID: 337350fc54133b327ce0d6d9f385f82a2a6738cf)

18. how do you answer the question that always seems to get beat like a dead horse when i cosplay . how did your character end up at the convention ?
   (ID: 03d15a94c7d0f2138a5e5c0cf7e503c341abbf78)

19. did you phrase her like a question ?
   (ID: aaee7c28c6f1f83a427cf3dccf635bb78656a19d)

20. why does the spiderman suit look like it ' s xxxl ? did you steal it from a poor fat kid ?
