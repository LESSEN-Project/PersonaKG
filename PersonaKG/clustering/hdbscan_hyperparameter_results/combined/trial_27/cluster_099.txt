2. thank you so much for sharing . honestly the fb groups made me wonder if i wasn  t worried enough about keratoconus . it made me question if i wasnt taking keratoconus serious . post referring to  how much do you miss your life before keratoconus  were really there to bring people down no lift them up thankfully with comments like yours il realize like im not the only who see keratoconus as something that sucks but i also making sure it doesn  t control my everyday life .

3. sounds like you wanna get back with him . why are you asking this question is the real question . pretty sure this violates several rules of this sub .
   (ID: 76442d997e7f64c10223aeac0f4ff8af70ff9dde)

4. sounds like you ' re pretty dang unlucky . haven ' t changed mine in like , almost a year . are you sure there isn ' t anything blocking the signal sometimes ? if not , i ' d suggest getting rechargeable batteries .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

5. don ' t get it if you ' re not sure you ' re going to like it . remember you can back out anytime . even when they put the stencil on and it ' s not what you really wanted , speak up .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

6. yeast . i ' m pretty sure i could do up a solid diet of beer and bread  based foods like sandwiches ! ha !
   (ID: f3657f57aa348caf1c32ec21ef139ea41a45dc29)

7. damn that sucks that sounds like a really fun concert ski and juice wrld are great performers . im sure you will have fun anyway .
   (ID: 701f8001d10c04dcd53d9b13ab2a896b452e50f7)

8. right , i can see why you would make that decision . i was thinking about the dark base too but i wasn ' t really sure about it . is it any good ? what can i expect from a case like that ?
   (ID: 2971f819c4d7400b9fa7806434e9037b6af4dfae)

9. i ' m not sure about how much you ' d need every day but you can certainly become more tolerant of peppers until you can eat them like any other food . you essentially build up a resistance to the spice of it and become , as it were , immune to spicy foods if you do it enough .
   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

10. google anything you are not sure about , every little thing . digit  of the time you find the answer . it seems like common sense but most people never do it .

11. science doesn ' t have to give any explanation , but it could point out the reasons why someone is ' messed up socially ' which would be the first good step towards change . better than the typical religious explanation which is something like ' you need jesus in your life ! that ' s why you are messed up ! let ' s pray together ! ' and ' purpose ' in life ? that ' s easy . it ' s whatever you decide it is . sure , it might be hard deciding , but in the end it is still your choice to make .

12. telemarketer . if they can sell well , it would be pretty simple to have a low level secretary scan the approved calls and type out the critical information . consulting , if they have extensive previous experience in a field , reviewing projects can be quite valuable . public speaking . people will hire him to talk about how he overcame is hardship even though he only overcame it because people are willing to pay to see him talk about overcoming it . kind of a self fulfilling prophecy all for the entertainment of others by capitalizing on his disability . basically a modern day freak show with better pay , to put it in less politically correct terms i am sure there are other jobs that can be handled depending on exactly his level of disability . does he have any slight motion in extremities ? has he learned any systems for people with his disability like eye tracking or other controls like head or breathing based or speech based computer controls ?

13. couldn  t agree with you more . yes it wasn  t a perfect remake but it was pretty damn close in my books . if people don  t like remakes , i get that . but i can  t understand why people on reddit hate on this movie otherwise . i  m not sure what people who didn  t like it would have changed . the video said jungle book was better ? how ? they were almost the same in turns of animation . i liked it . my friends liked it . like you said the original will always be number one in my heart . but this was a damn fine movie in its own right .
