1. the best advice i can give to you is to either talk to your friend , let them know how you feel and give them the chance to become aware that their behavior is bothering you , or do nothing and slowly back away from the friendship . i am in a similar boat myself . as friends we should be able to voice our opinions and concerns within our friendships and not worry that the other will become defensive or misinterpret our motivations , but sometimes it just doesn ' t work that way because of bias or prejudice or just plain ol ' human error and that ' s when it ' s time to step back . good luck !

2. as a guy , i can tell you , he  s not stopping . it  s not a matter of you or the other girls , it  s a change . i agree that the pictures over video is probably i  m the minority but to each their own . unless you  re always there to have sex when he  s horny , probably nothing you can do about it . the best thing to do is just what you have , express your discomfort and how you feel and leave it alone . let him work through and compromise for you , or not . its not worth starting a fight , not for either party . i hope your bf calms down on it though so you feel more comfy , good luck .

3. we all kind of rely on each other to be honest . i play all roles and i feel there should just be more respect , and more competency between them . healers keep everyone alive yes but a good tank stops everyone else taking damage . without the tank you would be equally screwed . likewise good dps will kill things so you ' re not fighting a war of mana . they should interrupt and stay out of danger . what i am trying to say is that everyone should work together , show some support and learn your class so you can adapt quickly . as soon as one of these digit roles thinks they are more valuable or don ' t have to try as hard the whole thing fails .

4. we are particularly good listeners by nature so that ' s why people tend to dump their problems on us . also , i feel we tend to understand and put ourselves in their position thus being able to say what we might do to help improve the situation . personally speaking , if a friend asks me how i ' m doing i just say i ' m fine since i feel my problems are mine and i don ' t like unwanted advice . so , if i were you i ' d learn how to tune out when people start wittering on about their problems or make yourself unavailable for a while . hope it gets better for you .

5. thanks friend . i liked your poem . i am in the general habit of cutting much . i say lose traveled because life traveled nowhere fast is cliche and doing something so simple as i suggested freshens the idea and can challenge a reader in a good way . i also don ' t like a poem laden with prepositions , hence the absence of between . these are all just opinions from your readers , which after some trolling , i feel this subreddit lacks at least quality opinions  input

6. hum , talk to him and tell him how you feel , your fears , what you want and what you expect of the future with him , that you live him if you do . and ask him if he ' s willing to be there and take the compromise with you to make it work . depending on the answer just do what it ' s best for you and the baby . it ' s better to leave on time than stay and get more hurt . good luck !
