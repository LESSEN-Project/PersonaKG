1. i 'd say pictures do n't really do it justice , but here 's the best i could get .
   (ID: NietzschesUbermensch)

Total from this dataset: 8

1. i don ' t really have anything to say , but you ' ve put a smile on your face for having personal responsibility . i can ' t sympathize with the ' previously religious ' part , but for the rest , you ' re not alone . being responsible for your own actions sucks sometimes .

2. okay , then in answer to your question i would say that if you actually want to have sex then you might develop some kind of negative hang up about penis size but there are tonnes of ways to pleasure someone besides that so it shouldn ' t really have a negative affect .

3. depends how urgently you need an extra merge for scoring purposes . if this gets you over some arena tier threshold or makes it a lot easier , i ' d say merge . but as you said ,  digit merge doesn ' t do much in itself so i ' d say fodder her if you really want to do that build .

4. male im not really friends with any girls , but i do know that a ton of stuff i say is a joke , and even sometimes ill give actual advice in a half joking way , its weird . something like " how about you dont please " cant think of any off the top of my head and also , yes , i hear tons of fucked up things but dont really get offended at any of it , confirming your point . . waait so are girls really that boring ?

5. i haven ' t heard of that book . i wonder if even if they read it if they would realize what they ' re in for . they are such amazing , hard  working people that are in it so deep that to admit defeat . well . i just don ' t think they could do it . wouldn ' t it be so embarrassing to say you tried and gulp failed . it really really makes me so sad for them . and i agree , it sounds like a book that could be quite dry , but i bet it would actually be quite interesting if you know someone personally involved . i would probably cry for them .

6. so you keep telling me , i must have really made you angry with my opinion . didn ' t know it would shake you so badly . at the point you just parrot what i say while putting crying emojis in it i would really call it a conversation .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

7. i hate how they all say  leave a like it really helps me out  like i get it , i do , but it  s really annoying .
   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

8. darksouls was the most challenging game i ' ve played in past decade , and imo is one of the best games ever made , so hyped they might remaster it next year . as an emotional wreck of a human being and welding a heart so deep one could say it ' s . the dark , the game and stories of the npcs really hit me hard .
