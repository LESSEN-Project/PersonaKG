1. make the difference between what you really need and what you want . for the want , don ' t buy immediately , think about it , would that really make you happy ? often it ' s only a happy boost at buying time , an instant gratification and nothing else . many would think it ' s miserable life but it ' s all the opposite , the want i end up buying are things i really want .

2. compromise . you need to find a way for both of you to get a little of what you want . often time teenagers are completely oblivious to what they really need as support and same goes for parents not knowing where an appropriate line should be drawn usually out of fear or anxiety for their child  s well being you may see improvement if you take on more responsibility around the home or in the community  but that  s only a vague suggestion because i have no idea about your specific circumstances .
