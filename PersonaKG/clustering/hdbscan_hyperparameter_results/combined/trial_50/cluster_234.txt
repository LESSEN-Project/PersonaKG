2. i agree with this digit  . when i put my blinker on to get over , more than half the time , the person i ' m trying to get over in front of speeds up to stop me from getting over . so i just quit using them .

3. wow ! that ' s a lot lol thank you . i own a aspire breeze and it says on the packaging that i should not go over 70vg or 6mg . so after reading this i could go past digit but it would just take more time to wick ?

4. with your husband ' s permission , you could start a blog and write about your experiences or just post here every monday and tell us about it . you could spend time researching ideas for next weekend . maybe learn to deep throat or other creative skills he might appreciate . shop for some sex toys . i like the blog idea , though .

5. yes it sucks and having digit  learnings to complete is a bit much . they are there for a reason and if you just skip through without retaining any if the knowlage idk what kind of employee you would be . just take them one at a time .
