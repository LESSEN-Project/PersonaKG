1. i know its not so easy to do when shit like this happens but . do people who do this not train themselves to get out of this situation ? as i understand you are supposed to roll onto your front , get your ice axe thats tied to you and kinda use it as an anchor ? i mean there were parts there where it seemed like he was just sitting up like he was on a slide

3. aren  t most guys in porn pretty desperate people ? i mean , if you have any sort of other skill or talent , do not have a criminal record , no visible tattoos , and get along with others , you can probably get a legit job instead of porn .

5. i mean people sometimes name their kids after traits or values , like charity and patience , so it ' s not totally implausible that someone might use celibate . i personally wouldn ' t . a couple of google searches seem to suggest that this is not a thing .

7. i like seeing other people progress , and its inspiring to some people . no hate towards you op , but please realise that not everyone thinks like you and just because you dont like it , doesnt mean everyone doesnt like it . thinking like this is how you get toxic people who shame anyone different not accusing you of this tho
