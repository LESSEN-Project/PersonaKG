2. our commanders does the same thing and i understand why are they so pumped when giving out orders . if you are in the middle of a fight , he  she doesn ' t really have time to type out orders specially if the group was portal bombed . so at least the people in the channel gets the right instruction so that they could react appropriately . sometimes our guild run havoc groups when we don ' t feel like joining the zerg and i sometimes speak rapidly when we are in the middle of a scuffle . it ' s not much scolding but more of excitement specially if you can feel you can wipe the enemy zerg .
