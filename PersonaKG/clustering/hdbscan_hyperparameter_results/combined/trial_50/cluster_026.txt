1. hey . firstly you need to speak to someone be it a doctor or the samaritans , someone . secondly why are you looking up reasons instead of looking inwards and seeing what the actual issue is . do you have depression or something that maybe people around you don ' t know how to handle ? what kind of person are you ? are you kind ? thoughtful ? generous with your time ? empathetic ? honest ? nice ? these are all traits that people like . or are you selfish ? negative ? deceitful ? apathetic ? narcissistic ? irresponsible ? egotistical ? you can change your behaviour and your characteristics . you are not always going to be the person you perceive yourself to be now . everyone has the potential to change and grow . believe in yourself . only you have the ability to make yourself happy . don ' t depend on others to validate you . mind yourself .

2. it wouldn  t be a bad idea to have an older student tutor you . does your school have a peer tutoring program ? lots of people struggle with math and geometry takes a lot of understanding about different shapes as well as a lot of equations . it could be as simple as you simply don  t understand how it  s being explained to you and you need a new perspective . if you  re not willing to get a tutor you  re going to have to put in double time on studying . write and rewrite problems and how to solve them until you understand how you get the answer correct . you can do it ! it just might not be easy

3. rifle training was once taught in school . they even had competitive shooting teams . firearms in america have been part of ordinary life for a long time . it is only recently that mass shootings have become a problem . the number of shootings is increasing , while the number of gun owners is going down . this suggests that guns are not the problem . so , what is the problem ? what changed ? is it a breakdown of family values ? or that we no longer teach civic duty and citizenship ? is society encouraging a sense of hopelessness , futility , and cynicism to the point that we devalue human life ? i don ' t really know what the answer is , but it appears that there is too much fighting for enough people to think about what it might be , in order to make a change .

4. can i let you in on a little secret ? and it ' s going to make a lot of people who make their living killing them angry , but you could kill a werewolf with a little lead . 22lr bullet or even a particularly sharp stick if you knew what you where about . see here is the thing yeah silver will give them a nasty bout of the anaphylactic shock and otherwise they heal pretty quick , and going back human fixes most of what ever other problems are left , but they are still flesh and blood . now don ' t get me wrong they have the durability of a pcp addict on meth , but still flesh and blood . if you let enough blood out or put a whole in something they can ' t live long enough to heal they will die . so if you can put a bullet through the base of the brain , the aorta , or believe it or not even the old top of the double boiler they will go down and stay down . however , here is the problem . most people struggle to make that shot on bambi , when they are in no danger , the deer is completely unaware , and the shot is short and static . this is why you got jackalopes out there thinking you need a digit win mag or an anti material rifle to tip over a little ol ' deer . now imagine instead of bambie you are trying to make a precision shot while also being charged by an digit foot tall slavering monster . that does not make your shooting better , but as any one who ' s ever spent any time around a hunting camp knows a hunter never misses a shot was always their lousy gear . thus the myth you " need " silver bullets . that being said please use silver bullets . its safer for you cleaner for them . every one comes out better .

5. yeah , at my lgs , i don ' t have a regular time i can make it in , so i have about digit people where i grab whoever is avail to make a pod . i have about digit decks , pretty much at digit differing power levels including digit cedh deck , so i always know i can match what their bringing to the table . i know the people who have lower powered decks , so i offer mine to use if their deck isn ' t going to keep up . it helps a lot in making balanced pods . so , all i ' m really saying , is you can build and recommend someone borrow your interesting decks for everyone ' s benefit .

6. people are raised in a certain way and if everyone around you thinks that way throughout your time living there it  s really hard to be critical of that way of thinking because you  d be going against everything everyone you know believes , in short , peer pressure on a larger scale

7. i absolutely agree with all your points . especially about letting the kids wander away . but i love the show for the zombies . need more zombies ! on the flip side , i do believe that the characters really are a pathetic group that don ' t think rationally . i suppose after their world is turned upside down with so much death and destruction , they don ' t think , plan , and " survive " as well as we do in the comfort of our living room chairs . but the drawback to that as a drama series is that i lose sympathy for them , and start not caring what happens to them . in fact , i start waiting for them to get picked off by the zombies and start cheering for the undead . one thing i noticed was there were a lot more dead people this time , and they were quite rotted away  dried husks . i understand people rotting  bloating , but would they be so dried out ? atlanta is not exactly a dry desert environment . has the zombie invasion been going on for that long ? as for the radiator hose , i had an old chevy vega that broke a hose on a cross country trip . i fixed it with hose tape but it would only last digit miles before it broke again . so yeah , once your hose is shot , it ' ll keep disintegrating until you can replace it . but what bothers me , there are so many abandoned vehicles on the road , couldn ' t they switch to something better than an rv ?
