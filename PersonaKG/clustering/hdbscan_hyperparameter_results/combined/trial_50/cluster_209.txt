1. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .

2. wait i have another question , sorry for bugging you , but should i just say  hey  or should i open up and go straight to the problem ?

4. i can answer this despite being an english speaker . it ' s because you haven ' t been taught that cuss words in other languages are just as bad . we never snuck around our parents to say " mierda " , unless of course you ' re spanish , so yeah . it ' s just that it wasn ' t drilled into your head like it is with your own version of the word . like americans using bollocks

5. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting

6. i would like to say loyalty but in all honesty it ' s probably just as simple as my capacity to relate to them overall . maybe you could call that open mindedness .

7. those are the same bitches that add you to a group chat with their friends just to say  i  m gunna cut your dick off if you hurt her
   (ID: cd907372aff0871825a64e977822586e3bb0ecb7)

8. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

10. having to take all the hate and persecution yes i just used that word that femenists throw at men . i dedicate lost of energy to not doing what they say but they never hear or care . its a battle you cant win and its trash
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

11. you can  t hate on under the bridge or dani california . you just can  t . also  any true music fan knows that they peaked in the 80s .  what a fucking douchey thing to say
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

12. i  m getting one that isn  t a full controller but offers triggers so i can switch my shoot  aim button on pubg to be where they press . i  d say your best shot is to just search game controller for phone and see what would fit you best
