1. hahahahaha . no buddy . telling someone words is not a threat to them . actually committing acts is a threat to them . they have shown time and time again that they are willing to actually kill people . stop fucking defending these fucks . they ' re scum . and they deserve everything that is coming to them .

2. i ' m sorry you hate dogs ? people coming together to save a life , or give more time , is somehow a bad thing because its not human life ? this makes zero sense to me . i know people who have spent just as much if not more on their pets . you do what you can for those you love .

3. we can go outside and still not talk to people . remaining " quiet and invisible " while socialising gives us time to observe people . for me , that makes it easier to see if we ' d have anything in common and so be able to have a proper conversation . having lots of inconsequential small talk with numerous people is very tiring for me . i want a conversation that stimulates my brain .

4. i dont get it . normal people ? of reddit ? how do you look in both eyes at the same time ? wat

5. i  m not whining . i proposed that we make the world a better place while asking people if they can help me get a foot in the door so i can prove myself on my own merits . if you  re lifestyle and career aren  t making you happy than i empathize with you . you are my brother and you deserve better . you  re capable of so much more than they  re paying you for . your life has meaning , your time is limited , and your purpose unique .
   (ID: 2a3f07a52e2fc5e79fd2ed52f4f601fa39ebe2e4)

6. exactly , no way to win . only thing to do is avoid the situations with people who are like that and try to have worthwhile conversations with people who are more reasonable . the stuck up sjws aren ' t worth you time
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

7. " fuck off " thank you for your input . when you ' re on the clock you ' re expected to at least meet corporate and customer expectations . if you can do neither then any job that relates to working with people is not for you . when you ' re off the clock and on your time you can do whatever pleases you .

8. by the time time traveling was invented people might not care enough to change it , it would probably be ancient history to them and not worth rewriting history as they know it .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

9. i ' m in grad school now but i had a gap year after undergrad . it was very different . i had less on my plate than before because i worked full  time during undergrad . i lost a lot of friends that year because many people moved away .
   (ID: 24d2489761902de9148fe06d43ec8d7e34c8e35b)

10. because we leave the freedoms to the individual . some people are retarded and make poor decisions ie not paying attention in school , have kids at digit years old , or joining gangs instead of filling their time with more productive means
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

11. why is it that people who behave like this , look the part at the same time rolling  on  the  floor  laughing
   (ID: 79b35c8caff79f47f37bb4856cc6b57bcd49e5bf)

12. i ' m not talking about that sort of camping . that ' s the proper way to camp and it still involves looking for fights so i have absolutely no problems with that at all . i ' m just referring to the people who sit in one spot for a long time hoping to catch players by surprise .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

13. no , but i watch people do it to all the time . usually in my personal case most people are afraid of me which is why i typically never approach people at all . i do watch while people insult friends of mine just for trying to have a conversations though .
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

14. reworked my philosophy on the importance of exercise as part of prepping and wrote this outline , would appreciate people ' s feedback ! also  chopped what felt like a ton of firewood  actually more like two week ' s worth at most . that stuff burns so quick , it ' s gone in no time at all .
