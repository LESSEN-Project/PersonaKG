6. people get surprised when they find out that a majority of my aerodynamic knowledge comes from playing games and making paper airplanes it ' s interesting to read about what you study but when you play a game based on what it is , it really kick  starts your experiences in that field .

10. because when you ' re in rome you do as the romans do . unless you ' re obviously a tourist or you don ' t speak english at all , i think it ' s really rude to go out of your way to speak in a manner people around you can ' t understand . my wife does this to me in spanish when she wants to talk about someone we see while we ' re out or whatever and it annoys me to no end .
   (ID: f39e591889b6331bd255039773030c1b50c7e201)

11. no matter the circumstances there are people out there who really care about you and your well being
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

12. yeah the whole politically correct culture is pissing me off . and i think it ' s really a small group of people claiming to be offended . seems like outrage is like a currency these days .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

13. i see your point in a sense . it ' s not that they ' re being confrontational , it ' s that people come up to the camera . there are plenty of   boring   videos where nothing happens . there are also videos where people learn their rights . there are auditors i disagree with and auditors who react well to the public better than others . suspicious activity is only suspicious to the person who doesn ' t understand what ' s going on . i suggest watching a bunch of different auditors and see which ones you like best , or none at all . i really like the boring ones where nothing happens because it shows that they ' re not out there to harass people .

14. well i always walk into a room with my head held high and with purpose so i start off looking like i belong  have confidence . really watch how you present yourself , use your body language to exude confidence . one thing i try to do but is so hard is to make eye contact when speaking with others . when interacting with people , i try to stand still and not fidget with random shit like my hair , phone or whatever because that comes across as being anxious . one thing i do which isn  t the greatest is i act cocky and borderline conceded . it makes me feel better and people who know me know that i  m not being serious . but sometimes you really do start becoming this person you  re channeling .
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

15. how important it is to really pick the people you sleep with .
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

16. i know i ' ll never get one so i ' m not really worrying about that . however i do carry some so my breath doesn ' t smell when talking to people
   (ID: 1921dc07cd609c210cb71a0176afa3dfa4fa3772)

17. maybe it ' s just me but i don ' t think i ' ve ever really been around people who really care that much about how others get their rocks off , and i ' ve lived in three different countries all over the world . sure , people might crack a joke or tease someone for it , but i don ' t think anyone really cares any more than they would if they found out about any other fetish . it ' s simply a non  issue . that ' s why the parades  culture thing feels so bizarre to me . it ' s as if they are deliberately attracting attention and criticism by shouting about something that the general public couldn ' t care less about .
