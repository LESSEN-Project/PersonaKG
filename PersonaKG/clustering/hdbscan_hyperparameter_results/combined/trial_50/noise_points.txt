2. ummm . wow ! it wasn ' t the nazis who built that wall . yikes ! i correct my previous statement , you should have just learned history ! that was not such a wall , that was to keep people in . much easier to do if the gov ' t kills anyone you know if you escape . kind of puts a damper on escapes and the ability to plan them with others .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

3. it depends , honestly . were the charges nolled because you did some type of ar  jail diversion program ? how far is your army recruiter from you ? if they ' re local just bring all your documents if you still have them . if not give them a call , and explain the situation . they ' ll probably tell you right off the bat . i don ' t have my regulations in front of me at the moment , plus i recruit for the national guard so we have our own regulations on top of the army ones .

17. because everyone told me that it was bad as a child without being able to explain why . i got a lot of " it just is " which was about as useful as tits on a nun . i ' ve always had a weird trait , though . when someone tells me to stop asking questions or to stop thinking , i do those things even more . so , after being told to just accept things for years and years , i decided to start reading for myself . after all , i had this internet thing . then i had college . i started reading about all sorts of people . people fighting for social justice long before that became a pejorative , people fighting for economic justice . and also the people who conned other people in the name of those things . i came to a few conclusions  capitalist don ' t give half a flying fuck about the people on the bottom  be they workers , consumers , the old , the infirm , or some combination thereof . if they do seem to care , it ' s usually for the following reasons  they were personally impacted by a certain issue , they need to boost their pr , or and this is insanely rare they are actually decent people that managed to get wealthy . that communism seemed a tad extreme for me . also , that i doubt the human race is capable of actually committing to communism on a large scale without succumbing quickly to greed for power and wealth . that socialism seemed like a pretty nice compromise . take the good things that you see in a capitalist society , but remove the parts that shit all over those at the bottom . my views haven ' t really shifted all that much from those points i realized around ten years ago . i have gained far more knowledge since then , and i have realized that i am an outcast within my own region of the united states . the south is the most backward thinking place i have ever seen . they have some of the most government dependent citizenry , but they convince that citizenry to vote against their own interests and give the elite more power and money . and the thing is , i ' m torn . do i try and save the south which seems damn hard when even the liberals i know wholeheartedly embrace capitalism and shun socialism ? do i scrounge as much as i can and get the fuck out for friendlier waters which seems a tad cowardly and defeatist ?
   (ID: 73a501f273781aa2c0deb878ecb02dcab3a9d4d3)

18. I own a birthday.
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

19. so basically you got a crush on your friend and not in love with your boyfriend ? from my point of view you have three options reak up with boyfriend and hook up with the friend , break up with boyfriend and hook up with other people or work things out with your boyfriend . if i were you i ' d go with the first option but i ' m forever alone ignore me and do what you wanna do . anyhow , i personally don ' t thing there ' s any point in a relationship when its not a lifetime commitment but that ' s just me .
   (ID: 9adb5fb6fb9aeeeb65afe41002460d73817044b0)

20. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
