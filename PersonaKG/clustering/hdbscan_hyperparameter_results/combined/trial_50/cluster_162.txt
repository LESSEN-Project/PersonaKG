3. a nicotine craving only lasts for min at the time , after that you feel normal again . always remember that you just have to resist for digit min as soon as the craving beginns . and also try to avoid areas where you typically smoked or your friends do .

4. on your third date , hump him awkwardly at a phish show . it ' s the only way .   x200b  raves are a special thing . i wouldn ' t bring someone around who made me feel awkward a third time . and there ' s nothing wrong with keeping looking for someone who has long term potential or at the very least is more compatible now !
