1. very high expectations without the resources to meet them . whenever circumstances were such that you didn  t have enough to make them work , guidance was  make it happen .  sometimes our computer systems went out for digit days straight . what do you do then ? make it happen . the recipe for  make it happen  is almost always do this on your own time for no additional pay .
