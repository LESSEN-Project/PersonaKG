1. although i love clannad and code geass with all of my heart . they arent flawless . and i dont think its good to keep saying to yourself that nothing will beat this anime . because then you ' re making it harder for yourself to find a really good anime . i recommend going in every anime with the thought that this could be you ' re digit  anime . this way you can enjoy more anime .

5. hi , i can see that you  re really talented and you played really good if i would change one thing though i would play the original music clip in the corner so everyone who is not an guitar expert and doesn  t know what everything does can look at the original clip and the rest can ignore it because the clip is in the corner

6. that ' s really interesting thank you ! in my mind i always believe that businesses would seek vc but it ' s really interesting that they proactively seek you out , which kind of makes sense because if i had a shed load of cash to invest i wouldn ' t be sat around waiting for the golden goose . good luck in your business , it ' s a fantastic idea !

8. buckle down and raise a son when i really wasn ' t ready to . i don ' t want to be a deadbeat dad , but sometimes i feel like it would be a hell of a lot easier than what i ' m going through now

9. the happy songs do a really good job of covering up the sad ones like my confession , or sayo  nara .

10. i saw a comment on a post recently imagine your lonely dying breaths , ending with you feeling comforted by what you feared most your entire life . get out there and face your fears , because behind all of them is a chance to gain new perspective and expand it and really grow and learn . our fears force us into our  comfort  zones , es little stimulation in comfort . anyways i  m rambling good night victory  hand  dark  skin  tone

11. i don ' t really feel like he holds me back , but my life isn ' t the way i want it to be living with him . i ' m gonna say the same shit everyone else says , i do love him and i enjoy being with him . but lately it doesn ' t feel the same . he ' s a good person but i feel like i don ' t really like him anymore . maybe it ' s my mindset but i feel like we don ' t have fun or enjoy each other ' s company . but if i leave i know i ' ll miss him and be sad . i ' m not going to go jump on another guys dick .
