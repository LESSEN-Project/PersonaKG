--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 5

1. if you don ' t want to go on a date , you don ' t have to , whether you already agreed or not . it ' s your life and your decisions , don ' t do something that makes you uncomfortable so you don ' t disappoint someone else , especially if that person seems bad for you , as this guy does . let him know you changed your mind and if he won ' t leave you alone block his number .

2. i think being loving first and getting to know them can permit the conversation about jesus to go more smoothly . they may even come to see god through through tour loving relating as the candle shown for all to see . if we don  t tell our co workers at our jobs about hell digit  digit why should we do it to homosexuals ?

3. okay , but that  s not a valid sample . results will be purely anecdotal . you may want to point that out to your teach so they know you  re aware of the faults and limitations . also , the same study found that about digit percent of shower water is from the hot water source . and if your calculating enviro footprints , don  t forget about all the embedded energy in water , both hot and cold .

4. i don ' t know why they switched . most articles on the topic mention the same sequence of events , with that detail missing . 1800s  kids ' clothes are unisex . everyone wears white dresses until around the age of digit or digit . white because it ' s the easiest to clean at the time . 1910s  blue is mentioned for girls , pink for boys . 1940s  the public decides they want gender  differentiated clothing . manufacturers , for whatever reason , go against the social norms of the previous few decades .

5. now cook me a fucking dinner ! what do you want ? i don ' t know . let ' s do the digit  digit  digit game .
