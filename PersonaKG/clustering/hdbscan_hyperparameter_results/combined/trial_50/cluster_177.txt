1. its was my first one too , so i recommend you jojo ' s bizarre adventure , mob psycho digit and overlord . jojo ' s is a must have for anime fans . just watch it even if the first episodes are more or less bad . if you liked one punch man you will also like mob . that all i want to say to that . try overlord if you want something new .

2. one of my pet peeves is that here in oregon the signs say " motorcycles use extreme caution " that they can craft a sign with four words that has two mistakes  okay , one definite mistake and one iffy word choice  just makes me want to bang my head against a wall .

3. you can fake study , just put you book in front of you and put your phone in there or whatever . then you say that you already studied and you can do whatever you want

4. i typically find it easier to show them a picture if i want a new style . if i want a trim i just say something like " a digit fade on the sides and just the tips off the top "
