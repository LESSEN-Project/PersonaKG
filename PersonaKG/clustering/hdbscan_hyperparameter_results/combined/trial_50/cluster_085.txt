1. just when you think it ' s gone you hear the eeeeeee .
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

2. this is how players get hurt . having to think to much and letting up , not doing what you would naturally do . this is more of a problem than the refs . they should just play digit  hand touch and qbs should wear red jerseys the whole year if this is how it  s gonna be . i understand the league trying to protect the qb , but this is just absolutely ridiculous now .
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

3. if there ' s nothing i can do , i just think .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

4. she invited you to her house , showered while you were there and was willing to let you see her in just a towel ? i think you missed some signals , buddy .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

5. i think you ' re just bad at it , it ' s fun
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

6. yep ! i think we also see her mention it briefly in a season digit flashback to the red center just before she mentions the colonies and we see the picture of junes mom too .
   (ID: e387b7eddf8ab01e3dd767dc2f5ca52494fbe9b0)

7. why should you panic if there is nothing to lose . youre not playing in the katowice grandfinal . just try your best and if you fail , think . about what you could have done . better in that situation . you learn by mistakes
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

8. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

9. the planet or just life on it ? i think it would be cool if we explored to other planets and earth became obsolete .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

10. surely there are other avenues to take this information . you reported it to the police department of which luke murray is assigned ? nothing seems to have been done ? take it to another department , go get legal advice , take it to a lawyer , any of these options are better than posting it on reddit , and if this turns out to be a false report then you are committing an act of defamation . i ' m not doubting your honesty , just think you should find another means of having the law look at this accusation .
   (ID: 9e8a44f7c55ebce4785906436a033b33a1ccb949)

11. i think that you answered it well it  s just that the last part could give the op an idea that is more likely untrue then true . things that aren  t proved to be true are fine but they should have some kind of evidence to support them  that idea , if anything , had evidence that makes it most likely untrue . opinions should not be used to answer questions unless they have facts to back them up .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

12. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

13. just when you think it can ' t get worse , she keeps typing .
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

14. im not . i just think its kinda bruh moment cuz no part digit character is gay . and no one can disagree . sorry but judt remember thats a weird fantasy . also you used the word hypocrite wrong .
   (ID: de0709ad19c458ffff0b96aab8fcfa9c40b24603)

15. yeah . i think ill give up on having bias ' in groups and just love em all
