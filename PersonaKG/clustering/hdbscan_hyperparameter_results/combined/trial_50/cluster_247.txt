2. a real god would write more interesting stories . and at the very least they ' d be consistent and factually accurate . also , any story that wasn ' t part of the official cannon would instantly leap into flames . since i can write my own story that says , " all other religion are bunk and this one da bestest , " and not suffer third degree burns   or even mildly crippling diarrhea   is good enough for me .
   (ID: eb338cca8f5e87e4b6e5d369997ab6dbebf241c5)

4. i found a good price on alaska  singapore airlines , which wins " best airline " every year . route is jfk to lax to nrt so it ' s not direct . jal or ana direct would definitely be the best , but they will all have hot towels and good cabin crew .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

5. i assume it does take a toll . perhaps that is why we forget them , your brain probably can ' t handle too much unnecessary information . so it ' s probably a good thing that i forget them .

6. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .
