3. honestly didn  t read the body just the tdlr cause you  re digit and you just need to do you for a bit . seriously young people are on here constantly asking so many questions like this but you just need to find yourself and not listen to strangers opinions on your choices in life . why not just try to meet new people and not worry about who is your  most compatible  . have some damn fun
