3. my area put up a stink about this because they put in an old time clock that barely works . we all manage to get clocked in before 5am but it ' s tough some days when it ' s malfunctioning . the supervisor has been nice enough to forgive a tardy so long that you were in line at digit  digit .

4. i will admit i worried about that a bit when we went to new zealand for our honeymoon . saw a lot on the internet about rampant tourism being out of control , etc . it turned out to be fine . we went in the end of a shoulder season us thanksgiving and built an itinerary of all the " second best " or " less popular but great " things  for example , hiking isthmus peak instead of roy ' s peak near wanaka  spending time in wanaka instead of queenstown . never underestimate the ability of crowds to all take the same photo and go to the exact same digit places .

6. everything that you said is absolutely true . the most aggravating thing about the focus tree is the middle tree especially . oh you have to take digit focuses to get on with the tree ? ok . oh digit days wasn ' t enough ? how about digit different sub  trees that take another digit days to start . the war is almost long over by the time you get the claims on neighbors .

   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

9. that isn ' t even a russian design ! the best they could do in digit was essentially a fucking fiat ! and that design was already digit years old or something like that . i remember reading about this at the time in cab  drover mag .
