   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

2. the best suggestion i ' ve heard on the subject is , ask your pizza delivery guy . start with cheap chain places like dominos , because their drivers are more likely to not give a fuck . a driver for some local shop might be the son of the owner or something . so you order a small pizza in case you have to try this more than once in a night , and tell the pizza dude your situation . you are new to the area , and could use help finding bud .
