1. oh wow someone told you something so you threw years of your life away ? let me guess you didn  t work in this time frame either ! and i  m also guessing you live in a poor area to be in this position , for example i live in a place where you can easily earn  digit  and likely earn  digit plus no degree , no experience with low cost of living . i don  t think this is  something  bad that happened to you  just a result of poor decision making . luck plays a role , but not a significant one in things like these , and i am in my position in life basically entirely based on luck .

2. nah . old people are notorious for speaking their minds , as are iranians in my experience , and there ' s even a chance the neighbour was just venting frustrations on you about their own children they don ' t see . you work a lot and still made time to go see your parents who live a few hours away , your not a bad son by any means well , no means relevant to the story anyways . and had clearly reached a breaking point for strangers bullshit . the neighbour obviously shouldn ' t have said anything that confrontational but realistically probably had no idea that western culture frown upon chastising strangers .

3. please note  i am sorry if i sound ridiculous or well off the mark . i ' m from nrth qld , and have no real sense of what the city of adelaide is like . i am happy to not live near the heart of the city , so long as my labouring  standard job type partner can work close enough to the home , there is a nice school in the area , and there would be a doctor or hospital close enough if one of us or my kids needed emergency care . also being from the north , our threat is cyclones so i would be clueless and terrified in a fire . so i would not be the best to live in the middle of a fire threat zone etc . thanks for being patient and i do google earth the area a lot . i like the look of the suburbs in the area i circled but i ' m not sure if they are actually suburbs or if they are small communities considered " way out .

4. illegal in a lot of places . unless you ' re working under the table , where i live you have to be digit to work
