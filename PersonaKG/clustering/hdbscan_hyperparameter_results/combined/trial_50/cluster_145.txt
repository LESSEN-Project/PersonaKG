1. lol , you can wander around with in the sanctioned playpen of ordinary consciousness , and we have some intoxicants over here if you wanna mess your self up we  ve got some scotch here and some tobacco and red meat and some sugar and a little t . v . and so forth and so on . but , these boundary dissolving hallucinogens that give you a sense of unity with your fellow man and nature are somehow forbidden . this is an outrage ! it  s a sign of cultural immaturity and the fact that we tolerate it is a sign that we are living in a society as oppressed as any society in the past .
