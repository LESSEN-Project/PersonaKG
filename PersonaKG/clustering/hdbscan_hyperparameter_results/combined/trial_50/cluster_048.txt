2. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him

4. if you try and eat a little something at meal times even if you  re not that hungry then that might prevent you going all out after you  ve gone a long time without food . you  re probably a lot more hungry that you realise
