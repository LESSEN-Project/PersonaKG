2. people might say , he couldve saved that money . but who actually does that ? save for 17years ? only rich people . for average people , its almost impossible to save for years and not touch that money over those years . just take that guy above as a person who smoke cigarettes for years . at least his chance with his money is to become a millionaire and not cancer .

3. well i seem to be somewhat unique in that i can ' t honestly say i relate to any of them , at least certainty not on the level of a lot of other people on this sub . i am very lucky to have never personally experienced any of the problems portrayed in the game . that said i do definitely sympathize with them quite a lot . i ' d say i sympathize the most with sayori probably because my sister suffers from depression , followed by natsuki . then yuri , then monika . i love natsuki the most though .
