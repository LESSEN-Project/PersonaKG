1. no way , and i don ' t recommend anybody to date someone who has a carbon copy of their personality . i ' d prefer someone that is a good balance for my weaknesses for instance i have a useless sense of direction and can be stubborn often . i want to date someone who will make me a better person , not who is a mirror of myself .

2. this is a very unpopular opinion and for good reason . people do play video games to escape reality , like you might eat tasty foods because they taste good , and because you don ' t want a plain , boring meal . there is one gamer who gets paid 500k annually and is digit y  o .

3. what ' s the old saying ignorance doesn ' t make you immune to the law ? that ' s the risk you take for playing in large tribes with people you don ' t know in the future i hope he thinks about it before joining cheaters . also how do you know he didn ' t know ? it ' s easy to feign ignorance so the most efficient way is to blanket ban all members and move on . so good on them .

4. why would you assume the fbi isn ' t corrupt ? they are a violent criminal organization . i don ' t know why so many people view them as a good thing . last time i checked the good guys don ' t radicalized and arm domestic terrorists .

5. don  t make the normal kids suffer . at my jobs xmas party last year my ceo decided to have all the food be vegan but only him and his son are vegan . long story short the party ended with tables full of food wasted because your average person doesn  t like that crap . hell , even the cake was bad . if you can  t make a cake taste good you  re doing something wrong

6. well look it at another perspective . you have learned from this experience . it sucks of course . but it will make you better in the en  don ' t let this be something that controls your next couple of days . let it go as hard as it seems and do some stuff with your friends . or talk to other people . in the end you will come out stronger . here is a quote i picked up "  if we see any mermaids i  m gonna ask them where their merginas are " i know this isn ' t helpfull at all but it makes me laugh everytime . have a good one !

7. sf would give you some good experience especially if you don  t have any . it  s my experience that they usually recruit people with experience .
