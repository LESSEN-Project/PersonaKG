   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

2. hey , you  re not a bad person  you were angry and people often say unkind things when angry . i get it , that  s why i asked why you commented that way . i like rust a lot and believe it will become more and more influential . thank you for your time to respond and apologize . it  s a sign of bravery when people do that . i appreciate you .
   (ID: 2a3f07a52e2fc5e79fd2ed52f4f601fa39ebe2e4)

3. i  m arguing because you say stupid things and can  t accept the fact that your post is not fun , smart , or helpful . you argue like a child and need to learn that not everything you say matters . you don  t want to argue , don  t respond . your the one who posted a garbage post with moron comments . you get off reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

4. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

5. except for my very first post where i said lgbtqwhatever , because that  s what those napoleons like to be called , please , show another one of my post , where i was arguing ? i simply stated what i strongly and firmly believe . now back to people , who like to suck dicks , being fuk in the ass , licking each other  i don  t care what they like to be called and what they think they are . they are mentally ill people to me . i could make myself more clear .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

6. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .

7. my initial reaction to this was anger and confusion which means i can learn from it if i try to understand you calmly . please expand on why you feel wealth inequality to not be bad .
   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

8. what the hell are you even talking about ? i  outed myself  ? my comment about democrats was part of a response to someone maybe you , i can  t be bothered to go back and verify user names saying something like  spotted the trumptard  to me . there were other comments between those , but that  s the main premise . is the main point of your comment to basically say  hey , twist  digit is a republican !  ? because if that  s the case , you  re wrong . my original comment was to voice my opinion that kaepernick isn  t talented enough to ignore the media circus he brings with him . why you  re making it out to be more than that is fucking beyond me . also , i don  t know why you think i  m going to delete any of this . i stand by everything i said , kaepernick isn  t a great quarterback and he isn  t worth the media circus .

9. not commenting and commenting are the same thing . you imbecile . you fucking moron .
   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

10. you are wrong , the fact that everyone is disagreeing with you should prove that enough . that is classic argumentum ad populum , and is a logical fallacy . the number of people saying something has no bearing on the truth .  and beyond this delusion of her being right cinder ruined the lives of the characters i do support in series and would be supporting if i existed in this world , so i hate her on a personal level as well . that is a very valid stance to have . there have been a lot of characters hurt by cinder , and they and those who support them have every right to attempt revenge . that doesn ' t mean i have to support that revenge though .  you are wrong , i ' m not interested in constant debate , i am not responding to any more of these topics . if you keep posting these topics to trigger people to respond to you i am going to start reporting you as a troll . nobody is forcing you to comment . nobody is forcing you to join these debates . you are joining a debate of your own free will , and now are angry about it . you are welcome to leave and post on other threads . as for me being a a troll , how ? i posted a controversial opinion you disagree with . do you really want rwby to just become an echo chamber where nobody is free to have differing opinions ? because i have remained perfectly civil and put thought into every argument . the only possible reason for wanting me banned is because you are attempting to enforce and echo chamber .  everyone else , just start ignoring this idiot . please . again , i have remained perfectly civil . you are the one insulting me , not the other way around .

11. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

12. i  m not talking about your initial comments , i  m talking about the whole conversation . and during this conversation , you  ve been all over the place . you  ve told me that you  re just giving me food for thought and i shouldn  t actually change what i  m doing , then you blatantly told me you  re telling me to change what i  m doing . you  ve called me apathetic , then you  ve told me i  m taking it personally . i should stop reading into your comments , but you get to interpret mine however you want . now you  re saying you enjoy disney movies , but you draw the line at writing quotes on the board . that  s not where i draw the line , and i  m sorry you feel that  s wrong . we could discuss the meaning of that song and why i specifically chose that lyric , but i  m not really wanting to open that can of worms with so many other things already on the table . what you  re not seeming get is that i  m not trying to do any mixing . i  m not making grey , as you suggest . i  m keeping the two issues entirely separate . and the definition of apathy is showing a lack of emotion or an indifference . i am telling you that i have thought a lot about my stances on these issues and am far from apathetic .

13. ahh , now you ' re playing stupid , huh ? way to show intellectual honesty . really . well done . thanks again for displaying what fucking liars you all are . way to show , again , that you have to lie through your teeth just to feel like you aren ' t a bunch of fucking rats . seriously . thank you .

14. sorry , pet peeve of minehttps    but not only does your vote not count when you don ' t explain why it doesn ' t help me understand when you don ' t explain why

15. i should have written my comment more carefully . that ' s not what i meant at all . i don ' t think my point came across . i hate microtransactions just as much as anyone else . and i ' m sure game devs do too . my point is game designers don ' t deserve to be harassed on social media when it ' s the suits at the top who make these business decisions . game designers are employees just like anyone else and it ' s not their fault that the game has microtransactions .
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

16. why does it matter how i respond to you ? your argument is invalid .
   (ID: 4126a6a9d5a548a6bed5e0c4992792b1c10f2b92)

17. it ' s just that you refused to address my points or say anything but lol you are stupid , since you are so far beneath me and you lack the intellectual capacity for rational discussion i have moved on to doing something better with my time . you know it as well as i do that socialism will when you ' re watching it happen on tv every day and you ' re burned up with impotent rage . i don ' t give a shit what you say about me because i have people in my life who actually love me and care about me unlike trump supporters who are disowned by their own children do to how awful they are .

18. cheers for not being aggressive in your response . it actually made me edit the post . this isn  t meant as an attack on people who use them but rather my thoughts on why the use of memes feels like a problem . if that  s what you love , then meme away my friend !
   (ID: 9cfb696c79a211a1c5a060dfb2265f65983eeeec)

19. op makes claim using vague terms , gets told to define term , provides definition , gets argued with or laughed at for mistaken assumptions . that ' s usually how things work around here . just substituting ' circlejerk ' for ' god ' or ' soul ' or ' spiritual ' or whatever the hell else . tell me exactly what you mean by it and i ' ll tell you what you have wrong . tl  dr whoosh
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

20. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .
