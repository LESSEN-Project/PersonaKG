1. remember how it was before you were born ? me neither . and that ' s the way it will be when we are gone . same exact state . there are many questions we will never know the answer to but it ' s best to concentrate on what we know and what we have  enjoy your life and be good to your fellow humans .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

2. this happens to me with my long distance friend . i ' ve been friends with her for years but whenever she doesn ' t reply for a day or more i assume i said something wrong and she hates me . i ' m always wrong . i know it ' s a shitty way to think but thats how my mind works . i think part of it is because i ' ve been betrayed by many people i thought were my friends before
   (ID: 7026695d5469f9ac5987bd602ce0be29968523db)

3. been there and it wasn  t worth the time . the impact it has on you when you like and are not  liked  back is really negative . save your own time and feeling and withdraw .
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

4. eh , no big . you stop taking the estrogen and move on . shit happens . don ' t know why we have to pigeon hole people and make them miserable , in any capacity . be what you want to be , even if you change your mind later , and everyone else can go fuck themselves .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

5. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .
   (ID: a3b2823250cd4b5927129512a5ab9061e10ebaf2)

6. grew up educated not to believe such nonsense , got into a relationship where i was unhappy that we don ' t have the same views on a lot of aspects . somehow it worked and after a few years i realised that we complete each other  all we need to do is to talk
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

7. if you don ' t care about whether she likes you or not why do you care about how she looks ? her hair doesn ' t actually impact your life in any way from what i can tell . let her do her and you do you , everybodies happy .
   (ID: 06080b0d1273cc2321b21dde5865b5c1c5180e56)

8. i am so sorry to hear about her condition . i can understand that it is difficult right now with everything going on including your wedding , it  s okay  people can become anxious and may not want to face a difficult  sad situation . your being honest at least . it  s often good to just relax and pull back and think about your two events in life and reflect . be thankful . anyway , i hope everything goes okay for you and your family . this reminded me of something  please see coco pixar  i think that it may help you and give you a different perspective about life in general .
   (ID: 7f37f47fcf6439c13308caa3da8118ac14f861f6)

9. i  m sorry this is happening to you . i know how this feels and i can tell you it  s never good to have a crush on your best friend . i hope things work out for you .
   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

10. as much as i empathize for your situation , i think you should consider the symbolism of the tattoo to your girlfriend . that tattoo symbolizes a huge part of her life , many memories , the birth of her kids etc . to her , it may come across as if you want to erase that part of her history from memory . i know it would be horrible seeing her ex ' s name every time you see her , but if she won ' t get a cover up tattoo for it , then maybe try to change your view on the tattoo its self . it ' s not her ex , it is a stage in her life that has contributed to the person she is today . tl  dr the tattoo is representing a part of her life . you can ' t change it , so change what you can . your perspective on it .
   (ID: d4912bd11a6aaa98c91794eda03e9fafdfcf5c43)

11. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

12. i hate when people call women hoes . what makes you think being a " hoe " is a bad thing ? what makes a hoe ? also how do they know you ' re a hoe ?
   (ID: c50abefedeeb0c19f834b1ebb28634054bccee26)

13. i don ' t really see how you weren ' t supportive of her . she seemed to make her mind up on plenty of issues without you and you ' ve tried to approach them all in a logical way . also she purposeful tries to do things that hurt you ? that ' s unsupportive . you might have to let her go . i think it ' ll be better for both of you .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

14. no , i never told anybody . it ' s hard to explain , but i just can ' t get it out of me . i was afraid for so long that i would be judged , or that people would " feel bad for me " . i know what happened was horrible , but i ' m in a good place now . i don ' t want unlock that part of my memory for someone else to see , if that makes sense .
   (ID: 011a531fc3f706d76441a0f95cc8091fd4453dd8)

15. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them
   (ID: 3e7b07ddd384cb288bc529e6aeb73f840aa5a294)

16. not a psychopath , just a sufferer of  bpd  . the intrusive murderous thoughts , the abandonment paranoia . we  ve all been there . the good news is the monster has a name . now you know you don  t feel that way ,  it  does . it  s like a dark thing in your head that pretends to be your friend , tells you it knows you better than anyone . that your other friends will all leave when they get to know the real you . but that  s not the real you .  it  is a leech that  s gorges on your unhappiness . and like any manipulator it  s goal is to isolate yoget you far away from people that care about your wellbeing . don  t let it trick you into thinking you hate people , that  s how it wins . best of luck friend , remember that you  re not alone .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

17. i agree that she ' s dropping hints . next time she brings it up say something like " why in the world does anyone get married ? the details are mind numbing ! i can ' t imagine putting myself through that . big sigh . i don ' t know how you ' re managing to deal with all this . let ' s go to a movie or something because this is seriously depressing me . "
   (ID: 1293e72aa7301baf0ecb3a2509e46cdcca834cd9)

18. nta she ruined your first martiagr and if it was on purpose well domt let her find closure , that way even in death you will have won .
   (ID: d7f47de640bd3d8659ad150b77fea8f843c60c26)

19. my psychiatrist says i have ocd tendencies along with aspergers syndrome . i don ' t know if i actually have ocd or not but from my experience i also get these impulsive thoughts . " i liked these girls when i was a young child , do i still like them now ? " that ' s basically my worry , i ' ve been an adult for a few years and i worry the same . " why won ' t these feelings go away , i don ' t want these feelings and thoughts . they were okay when i was younger but not now ! stop it stop it stop it ! " my psychiatrist says sometimes we have trouble shifting from developmental thoughts to adult thoughts . he also said to be in the present moment more . i don ' t want these thoughts , i don ' t want these feelings . i really think i have " harm ocd " but we ' ll have to see what my psychiatrist says next session in digit weeks
   (ID: f9d3bf7ce779e854aa865f12a7dfaaee14a65cfa)

20. you have to remember as a child those pets are one of the few friends they have at home . i  d try breaking the news as soon as you can so she can at least try to understand . just tell her your situation and what you had to do .
