3. " hot tits " is a winner in most girls books . men don ' t understand that women want to be sexually spoken to and touched like a whore , but respected like their mother all in one . most of what we complain about would fall into one of these categories . guaranteed . in some way it will be either a you dont find me attractive or b you don ' t respect me enough summary  fuck like whore , respect like mother . p . s . clean dick is a must .
