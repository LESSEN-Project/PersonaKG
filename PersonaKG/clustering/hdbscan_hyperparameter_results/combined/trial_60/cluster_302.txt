1. bro , all i read was you  re digit and skipped the rest of your novel . don  t sweat shit like this at such a young age . there are so many more people to meet in your life and so many lessons for you to learn .

2. other family members watched all of it , so i ' d be in the room through most of it . i think early on i just decided it wasn ' t for me . i get why people like it but it was marmite to me .

3. i have to ask you why you don ' t look this up yourself ? you have to be on the internet to type and submit your comment so why not just do a quick google search ? one of the biggest problems in this country is that a lot of people do not research anything themselves . they simply wait for someone to present information to them . when they don ' t like the information they hear , even if it is true , they dismiss it and when they hear information they do like they accept it even if it is false . it ' s absolutely ridiculous how easily manipulated people can be .

4. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .

5. some dogs don  t like people with hats on . might just be something they aren  t used to . or a bad experience .
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

6. why are you asking this ? like other people said there ' s nothing wrong with it , they don ' t hurt anyone for me as long as they don ' t convince others to be gay i ' m ok with it , they ' re humans just like you and me

8. i would actually like to play this scenario . but , the thing is , everyone would just camp their wool the whole game and there wouldn ' t be too much pvp . also , i think popular people ' s wool would get target too much . but overall , great scenario !
   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

9. i think they ' re just not putting up with people ' s shit anymore . at this point it ' s like " i am who i am some fuck you if you don ' t like it ! " they just people to stop treating them like shit for it .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

10. i don  t get the hate . i hang out on video gaming board . it  s just people wanting to have fun like me and you
   (ID: 726c36ce13fa631676ed5053f62b0f5f7b61eb5e)

11. well , as harsh as it might sound , there might be people in your life who have slept with everyone but you and they still don ' t owe it to you to sleep with you . that said , i guess it ' s one ' s own choice whether one wants to hang around with a person like that , not out of spite , but out of being annoyed by being regaled with all the fine details which might be tmi .
   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

12. well a ton of socially anxious people think of similar shit like this that happened years and ages ago so just add it to the end of the queue .
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

13. the amount of laziness by the person who made this is unbelievable . the only effort they put into this is giving one of them a guitar . they didn ' t even bother to think up a pun . although that actually might be a good thing . it ' s just like they said " people like the beatles , people like minions , just stick them on a cover of a beatles lp , bobs your uncle "
   (ID: 808718709a1de9360ade79304c59728079eae812)

14. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

15. saw someone post something like this the other day . i don ' t understand how people don ' t get , it ' s not at all confusing . users submit any content they like , which gets voted on by the community , and those which get overwhelmingly positive feedback reach the front page of the internet
