3. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .
