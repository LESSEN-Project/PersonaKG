1. more like for security . the reason someone would carry a gun is very similar to why someone locks their doors . if it  s that hard to understand , maybe you will after your involved in an incident that threatens you or your loved ones . most malicious attacks  robberies are going to tip the scale towards the criminal meaning they are not looking to present you with a fair fight . so for that reason , it  s wise to be prepared yourself .
