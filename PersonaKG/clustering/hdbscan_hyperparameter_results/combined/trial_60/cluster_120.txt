1. i can answer this despite being an english speaker . it ' s because you haven ' t been taught that cuss words in other languages are just as bad . we never snuck around our parents to say " mierda " , unless of course you ' re spanish , so yeah . it ' s just that it wasn ' t drilled into your head like it is with your own version of the word . like americans using bollocks

2. there is a kid in my school who is like this , except he singles me out for food and if i say no he tries to just take it from me .

3. the action scenes were painfully average but it had something to say about race relations in our world today and it does it with a little , not a lot of nuance . while it wasn ' t the best picture of the year i myself am completely fine with its nominations especially considering the two biggest winners of the night were green book and bohemian rhapsody . it ' s totally ok if you didn ' t like it just acknowledge that it was trying to do more than your average blockbuster .

4. i digit  agree . the enablers are the worst . they see something is wrong with the person and say things like  that is just how he is

5. i would like to say loyalty but in all honesty it ' s probably just as simple as my capacity to relate to them overall . maybe you could call that open mindedness .

6. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol
