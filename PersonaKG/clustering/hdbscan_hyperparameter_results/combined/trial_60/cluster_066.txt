4. i ' ve done nothing . i see these posts online about people who ' ve murdered sex offenders , and the comment section is filled with people who applaud the murderes actions . though i dont completely agree thats the way to go about it , i always think what if one of my friends or family members was a victim of assault .

5. if you call me , please tell me your name . i can ' t distinguish voices aside from male  female . when i pick up a phone , everyone sounds alike . i imagine if morgan freeman called me my brain would label him ' generic male ' . and yes , i ' ve had entire conversations with people without knowing who they are because i ' m also socially awkward and past a certain point , it becomes too awkward for me to ask who i ' m talking to .

7. and that  s your achievement today . you  ve made a healthier choice than millions of people around the world , people who would drink themselves to sleep . that  s something to be very proud of . even on my bad days , if i  ve brushed my teeth , i consider it not so bad . you  re achieving so much just be being able to speak to me , some random stranger from the internet . i know it feels like a stretch , but as i said , the littlest steps are often the biggest . getting started is the hardest part , but you  re already on that path by reaching out for help .
