1. some would argue if a company has interviewers who get off on asking overly technical questions you ' d be better off not working there . just something to think when you choose to grill people with random unrelated  to  work algorithm questions .

2. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .

3. not being preachy but maybe look at potential partners other aspects mental  spiritual , lifestyle choices etc . and see if those are healthy  attractive . people can change but if you are dating someone in a rut , it will be ten times harder for them to better themselves once dating and that ' s the real ugly side of relationships . if you think you are shallow about appearances then you might be using it as an excuse to not address other flags from that person . unfortunately it is so easy to rate people based on image so it ' s just a constant effort to remind yourself .

4. a sect ? or maybe just call it by the name of the group . i think namenerds is more about names for people or characters or pets , rather than words in general . you might have better luck on another subreddit .

5. i think you are an upstanding member of a higher functioning society . i agree with you on all points . and i greatly appreciate that you have replied to people disagreeing with you . it ' s just a shame that none seems open minded to it .
