   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

5. this is how players get hurt . having to think to much and letting up , not doing what you would naturally do . this is more of a problem than the refs . they should just play digit  hand touch and qbs should wear red jerseys the whole year if this is how it  s gonna be . i understand the league trying to protect the qb , but this is just absolutely ridiculous now .
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

8. you think you have a brain damage , then you kinda realize that you are asleep and try to start a self induced dream about pornography and it does not work , so you just hang back until you wake up
   (ID: 53aa6c267ff5eccf891e178786d41ca5df80a5de)

9. lol , been watching ' rasslin since ' digit ! even saw lil ' seth here a half dozen times when he was tyler black ' ing it up in his rookie year . i swear , i think some of you folks thing wrestling was just invented five years ago and think that what wwe presents is law .
   (ID: c21f8d5819115eb61914aa55dbbc727a12117bef)

10. the planet or just life on it ? i think it would be cool if we explored to other planets and earth became obsolete .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

11. i think this whole discussion revolves around the concept of " beating the shift . and i ' m asking this honestly  i just can ' t fathom how a single is considered not beating the shift . to me , just getting on base at all is beating the shift , since just getting on base is paramount to scoring runs in the first place . i

12. if it makes you or them uncomfortable there ' s nothing wrong with it , but if it ' s more of a " i think it bugs them " you should just ask if it does then go from there .
   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

13. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

14. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

15. how well someone speaks in a beauty pageant is irrelevant to my point , i wasn ' t trying to point out everything about each topic . plus it is just an idea , i think you are taking it a little too serious .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

16. surely there are other avenues to take this information . you reported it to the police department of which luke murray is assigned ? nothing seems to have been done ? take it to another department , go get legal advice , take it to a lawyer , any of these options are better than posting it on reddit , and if this turns out to be a false report then you are committing an act of defamation . i ' m not doubting your honesty , just think you should find another means of having the law look at this accusation .
   (ID: 9e8a44f7c55ebce4785906436a033b33a1ccb949)

17. thanks , that only made me think everyone else was doing the same thing , and doubled down my fear that they were just tolerating my presence out of politeness . that ' s pretty much how all of society works , we all just tolerate each other existence . you fit right in .
   (ID: 225291489bc1a4ddf3d197a3062fa9ff935f3029)

18. i think you just clearly stated the concept of a ' starter home ' that you and your spouse are doing right now . as your family and income grows , you may find that house too small and if you are able to buy a larger home , you may do so .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

19. this question just made me think of the movie sleepwalkers .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

20. actually i just realized op  s would still be wrong because the apostrophe shows ownership so i think it would just be ops . my bad
