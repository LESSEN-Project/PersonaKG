1. it ' s awkward because after the breakup , it is always weird to celebrate your own birthday by yourself , especially if that person was toxic or abusive . i just haven ' t celebrated my birthday in years because i feel like i ' m celebrating their birthday instead of mine . in the moment it was awkward too . when it ' s your birthday you get special treatment from friends and family . when it ' s someone else ' s as well , it sort of makes you feel like you ' re not unique or special in any way .
