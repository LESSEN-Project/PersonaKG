   (ID: e09cddf2452184c83537d2d4e8a36f0ba7c3fae9)

9. i think its fun to find a corner of the map and gun down as many as i can until the storm comes . especially when theres challenges and cool rewards involved . i never play the base game normally so i never faced any of the problems everyone else was having . i just think its fun shooting guys which im not good enough to do normally

10. no problem . i think if you ' re doing a long term planning and you ' re not good with investments and finance , yeah they totally worth it . but in my own opinion i ' m no expert . if you just wanna deal with your saving , then nah just invest your money in a moderately safe portfolio and take it out when you ' re done .
