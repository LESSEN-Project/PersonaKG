1. i get so damn annoyed when people criticize me for looking up everything . " you are taking all of the mystery and wonder out of life " gods dammit , no ! if you are wondering about mysteries that humanity has already solved , you ' re doing it wrong . when you look up information and can ' t an answer to your question , that is what you should spend your time wondering about .

2. hahahahaha . no buddy . telling someone words is not a threat to them . actually committing acts is a threat to them . they have shown time and time again that they are willing to actually kill people . stop fucking defending these fucks . they ' re scum . and they deserve everything that is coming to them .

7. fair . i can see why bringing penicillin to medieval europe is a tempting answer . however , i have to consider that the further back in time you go , and the more broad your cure , the more you risk causing more human birth and an alternate timeline in which war , starvation , or drug  immune diseases wipe out more people that would have died had you not tried . by sticking to a smaller number of people and a more recent event with fewer possible ramifications , you ' re more likely to come out saving more lives than endangering .

9. " fuck off " thank you for your input . when you ' re on the clock you ' re expected to at least meet corporate and customer expectations . if you can do neither then any job that relates to working with people is not for you . when you ' re off the clock and on your time you can do whatever pleases you .
