1. however , and don ' t down vote me here just for bringing up the contrary position the nuclear fireball in the center of our solar system seems to have a majority say in the activity , heat and weather patterns of the planet earth . currently there are zero sunspots  i direct you to nasa on the data . as a result earth ' s the climate has been shifting again . a bit " cooler " than what was anticipated by the computer models that al gore used . also  the temperature of mars has heated and cooled on the same curve as the earth , as measured by nasa . which may suggest that perhaps the sun has a say in both planet ' s temperatures . all said , however , if your opponent in your debate does not use this data , and is simply quoting rush limbaugh . i would say you need to dismiss this parrot and find new friends . again , even if there were significant proof pointing to the sun as the only cause of warming , i do not suggest that humanity should continue to waste resources and continue to use oil to make plastic bags , roads , and hummers .
