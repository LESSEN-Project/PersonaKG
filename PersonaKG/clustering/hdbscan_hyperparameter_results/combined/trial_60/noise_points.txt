1. yeah , they could have swapped these amateur  oriented modes " effects " and " scene " for u3 and u4 . they messed this up on the d7100 by putting " effects " between u1  u2 and m  a  s  p and i still like the d7000 ' s approach on this for the same reason  on this type of camera , they could easily go with m  a  s  p , u1  u2  u3 and nothing more . if the d750 could go up to , say , digit fps with a grip and if it had an adequate buffer depth , it would be something of an upgrade from the d700 . i agree it could be named d650 , because the d6xx could have more serious af in the first place . if i was soon going for an fx body , i ' d gladly pay the price of the digit for a d750 without these things that are crippling it .
   (ID: 32520dc340c18ed101e3d5ea02b3a7bca25dcc29)

2. usually the biggest problems are when there is an issue at the handoff point between us and another carrier . at that point it becomes a battle of proving yourself right that your network is not at fault . so basically it ' s an it brawl . another challenge is trying to figure out how the dumbasses that provisioned it actually made it work even though the design looks like crap . so you will hear a lot of us yelling " what the fuck ? at the monitor . so not only do i troubleshoot networks , i troubleshoot stupidity . but yeah learning is always great . in my opinion , the second someone decides that they don ' t care to learn anymore , that ' s when they stop a fundamental aspect of life . not learning is boring . which is another reason why this career is great . there is always new hardware and software to learn .
   (ID: 388a9b7cd52305ad65297c63f4c50272c2661e4c)

   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

8. this is stupid . how can we call for a better america then specifically arrange breaking the laws we set in place . i guarantee you there  s nothing left at area digit , we all know about it , it  s a tourist zone . we should probably be worried about area digit or digit , that  s probably where they moved anything . lol
   (ID: ef2135d90df57b27df5e96791848d8d9201afd29)

9. i think this was middle school but we our science teacher was pretty funny . he would say a few things that were really stupid and  or funny each class . i kept a separate notebook filled with his quotes . one of them went like this  student   how do you take out a cell ?  teacher   okay , it  s like this  you know how you have a box of marbles ?    yeah , i guess    okay how would you take a marble out of that box ?   i would just reach in and take it , i guess .   well that  s not going to work in the case of cells .   then proceeds to continue the lesson

10. by the time time traveling was invented people might not care enough to change it , it would probably be ancient history to them and not worth rewriting history as they know it .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

11. well , i hope that you ' re still here . those friends that your referring to , those aren ' t the type you want to have . if they don ' t like you or your interests , that ' s their lost , not yours . if you don ' t mind me asking , why does your mom want you to move back in ? you may call her narcissist , but aren ' t all parents , in a way ? i would suggest you call her . if you kill yourself , it could destroy her . i wouldn ' t know , but maybe she wants you to move back in because she likes having around . maybe she needs some help , that is if she lives alone .
   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

12. hercules . it ' s hard for me to sit through the movie now , nearly every line in the entire movie is some sort of mythological reference or joke . great movie too .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

13. proposals in front of a whole crowd would be terrible . i have always thought a nice one would be very intimate and just in a really nice location at a nice time of our lives . i think if a genuine man puts in effort and real thought that ' s what matters . my sister still lives at home underneath my mother ' s house . she got proposed to by him getting on one knee under the house . worked for her but i would be underwhelmed lol . nothing hard about going somewhere beautiful and secluded . but hey , marriage isn ' t about much of this anyway . it ' s a promise to someone to love them entirely as a human for as long as that person is alive . to be the other half of that human through all of life ' s journeys . choose wisely .
   (ID: 7a3a98777bf2cebb6bd14409075a19b82035e535)

17. nothing changed ? what are you talking about ? the defensive meta is gone after all the changes . it ' s not as reliable as before to stay on defense . for honor is in a digit times better place than it was when this year began and there was no way to do damage unless you picked a dlc character and everything was shadowed by timesnap and it felt clunky . sure , they need to optimize conq ' s bashes and some more character , but even if they leave it where it is , it ' s still a fuck ton better than year digit and a little bit into year digit .
   (ID: fc02053133b0aa8d444b95ed56c24999ae82879b)

18. try talking to him in person first . it ' s weird if you message him but he has no idea who you are . work in baby steps . first try saying hi and introduce yourself and slowly work your way into having a conversation with him even if it ' s just digit seconds long .
