1. i saw a comment on a post recently imagine your lonely dying breaths , ending with you feeling comforted by what you feared most your entire life . get out there and face your fears , because behind all of them is a chance to gain new perspective and expand it and really grow and learn . our fears force us into our  comfort  zones , es little stimulation in comfort . anyways i  m rambling good night victory  hand  dark  skin  tone

3. i really enjoy my work  sometimes it ' s tough and stressful , but it ' s intellectually stimulating and i have some great colleagues for the most part . my boss also seems to appreciate me and value my input . it isn ' t perfect , but it ' s good enough . i suspect that for jobs that suck , one or more of these things is lacking .
