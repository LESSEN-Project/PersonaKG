3. there was a big difference between child tax credits and the disability element of that and the child element of uc . i can ' t remember the exact amounts as we got moved over digit yrs ago but it worked out at approx digit per week . that was with digit dla child . my 2nd child recieved his dx late last yr so i haven ' t been claiming his extra for long . i also got hit by bedroom tax despite it being medical reasons why both children couldn ' t share a room despite having medical grounds since my eldest was digit and a half . it ' s basically just so much lower than income support , especially for a couple as it was before my husband became my ex now as a single parent i ' m getting used to the new budget still

5. i havent experienced this myself purely , but i got lectured by my mom ' s colleague about it . apparently robbers just hand a sticky note to the bank teller sayain , " i have a gun . give me money " and if the teller tries to resist , they will be fired because if they get hurt , that hurts the bank ' s image . usually , the teller would just give the robber  digit or so and the police would find the criminal later . so no . it is absolutely nothing like how the media portrays it .
