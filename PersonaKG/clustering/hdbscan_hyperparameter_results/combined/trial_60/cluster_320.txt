2. you don ' t see the problem at all . you don ' t know any of the complexities or the implications of the issue , and that ' s why you think copy  pasting your own method would work . how offended would you get if the us told your own government  hey , our economy is the most successful in the world , you should copy it directly . of course you ' d be insulted . you should run your own country to your own circumstances , and we should do the same .  copy pasted from question digit mins ago

7. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .

10. i think it ' s more of a confidence issue for me . if he makes the first move than i know that he likes  wants me rather than me taking the chance and getting rejected . although i have asked out all of my past boyfriends so i don ' t require it .

11. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !
