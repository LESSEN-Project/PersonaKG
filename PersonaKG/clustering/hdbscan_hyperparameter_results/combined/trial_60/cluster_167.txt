4. i ' m a go ahead and disagree with you on that one as many people have already said the kid is digit and should already know how to treat other people property regardless and the kid did offer to pay the whole digit so op let him of easily .

5. that ' s honestly worse to me . none of the dozen people in the household noticed the kid was gone , or if they did none of them said anything . usually in big families the older kids are at least partially talked with watching the younger ones . several people dropped the ball .
