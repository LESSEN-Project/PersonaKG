2. i have done this . in highschool , me and my group of friends used to hangout , party , and usually end up crashing at each others places . i am half awake one morning , and my pen tip felt strangely good . open my eyes , it ' s literally rested between my buddies cheeks . i recoil , he ' wakes up ' like two minutes later , and never says anything . a few years later , comes out of the closet to his parents while he and i are in their car driving back to their place to spend the night and get the old crew back together . awkward .

3. yeah if the case cover is off i would suspect bad contact of the cooler to the cpu . with a good aftermarket cooler you shouldn  t be seeing temps like that .

4. does that include someone shooting heroin ? correct , i would not report someone to the police for shooting heroin .  you wouldn  t report that person for their own well being ? sending them to prison is not good for their well being . so again , i would not report them .  what do you define as a victimless crime ? a legal offense to which all parties consent and no party is injured .  instead of getting all defensive like a little soyboy you could have answered my sincere question . um . okay ?

   (ID: d3491a90d756046acac8c3053e9e99c3e6c231f9)

7. try to get the point across with statements like , " i haven ' t had something as good as this is a while . " , see if a mutual dialogue opens ?

8. i like how the stars on the boats represents how many seasons they played . good job !
   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

9. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .

10. omg u guys are so dumb obviously no one has ever said this to you so stop making  memes  and go get a real job like go on tumblr or something that  s a good website guys it  s obviously a joke . edit

11. if we ' re being technical , digit minutes . we agreed on dating then i changed my mind because i felt like i wasn ' t in a good mental state .
   (ID: 404d4f663681fcf738d043296148ae4de655b22b)

12. with soccefootball there are so many players around the world , plus the transfeloan system , it makes it easy for the wealthy clubs to acquire good players . in the nba it ' s a lot more difficult , sometimes there is nothing they can do . teams like the lakers and knicks would have been relegated a few years ago , despite how big of fan bases and wealth they have .

13. good question . seems to me like they might be able to answer quite a few of the questions around this case by discreetly placing a camera to catch whoever is desecrating the grave .
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)

14. i can somewhat understand this with subs like wpd , or cringeanarchy , but waterniggas ? seriously , what the fuck ? that sub is actually pretty wholesome . memes about staying hydrated can turn into good tips on living a healthy lifestyle .
   (ID: 419b67e0e2cdcb7bd8ea9a89d34d0747a1f5f620)

15. hmmmm . what would be a good place ? get everyone to head out to a wheeling spot like hot springs ? i ' m not coming up with a good one between me and you .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

16. that actually sounds like a good idea . the only problem i see possible is where do they go for work afterwards ?
