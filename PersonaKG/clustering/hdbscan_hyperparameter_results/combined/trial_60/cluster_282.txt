   (ID: 5be7ef463c3ba0c7a9c255bd9769c5f638d2b805)

12. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .

   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

18. it takes up a decent chunk , but i find myself gravitating back towards british tv . stuff like friday night dinner , it crowd , and other various shows . then again , a lot of action  y drama stuff is american . i ' d say i watch about digit  american tv .

19. my suggestion is that you should jusrify the desicions she makes based on beauty . for instances the more beautiful they are the healthier . there are uncountable ways to justify it like magic , culture , sport , economic competitiveness etc . you can make your character ' s perspective more poetic or funny . example  instead of saying " your nose is too large . you can say something like " you can ' t beyond your own nose .
   (ID: 3171687207fd659f146afaa305fc2ad7b92ea52b)
