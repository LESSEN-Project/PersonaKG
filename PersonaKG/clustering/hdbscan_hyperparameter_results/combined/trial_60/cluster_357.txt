1. by the simplest and most accurate definition , it ' s a particular act that you personally sexualise more than just about anything else . it doesn ' t have to be innately sexual . just like sexualities and , closer in relation , fetishes , nobody knows why fantasies exist . but there is speculation that the reason they remain fantasies is because people rarely see themselves participating in real life .

2. someone called me some bad stuff and admitted that the intent was to harm me . took me almost a year to figure out that bad people just exist and can fit in with society like everyone else .

3. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !

6. yeah that ' s fair enough , although players like t . brady and sydney crosby actually do do that , it ' s just more difficult for then to build super teams around them . lebron has only been able to carry a shit tier roster to the finals twice in his career , and in this year ' s case a lot has to do with the weak competition in the east . also the commercials , stoppages , and fouls are actually the biggest issue with the nba . the o my reason it seems like the " main theme " is because it ' s them only thing people are responding to . they have no answer for the terrible stoppages , fouls , and commercial breaks .

7. for the most part . the problem as i see is that the investgation was long and publicised . its been at the forefront of the news cycle for almost two years . people are burnt out on it and tired of the far left and far right . its like listening to two children argue and fight with each other . at some point everyone just wants the politicians and judiciary to shut up and run the country .

8. it ' s just a matter of what people find attractive . myself , i like all parts of the chicken !
