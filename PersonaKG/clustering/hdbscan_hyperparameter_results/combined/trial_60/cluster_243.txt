2. i swear to god if people call this post shit because it  s starco , people can have their own opinions , you can count ships as opinions if you want to . but saying this post is shit is basically calling the artists hard work shit , it  s not shit , saying that might lower the artists self esteem , so in my opinion this is a good comic

9. ever country shows certain degree of hypocrisy . when there are so many people in a single country , long term rational decisions are tough to take as humans tend to give more weightage to short term experiences while making decisions . also in democracy leader who want to come to power again , it ' s easier to take actions which seems sweet for short term . that migrant worker construction  worker most probably , isn ' t gonna vote .
