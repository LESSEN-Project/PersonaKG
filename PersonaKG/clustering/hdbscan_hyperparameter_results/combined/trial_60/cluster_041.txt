1. after completing your first life tutorialfantasy life you are free to do almost whatever you wantyou need to complete part of the story mode to unlock other places but it doesn ' t take long to . rune factory digit can get really frustrating because there are times where there is a sudden spike in difficulty namely a boss after the first arc that can be ridiculous fantasy life isn ' t frustrating unless you want it to be like taking on bosses under  leveled rune factory has a big overworked however can take forever to unlock especially for new comers to the series in fantasy life you can unlock things faster but i would advise completing it as paladin or any fighting class so you can breeze through the story . so in terms of a light game i would recommend fantasy life

2. oof , as a woman i suggest you not to spoil women that much , some of us get used to get all we want and then it ' s really hard to get on track again . not my case , i made clear to my boyfriend we are equal and he can count on me as much as i can count on him . i suggest you to talk to her and give her an ultimatum , you should take care of her but she ' s abusing it and not thanking what you do for her . obviously you need to change this , and don ' t have any kids for now , neither more pets or expenses . that wouldn ' t be good for the kids or you .

3. i  m a nanny and honestly you pay for what you get . if you want someone to take care of your kids with love and care then you need to pay them happily . the family i nanny right now don  t need me for many hours but they don  t want to lose me so they still pay me my normal pay . if you want someone who you will trust and will take good care of your kids , you pay a considerable amount .

5. because if you ' re booking it that close to the date you probably really want or need to go , so you kind of bend over and they fuck you . if they tried to fuck you sooner you might be able to travel another way .
