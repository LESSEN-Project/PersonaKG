7. the post says not to bring a kuruma or other armored vehicles . you replied to my post , you must have that that digit statement . so what do you do ? you wring a car with weapons in a heist with you to use it in that heist . i couldn ' t care less if you used it to drive around in and then parked it at the side of the road . instead you decided to use it . i have explained why i rather not have people use those cars makes it more difficult for other players because enemies scatter , the passengers never gain any decent gun skills because the vehicle is doing all the covering for them  generally speaking people who drive armored vehicles are douchebags who ram into each other with their cars or drive over people . still using your car is the douchy thing to do if people ask of you not to use it .
