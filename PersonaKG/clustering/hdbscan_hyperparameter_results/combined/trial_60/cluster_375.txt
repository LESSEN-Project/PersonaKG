   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

3. romney allowed some folks to take his money and turn it into more money for him , and that qualifies as work ? yes , as a matter of fact i think our country would be doing a lot better if we elected people with janitorial experience to national office .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

5. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

6. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

7. i think we are looking at this from a totally different point of view . my primary concern is the unnecessarily destructive behaviour of people on the local ecosystem . and i guess you are inspired by what you see as a romantic gesture .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

8. i agree . do you think it ' s white people ' s fault that the number of black people in these fields is so small , like a lot of people think ?
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

9. think long and and about the history of black and white people in this country . now tell me . why do you think it ' s not considered racist ?
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

10. or it ' s a bullshit made up story , hoping that they will be one of the first to receive it . reminds me if some guy who demanded to receive his kickstarter shit faster than other people because of some condition . think it was shiftware .
   (ID: b25bdf3935142c93d642393810cba283ec3b801f)

11. it was a whole group . digit people and we were great . but we grew apart and i try not to think about it
   (ID: 41ecb08cd807b953da29a82cba9ddfcf32745fc3)

12. i think that people shouldn  t have to lie about their beliefs . i think their religious beliefs shouldn  t be mentioned at all
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

13. being happy and being usefull for other people . for me if you think you shouldn ' t be happy you are living wrong and if you think it ' s fine being a useless piece of shit you are living wrong as well .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

14. i don ' t care if people think i ' m misogynistic though . i think people should be responsible for their actions . if you have sex and get pregnant you should accept responsibility for your actions . if someone thinks i ' m misogynistic , the worst they can do is call me a misogynist and take away some of my " whose line is it anyway " internet points , or if this is a face to face conversation , they can ' t even take away my internet points , so what do i care ?
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

15. people often hide names in screenshots , i think it is  was against the rules to include them .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

16. what the fuck ? i wonder if these kinds of people ever take a step back to question their insanity and then go ahead and do the crazy shit anyway . or if they do question themselves , what sort of stuff do they think is too crazy and don ' t follow through .
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

17. i think it ' s more of a celebration than a " get people back into the game " sort of deal .
   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)
