1. sometimes i think that no matter how hard our life is , no matter how much we suffer or put others in pain , the people who have passed on are laughing because they know it doesn ' t matter and nothing matters in life because there ' s something else that ' s better for everyone once we pass on . as far as i know , death only affects those that are living .

2. how do you deal with people like that ? i struggle with people already but when it ' s someone either not listening or think they know better i end up snapping at them

3. i hate how people think that it ' s a woman ' s job to be the one who does housework . in a perfect relationship yes , i know there ' s no such thing both the man and woman do equal parts of the housework .

5. always wondered what law graduates think of working in claims firms ? the only people i know who are solicitors are older and came up before they started being a thing . are they desirable or are they the equivalent of call centre work ?

6. i hate when people call women hoes . what makes you think being a " hoe " is a bad thing ? what makes a hoe ? also how do they know you ' re a hoe ?
