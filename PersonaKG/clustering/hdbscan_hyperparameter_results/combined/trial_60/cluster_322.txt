6. it  s unclear what knowledge , or lack thereof , hannity is using to make his prediction . i hadn ' t listened to hannity in almost a decade , so i first asked the question " how the fuck does this putz know any damn thing about the inside of that administration "  phone calls between hannity and trump are frequent occurrences , discussing everything from hannity  s show to trump  s frustration with the mueller investigation and to what the president should tweet , according to more than a dozen friends , advisers and associates of trump and hannity who told the washington post in april . oh . you know , somehow this seems worse than trump being a fan of alex jones . at least he ' s widely known as a crackpot yelling from the fringe . hannity is still , somehow , mainstream .
