8. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

15. i think a lot of this comes down to the definitions of coercion and seduction . yes , in seduction the idea is to do your best to be enticing to someone . however , this should not be confused with a bending of their will or a manipulation . coercion is doing whatever is necessary to achieve a desired response from someone else , including putting extra pressures on them , which can be easily done if the coercing party is in a position of power , whether that is physical strength , employment , or status . seduction is like giving someone all green lights , coercion is like trying to take the steering wheel .

   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

20. i think i found it ! something called " captain blasto . this article says that one of his lines is " honey i ' m home "  here ' s a gameplay video , though it looks ps1 instead of n64 . but this is definitely your guy , in space with a blaster with the wisecracks very much like the gex game i remembered
