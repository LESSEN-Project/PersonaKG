2. we welcome everyone to help with all our community projects ! i may type boldly at you if you deviate from the blueprints that are in my head thus only i can see them . but for now , this project is on hold . we are on a temporary map after the beta update . once we are on our permanent map , i ' ll get going again on it .

3. have you tried closing all of your vents in case you  re getting it through those ? you could be also getting air in the dash vents . if it  s not sealed you  ll likely get water in too which you could check by going through a car wash . to fix that would be to have the windshield pulled and resetting with new adhesive . my escape has a  wind  noise when driving but that  s caused by the wipers .

4. irrespective . i allot  digit  digit for money above the taxes etc . a tip is not a guarantee , it ' s a weird custom that only applies to certain industry workers . why do baristas get tipped but not mcdonald ' s ? why restaurant delivery but not amazon or post service ? i ' ll partake in the custom because it ' s a social expectation , but i have my equally arbitrary rules for how i ' m going to pay it .

5. i have seen ghost busters and back to the future and i ' ll get even more downvoted than you for this , but they are both hugely overrated . especially ghost busters . lot of nostalgia tinted glasses going on there .

6. do you own one ? range anxiety i heard is a thing but apparently it  s not as bad and when you put where you are going into the map it calculates how much charge and if you should pull in to a charger and how long it  ll take
