1. whilst browsing hentai porn as a horny teenager i was popping in and out of various categories looking for something fapworthy when i spotted ' loli ' without yahoo or altavista ' ing the term . ' pre google ' i clicked it and instantly felt sick , turned my computer off and worried for almost a week that someone was going to find it on my computer and think i was a pedophile . iirc i reinstalled windows thinking it would hide it . heh bad times .

5. i ' m going to assume that you , as a police force , have limited resources , and you can ' t possibly investigate every reference to some crazy thing in art . so , if that ' s the case , how do you choose what to investigate ? are you investigating rappers because you think they ' re more likely to be involved in crime ? that could be racist and prejudiced . if you ' re investigating rappers why haven ' t you investigated carrie underwood for " before he cheats " ? start to see why it might be a civil liberties issue ?
