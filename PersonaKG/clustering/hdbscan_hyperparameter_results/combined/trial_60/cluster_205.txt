   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

5. i personally fell out of an uber two night before my internship started and wrecked my face . had the scaries so bad i didn  t do anything for digit weeks . really was an eye opener to me . still get dumb like a normal college student but made me notice things can get out of hand , and that i am not the best drunk lol
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

7. probably like digit percent cause no one will really notice and it ' s a decent amount of money
   (ID: 818422b560c80f37eedf14f771cd2fcd3657589a)

   (ID: c787052a42459acc9cd2034c7531250ccd441795)

9. yeah , that ' s a little unfair . although there would be false positives there too , like " you must really enjoy the elliptical "
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

10. what is the worst thing about you ? how dirty is your bathroom , really ? where would you like to go on your next vacation ? how many monkeys can fit into a barrel ?

   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

12. customers that pick up an item from the shelf and then put it back in the wrong place . like , you can see that everything is in its place , is it really that hard to put things back where they are ?
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

13. i draw the line up to where someone tells another person to harm another . example   go out and cause x harm  or  go harass x  and the logical call to actions like saying there  s a fire in a movie theater when there really isn  t . other than that it  s fair game no matter how hateful the words are .
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

14. that sounds like you have some really tense fingers , no idea what would help with that . my best guess would be to pay attention to your hand while you play and see if it gets super tense , and if so relax a bit . otherwise visiting your doctor might help
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

15. invention of the ballista  " what if we make it , like , really really big "

16. you should really be able to deflect bayonet charges like this with a well  timed melee attack . it doesn ' t have to kill the target like it does here , but it should stop the charge and prevent you from dying . it could even work differently across different melee weapons , or only be a feature for certain ones . example being that it ' s much harder to shove aside a bayonet charge with a knife than it is a large club or shovel .
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

17. it really do be like that sometimes
   (ID: 88279b92dca36b3b3c236d960135a2afe2e68b33)

   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

19. are you serious ? edit  i ' d be glad to help you and all , but that ' s really not a lot to go on . sorry for sounding like an ass , though .
   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)
