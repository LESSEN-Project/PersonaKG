1. depends on where your mind is at the time . how was your day ? are you happy ? sad ? angry ? how much acid ? what kind of trip are you looking to have ? have you ever dropped acid before ? are you an experienced cosmonaut ? there ' s nothing wrong with dropping acid alone at digit pm . as long as you are doing the drug and the drug isn ' t doing you

2. why does what you do in your free time have any bearing on what you do at work ? in your mind , is it impossible for someone who likes to get high to refrain from doing so at work ? if you drink beer or alcohol , how is that any different ? should having a beer at home disqualify you from driving a forklift at work the next day ? these are genuine questions .
