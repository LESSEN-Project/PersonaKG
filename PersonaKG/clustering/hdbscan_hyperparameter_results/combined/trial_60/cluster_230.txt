1. just make a new character ! that  s part of the game ! learning and trying new builds ! just re  level another character ! it  s endless excuses over at that community when the fact of the matter is  the game is complicated for the sake of being complicated . plus , the story  theme  tone is nothing great like diablo digit and digit were . poe is not a valid replacement for diablo in my eyes .
   (ID: 9414b9913220ebe2601862e3001aac74ebcffe33)

   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

6. agreed , the idea that someone or something created all of this intentionally is kind of saddening . i like the idea that we just show up here do our thing and then we  re done way more than being put here by someone do do things , potentially under their control .
   (ID: c89ddae23e08cef80eb492a534ca8ddb441aa512)

11. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets

   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

19. well , my nightmare won ' t let me do it . i have far less control in a nightmare . in a regular dream , my phone is easy to find because i just decide to pull it out of my back pocket . i call him because he ' s always on my side . he ' s my lily new vegas . we also work well in real life because we compliment each other ' s strengths and weaknesses . he ' s my ultimate sidekick in my dreams . i can get him to appear in a lot of ways , though . sometimes , i just have to call for him . if he ' s not around , i call him . if i ' m in more of a mystical  magical setting , i like to get creative and summon him or have him make some grand appearance .
   (ID: ca13e283de9a99b9eb1cf4f68eed33eccff74e35)

20. hell yeah you said it bro . or when you like chillin in the park and some guy comes with his girlfriend and hog the monkey bars and all the other play equipment just to show off " look at us crossfitting " and all the kids stare in disbelieve and ask what are they doing ? how the fuck do you explain that to a kid ? " well son , they have mental issues " not that i have kids but i see them fucking up the playgrounds !
