   (ID: f7713e4cd0a5245097f9f45a1194222bda369b48)

4. harassment is indeed illegal . just wanted to point out that we shouldn ' t hate on people who simply states their dislike of the lgbtq community , as that is what homophobes wants us to do so they can have an excuse to harass us .

   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

7. apologies if my comment came across as uncivil and misunderstood . i wasn ' t insulting the op in the slightest  in both of our cultures what i said is deemed friendly banter and it is a difficult situation as the internet is globalised so certain cultures reading this would take what i said to be offensive however the person this was directed at would digit  understand where my intent lay . i do however understand that there may be people reading this who could find it offensive even if it wasn ' t directed at them so i can see why it was removed . i just wanted to clarify that there was zero malice in my statement . thanks .

   (ID: afdf67bb8f008481f179013844deeffa5b1b9a03)

9. omg . murder and war are just examples of the flexibility of human morals . i knew some idiot would get wrapped around the axle over some inconsequential minutia and miss my point . it was simplistic to make a point . morality is completely relative based . mistakes are made when i apply my morals to your situation . fuck , people , get out of the fucking weeds . op wasn ' t asking about specific moral issues just morality in general . goddammit .
   (ID: 06f2b7a65e600f531fbc47a595626f329ee413a4)

   (ID: cd0b72d117bf74908c3edaaf3947b089a9dafc0c)

13. people that hate others for the way they are , are just sad individuals , and nothing else .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

14. men are just mad that they  re being asked to be better people . if the ad doesn  t apply to you , there  s no reason to get mad at it . if you  re getting angry at it , you  re probably a part of the population gillette has asked to be better .
   (ID: 12803a9aad224d0537b68ab83a6cdc6a45d3160f)

15. misophonia is a serious disorder . if you file for divorce , you might be on the wrong end though . seeing a psychologist might be more beneficial . what about all the other people you hear eating ? or maybe she was just absurdly loud ? who knows .
   (ID: 5bb6e2d4db1d5ccf3a1f430564735551dfb4c28b)

16. hell yeah ! preach ! just one correction tho  transgenderism isn ' t the right word . it ' s just " being transgender " . the term has a lot of baggage from people using it as a slur so for the most part we avoid using it unless joking about people being dick .
   (ID: 77e0b8c51dfb89ff57bd838b86ee4d78a9fe856f)

17. is the mail pre sorted for you or do you have to sort it ? our complex has digit mailboxes all in a row and our mail man just throws it all in and we have to sort it ourselves . almost daily i get other people  s mail . is this common ?
   (ID: 472de55a2855849453179c0ccb5234c4ea9d1192)

18. i might just be more used to being around people of my own , not that i specifically dislike another
   (ID: dc000fb877b86a0bbd3d65fe6040b512b4f5b042)

19. it probably is fake . there  s thousands of people on this app . he  s claiming something that is pretty extraordinary . if e can  t provide even a piece of evidence or a hint then i won  t give him the benefit of the doubt . that  s just me though
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

20. my problem with quidditch is that as a sport it makes no sense , because catching the snitch is worth too many points . nothing the other players do is likely to matter . as a plot device in a book so that the main character can be special , it works fine , as an actual sport , it ' s retarded . it would probably be fun to watch the first couple times just for the novelty factor of a sport people play while flying , but after that i ' m guessing it would get old .
