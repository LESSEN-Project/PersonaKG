2. that makes your opinion even more ignorant than it already was . or maybe your definition of abuse is different from mine . or maybe the abuse you suffered was insignificant . you obviously don ' t know what you ' re talking about becuase no woman who does would say any of the things you said here . nothing about this is funny . how dare you go online and perpetuate the idea to even one other woman that she could possibly deserve to be abused ? shame on you .

4. it ' s not ok for him to brush off your concerns or get angry or annoyed when you ask and then not fully answer you . when he doesn ' t give you a full answer it makes it seem as though he is hiding something . if he respects you then he wouldn ' t say you were being jealous , he would answer your question so that you don ' t have to keep wondering . how can you let it go and move on if you don ' t even know what really happened ? i wouldn ' t approach him about it as though you are mad but i would let him know you don ' t think it ' s fair and you think it is kind of disrespectful for him to let a girl that obviously doesn ' t respect your relationship to do that to him .

5. i see your point . i think it is safe to say that for the most part " they don ' t even know any better . ' they ' meaning everyone  rich , poor , middle .

6. and we don ' t know how aware he is . so with that information is it safe to say that calling this man a monster was out of line ?
