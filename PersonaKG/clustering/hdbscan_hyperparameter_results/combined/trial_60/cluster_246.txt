1. i don  t think they are ugly , i just think it  s interesting to see something marked on someone and think what was the motive behind the tattoo and what  s the story .

4. don ' t think that ' s the case . this mentions nothing about an injury here , just the marine ' s takedown and then how he was restrained . the robber was put in handcuffs , with no mention of needing medical attention .

6. the game is too big to die . with all those mods , you can even play just terraria for your entire life . maybe the hype might die and player base will be lower but i don  t think it will die .

8. so just because you disagree with it , you think it should be okay to censor it ? don ' t you see how slippery of a slope this is ?

9. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?

10. homosexuals are still able to pass along their genes , just not in the ' traditional ' sense . i think it was , but i don ' t think it is any more .
