2. sorry on mobile so i booted up the game today and accidentally clicked kyf instead of killer  the game lagged out for maybe a straight minute and then loaded killer without me backing out of kyf and selecting killer killer loaded weird , i had all the perks at rank three but all four perk slots , both addon slots and the offering slot were locked and all the cosmetics except mike ' s bloody mask eventually it smartened up but never did give me my mask back or take away the overalls . i ' ve even played a few matches and still nothing
