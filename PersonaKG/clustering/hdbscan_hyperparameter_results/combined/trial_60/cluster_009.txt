1. although apple has obviously found a way to legally enforce its will on the buying public , this is unfair . can you imagine the uproar , if say gm made it illegal to change the tires on a camaro , without their consent ? if i pay for the machine , i should have the right to modify it as i wish . this is another reason i will never buy apple .
