1. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

2. i guess all i have to say is it ' s one thing to know how to do something , and another to know why what you ' re doing works .

3. why have sex when you know that it is made for reproductive purposes if you aren  t willing to face the consequences ? and i would say we add more because it  s better to be alive and not murdered
