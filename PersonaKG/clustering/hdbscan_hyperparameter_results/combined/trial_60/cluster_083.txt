3. your argument is therefore  " there is one candy in the shop . i have a penny . some guy comes along , and tells the shopkeeper he ' ll pay a dollar for that candy . shopkeeper sells it for a dollar . " so , i can complain about why should i not get candy just because some rich people decided it ' s worth a dollar ? that ' s called socialism . the real question then is , if the city is getting richer and more propserous , why are these poor people still poor ? something wrong with wealth distribution here .

6. because you were obviously born here , have an excellent command of english and you ' re an aussie reddit user , so i ' d imagine reasonably well informed and educated and likely , left leaning . i ' m making assumptions here just as you make assumptions about these people and their situation . i ' m assuming you aren ' t working because you ' re picky about what you ' ll do to earn a dollar , consider yourself above physical labour and simply working hard , seeking opportunities where you can find them . or the most likely assumption is that you ' re just damn lazy .
