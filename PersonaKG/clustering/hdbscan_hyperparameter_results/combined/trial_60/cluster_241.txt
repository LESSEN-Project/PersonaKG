   (ID: e982e025c0604997a6e2072eb87b9bb01bed38ae)

   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

3. honestly this is one of the most encouraging responses i ' ve had to anything like this , so thank you . it ' s always amazing to be reminded that sometimes disagreeing doesn ' t have to be as ugly as it often is online . thank you .
   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

4. a lot of disney movies or maybe even things like spongebob squarepants because there are so many hidden references that you only get after you ' ve grown up .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

5. yeah i saw that today while i was at work as well . souls be out april 26th . surprised that the tcg twitter account hasn  t announced it yet . cheapest place i  ve found for devastator for me or from a site in the uk . one or two i  ve tried in the states have the product region import locked like magic is . amazon would run me about  digit .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

6. but . what reason do i cite for leaving ? i have no professional issues . i  ve never been in trouble . i bend over backwards for my guests , after all their happiness is my tip . but like i said this is what  s happening .
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

7. sounds like she  s too shallow to understand your pov and what you  ve been through . personally , that trait alone could make or break a relationship for me .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

8. saying neither you ' ve affirmed their statement . should switch it off with something like ' well it ' s more natural than  insertrandomcharacteristic . plg '
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

9. the only difference is you sound like your experience is from page digit while mine is from raising a daughter after many failed relationships as a teenager , hence my clumsy attempt at telling the young team how life works . i may not come across like it but i am the voice of experience . i  ve lived it
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

10. most blackouts leave only fragments of memory of the night , like no context mental screenshots , which may pop up in your head for a few days after . takes a lot to get so drunk that you remember nothing at all but i ' ve done it like digit to many times .
   (ID: 864d1fa2ae2c7d60534e62e5a4b00fcb39a2c565)

11. some random garden type thing that my mom brought me to when i was like digit . it was a wip then . i  ve brought it up multiple times , saying that we should go check it out , and she doesn  t remember . it  s too vivid to have not existed .
   (ID: c89ddae23e08cef80eb492a534ca8ddb441aa512)

12. i will shine on you , like it was the only thing i ' ve ever wanted to do . shine by the smith street band
   (ID: f6b8978c4b660719e17dff38ba86c988b9bf86f5)

13. the answers to these tell me a lot about a person . what  s on your playlist ? what  s the most fulfilling experience of your past year ? what  s the funniest thing you  ve ever done ? how many times have you cheated on a partner ? what  s that body count looking like ?
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

14. nah man , even if you put the scenes in chronological order it still has no plot . i  ve tried to appreciate the movie , but nothing happens . compared to other tarantino movies , even ones light on story like kill bill , it doesn  t hold up .
   (ID: c418fa452eafbca022ce1c49b521d4574aa77cd1)

15. listen , as i ' ve aged i ' ve come to find that someone somewhere will always find you attractive . regardless of what a census says . sounds like you ' re having an identity crisis .
