1. what do you want ? answer that first even just to yourself and then it will be clearer what you should do . i want hugh jackman to come over to my house and rub me with oil and roger me senseless . i can want all i want  nothing wrong with wanting . it is just that what we want is not always going to happen .

   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

5. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .
   (ID: 4422c1db26c9be5bec35694a448a490c2761d985)

6. welcome to life brother they want you to have digit years experience but your digit . just apply and always include a cover letter about what makes you a good candidate . why were your other jobs so short ? that could be why your not getting many call backs . maybe take the digit month job off your resume .
   (ID: 472de55a2855849453179c0ccb5234c4ea9d1192)

7. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

8. i ' m turning digit next week but right now i just want to not be an asshole
   (ID: 79fc72ea72532d39a039ecb4e47a630a601ff4a8)

9. yta , sorry to burst your bubble , but you can ' t make someone do anything to you . if she doesn ' t want to have sex , she doesn ' t . and making her give you a bj just fucked it up even more .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

10. one of my pet peeves is that here in oregon the signs say " motorcycles use extreme caution " that they can craft a sign with four words that has two mistakes  okay , one definite mistake and one iffy word choice  just makes me want to bang my head against a wall .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

11. haha it was a one time thing via tinder so i don ' t have it , but i would suggest you just be upfront and say you want that to happen .
   (ID: c6e395c03fa0151554baed67a84968066bfa9cf3)

12. well that just sounds lazy to me . is that the only reason people want illegals is so we don  t have to do the jobs nobody wants to do ? what job could be so terrible that somebody wouldn  t take it ?
   (ID: 89a759866debf6704efa0f603c1b9c4476abd731)

13. just quit . they don ' t own you , you can do whatever you want with your life . i can understand you may have a tough time with her personality , so just simply send an email or write a note and attach it to your timecard or whatever , and simply say you are giving your two weeks notice as you have been given an opportunity to do something new and exciting in your life . thank  you and good  bye !

14. mosquitoes . they cause the most human deaths compared to any other living thing . seriously , whenever i see one flying around , whether it ' s minding its own business or looking for a midnight snack , i get my zapper and dart to the other side of the room . i ' m literally fine with a spider , i even held a jumping spider to put it outside , with my bare hands ! but i can ' t even look at a mosquito without trying to reach for my zapper . i just realized that i made this a confession . sorry to those who didn ' t want to hear that .
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

15. yeah , i ' m waiting for my legs and arms to rot off , the cancer to spread , and my life to be completely be disassembled by people who i never meant ill  will for . even my family is going to be killed . strict . i just want to be father to my kid and have him have someone to look up to by living well with the short  trip i was given . maybe , too late .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

16. i agree with you . it ' s disrespectful when people say friend zoned . all you want me for is to get in my pants ? if you don ' t value my friendship then just leave .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

17. she gave both of them the exact same treatment and even tried to get him to hang out at a different time . how is that playing favourites ? he doesn  t get to kick someone out of the friend group just because he  s not comfy around them anymore . everyone else is still friends with her . it doesn  t matter that he was around first , she  s here now and has just as much right to have friends as he does . it sucks that he missed out on game night because he didn  t want to see her , but that  s his problem , not op  s .
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

18. that whole  shoot your brains out  answer might have been the one you wanted but it  s still a answer , you won  t want to whip out your cock and beat it to death if your brains are all over the room it  s just an solution not saying he should i  m just saying that would stop the sex drive
   (ID: cd907372aff0871825a64e977822586e3bb0ecb7)

19. you can smoke if you want to , just understand the ramifications for your actions .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

20. so you pointing out that it ' s about race and gender implying that you want it to be true just because she is a woman and an african please provide a valid counter argument or fuck off with your faminazi sentimentality .
