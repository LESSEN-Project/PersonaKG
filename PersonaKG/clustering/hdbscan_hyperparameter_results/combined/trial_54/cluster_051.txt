Total from this dataset: 45

1. you ' re staying strong mate , good to hear . it might be unnecessary to reward yourself ' cos you ' re doing so well anyway , but you could always treat yourself with something like a massage , pamper treatment or the like . your way of rewarding you , if you think about your winnings and the fact you ' re not pissing your money away on booze instead like we all have , i reckon it is well deserved ! not your thing ? ziplining ?
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

2. i think hot manifests crazy , and i like hot . so by the power of association , i like crazy
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

3. no way . i don ' t think i ' d like to be a kid in this day and age . potentially everything i do would be saved for posterity somewhere on the internet
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

4. except for my very first post where i said lgbtqwhatever , because that  s what those napoleons like to be called , please , show another one of my post , where i was arguing ? i simply stated what i strongly and firmly believe . now back to people , who like to suck dicks , being fuk in the ass , licking each other  i don  t care what they like to be called and what they think they are . they are mentally ill people to me . i could make myself more clear .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

5. i think it ' s like disco domination where it ' s release is delayed but alot more worse
   (ID: 84a0b9e5d9e0e37c98f992c96c029f6ec99fb1ca)

6. spoiler this makes me think of jason segel at the end of episode digit , season digit , of how i met your mother . what was he going through to produce a scene like that .
   (ID: ccc20fb024de820a5ad1bfc4117d69d6b7c3a6c9)

7. he didn ' t almost collapse a grooming gang trial and it utterly transparent that you only all of a sudden give a shit about the victims because you think it bolsters your point of ' football man bad ' . you didn ' t care about those girls before and you don ' t care about them now and that is precisely why someone like tommy robinson came to prominence .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

8. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

9. i think i speak for most atheists when i say that i cringe hard when i see fuckheads like this .
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

10. it  s more like you return to home . i think it  s a pun on peter being a kid like spider man get back home ! or the chancla !
   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

11. i think everyone pronounces their ts like ds if its in the middle of a word
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

12. never ever pay first for challenge services . if they refuse , find another person . i think this is the only way i got scammedwasn  t much , like digit chaos , but the act of being scammed leaves a bad taste in my mouth . item trades are much easier to avoid
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

13. the game let you continue to a3 without getting vampirism ? that doesn ' t seem like it should happen . huh . i ' m trying to think unless you can go back to another save if there ' s an alternate path , like something with the black ring , that doesn ' t involve trying to ascend at the moment .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

14. yeah i fear that a lot actually , especially since i watch hentai from time to time which is nothing like real life . think i should quit ?
   (ID: 1e6ea64fb15fb5b12b1d82a3a5bdced4e3a6559a)

15. no way ! i grew up on the prequels so i have the nostalgia goggles going on . that being said , i rewatched them last year after years of not seeing them and view them differently now . i like the phantom menace , but still think jar jar and anakin significantly make the movie worse . i do hate that the actors suffered immensely after the film but that doesn  t change that their movie parts sucked .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

16. thank dude , but i posted this hours ago and there is like digit person registered on it . don ' t think this is going well .
   (ID: e3524b3478c664f2c6e8b00a4341ff0a26995fbc)

17. i used to be like that too , not anymore though . but i ' m afraid i will at some point think about it again so i like to make jokes because it makes something i ' m scared of a little less scary .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

18. well then . i could explain where i think it may come from , but no matter what i come up with , i feel like i would have to join  imgoingtohellforthis permanently .
   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

19. he was trying to wife you i bet . also out of curiosity . how old are you and what ' s your " number " if you had to guess . i ' d like to guage what you think is more than your fair share compared to mine
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

20. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
