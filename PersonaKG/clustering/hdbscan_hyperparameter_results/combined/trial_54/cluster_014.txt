4. be aware that if you ' re caught and you probably will be , no matter which way you go about it , the consequences may be a bit more severe than them just saying " no , you can ' t do that " . you may well be ejected from the park , barred for life , or possibly have security involved . the only way for you to do it and feign ignorance and possibly get away with it and i am not condoning this at all would be to try going through hogwarts express or the main entrance and , if caught and chances are you will be , saying that you thought the parks were the same . but , if you try this , you ' re a bit of an idiot , and even more of a complete git .

7. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .
