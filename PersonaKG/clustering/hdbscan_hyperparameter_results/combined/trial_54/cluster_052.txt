12. yes , it  s not rape . i personally believe you should always disclose that you  re transgender , even in short term activities like hook ups , for your safety . what if someone outs you to them ? what if blah blah blah . a lot of things could go wrong . there  s plenty of stories online where they talk about how they almost got beat up or killed because they disclosed they  re trans or forgot to or something . personally , as a trans man myself , i want to know if my partner or hook up is a trans woman . i wouldn  t be mad or anything last minute , but i would want to know .

18. understanding you can laugh at dick jokes all you want while being mature in my opinion , but if dont understand something and your trying to argue it , you are highly immature . as well as knowing when a dick joke or anything else considered " immature " would be a very bad idea ex  any serious situation my point is , you can be immature , as long as you know when you should and shouldn ' t

19. i don ' t know why they switched . most articles on the topic mention the same sequence of events , with that detail missing . 1800s  kids ' clothes are unisex . everyone wears white dresses until around the age of digit or digit . white because it ' s the easiest to clean at the time . 1910s  blue is mentioned for girls , pink for boys . 1940s  the public decides they want gender  differentiated clothing . manufacturers , for whatever reason , go against the social norms of the previous few decades .
