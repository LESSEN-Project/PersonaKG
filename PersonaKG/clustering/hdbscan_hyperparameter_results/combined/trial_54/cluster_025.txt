1. another good strategy is to have foreknowledge of whether or not they say " shoot " at the end of the phrase , and then do the opposite of what they do to disrupt the round to give them more time to think , and generally they ' ll not choose rock since they had to think for a longer period of time , and will digit  of the time choose scissor , allowing you to choose rock and beat them .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

2. i think it ' s because half the time you keep talking to the wrong end . pick the side that ' s not blowing hot air , and you ' ll have a good conversation . if you do pick the wrong side , run , for it will soon be smelly .
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

3. i  m a big decepticon fan , and these guys are an inescapable purchase for me . even moreso because i  m in canada and the wait sucks , so i  ll go stateside for it online . one of the thing i think some people have overlooked is that since there are digit bots for devestator , in order to make the star math work , we see the firsts 4pt filler bots .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

4. i mean you could try to have a long distance relationship even if you think it won ' work . and if it does work out , you ' ll be happy that you tried it .
   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

5. glad we ' re on the same page in this technological age i think more people are looking into names and most people will check what they mean , but they ' ll always be some .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

6. tell that to the people who object to the " n " word . i ' ll bet you ' re really careful with that one aren ' t you ? this discussion is such a shame , because as i said earlier , i agree with you on this issue . my point was that your message gets lost in the abusive language you use . anyway , i think we ' re done here , don ' t you ?
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

10. i never understand what people think will happen if lowe is gone . i ' ll answer that question , nothing . nothing will happen good or bad .
   (ID: e3a37ef234435ebde735894f98de2b3f90e3bbe9)

11. i don ' t think you should feel embarrassed . as far as i understand , you didn ' t really have a choice back then and your friend will probably understand this . i think he ' ll mainly be glad you ' re doing fine now .
   (ID: bfc2e9a6e5f84327293fa1a1fd0287066782bcec)

12. do you think he supports negligent homicide investigations for miscarriages ? either a fetus is a person , or it isn ' t  if you push hard enough , i bet you ' ll find that ryan ' s beliefs have the same inconsistencies as most republicans . it ' s not about preserving life . it ' s about punishing sluts .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

13. i think in all fairness , i should explain to you exactly what it is that i do . for instance tomorrow morning i ' ll get up nice and early , take a walk down over to the bank and . walk in and see and , uh . if you don ' t have my money for me , i ' ll . crack your fuckin ' head wide  open in front of everybody in the bank . and just about the time that i ' m comin ' out of jail , hopefully , you ' ll be coming out of your coma . and guess what ? i ' ll split your fuckin ' head open again . ' cause i ' m fuckin ' stupid . i don ' t give a fuck about jail . that ' s my business . that ' s what i do .

   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

16. jack handey v  o  if you ' re in a war , instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy , throw one of those small pumpkins . maybe it ' ll make everyone think how stupid war is , and while they are thinking , you can throw a real grenade at them .
   (ID: 2988ee1cd7a2bcf8e2d215c795ee2d06a985665a)

17. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

18. it ' s the equivalent of canned laughter  the reader is being prompted to laugh . i ' ll laugh if i think something is funny . in fact , if i read something funny but the writer includes a " lol " , i will stifle my laugh . principles .
