7. because you were obviously born here , have an excellent command of english and you ' re an aussie reddit user , so i ' d imagine reasonably well informed and educated and likely , left leaning . i ' m making assumptions here just as you make assumptions about these people and their situation . i ' m assuming you aren ' t working because you ' re picky about what you ' ll do to earn a dollar , consider yourself above physical labour and simply working hard , seeking opportunities where you can find them . or the most likely assumption is that you ' re just damn lazy .
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

15. his creator  owned stuff is fine . it ' s when you give him someone else ' s creation to play with that he can ' t be trusted . chances are he ' ll kill off your favorite character and replace them with a new one that either has zero personality or his just so annoying that you actively root against them . otherwise , he ' ll just spit on the continuity because it ' s getting in the way of the story he ' s trying to tell .
   (ID: 17d6f5fb6fdd1b0ceedb5ec118276bdbb72a462f)

16. op makes claim using vague terms , gets told to define term , provides definition , gets argued with or laughed at for mistaken assumptions . that ' s usually how things work around here . just substituting ' circlejerk ' for ' god ' or ' soul ' or ' spiritual ' or whatever the hell else . tell me exactly what you mean by it and i ' ll tell you what you have wrong . tl  dr whoosh
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

17. do you mean that they don  t marry ? if they are in your court you  ll just have to pick a partner for them

18. good luck . if you get a craving , just do something different . for instance , if i get one in the car , i ' ll change the channel and listen to something else that distracts me . on chantix , the cravings pass pretty quickly , if you have any at all .
   (ID: 5603c8fcb517a4b5745afb8c3f46248974edebe3)

19. your argument is therefore  " there is one candy in the shop . i have a penny . some guy comes along , and tells the shopkeeper he ' ll pay a dollar for that candy . shopkeeper sells it for a dollar . " so , i can complain about why should i not get candy just because some rich people decided it ' s worth a dollar ? that ' s called socialism . the real question then is , if the city is getting richer and more propserous , why are these poor people still poor ? something wrong with wealth distribution here .
