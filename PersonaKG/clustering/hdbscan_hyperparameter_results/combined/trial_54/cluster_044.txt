1. a few years ago , i was sitting in class doing my homework . the kid in front me , who at the time was my friend , turnt around and said " i think we should just nuke iran . this pissed me off , because im persian and i would prefer if my aunt wasn ' t turned into nuclear fallout . he then went on to say that the second amendment shouldn ' t apply to muslims  middle eastern people . a quick google search showed him that most of the post digit  digit terrorists were native born white people with more in common with him than me
   (ID: e7d4349520d7fd2b6b8d8e41558874e7ce55f7c3)

2. the question was " what is the first thing you think of " . i didn ' t say that i was stating facts , it is just the first thing that comes to mind . i have never actually been there so i can ' t say anything for sure . that is just what i think of .
   (ID: 388a9b7cd52305ad65297c63f4c50272c2661e4c)

3. i don ' t think there is any " one " for us . i think there are many potential people for all of us . if we just spend our lives bettering ourselves , being alert yet patient , we will find happiness . in ourselves and in someone else , if we so desire . all will work out . red  heart my two cents .
   (ID: 445ba4596e4bcff0c96b23f038cf784185970198)

4. a sect ? or maybe just call it by the name of the group . i think namenerds is more about names for people or characters or pets , rather than words in general . you might have better luck on another subreddit .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

5. i think its fun to find a corner of the map and gun down as many as i can until the storm comes . especially when theres challenges and cool rewards involved . i never play the base game normally so i never faced any of the problems everyone else was having . i just think its fun shooting guys which im not good enough to do normally
   (ID: 8f5b0c902ce9c2bf19ecdb9205cb3d9f2a7c14fa)

6. lol what are you going to say ? just straight up ask  what are your views on feminism ?  you think a guy that wants to have sex with you is going to say  oh i hate women  ?
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

7. yea i think that  s what it all comes down to at the the end of the day . i  m always looking for a quick fix or an escape or the easy way out , i need to just confront my problems . i know exactly who i wanna be , i  m just too lazy or scared to get out my comfort zone and just do it . but nobody can make the decision but me . no therapy , distractions , drugs are gonna do it for me . sorry if this is all rambling and incoherent , i  m still pretty blazed . but i think i  m starting to understand . you don  t know how much this means to me man , thanks

8. of course my argument makes sense so long as you think about it properly . the effective skill of your team lowers when someone is simply feeding , or their focus blinded by anger . getting tilted and becoming unable to play your best handicaps you and your team , effectively lowering the skill of that player .  and you can ' t control soccer or football in that regard because people who throw in those games get permanently banned from the league yeah , and the exact same thing happens in professional dota digit . another similarity between dota digit and football  soccer is that you don ' t get permanently banned from throwing games just by playing casual matches with randoms .

9. you don ' t . you just think you do .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

10. thanks , good to know i ' m not alone . i think the problem comes from how people take the word " noob " to mean . most people here think not being a noob is just able being able to win or get high ranks , so if you win or have a high rank then you ' re not a noob . for me not being a noob means being able to aim well , win fights and just having good general fps skills , as well as all the br skills survival , camping , etc . lots of people who win are terrible at fps stuff and they don ' t even realise it . i see it often when spectate .

11. go , why the hell not ? just be smart and have a plan to gtfo if everything goes south midway through . i think you should tell someone you ' re going , a friend an adviser or someone you can count on if it goes to shit . you will regret not going .
   (ID: f4e4929bb0bef09e7eb72aaccf20c2d9454729c7)

12. honestly i think you should go get a makeover and try focusing on your own beauty . i could see how that  s irritating and tbh i don  t even know how you would begin to deal with that but maybe ask her to tone it down with talking with you or maybe find another outlet for support ? idk if i felt this way i  d get my hair done and go shopping maybe get laser hair removal just feel good for yourself .
   (ID: c502154cdae9232a9351bdc0e55d2030d75a8094)

13. i think you ' re good as you are . never listen to these negative people , just ignore them . your hair looks pretty nurtured  normal , and your breasts might be smaller but that is completely okay , there is nothing wrong with you ma ' am !
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

14. by god its a little baby . what country sends babies to school ? i ' m not judging per say , if that ' s what your country does that ' s fine . it just seems odd from where i ' m sitting . then again my kids came to work with me from the age of digit to digit when they started school . you probably think that is weird .
   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

15. she invited you to her house , showered while you were there and was willing to let you see her in just a towel ? i think you missed some signals , buddy .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

16. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

17. homosexuals are still able to pass along their genes , just not in the ' traditional ' sense . i think it was , but i don ' t think it is any more .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

18. and if that small chance does happen . what are you going to do without a way to get help ? get yourself out ? what if you were just hiking in the forest and you find yourself lost , without a way home ? i don  t think the ability to pay taxes will help in that situation , imo .
   (ID: 93c3b3d523de0afd404d3bcb4acdf023866f9281)

19. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

20. god , i hate all of the rock fans . from the gatekeepers to the lewronggenerationhttps    type people . it makes me ashamed to be a rock fan . i can hardly wear a nirvana shirt without someone saying " oh i bet you don ' t even know that ' s a band and think it ' s just a brand " . bitch , you can fuck right off .
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)
