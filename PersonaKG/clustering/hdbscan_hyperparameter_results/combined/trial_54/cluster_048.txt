1. youre probably just paranoid . you dont even notice the mistakes you make . going to the same position each round , doing something " obvious " . most of the time you dont even need to know where someone is cus its obvious . if you face a wallhacker you can still outaim him . however if the guy has an aimbot it doesnt matter if he sees you or not . he just holds down lmb and you die
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

2. so you keep telling me , i must have really made you angry with my opinion . didn ' t know it would shake you so badly . at the point you just parrot what i say while putting crying emojis in it i would really call it a conversation .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

3. i talk to people every once and a while they hate me at first then get used to me and friend me out of pity . i don ' t know why they do that they could just stop talking to me if they hate me but it ' s just what happens .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

4. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

5. ummm . wow ! it wasn ' t the nazis who built that wall . yikes ! i correct my previous statement , you should have just learned history ! that was not such a wall , that was to keep people in . much easier to do if the gov ' t kills anyone you know if you escape . kind of puts a damper on escapes and the ability to plan them with others .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

6. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

7. i just don ' t understans why they made it so rural . i mean we know that bucky knows secret of wakandacivil war post credit scene . why show them in a hut ?
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

8. a lady done this for me one time flying to london and i couldn ' t thank her enough . i hate flying but i know it ' s something that just has to be done to get places .
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

9. i didn ' t imply that , you inferred that very incorrectly i might add . all i said was they matter , and you twisted my statement around to make it something it ' s not . you really don ' t know how mental illness works , do you ? tell a suicidal person to just buck up and see what happens . most likely , it ' s not gonna do a damn thing for them .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

10. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

11. ah i see , i would be lying if i said i hadn ' t done similar things in the past aha . do you actually enjoy the music  dress sense you are " rocking " at the moment ? haha , or is the sole purpose of it to please this girl . because i know it sounds cliche , but you are better off just being yourself man
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

12. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

13. i know you guys are gonna tell not be with someone who i can ' t trust you ' re goddamn right .  but hear me out . maybe we ' re just doing something wrong ? mmmm nope . you shouldn ' t date someone you can ' t trust .  i just wanna fucking know who she ' s talking to lol . bit controlling but okay . ask her if its that big of a deal .
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

14. i get social anxiety too sometimes when i ' m in larges groups of people when i smoke . i don ' t know of a way to counter that , but alcohol makes me much more sociable , while when i get high i ' m just chill and spaced out . try smoking alone a few times to get used to the feeling of it , and try to smoke with people you know well i would suggest .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

15. ok , i didn ' t know what this word meant so i just googled it . thanks for burning that into my memory .
   (ID: de5db66359e6314e9bac24fd9a10ec1d49584c4f)

16. is it weird that i have no idea what spotify is ? i mean i know it ' s a music thing but that ' s it . i don ' t know what it actually does . is it a social networking thing or do you just buy stuff from it ?
   (ID: 5147e830e7cfa538d6990a8699ad6462b57cfb52)

17. well , thank you ! at least now i know . just one more question  the bag they gave you already , just not the right size for the helmet ?
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

18. tpms are horrible , especially in the cold . best bet is to look at the tires and if it doesn  t look flat , it  s not . it  s just a cash grab against people who don  t know how a normal tire looks
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

19. i mean , i get it . we grow up and suddenly we ' re responsible for our own survival , when we only exist because someone else wanted us to . why do i have to get a job and pay bills and all that shitty stuff , when my parents are the ones that put me here ? don ' t know that you can really win in a court of law , and maybe you should suck it up and just deal . but i get it .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

20. wow . you really know how to kill a vibe , my guy . oh well . i should have known just by the look on your face .  rip
