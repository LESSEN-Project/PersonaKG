1. depends how fresh . if it just happened , you say sorry and then might wanna give them space to process whatever it is you did .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

2. i nearly did this to a player , not out of spite but by mistake . two accounts would go around our area , take all of the gyms and golden razz spam anyone who tried to retake them . they ' d just monopolize the area twice a week . asked around , no one knew who they were , so based on the behavior i figured it was a multi  account spoofer with a bot set up to berry feed . nearly reported it , but then i found out from someone at a raid that it was actually just a couple from the next town over who drove around and played super aggressively . would have felt really bad if i ' d reported then although niantic doesn ' t do anything about those reports anyway .

3. this is enlightened . complaining is not the same as soliciting advice . so often a child ' s minor complaint about something gets a response telling them what they did wrong , just making the kid feel bad .
   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

4. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

5. saw dogs getting killed for food . it wasn ' t even an ethical kind of kill , they just beat the dogs until they stopped whining . the dogs did even fight back btw , it ' s also on youtube
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

6. i just had three days off ! i visited my grandparents , met with a friend for coffee , did some baking , cleaned the house and played an unreasonable amount of stardew valley
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

7. yeah but why tf did you decide to post this on here . i support the lgbtq community but jeez man , chill out and talk about that stuff someone else . it  s just a meme
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

8. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

9. so i just started watching the series to satisfy my endgame hunger . i recently ended with the episode " the well " and the end got me curious whether the two agents did it . so it got me to wiki of aos which is probably the worst thing to do . i discovered some things . specially about that agent .
   (ID: a5976f282a96c036f5e4d14957305323c9a5776d)

10. well here is where you went wrong . you jumped into water with sharks ! what else did you expect ? these arent dogs , cats , or any other animal human have domesticated . this shouldn ' t be news , just a reminder if you take a risk expect to get bit .
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

11. those " weird looks " are just how wizards look at each other , jackass , which you would have known if you were a real wizard ! the important science question here is how did a fake wizard ever end up with a real princess ?
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

   (ID: a4eb94a9fe8ebabb780c319cc7d3f552eb79625e)

14. lol what , did it take you the full digit hours to come up with that shit spray ? you couldn ' t be more wrong about everything you just slammed your ass on the keys to write out . what a waste of my time reading such garbage .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)
