   (ID: c418fa452eafbca022ce1c49b521d4574aa77cd1)

13. getting real tired of this dumb idea that comp and trim are now easy like you didn ' t have to do everything else on the req list . for comp the only difference is people who would ' ve paid a leech , don ' t have to , it hardly undoes everything else on the cape .
