Total from this dataset: 127

1. i failed to see an argument for why rancid is good . while people can like what they like , there is some objective measure to what is good and bad . simply put , rancid is just not special in any way . rubyrubyrubyrubysoho
   (ID: 5c9dd67e95ee5403b2bd9a6848c017674d46396b)

2. the first tool concert i went to i was digit they had primus there as the opener . that night i learned the crowd was kid of pretentious . an older dude in the merch line questioned me and this other younger guy our ages and went off on a rant about ' before you were born . true fan . lucky to be here blah ' like i gave a shit . i just wanted a shirt . other than that i didn ' t really have any issues , whatever you choose to do about it definitely go to the show . i would probably recommend company , just don ' t miss out on it .

3. yeah that ' s fair enough , although players like t . brady and sydney crosby actually do do that , it ' s just more difficult for then to build super teams around them . lebron has only been able to carry a shit tier roster to the finals twice in his career , and in this year ' s case a lot has to do with the weak competition in the east . also the commercials , stoppages , and fouls are actually the biggest issue with the nba . the o my reason it seems like the " main theme " is because it ' s them only thing people are responding to . they have no answer for the terrible stoppages , fouls , and commercial breaks .
   (ID: 0264eec5f9f9a43d83f3a82c46341e90961fa3b8)

4. no . it  s just idiots like you that ruin the game . go play rainbow digit and be toxic there
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

5. so the person with income can ' t just use up the other person and then abandon them with nothing whenever they feel like it .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

6. i actually ask this because i wonder about people ' s motives . are they just trying to be funny ? do they like being assholes ? both ? personally i don ' t like to insult people . to me roasting is more like an association game and a form of brain training .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

7. i don  t get the hate . i hang out on video gaming board . it  s just people wanting to have fun like me and you
   (ID: 726c36ce13fa631676ed5053f62b0f5f7b61eb5e)

8. mid digit ' s single female . probably white . you are thin , probably a professional who doesn ' t have a lot of time to cook . or you go out on lots of dates and eat dinner that way . you eat organic and non  gmo but can have diary , so your not vegetarian or vegan . you just like to watch what you eat . i have no idea region , so i ' m just gonna say texas bc the beer .
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

9. just one point of advice . i don ' t care if you take it or leave it . when you disagree with someone , keep the argument on  topic . if you are talking about latin american revolutions , just talk about that . resist the temptation to bring in things like mao , etc . you might feel justified , but it ' s not a productive way to interact , because  a the topic of latin american revolutions is complicated enough on its own , without bringing in the chinese . you ' re just opening a new can of worms , trust me . b the other person will take it as a personal attack , even if it wasn ' t . c it feels to the other person , anyway like you are deflecting . that is , it feels like you are trying to change the subject , and refocus the conversation on her shortcomings , rather than dealing with the topic at hand . she will see you as immature , like a school boy who gets caught cheating , and then screams , " but jimmy cheated last week , and got away with it ! " it does not matter if jimmy got away with it . we are talking about you cheating right now , and talking about jimmy is off  topic . again , this will only make you seem immature .

10. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

11. excuse me , but who gave you permission to just do the damn thing all over us like that ? you gorgeous man , you .
   (ID: 3a16ba639560d155caf77e9cfc21f6a1df031d4f)

12. i hate such mis direction . a movie should be like fight club with subtle clues all around place . maybe its just my preference .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

13. i just remember car accidents are like the highest cause of death at highschools , it makes sense though .

   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

16. i was born with something called microtia type digit . if you search it up you will understand , it is not gross it just looks like a bunch of extra skin and bone
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

17. literally that  s what happens to my dads sister , and the only thing she bought was fake kylie jenner make up , but like a fake digit dollar watch , that  s some serious shit , they might go easier on ya if you just turn yourself in
