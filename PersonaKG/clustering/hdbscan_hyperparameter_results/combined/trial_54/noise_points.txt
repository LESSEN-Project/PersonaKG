--- PER-CHAT (5289 points) ---

1. this sounds like a lack of training  impulse control issue and not the dog actually hating you . your friend should train her , it ' s not cute when an adult pitbull acts like that and is dangerous for the dog ! there ' s a guy in my area who brings his totally untrained   digit lb pitbull to dog parks . the dog regularly jumps on people and bites their hands  pulls on their clothes . the people involved have all been dog owners so they know to remain calm , but i don ' t see it going well if a dog  fearing stranger or child were the target .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

2. i only know what happens to me when people tell me what happens because i black out .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

3. thank you ! that ' s what i said too ! i was like , this is the lamest faux  strip tease i ' ve ever seen . it was freaking terrible ! he now loses all credibility he ever had as a judge and mentor on that reality show . dude . you suck live !
   (ID: aa8abed66c32a0519ab922c1a606563d97de28fc)

4. well i seem to be somewhat unique in that i can ' t honestly say i relate to any of them , at least certainty not on the level of a lot of other people on this sub . i am very lucky to have never personally experienced any of the problems portrayed in the game . that said i do definitely sympathize with them quite a lot . i ' d say i sympathize the most with sayori probably because my sister suffers from depression , followed by natsuki . then yuri , then monika . i love natsuki the most though .
   (ID: 0b52265db13bf8bc27ad36aad94e870706eb6689)

5. One of my favorite things is test.
   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

6. you took care of someone else ' s kid . that ' s nothing like actually having a kid of your own , so of course it seemed easier lol .
   (ID: ecc98de1e575d7e863a2124b364b8ed586778ba5)

7. " fuck off " thank you for your input . when you ' re on the clock you ' re expected to at least meet corporate and customer expectations . if you can do neither then any job that relates to working with people is not for you . when you ' re off the clock and on your time you can do whatever pleases you .
   (ID: a61db1f2f0a3d15376fd168a1637c028f25100e1)

8. well we now convienence , we have veggies galore to enjoy , just being able to buy a bag of ceaser salad , add premade ceaser dressing . that would take hours to do at home
   (ID: 85ac769b0cb349e567cb91e8109645bd1ac28b9f)

9. maybe i am just bad at using them but my experience has been they don ' t help a lot with deer while bow hunting . if you can ' t get close with out one they are not a silver bullet for fixing bad sneaking , add to that they get caught on everything until you get used to moving in them and they get warm . that being said they are uncomfortably good for hiding from people . we had a rather large fellow bring his double xl curvy lady out to the woods for some public private time . they started getting undressed about digit feet from where my buddy and i where sitting in on a hill . they freaked out when we got up to walk away because , neither of us wanted to watch what was about to go down .
   (ID: a76c6dcf1c50896c141e83f47bc82d2256c9265a)

10. i want to tell my shrink about it . but i ' m afraid i ' d attack his couch as well !

11. oh i do . i let people know right away that they are dumb for asking a question when we both know they already know the answer . why would you want to force a conversation with someone ? do you enjoy bothering people ?
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

12. we as humans like to apply black and white labels to everything . there is nothing wrong with emotions . there are things wrong with what people do with them or how we feed them
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

13. absolutely speak to your therapist . you trust them . they will help you . you need to get yourself out of that relationship for your safety , physical and psychological . this is not a one  off occurrence .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

14. it  s not offensive , never said it was . and again , i  m not against sending a message , it  s how that message is sent . my concern is that they will overdo the strong independent female personality , just for the sake of it , robbing the characters depth and transforming them into a trope . it would be as boring and lifeless as a generic male power fantasy .
   (ID: 127d601df381c9f971eae1e3fd42953571015813)

15. when people touch your stuff . it happens too often that people just pick up my backpack and throw it on my lab instead of asking to free the seat next to me . and for some reason its always women who do that , guys always ask
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

16. thanks ! thankfully i have no problem rolling the arabic " r " . it just sounds really funny when some westerners can ' t pronounce it properly haha
   (ID: 6b55ac21377298601038ad44ea0f65b18e7c5b51)

17. the only thing i ' m scared about is my parents taking me to the hospital for my thoughts but after reading this has made me think " isn ' t it better for someone to take you there for thoughts rather than an attempt .
   (ID: 168d1161144e63a83a23f04ae4e64bd4b25684c0)

18. fuck off . i can like what i like . so can everyone else . you ' re not special in any sense of the word .
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

19. right there with you . can ' t stand the holidays . what sucks is that my kids and wife do .
   (ID: f8d48136e1ccbc739d4b7fb8db1e8f668422b145)

20. as a very analytical person this is a real challenge for me . i need to learn those words as a mantra . thank you !
