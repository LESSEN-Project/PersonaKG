   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

5. i think it  s hit reg . as far as i know there aren  t any hacks that make you invincible but in the wake of the hit reg bug it  s entirely possibly it could have been developed since everyone would put the blame on hitreg
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

6. how cute , you think you know a thing about what people go through . try being bullied and shunned to an extent at digit different schools , 3rd grade until i went to college . oh , and you would all collectively call me a normie because i have an intimate relationship . don ' t assume you know a damn thing about any person who posts here because you simply dont .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

9. im waiting for kunimitsu and negan , and i know several pros and cons . pros are you know the most of the match up , move , what safe and what can be punish . cons are sometimes you do wrong input for example yoshi ender i always use with f3  digit but some times i mix that with miguel button input . also , having your brain expand the size of the entire roster , sometimes i found myself think of all the move i use when i fight those character , for example like if i fight yoshi , i would expect my opponent to only use what i also used but nope he use other tech so i find it difficult sometimes . sometime you you underestimate your opponent because you know most of the match up , and other than that , you can mix some move into other character for example yoshi didn ' t have savage but you think he has cause you play most of the roster . in short it can confuse you .

10. sometimes i think that no matter how hard our life is , no matter how much we suffer or put others in pain , the people who have passed on are laughing because they know it doesn ' t matter and nothing matters in life because there ' s something else that ' s better for everyone once we pass on . as far as i know , death only affects those that are living .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

11. fuck , i think i know him ! well actually i know his mother . intimately .
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

12. lol i didn  t really ask , but it is cute you think it  s worth flaunting over a teenager assuming you  re pathetically in your 30s as your name indicates . but i  m really not even a bad student at all which makes this hilarious . keep going , you can find more i know you can
   (ID: 2401680976bbdfe87278659ff11173d22161b22d)

13. yeah maybe with mammals and stuff but i don  t think snakes really understand the concept of help . from what i know they  re left on their own from the time they hatch and don  t receive any kind of assistance from mom . it  s possible but i doubt it
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

14. i think being loving first and getting to know them can permit the conversation about jesus to go more smoothly . they may even come to see god through through tour loving relating as the candle shown for all to see . if we don  t tell our co workers at our jobs about hell digit  digit why should we do it to homosexuals ?
   (ID: 2a3f07a52e2fc5e79fd2ed52f4f601fa39ebe2e4)

15. i dont know about pudding because even if she becomes good she doesnt have any purpose in strawhat crew but saying that katakuri will be joining im thinking u are trolling otherwise he is the strongest after big mom and lets say her security guard and if u say about her realitonship with the kids i think is the same will all of them they fear her and they are tools for her acomplishments , so katakuri doesnt seem mistreated or anything .
   (ID: 28b40f8090abf393e7d7a7cf1772fb2c16d434a1)

16. sigulairity is based up on the undefined becoming exponential and as the comment above mentioned using ai and human . here i considered dream as a state , where we start with undefined and end with something we imagine by using consciousness and our choices etc . but as their is no end for the imagination which is exponential . as we still don ' t know the beginning of the dreams which is undefined , made me think that start of a dream can be considered as a singularity . correct me , if i ' m wrong !
   (ID: 498ec9e13eaa203d64a9b79260e2285867993564)

17. i do get laid , and i dont think you even know how to please one . however i am an enviro9enthusiast and care about all animals and ecosystems , which you so clearly dont give a damn about . bust since you are all high and mighty . can you tell me where the clit is ?
   (ID: ee2906681b3174a80cefe2bcfb40bd3a110c1b29)

18. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

19. honestly that sounds pretty expensive to me . i dont know the prices of the parts off hand , but i really dont think it should be 2g to do such little work
   (ID: 46a39b1131e50f9cc061bbaf88e15686e5c9359d)

20. in what way ? wanting to know what specific thing you think makes it shitty .
