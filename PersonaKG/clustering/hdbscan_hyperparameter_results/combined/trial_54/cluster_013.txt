2. i absolutely hated vegans . would constantly mock them , make fun of a girl at school for it although i didn ' t realise how bad i was being until i realised all my mockery or " questions " she had genuine answers to . now i still think some vegans are insane , but you get that with literally every group out there including non vegans . it was the best change i ever made . i love the food , the community everything about it .

3. animal abuse , because if you think its ok to do it you will get murdered within digit week . note  i love animals
   (ID: 4beccb79954eaf4ba6b69b6ac31b148b48f4f579)

4. i think what  s happening is now everyone knows about the show so the typical applicant might br madly in desire of their digit minutes rather than madly in love . collateral damage is what worries me . there are people who would do whatever necessary to get on tv etc , when the shows  s over , their spouse and new families might be over too .

5. ok love . how about the cathedral in naples which holds a vial of blood from an early christian martyr , st . januarius . reportedly , the blood is dry most of the year , but mysteriously liquefies three times throughout the year , on days commemorating his life and impact . i think that one would be testable ?
