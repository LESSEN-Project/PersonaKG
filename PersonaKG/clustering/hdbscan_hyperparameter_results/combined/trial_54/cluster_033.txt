1. thanks a million ! just to pick your brain a little more , my flatmate has pokemon y , he told me there is a way to carry over stats when breeding . is this right . i may have misunderstood what he was saying though . edit  i am aware of nature and characteristics . but we were talking about defence stats and things .

2. oh , i agree they should probably return the items , but i ' m pointing out just how vulnerable these things can be in this world . it ' s a real concern .

3. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .

4. it is better to just get a new controller . you could find some videos on youtube to fix those certain things if you  re handy and can wait for the pieces to come in the mail .

5. myself from the past . just to tell my self of the things that i shouldn ' t do
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

6. big baseball fan here  the scene in " digit " where the opposing manager is just giving it to jackie robinson , calling him all manner of horrible things .
   (ID: 2bb956084cb9bf79f58345d6cf6beca98e76bbb4)

7. yeah i agree with you . life is about balance . besides smoking and heavy drugs i do all those things . it ' s just objectively a bad idea .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

8. never cared to look into myself , people believe crazy things so i just figured there may have been some following behind it
   (ID: 89a759866debf6704efa0f603c1b9c4476abd731)

9. so being playful is just a metaphor for doing things that is in your nature and not being afraid to go against social norms ? '
   (ID: 3e7b07ddd384cb288bc529e6aeb73f840aa5a294)

10. no one is getting what i ' m saying tbh lol . people are just saying things without even reading descriptions on the game .
   (ID: 7c96bac704435347f721cc9a3056b8d7be16cc06)

11. i highly recommend getting the nathan drake collection for ps4 that has the first digit games on it . you can decide for yourself which is your favorite but they all have a lot of great moments and it ' s worth playing from the start just to see how nate  elena met .
   (ID: a18adc4ad3b28b34dfa3063a1c77566b8681a79d)

12. yeah , why i was wondering if anyone knew anything else i can rely on . i am scared to heck , we just moved . things haven ' t been the easiest .
   (ID: d42f47f147cdc8e97117f0e4963e2c1309d1dcd8)

13. i try to remember that i am just one member of a species on a tiny planet on the edge of a typical galaxy in a vast universe . puts things in perspective for me
