7. ehh no that  s not quite what i  m getting at , i know what you  re talking about . like someone looking off in the distance or distracted while talking , that  s not what i  m referring to . i  ve seen several people who talk with their eyes closed , like speak full sentences with their eyes closed . or they look up while their face is facing you . it sounds bizarre but if you know what i mean then i bet you agree it  s annoying . idk why people do it . some strange social phobia maybe

11. it ' s been implied that the infertility problems are due to pollution and bad farming practices . during the visit by the mexican delegates i remember either fred or serena talking about the improved pollution problem . also in flashbacks to the red center we see aunt lydia talking about pollution lowering the birthrate and she also pins some blame on women who can give birth but refuse by taking birth control or aborting . edit to add  i ' ve read the book too and know it was much more nuanced than that . my comment is based off what information they ' ve given us in the show so far .
