2. great show , excited to see where this goes in a month when we get by all the obvious games starcraft , cs , ext . do have one suggestion that might already be true but has to do with twitch . could you produce this show inside the " game " category and not the " gaming talk shows " category . since this talk show is digit  just about a the single game and not a of variety game talk show . if you do it inside the " game " i would guess you would get more people checking out the live stream . twitch might have rules against this but its my idea .

3. just curious , is there some sort of " vesting " in the canadian system , to prevent folks from moving to canada and getting benefits from others paying into the system ? for instance do you have to live there for a period before receiving benefits ? it may be something you need to consider .

4. dude , if you are serios , don ' t do it , there are plenty of reasons to live , even if you have difficulties . if not , then i will just leave an f

5. there are many alternatives to driving , and to say you can ' t afford not to drive is ridiculous unless you live outside of the city or the commute is immensely far .   x200b  biking is a great alternative , you will have to leave home a bit earlier but you can avoid the traffic so in some casesdepending on where you live it can save you quite a bit of time . obviously you need to take conditions into account but there are many snow rated bikes and clothing that people take advantage of .   x200b  public transportation is in every city and whether it be a bus or train there is a way to get from one end of the city to the next . i know it ' s easier said than done but if you can wake up a bit earlier it can save you the headache of totaling your vehicle .   x200b  again , depending on where you live there are many transportation apps like uber that are fairly reasonable and even if you just need them to get you over a certain bridge or past a certain point and you can walk the rest of the way is great .   x200b

6. similar , my elder got diagnoses asd when digit . digit yrs old . i was digit months pregnant with smallest . smallest is digit and just been diagnosed adhd elder is non verbal but can communicate using a tablet and pecs picture exchange communication system software . while his autism is profound and he is unlikey to live fully independently he ' s still a bundle of joy and the most placid kid ever . smallest opposite i often worry how smallest is affected by the adjustments we have to make for his brother .

7. i understand full well what the symbolism behind all that stuff is intended to mean , i just strongly disagree with it . it ' s not about false patriotism ? dude , what world do you live in ? i don ' t care what your reasoning is , having kids recite the pledge to a flag every morning is brainwashing . they ' re basically being forced into patriotism without being given a chance to decide tor themselves as to whether or not they even agree with it .

8. digit  . hardly any difference , then just live off the interest and fuck off the rest of my life

9. maybe his friends are just used to mockicking him and they do it rather jokingly . that ' s kind of insult  based friendship  relationship , commonly occur in real life . hiccup allows that because he is fine with it . if it comes to the villain , why wouldn ' t he try to insult him ? his aim was tomake hiccup lose his nerves , start acting impulsively and be easier to defeat . of course the more accurate and touchy the insult is , the better are the results but maybe grimmel couldn ' t come out with anything better as he never met hiccup in his live so he just reffered to his appearance . after all he ' s tights aren ' t very thicc .

10. do you draw your tags or buy them over the counter ? we have tag draws and only you can use your tag . but i have heard of sharing tags in states where you can buy a handful of tags or a punch card . the differences in hunting laws state by state are pretty neat . i was just talking to a guy the other day i forget where he lives but it is illegal to hunt with radios there , and where i live i can ' t imagine going into the woods without one .

11. nta judging by the fact you could pay off all her debt , plus buy her a new car it was obviously a decently large sum , that i agree with you i would not just randomly hand out to a girlfriend of digit months that you do not live with or are engaged to . maybe you could of helped her a little if you really wanted to , but you have no obligation to give her that money , or justify how you spend your hard earned money .

12. my mom once told me she didn ' t understand why god allowed me to live . little backstory . i was born nearly digit months premature . i technically died twice . the doctors told my parents not to get attached cause i wasn ' t going to make it . fast forward to the incident . my mom accused me of stealing her digital camera . she had just returned from a stay in maryland and couldn ' t find it . for hours she berated me and topped it off with the " god shouldn ' t have let you live " comment . the next day she found the camera in a box she had yet to unpack . she never told me she found it or apologized for her comment . she just pretended the entire situation never occurred . my dad apologized on her behalf .

13. how can you seriously say that ? it was pretty much men who fought on the frontlines in both world wars , and almost every war after , you are being completely disrespectful towards the people who risked and gave their lives just so you could live comfortably and be able to write this comment . get a life and show some respect for the people who , i dare say , saved the world . and about the raping and murder , can you give me a study or report about it ?
