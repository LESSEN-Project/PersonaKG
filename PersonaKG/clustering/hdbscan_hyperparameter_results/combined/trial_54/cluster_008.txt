1. i was raised hindu and was always interested in religion so i have a lot to speak of ! another one is that hindus in india will often put a lime and chilli peppers on a string  pin outside of a home or business . this is because lakshmi goddess of wealth and prosperity has an older sister alakshmi goddess of the opposite of those . lakshmi likes to eat sweets  milk  fruits , so if you keep them inside she ' ll come in and you ' ll have good luck . alakshmi likes to eat sour and spicy food , so keeping the lime and chili out there will keep her satisfied outside without coming into your life .   x200b  in a related story , when a sage was asked who is more beautiful between lakshmi and alakshmi , he said that lakshmi is more beautiful when walking towards you because you want good luck to come into your life and alakshmi is more beautiful when walking away from you because you want bad luck to leave your life .

4. since what a fursona is has been explained to death here i ' ll just add to it first , you do not need a fursona to be a furry . in general " being furry " is a very loose term . the only thing in common between all of us is that we like anthropomorphic art . however if you do want to interact with the community outside of reddit having at least an oc as an avatar will help tremendously . second , hya reddit is the best place imo . stay here if you want amazing furry art regularly oand go to furry  irl some nsfw , not a lot for memes and shitposting .

5. do you want cell service on it ? i bought a  digit tracphone at walmart for my toddler to watch netflix on during a trip . it has all the things you mentioned . it ' s locked to their network so you ' ll never be able to take it essential l elsewhere , but it seemed to handle what i required of it .

9. look at the sun first . then look at the data of the other planets in the solar system . you may find that there might be something similar going on ? you may also want to look into nasa ' s current observations on sunspots and solar activity and the average temperatures since this sun cycle ended . either your suv is reaching and has changed the heat of pluto  or . well , maybe i ' ll let you be the observational scientist . meanwhile , all the climate projections have been wrong since mr . gore ' s power point presentation . why ? it deals mostly with carbon dioxide , not the sun   and not a single climate projection that i have reviewed has ever taken in account of the heat sync ability of the earth ' s oceans .
