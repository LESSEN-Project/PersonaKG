1. after reading some of the comments ive come to realise people find some of the magic eyes difficult . i assumed you could either see them or you couldn ' t . although this image is quite shallow in depth it resolves itself just as easily as any other . not entirely sure what point i ' m trying to make only that it was an eye opener so to speak

2. just talk to everyone you can . sure you may have some weird convos that are a lil uncomfortable but then its done and you move on with life . the more comfortable you are talking to people the easier life will be

3. yeah i get that . don ' t feel lost in your situation though . i can assure you that there are a few people , myself included , that can relate to what you ' re going through just now . it ' s extremely tiring but make sure you have an " escape " for yourself . it certainly made my situation better when i had something i could get lost in and alleviate the stress on myself .

4. she ' s only snored while i was conscious at least every few months before , last few weeks have been rough . i just sleep on the couch if it becomes a big issue . that sounds rough i guess , but i actually sleep at least as well if not better on the couch than in bed . i made sure to talk to her about it and make sure she knew there were no hard feelings and it was just a practical matter . i never start out there , and make a point to spend time talking to her and the bump before she goes to sleep every night , we just agreed i can bail if i need to .

5. every break has to be done where both parties can see each others faces , next time youre on skype or something where you see his face , show him he ment something to you and just rip the bandaid . never ever text im breaking up with you . that will destroy a person . also make sure hes fully aware of whats going on , and explain why youre breaking up with him

8. for the international muppets it ' s 4am in italy . for an article and tweet from different sources to be taken down or edited right now is just weird . i mean i can see night editor having access to the article but the twitter as well ? do journos share their twitter access ? i wouldn ' t . i don ' t have twitter so not digit  sure how it works
