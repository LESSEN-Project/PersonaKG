   (ID: 337350fc54133b327ce0d6d9f385f82a2a6738cf)

16. that ' s pretty neutral , it ' s always best to be positive and not talk about what you didn ' t like but what you did like . for instance , your old boss might have been a real hard ass , riding you all day . instead of saying that you could say your old boss was really involved in my day to day tasks and was really focused on the job getting done . i learned a lot from him . this is not a lie and it spins the situation in a positive light .
