1. do you draw your tags or buy them over the counter ? we have tag draws and only you can use your tag . but i have heard of sharing tags in states where you can buy a handful of tags or a punch card . the differences in hunting laws state by state are pretty neat . i was just talking to a guy the other day i forget where he lives but it is illegal to hunt with radios there , and where i live i can ' t imagine going into the woods without one .

5. nta judging by the fact you could pay off all her debt , plus buy her a new car it was obviously a decently large sum , that i agree with you i would not just randomly hand out to a girlfriend of digit months that you do not live with or are engaged to . maybe you could of helped her a little if you really wanted to , but you have no obligation to give her that money , or justify how you spend your hard earned money .

6. nah . old people are notorious for speaking their minds , as are iranians in my experience , and there ' s even a chance the neighbour was just venting frustrations on you about their own children they don ' t see . you work a lot and still made time to go see your parents who live a few hours away , your not a bad son by any means well , no means relevant to the story anyways . and had clearly reached a breaking point for strangers bullshit . the neighbour obviously shouldn ' t have said anything that confrontational but realistically probably had no idea that western culture frown upon chastising strangers .

7. how can you seriously say that ? it was pretty much men who fought on the frontlines in both world wars , and almost every war after , you are being completely disrespectful towards the people who risked and gave their lives just so you could live comfortably and be able to write this comment . get a life and show some respect for the people who , i dare say , saved the world . and about the raping and murder , can you give me a study or report about it ?

8. if it ' s the driveway to their property , and you don ' t live in a place where parking on driveways is illegal because of some obstruction nonsense , they can just show you the deed or even a few bills . there ' s no way they own a private house but not the driveway attached to it lol . just make sure to get your parking spot lease in writing also .

9. great show , excited to see where this goes in a month when we get by all the obvious games starcraft , cs , ext . do have one suggestion that might already be true but has to do with twitch . could you produce this show inside the " game " category and not the " gaming talk shows " category . since this talk show is digit  just about a the single game and not a of variety game talk show . if you do it inside the " game " i would guess you would get more people checking out the live stream . twitch might have rules against this but its my idea .

10. that ' s enough money to live off . just make a good meal plan .
