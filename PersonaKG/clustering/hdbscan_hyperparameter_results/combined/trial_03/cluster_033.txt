1. i ' m sorry you hate dogs ? people coming together to save a life , or give more time , is somehow a bad thing because its not human life ? this makes zero sense to me . i know people who have spent just as much if not more on their pets . you do what you can for those you love .

2. first  didn ' t have my first boyfriend  relationship til i was digit . i was like digit . digit  sure i was terminally single for life , i couldn ' t get a date even when i lost 100lbs thinking weight was my issue . second  if you like the guy  is the conversation a . awkward on you part because you ' re shy or b . awkward on your part because neither of you actually have anything in common to talk about ? i like to play a game when first talking to new guys  twenty questions . not the fav coloufav food type of shit , but the stuff i really wanna know  ex . if you could have a concert w  any digit performers dead or alive , broken up or together , who would you pick ? if you were having a dinner party with any digit people dead or alive , famous or not , real or a character in a movie or book  who would you pick and why ? what would you serve ? pick obscure questions . get a feel . get lost in a topic when you hit something you both have in common and steer the convo into that . he picked alexisonfire ? well fuck you love aof and a show is coming up , maybe you guys should put that on for the future . he served a craft beer ! well shit maybe you just happen to love craft beer . discuss . he served duck ? you duck hunt . or you hate duck . or you know the best place for duck you both should try . discuss . he had a hockey player come to dinner ? a writer you love ? share your passions and the convo should flow . if it gets dull  time for one of you to take the next turn on asking

3. thank you , i just find it to be quite logical honestly . checking yourself in the best way you know will work to see if it ' s worth the wait , if your results were different emotionally you would know not to waste your and your so ' s time , which is better than starting the official relationship just for you to find out you don ' t really love her , now that ' s fucked up . goodluck with whatever you decide !

4. crap , i like playing support characters because i am not too great at gw2 when it comes to playing against people as it is my first mmo and i don ' t even know if my builds are any good . the server i play on is henge of denravi , when i play , there is hardly ever anybody on because of the time difference . over the past month i have not been playing gw2 as much because i have hit a wall . i do love jumping into a zerg as a sup gaurd or just tailing a small group i don ' t enjoy pve much since i have run all the dungeon paths multiple times , farmed the crap out of world bosses and getting my ass handed to me in pvp over and over isn ' t appealing . the only thing that has got me coming back is my guildies and doing living world because my so likes living world stuff so we do that together . i have the nbn where i am so latency is not an issue for me tbh , but i spent most of my time playing on an adsl1 connection with an average digit . 5mb speed , latency was a killer . but now the only issue i have with being able to play the game is the constant drops in connection , it ' s not my pc or internet connection either , if my so is playing at the same time she usually drops a few seconds after me . have run a tracert on the hod ip address , it always seems to time out around the 40th  43rd hop so there is nothing i can do about it . because of the drops i can hardly play let alone compete lol .

5. and there ' s no reason for them to not understand it , they just mentally disconnect . ask if they know what a penpal is , they say yes . ask them if it ' s possible to fall in love with a penpal , they say yes . ask them to imagine having a penpal over the internet , they can handle that too . but ask them to imagine falling in love with an internet penpal , and suddenly they don ' t know left from right .

6. don ' t fuck him unless you trust him . cause once they cum you ' re trash . and they usually don ' t even text back . so if you ' re looking for more than a fuck , get to know the dude . also ? cum tastes like shit . i don ' t care what anyone says . it tastes like medicine or some salty thick mucus shit . but for whatever reason they love it when you swallow . go figure
