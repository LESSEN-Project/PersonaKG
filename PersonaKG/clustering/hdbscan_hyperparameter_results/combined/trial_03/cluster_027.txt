2. i  m talking about in a survival situation dumbass , also , do you not know that most of the police officers , firefighters , military personnel , construction workers , are men . the people that keep our countries safe from other countries are mostly men , they risk their lives so that we could live in a good , relatively safe country , first worlders have the privilege to live safely , a lot of us don  t even know what danger really is . do you want to live in constant fear in a war zone ? no . no one does , but that  s the life that people unfortunately live . no matter what anyone does , there will still be crime , there will still be bad people , and there will still be poverty .

3. it ' s not rude at all ! i do enjoy talking to folks with different thoughts and opinions on the world , as long as its a respectable conversation . i ' ve always believed that god lets us have our free will . i mean , what a life we would have if we where micro  controlled by a guy we didn ' t really know . i also think that bad things happen , because we don ' t live in a perfect world , and while i don ' t know what a perfect world would be really , i could say that it would be no harm to anyone . the world we live in is thanks to the fall , and is a consequence of that decision  thanks , eve !  unfortunately . humans , in my opinion , also need to have something to look up to , something greater than themselves , whether that be science , a public figure , a deity , or even an object .
