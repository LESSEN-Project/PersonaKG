1. what actually happens if they think the way they did ? i mean yeah in some cases like at work , you should care what people think . but most of the time it just causes unnecessary anxiety with no real effect
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

2. i don ' t think it matters if he lied or not . i think the only question we need to ask here is " did he use public money to pay her in any way ? " . if not , then i don ' t see the problem here .
   (ID: f7356e924b370675e942b29b9c2184dc895ea5b7)

3. i ' m in the same boat as you , friend . i ' m working on getting a degree in a conservative field but i really wanted to stretch my ears . so i did . mine are down to a 2g but they will still shrink back to piercing size . i ' d say the lowest you could go without irreversability is 0g but each ear is different .  i don ' t think irreversability is a word

4. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .

5. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

6. in the long run , constant complaining may cost you more than you think . heyooooo . see what i did there ?
   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

7. yeah , he had a digit revolver i think , and a shotgun . police also found bombs in the area . people said this kid got bullied quite often and even by the coaches so he did it out of anger . the shooter also said he didn  t shoot anyone he liked .
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

8. they shook your hand and smiled at you because their religion instructs them to do so . if you gave a neighborhood party and a guy from down the street came and did something disruptive , i think you would consider it disrespectful in the same way people here think you were being disrespectful . i ' m finding it hard to believe you are actually this dense .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

9. well  known fact that devs pay attention to this sub  where did you learn that well known fact ? we get bugs posted here and fixed within hours when they weren ' t submitted to the official forums . also big hint valve employees commenting on reddit posts about the state of upcoming changes  bug fixes  explanations about seemingly random changes .  how would it be more convenient for the patch team to sift through endless shitposts to find bug reports instead of reading them in a dedicated forum . logic ? because they obviously don ' t " sift through " reddit posts looking for bugs . they check reddit , and if they see a bug post then they check it , or don ' t see a bug post then leave reddit . it is more convenient because reddit has a much higher userbase and so they get a higher sample of issues from looking at comments and can help figure out what causes the issue . all this took less than digit seconds for me to think of so . logic ?

10. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

11. for me it was oregairu , when i first watched i was at a point in my life where i acted very similar to the main character , and i hated that . the main characters actions never did anything but make me dislike the character , when i finally realized how similar i was to the mc i decided i wanted to be more positive and get better at making friends . while now i don ' t have a lot friends , i do have more than i used to and am a generally happy person . i think that if i never watched that show i would be much less happy with who i am now . tl  dr  oregairu made me realize the reason i wasn ' t happy is that i hated the kind of person i was .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

12. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

13. i think , and this is only a theory of mine , that op wouldn ' t have had a burnt down bedroom if he did that . i ' m not digit  sure on this , so don ' t take my word for it .
   (ID: 57e23377d2e20446272558e1ff75f7e0cf1b0049)

14. i sampled 1st chapter and part of the second . there are hints of effective altruism , but not much . also , this taylor is stupidly straightforward . one would think that utmost priority for a parahuman whose power stops working when she is seen would be ways to prevent being seen . the obvious idea is making a lot of smoke bombs , making suit out of them , igniting them all . if someone sees you , you turn into smoke  spewing teenager . as soon as smoke obscures you , you gain your powers back . once smoke dissipates , you turn into smoke machine again . that ' s the idea i got by thinking about cheats for a minute . taylor who lives this , whose life and death depends on it , would think of a hundred more cheats . she did not . i am disappointed . also , i feel compelled to ask the questions  spoilers about ending of worm  s " can taylor win ? if yes  why did simurgh choose this timeline ? why didn ' t contessa involve taylor in her path to victory right away "
