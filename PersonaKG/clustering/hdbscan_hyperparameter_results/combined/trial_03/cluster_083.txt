1. yes i can but you will probably make fun of me if i say it . i use my senses . it gets me through a lot of things in life and not just listening to the ' smart ' people that try to get me to believe something that they want me to believe in . when i look around the world i can see that it is flat . i have never ever seen anything with my own eyes that makes me think the earth is round . that ' s why i believe that the earth is flat .

2. i don ' t like anyone bagging my groceries for me , just the way i am . so when i see someone coming to bag it for me at the self check out , i turn them away . many times it is someone who is mentally challenged , probably often times i didn ' t even notice . either way , i don ' t want to be rude . i don ' t want them to think because of their disability i don ' t want them handling my food . so i say , " oh , no thank you . it ' s going to two different places " so they figure i need to pack it a certain way .

3. i think it is folly to claim religion or faith are at issue here . you think that without religion this person would not have done this ? the issue is humans are animals and they do some nasty shit . i watched someone set digit people on fire the other day , watched the police shoot a guy in the back and watch him bleed out , watched kids killing insects with glee while their parents watch on , seen soldiers throw puppies off cliff along with many other acts with degrees of nastyness . i don ' t think in most cases these were performed acting as gods right arm or with any religious intent . people do shit because they want to and would probably find an excuse or reasoning to justify their actions . that guy kills because of god , others kill because they play too many video games , others kill because it makes them horny . we are all missing the point . humans are nasty , disgusting pieces of shit and are all capable of horiffic things . its just some people do it where the rest of us don ' t religion or not

4. divorce sucks . especially for the kid . typically gets worse as time goes on too . if there is any chance of working it out i ' d strongly recommend it . you are both going to need counseling and lots of it . however , if you ' re done or she ' s done  then you are done . if that ' s the case too i ' d still recommend counseling as well just for you to stay grounded . wild emotions do not help make good wise decisions . you ' re best grounded to accept not just the divorce but to decide what you want from it too . don ' t just agree on the decree at all  think before you act on how it will effect you today  but digit , digit or even digit years from now . even though your divorced you will have to dela with your ex since the kids there . just some insight from a divorced dad of digit .

5. it worked for me after smoking for around digit years . i haven ' t had one since fall , and i don ' t want one either . some advice . be prepared for some very vivid dreams , but they seem to subside after a while . make sure you drink plenty of water with the pill and eat something with it if you can . it can give you horrible stomach cramps if you don ' t . keep taking it even after you quit , for at least a couple of months , although you can typically taper off to one pill a day after the initial digit months . if you still feel a slight craving after the initial digit months , ask your doctor for another prescription . it gets so much easier after a couple of months . i just had a digit hour drive with an open pack of cigs sitting next to me , and i didn ' t even think about lighting up . good luck ! it ' s sooooo much better after you quit .

6. thanks man , really means a lot . i just want to make sure that you don ' t think there ' s something wrong with me . is it really normal that i don ' t feel any sexual urges even digit weeks after that experience ?
