1. i think you really don ' t get it . we don ' t want a significant other , we do not want to find " someone to spend our lives with " your post and your opinion shows how little you actually know .

3. you didn ' t mention your age . if you ' re coping well with your problem i wouldn ' t bring it up right now . however if you ' re struggling you may want to bring it up to your more understanding parent . your sister may feel that you are trying to steal her spotlight , is that something you think she may feel ? you would know her tendencies better .

4. i know a girl who politely sat through a date where the guy wouldn ' t stop talking about all the ways africa could be " fixed . he ' d never been there , but he was taking a really interesting sociology course and figured she ' d want to hear the entire thing . when he finally stopped for long enough that she could get a word in , she had this inner argument running  should i tell him i lived in nigeria for four years and that he ' s full of shit thus inviting further " conversation " , or should i tell him that ' s fascinating and ride it out to the end ? she rode it out to the end . there was no second date . i think you should tell the story of this date . it sounds entertaining for us .

5. that ' s fair , one year is a pretty common tipping point in a relationship in my experience anyway . if you feel you have truely put in the effort to address this and seen no improvement , than i think you know what to do . let him know you ' re unhappy and that you want to be with him , but his lack of attention is hurting you . if he still does not put forth the effort than it ' s time to move on .
