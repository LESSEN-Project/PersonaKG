1. she acted like you took up sooo much of her time whining about your poor baby . no . this woman is a cold lizard . she gave you the minimum and you are victim blaming yourself ! sorry . she sounds peeved that you are so sunk in your grief that you  ve forgotten the planets revolve around her ! well screw her . you are grieving your baby . what was her name ? where is he buried ? and what did she look like ? these are all such basic questions , for god  s sake that she could have asked ! because they mean something , and like any parent , you want to share your memories of your beloved infant . and you deserve to .

7. sorry on mobile so i booted up the game today and accidentally clicked kyf instead of killer  the game lagged out for maybe a straight minute and then loaded killer without me backing out of kyf and selecting killer killer loaded weird , i had all the perks at rank three but all four perk slots , both addon slots and the offering slot were locked and all the cosmetics except mike ' s bloody mask eventually it smartened up but never did give me my mask back or take away the overalls . i ' ve even played a few matches and still nothing
