3. people are raised in a certain way and if everyone around you thinks that way throughout your time living there it  s really hard to be critical of that way of thinking because you  d be going against everything everyone you know believes , in short , peer pressure on a larger scale

4. also , most people in the states are apolitical  depoliticized and best praxis would probably be to date them and radicalize them . we all have long and winding political developments and it ' s good to meet people where they ' re at and engage with them . this could also be applied to liberals  conservatives , but probably not with reactionaries . although you never know ! i wonder if any communists have converted a reactionary

6. enjoy the life i ' m living even though it ' s far from being perfect . the reason i ' m saying that is that a reddit has quite a reputation of of people not happy and quite depressed when you ask people about reddit . i know it ' s not the case and i don ' t generalize but that ' s the general thinking about reddit .

7. yeah , at my lgs , i don ' t have a regular time i can make it in , so i have about digit people where i grab whoever is avail to make a pod . i have about digit decks , pretty much at digit differing power levels including digit cedh deck , so i always know i can match what their bringing to the table . i know the people who have lower powered decks , so i offer mine to use if their deck isn ' t going to keep up . it helps a lot in making balanced pods . so , all i ' m really saying , is you can build and recommend someone borrow your interesting decks for everyone ' s benefit .

8. i really don ' t know why people look so much into stories and anime . do you really care ?

9. well look it at another perspective . you have learned from this experience . it sucks of course . but it will make you better in the en  don ' t let this be something that controls your next couple of days . let it go as hard as it seems and do some stuff with your friends . or talk to other people . in the end you will come out stronger . here is a quote i picked up "  if we see any mermaids i  m gonna ask them where their merginas are " i know this isn ' t helpfull at all but it makes me laugh everytime . have a good one !

10. why would you assume the fbi isn ' t corrupt ? they are a violent criminal organization . i don ' t know why so many people view them as a good thing . last time i checked the good guys don ' t radicalized and arm domestic terrorists .
