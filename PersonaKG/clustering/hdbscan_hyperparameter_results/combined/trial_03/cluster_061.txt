1. god , i hate all of the rock fans . from the gatekeepers to the lewronggenerationhttps    type people . it makes me ashamed to be a rock fan . i can hardly wear a nirvana shirt without someone saying " oh i bet you don ' t even know that ' s a band and think it ' s just a brand " . bitch , you can fuck right off .

2. thanks , good to know i ' m not alone . i think the problem comes from how people take the word " noob " to mean . most people here think not being a noob is just able being able to win or get high ranks , so if you win or have a high rank then you ' re not a noob . for me not being a noob means being able to aim well , win fights and just having good general fps skills , as well as all the br skills survival , camping , etc . lots of people who win are terrible at fps stuff and they don ' t even realise it . i see it often when spectate .

3. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .

4. well . im just gonna be honest , becuase i dont lie . i actually think this is the stupidest arguement ive ever had . your a man who has wayyy ! to much time on your hands sir , you think that my spelling mistake is soooo important to the boiling point where you actually have to not only once but multiple times correct me . hahahahaha copy . you know what , i have an idea since your soo good at spelling . you should be a teacher yes yes . well maybe i dont think even english teachers care an english teacher so you dont have to correct people on reddit . you have two paths in life , my friend . the road where you keep going on this path , and gain lots of enemies . or if you seem to care and have been reading this far , you can look at yourself and maybe say ' there are lots of things i can be doing right now . have you seen your fam in a while , your mother must be so proud .

5. nope , never wondered . my dad installed a pair which i think he acquired when working for ge , designing train engines . i don ' t kinow whether he put them in earlier cars but i know he put them in his digit new yorker , soon as he got it . i was digit at the time so i don ' t know too many details . until he got around to getting a compressor and building an engine mount for it , he just had a good size air tank under the hood . oh , the horns were also mounted in the engine bay  those old chryslers were huge . it was fun to stop for gas on vacation trips and dad would ask for air . after giving the " what is this screwball doing " look as dad lifted the hood , the attendant invariably said " holy shit " then , of course , had to hear them .

6. you know you don  t have to follow a guide right ? one thing about majority of the players playing this game is that they don  t bother to adapt , they just mindlessly play and when something kills them , they think it  s bullshit or the build is trash .
