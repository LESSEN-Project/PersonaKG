2. delete the number , or block the number . make it extremely difficult to get in contact with him in anyway . know what he did to you and know how you felt when you found out . do you really wanna feel that way again ? you deserve to be happy and putting yourself in that situation is going to dig yourself into a deep hole . dont give him the satisfaction of cheating on a girl and then having her run back to him . it will make him a worse person and it will only hurt you in the end .

3. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself

4. shit . that ' s a terrible thing to happen to you so young . if it helps , you ' re getting internet bro hugs from me . you should know that you ' re an absolute hero for talking her out of it . even if she ended up doing it later , you still gave it your all to save her . most people go through their lives without ever saving someone else ' s . most adults wouldn ' t know how to do what you did . you are a legend .
