1. you ' re gonna get camped one every dozen , dozen and a half or so games during the start of the season , it ' s just people hungry for their old rank . it is a trade off because if he literally facecamps you and you do the right thing draw it out as long as possible then the rest of the team will basically secure a victory in the meantime , but that ' s not a huge relief for the guy getting facecamped . just incentive to learn how to evade better ! as for the rank reset , it happens every month so this isn ' t exactly the moon and sun aligning to screw you personally over . there ' s just a couple days of weird ranking while stuff gets figured out , not a big deal . it ' s gonna happen again in october and november and december and so on so it ' s not really worth complaining about

2. is the mail pre sorted for you or do you have to sort it ? our complex has digit mailboxes all in a row and our mail man just throws it all in and we have to sort it ourselves . almost daily i get other people  s mail . is this common ?

3. digit he didn  t make another post about all religions digit he can have whatever views he wants to have , just as i can call out a potential inconsistency in the view . why the fuck do you even care anyway ? do you disagree with my point ? or do you just have some ridiculous need to argue about absolutely nothing .

4. just apply , you don ' t need any experience . you apply , they call you in , you take a test , if you pass they do an interview .

5. people complain about how capcom makes this game too casual friendly and that it ' s just too easy . here they are making it so you can dp after the opponents cock is down your throat and it doesn ' t even trade but digit  just hits them even though you were slow as balls . now that you can ' t be punished for being slow but are actually rewarded for it , making this game that much easier and now everyone is happy about it . what ' s gonna be next ? digit button supers ? an option to pause online because you have to finish painting your nails ? pathetic .

9. colombia from bioshock infinte , but only if we kicked all the racists outs and made it less churchy  americanny or nuka world from the fallout digit dlc , we can keep the ghouls and murder bots just so long as they don ' t kill anyone based on the colour of their skin

12. wow ! that ' s a lot lol thank you . i own a aspire breeze and it says on the packaging that i should not go over 70vg or 6mg . so after reading this i could go past digit but it would just take more time to wick ?

13. . so ? i don ' t recycle . why should i conserve the planet for a bunch of assholes making billions exploiting it ? just give them more time to do what they please ? what ' s my " contribution " gonna do , compared to an oil spill ? what ' s my carbon footprint compared to a multinational ' s empire ? fiat iustitia , et pereat mundus .

14. misophonia is a serious disorder . if you file for divorce , you might be on the wrong end though . seeing a psychologist might be more beneficial . what about all the other people you hear eating ? or maybe she was just absurdly loud ? who knows .
