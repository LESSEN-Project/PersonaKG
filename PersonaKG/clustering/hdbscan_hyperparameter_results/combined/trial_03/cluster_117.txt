2. i only experience a split stream if i don ' t pee immediately after ejaculating . i usually get an urge to pee within five minutes after sex or masturbating . i hold it for a while before going , it will do the same thing that you described . i started sitting down to pee while at home around six months ago and a lot of my problems have been resolved . i ' ve found that in the sitting position , urine is able to exit the urethra better and i don ' t need to shake or pump out any remaining liquid when i ' m done . i still use a public urinal when it ' s available , except when i ' m at work because it takes more time and my boss qualifies for a stupid loophole in the state break law .

3. from my understanding the gov ' t isn ' t going to flip the bill for the drug tests . the people he is drug  testing , the people trying to feed their families with what little money they have , will be paying . i most certainly do not agree with this policy , granted , if you don ' t have money for many things you shouldn ' t be partaking in nefarious substances , but that is irrelevant . a prerequisite of welfare shouldn ' t be a drug  test . have you had a job in the past digit years ? have you looked for a job in the last digit years . whats that ? yes ? ohh here you go . wait wait wait you ' ve smoked pot this month because life sucks ? sorry pal your kids will have to starve

5. if it ' s staples requesting you to do so and not a subpoena from the courts you ' ve never been to court related to it ? , don ' t waste your time by going . once you show up to court the first time , you will need to show up every month until you are actually called and might be required to be there until a verdict comes out . fyi your current company would pay you the same way they pay jury duty .
