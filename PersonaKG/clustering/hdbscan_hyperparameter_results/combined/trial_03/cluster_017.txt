1. well , if memories could be restored and uploaded in the new brain , that person could live some of his life back again , finishing whatever they had left before dying , or just because they have the money , and don ' t want to die yet , to learn about cultures faster and shit . like a hard drive that you can manipulate but then you can restore it as how you got it . i dunno man , i ' m pretty drunk .

2. that sounds like it could be a feminization kink . if these fantasies are just about the bedroom then it sounds like you just have a kink . but for some people they find out they want to live full time as a woman through fetish crossdressing . i guess what i ' m saying is  it ' s totally possible you have a feminization fetish but it ' s also possible you could have other factors that lean you more towards being trans . being trans is more about the day to day life and how you and the world around you perceives you .
