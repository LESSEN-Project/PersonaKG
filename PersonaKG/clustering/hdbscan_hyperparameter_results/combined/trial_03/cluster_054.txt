1. we must not be talking about the same deku . why does he like bakugo ? they are childhood friends . too unrealistic ? you can believe that a dude ' s sweat can cause explosion but having deku be too forgiving is unrealistic , yeah ok . risking his life to save other ' s ? bro did you not see episode digit , " my body just moved ? deku at his core puts others before himself , thats the reason why all might chose him .   x200b

2. you have every good reason to be annoyed and uncomfortable . on the other hand people have their preferences and we are led to believe those shouldn ' t include overweight people . so it is possible they just didn ' t have enough self respect to ask you out before if they did like you . i once had someone relay a message about me " she ' s smart and funny , too bad she ' s fat . the great thing is that i won ' t always be fat but the dude who said it will always be an ugly block head

4. oh man what a prison scenerio , you got punked in front of everyone , now everyone will punk you . you gotta beat his ass down 5x harder than he hit you to get back with a little extra . even if you get beat up at least you dont look like a coward . or  its just highschool and no one will remember in a few days . he was obviously trying to impress someone so it has nothing to do with you personally so you can be the bigger man and walk away , dont give him the satisfaction of retaliating . if it occurs again i would ask him why he did that . if he has a reason , try to deescalate the situation and find common ground . if hes just a dick and doesnt stop , resort to the first plan .

6. don ' t appease her for risk of breaking your lens , shes just being uncanny . let her come around , , , dont fold my guy its not worth damaging your lens . let her be passive , but when she comes around hold to your strong points you have in why you refuse to use it . but you realllllly shit the bed by using the word psycho ahahaha i mean like , its like if the story of rosa parks went way south ? like if people didnt have none of that sitting down shit . well , you just did that . ahah she will show you psycho now that you called her out . best wishes on that part .

7. you got every single guy you shake hands with , reevaluating every piece of how the date went . guaranteed digit . digit  of the time the guy thinks immediately afterwards , " did she really just shake my hand " handshakes are more busniess  esque and not informal like first dates are . truly , dont cross boundaries by hugging . but givd them a kind , happy , warm smile tell them thay you enjoyed meeting them if its genuine and be on your way . they shouldnt expect a hug or anything more , but the demeanor of a handshake at our age 24m doesnt really fit the situation . in short , skip the handshake and just wait until you are comfortable with a hug !

8. you should like it , just giving you a warning about the place that did it . tattoos should look their best fresh , the lines will only get worse over time .
