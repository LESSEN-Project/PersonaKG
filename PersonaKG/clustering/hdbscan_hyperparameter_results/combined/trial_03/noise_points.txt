12. now this is a quality post .

13. it ' s kind of difficult to judge , because some people are not comfortable expressing emotions verbally . but if you guys were having the talk , and you directly confronted him , and his response was that he " doesn ' t know how he feels , " then my bet would be that he is not in love , and just having a good time . if you ' re ok with that , then there ' s no problem . but if you ' re looking for a future and marriage etc , you very well might be wasting your time . another talk might be in order . figure out what it is exactly that you expect from the relationship . what your goals are , where you want to end up . in the end , if you want two different things , it might be a good idea to part ways before you get any more attached . best of luck op .

16. here are your two outcomes , i too work for a large hotel , and i see this quite often . digit .  you go to hr and explain how this was not divulged to you , and you do not agree with the discipline given given it is some sort of progressive discipline , and you aren  t given a verbal warning vs a written one but , you paint a big target on your back by doing this , and moving forward they will look at you day and night until they find something you do wrong . digit .  you take it , explain to your new director that you were not aware , and you never received the information . but you are aware now , and you can assure that you are there to be part of the team and  help  him through the transition , making you an ally . it  s the high road , and depending on your short and long term goals , this might be your best option . remember the hotel industry is not that big , and someone always knows someone .
