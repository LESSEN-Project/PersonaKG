1. support for people with intellectual  learning disabilities and asd . pay is good spend my days , going to cinemas , swimming sessions , arts and crafts classes , etc . i feel completely out of the rat race my job is literally to help people get the most out of their day . you don ' t even need any specific qualifications either you just need to be a nice person .

2. it wouldn  t be a bad idea to have an older student tutor you . does your school have a peer tutoring program ? lots of people struggle with math and geometry takes a lot of understanding about different shapes as well as a lot of equations . it could be as simple as you simply don  t understand how it  s being explained to you and you need a new perspective . if you  re not willing to get a tutor you  re going to have to put in double time on studying . write and rewrite problems and how to solve them until you understand how you get the answer correct . you can do it ! it just might not be easy

3. sure , people eat that stuff all the time . and some of them get sick . you don ' t need to check the temperature of your food , buts leaving it out at room temperature isn ' t exactly a " proptip . you ' d be better off putting it in a low heat oven , or the fridge and then just nuking it gor a minute or digit .

4. well , if we accept ourselves  just as we are  then nobody should ever work out because you  re changing your body , put on make up because you  re changing your physical appearance , wear clothes because you  re covering your natural body , or change yourself in any way because if you do , you  re not accepting yourself just as you are . everyone  s perspective of self acceptance is different . some people don  t believe in getting butt lifts or boob implants , some do . regardless , people still get them . people getting packers is trans guys accepting themselves as who they are a man . hypothetically , and assuming your a male , if you were in an accident and lost your dick it  s happened to many guys , you wouldn  t do anything to help yourself feel better about the loss ? i mean , since you should just accept how you are now . i do recognize that i sound very condescending in this comment and i  m not going to deny it , i  m just trying to counter argue and use your logic against you .

5. i beg to differ . just because you ' re not overspending doesn ' t mean you don ' t need to keep track . and tracking expenses don ' t really take up much if your time . you probably need at most digit mins daily to do it .
