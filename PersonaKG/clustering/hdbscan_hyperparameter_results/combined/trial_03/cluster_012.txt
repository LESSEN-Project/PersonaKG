1. there are probably digit more relevant facts that i could still let you know about , i think today ' s interaction just set me off and it is all i thought about . i guess what i am getting at is , when there is no more respect for each other in a marriage is there any coming back from that ?

3. there is . you wont really know who is spectatin you or wheter he is spectating your team . it ' s like having random guys on teamspeak  mumble who can listen to your conversations even thought you dont know someone is there .

4. with people i know it ' s behavior because i can see it . there ' s nothing that applies overall , it ' s been specific to each couple and the individuals involved . with celebrities it has to be intuition , maybe with a dash of " no duh " thrown for the more obvious ones . the one i felt awful about was chris pratt and anna faris . they were so cute as a couple to me and then one day i random thought they didn ' t seem right together any more . i felt so bad for thinking that . within a couple months they announced their separation . come to think of it i saw amy grant and her ex husband perform together once and knew immediately that they were doomed . that was before i knew to keep those thought to myself and got an earful from the one person i mentioned it to .

5. i understand but it seemed that your question didn ' t make any sense . a cop will give you a ticket if you break the law even if what you ' re doing makes sense as is safer than following the law . a cop will give you a ticket if he doesn ' t know the law or is having a bad day . your question doesn ' t matter , hypothetically or not . you do the best you can and try not to break any laws . sorry if i became outraged because i really wanted to understand and answer the question and really thought that i had , and it frustrated me that i didn ' t .

6. i thought i knew it all  megadeth cause at certain points in life ou do think you know it all only to have a curve ball come on down the line and i had no clue what was going on .
