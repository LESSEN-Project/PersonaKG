6. yeah , i don ' t care of tseries vs pewdiepie either . i enjoyed his content in digit  digit , but i was like digit in digit . i agree that rewind is trash , but i also hate the memes about it . also , i stopped using youtube for almost half an year , i do not like it . i only watch simple history , geography now , armchair historian , half as interesting , seeker , allan pan , crash course , it ' s okay to be smart and others , but all of them rarely . i use reddit but i am losing a bit interest . anyways , returning to the subject , i agree with you
