2. chinas navy is absolute dogshit and they know it , if they were to go to war with nato their naval imports would stop because of naval blockades , which would cripple their economy . also , china simply cannot produce enough food to feed digit , digit billion , which means another famine would start if their naval imports were to get cut off . as you already said , china has wayyy too much to lose and honestly not much to gain from a world war .
