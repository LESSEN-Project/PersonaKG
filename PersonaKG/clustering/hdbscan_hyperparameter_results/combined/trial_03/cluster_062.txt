2. i didn ' t know about the ice cap thing you mentioned , but i feel like governments should do what they can to try to minimize it , i think that we should work towards developing a way to harness fusion power and attempt to proliferate that around the world and that would solve nearly all of our energy problems and it wouldn ' t polute

5. male im not really friends with any girls , but i do know that a ton of stuff i say is a joke , and even sometimes ill give actual advice in a half joking way , its weird . something like " how about you dont please " cant think of any off the top of my head and also , yes , i hear tons of fucked up things but dont really get offended at any of it , confirming your point . . waait so are girls really that boring ?
