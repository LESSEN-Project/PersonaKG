1. science doesn ' t have to give any explanation , but it could point out the reasons why someone is ' messed up socially ' which would be the first good step towards change . better than the typical religious explanation which is something like ' you need jesus in your life ! that ' s why you are messed up ! let ' s pray together ! ' and ' purpose ' in life ? that ' s easy . it ' s whatever you decide it is . sure , it might be hard deciding , but in the end it is still your choice to make .

2. we are finding it fun and manageable as we enter month digit with our digit month lab . he  s definitely not an adult yet and there is training that needs doing regarding occasional rude behavior and overstimulation , but he  s very nice to the cat and has a great temperament . for a first time owner having a baby at the same time as a puppy or young dog might be crazy . a new dog is kind of like a baby , you  re always trying to figure out what it wants and how to get it to go to sleep ! perhaps i  m speaking too soon but as long as we have a dog walker and have like . digit hours outside of work to train  exercise  bond with him , he seems very happy and sleeps all night . we ski on weekends and feel bad about the alone time , so usually try to spend one day doing a lot of dog  centric active stuff with him .

4. i stayed trying to help her and be the supporting spouse , the suicide attempts , the anger , the lashing out , the never being good enough , the weeks of abuse and then the apology and the same pattern over and over again . you can only for so long go about questioning your every move and how will it get thrown back at you . i was hurt and hurt to a depth that makes therapists cry , i forgive her , she is ill , am i still hurt ? yes from time to time . yes it does feel like those digit years were ripped from me .

5. i mean if the location is good , which it sounds alright it could make sense for some people . like i agree the rules sound insane but if you have a room to rent in sf if you are willing to lower the price you can make unreasonable demands .

6. don  t make the normal kids suffer . at my jobs xmas party last year my ceo decided to have all the food be vegan but only him and his son are vegan . long story short the party ended with tables full of food wasted because your average person doesn  t like that crap . hell , even the cake was bad . if you can  t make a cake taste good you  re doing something wrong
