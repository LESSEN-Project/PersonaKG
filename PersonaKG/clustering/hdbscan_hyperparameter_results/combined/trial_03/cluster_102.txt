2. welcome to life brother they want you to have digit years experience but your digit . just apply and always include a cover letter about what makes you a good candidate . why were your other jobs so short ? that could be why your not getting many call backs . maybe take the digit month job off your resume .

3. why would you want to hide your personality ? i see it as expressing your true self to people , because i have been liying to people for too long . on the other hand there is the argument that , well accourse it ' s just a hobby and that people shouldn ' t care what hobbies you have , but lets be honest , who ' s personality hasn ' t changed because of the fandom ?

4. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better

5. i agree with you . it ' s disrespectful when people say friend zoned . all you want me for is to get in my pants ? if you don ' t value my friendship then just leave .

6. because the entire point on playing with people in the same ranking bracket as you if to have a fair game . if one team has a player much better than all digit other players in the game it is unfair and therefore not fun , which is the end goal of any game  to have fun . as to your several points emphasizing on improving  not everyone wants to . many , many people just want to play for fun and their goal isn ' t to become better . no matter what way you look at it , smurfs objectively ruin the balance and fun of a game .
