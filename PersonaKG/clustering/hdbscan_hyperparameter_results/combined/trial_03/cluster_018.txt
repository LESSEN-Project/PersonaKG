3. be there for your friend , love him , and stay strong with him . as conversation continues , youll find out the severity of the incident , but if you ask him something and he seems confused or doesnt remember , dont fight it or ask any further . see if he knows your name and go from there . the last thing you want to do is frustrate him with things he cant yet remember . i say " can ' t yet " because you are going to remain positive and with that positivity , over the course of time , his memory may slowly come back . god works his magic in ways that could move mountains my friend . ill keep you in my thoughts through this time .
