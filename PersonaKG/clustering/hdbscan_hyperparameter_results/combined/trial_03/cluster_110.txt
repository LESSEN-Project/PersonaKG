2. oh , believe me , noah aint the worst shit you could have gotten . i have a name that only two other people have in my country , so . its pretty embarrassing . and well its just a one crush . i know it feels like shes the one , but let her make a decision , and accept it no matter what it is . you can try taking her out on date to show that you aren ' t some random retard . good luck man , waiting for the best news from you !

3. i completely understand . i just imagine my inner meaner as something ridiculous or someone i disrespect  don ' t like so i can tell it as sassily as possible to shut up . sometimes goals take time . its important to remember that no matter how smol the steps are , you are taking them one day at a time , and it should be celebrated . you will get there ! i know it ! just hug your stuffies and dream big lovely  digit

5. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .

6. i don ' t even know what to say , like do you drink wine and read books all day explain please cause being in france on holiday and try to get someone to speak english is impossible just because they refuse it ? i myself prefer the very down to earth , high all day on herbs  tea mess around with chemicals dutch lifestyle .

7. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

8. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

9. great question and i honestly dont have an answer for you . it can ' t be just feminity because the women i like , and the woman i married , are tall basketball player types . so . i dont know . just is what it is , i guess .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

10. i know its not so easy to do when shit like this happens but . do people who do this not train themselves to get out of this situation ? as i understand you are supposed to roll onto your front , get your ice axe thats tied to you and kinda use it as an anchor ? i mean there were parts there where it seemed like he was just sitting up like he was on a slide

11. lmfao it  s just like me . it  s like the  kakashi it  s already morning  meme if you know what i mean
   (ID: 84a0b9e5d9e0e37c98f992c96c029f6ec99fb1ca)

12. luckily i haven ' t , and i pray that day never comes . just like my other " gun , " i don ' t pull it out unless i know i ' m gonna use it .

13. idk i ' m just being biased provably . recently in my area there is a digit year old boy that came out as trans and is being put on hormone therapy as an digit year old . that ' s just soo wrong . children should be learning and playing not declaring to the world that they are gay or bi or trans , you know ? harmless childhood crushes are one thing but openly embracing it at an age like digit or digit is just wrong .
