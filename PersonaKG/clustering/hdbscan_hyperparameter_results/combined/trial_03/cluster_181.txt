1. i see your point in a sense . it ' s not that they ' re being confrontational , it ' s that people come up to the camera . there are plenty of   boring   videos where nothing happens . there are also videos where people learn their rights . there are auditors i disagree with and auditors who react well to the public better than others . suspicious activity is only suspicious to the person who doesn ' t understand what ' s going on . i suggest watching a bunch of different auditors and see which ones you like best , or none at all . i really like the boring ones where nothing happens because it shows that they ' re not out there to harass people .

4. if that was my sister i would do the good old " listen here you little shit . " talk . i broke many people ' s bubbles this way . i would tell her off , break everything into her face about how embarassing she actually is . you do everything she says and ignore her tantrums , try to not accidentally push her buttons etc and expect change . it ' s not happening and you ' re giving her more control over you . iron fist for people like your sister !

8. is all your water metered through the hoa ? that is a bit strange for a single family home . we have digit cameras up at our house . excessive i admit but there is nothing that happens we don  t see . perhaps you can ask if the hoa has monthly meetings you could sit in on as a guest . the best part about an hoa is if you don  t like how it  s run you can join and have an opinion .

9. the experience is really with the sittewalker , not rover  it is like uber or lyft for dogs . if you are great , your clients will rave about you . i am very sad my rover dog walker is moving  she always sent " rover cards " with a photo , bathroom update and even a map of their walking route .   x200b  don ' t be like my old dog walker who was in and out the door in digit minutes for a " digit minute walk " many people have cameras and won ' t tell you they do .

11. exactly , no way to win . only thing to do is avoid the situations with people who are like that and try to have worthwhile conversations with people who are more reasonable . the stuck up sjws aren ' t worth you time

12. i have no issue with sex workers , i don  t like how tons of people on twitter are attacking anyone critical or satirical of sex work like it someone makes you immune to lampoonery or criticism but why should it bother me what consenting adults do for a living ? also i  d be remiss if i didn  t laugh about the thot audit fiasco in which all these premium snapchat hoes got investigated by the irs for not paying taxes on their income . don  t say we need to treat sex work as real work and then try to avoid income tax
