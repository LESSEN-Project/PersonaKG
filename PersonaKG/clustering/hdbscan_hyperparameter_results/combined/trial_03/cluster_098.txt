1. to be fair i used to think this . i agree that some women are not funny . however some men aren  t funny either . usually if you don  t like vagina jokes don  t watch amy schumer . she is the female equivalent to louis c . k . i do recommend you watch catherine ryan  s special on netflix for you to change your mind .

2. cause trump would think of funny names for them like " beto the creepo " and " bad touch biden , " steal their thunder at every turn and make it hard to take them seriously . p . s . i didnt bother thinking up a name for bernie because hes too old to make it to digit .

5. my mother was an only child , she said it was very lonely growing up as an only child and she always wanted a big family . i have digit siblings , after seeing how expensive it is raising a child and all the other drama that goes with having digit kids , i think it is insane ! i personally would like to have two kids . maybe three .
