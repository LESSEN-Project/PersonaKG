1. is it really that big a deal to ask to do that in a custom match or with a full party of digit ? i dont normally have much fun when we decided to all go one hero then proceed to get stomped . i don ' t think losing is all that fun and when a good digit  of my matches are that and i get penalized for leaving ? yeah it gets old .

2. " perception is reality " . if everyone sees you in " one way " then that ' s what you are to them . what this translates to is if people around you think you don ' t care about your job  responsibilities , even if you actually do , you wont be given the opportunity to take on more responsibility or looked at for promotions . very true words that took a long time to understand and eventually agree with .

3. start by not giving a shit about what other people think of you . do what you need to do for yourself . learn to say " no " more often without the repercussions of other people ' s feelings . the rest will come naturally .

4. i think people that use no true scotsman fallacy to distance themselves from " extremist muslims " will generally have no problem using it again with " stupid muslims " , so don ' t expect instant deconversions from people you intend to debate . still , it may help with people on the fence , go for it .

5. because when you ' re in rome you do as the romans do . unless you ' re obviously a tourist or you don ' t speak english at all , i think it ' s really rude to go out of your way to speak in a manner people around you can ' t understand . my wife does this to me in spanish when she wants to talk about someone we see while we ' re out or whatever and it annoys me to no end .

6. well some people are really , really smelly . and they are legitimately making it harder on the rest of us . i think the smellies need to go tbh you ' re literally the one who started this mate . gaslighting is a very common abusive tactic . don ' t be an abusive asshole .

7. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .
