1. well , its been a while now and nobody got it , so here ' s the comment again with slightly easier to read formatting . you ever met a gay person ? or asked them about their experiences growing up in abusive atmospheres with people using language like this ? up until very recently this kind of talk was pretty common , and it shouldn ' t be tolerated just because it ' s " some guys down the pub " . fuck that . all it takes for this kind of crap to be perpetuated is people like you who dismiss it as " pub talk " , and " banter " . good job there , i hope you ' re proud of yourself . read the first letter of each sentence .

2. day digit  got the patch test added to my back . it was kind of annoying at first because of how it felt like my back had a brace on it . my shirts kept getting stuck on the tape as well . day digit  my shirts still got stuck on the tape , but i figured out how to lay down with it on . the tape started to itch really badly . day digit  i was told that i was smelly by my brother , but other than that i was fine . the tape was really itchy at night , but i just ignored it . day digit  i went and got the test removed . removinf the tape felt like a wax and was very uncomfortable but it wasn  t that bad . i had a lot of tape irritation . the only patch that my doctor is concerned with is  digit hydroperoxides of linalool , commonly found in fragrances , cosmetics , and hygiene products . i was told to wait a couple of days and to see if it got any worse because right now they can  t say for sure that it is a positive match . the other splotches are either dyes or common reactions , like polka dots from cobalt . i went out and bought fragrance free shampoo  shaving cream . now i just got to convince my girlfriend to do something similar . i hope you all are fighting the good fight ! don  t hate yourself because of eczema ! it  s just your body is confused and fighting itself ! don  t worry ! be happy !

3. i really really hope i don  t get hate for this , but there is the medication like you said . but diets have helped people . there might not be proof from a medical standpoint , but people do post their stories with diet with updates , and some of them end up clearing completely like psoriaisbuddy on youtube . auto immune protocol diets as an expample . anyways , just suggestions .

4. we are particularly good listeners by nature so that ' s why people tend to dump their problems on us . also , i feel we tend to understand and put ourselves in their position thus being able to say what we might do to help improve the situation . personally speaking , if a friend asks me how i ' m doing i just say i ' m fine since i feel my problems are mine and i don ' t like unwanted advice . so , if i were you i ' d learn how to tune out when people start wittering on about their problems or make yourself unavailable for a while . hope it gets better for you .

5. i ' m starting to feel guilty that i shaked my head to many old people for not knowing how in my mind simple technical things work and here i am playing around with my instagram i don ' t even use anymore for digit minutes and can ' t figure out what you mean with history . all i see are pictures . oh well hope one of you will post the direct video for young old people like me duh
