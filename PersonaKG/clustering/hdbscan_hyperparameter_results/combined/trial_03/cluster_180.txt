1. i  m not a bootlicker , i just have mad respect for the people that risk their lives to keep my county safe . i see the sacrifice that these people make for my country and i give them the recognition that they deserve . my grandfathers were in the military and they always told me to show respect to those who risked and gave their lives for my country , i guess it carries on

2. may i ask what system you play and what rep you are ? because there is no way in hell you ' re playing high level duels and landing a mix of lights and heavies consistently as kensei . its most likely mid tier at best . people don ' t parry in high tier . they just block . and kensei is left useless at that point .

3. i always notice the people that say this either have a 4x4 truck or youve just been lucky on the road . i drive a semi and dont blame anyone for going slower in snow  ice conditions . if youre unsure its better to take it slow rather than making a mistake and sliding through an intersection or causing a pile up . i do understand everyone has to be somewhere but not everyone is as experienced so just take your time or leave enough time in the mornings .

4. people might say , he couldve saved that money . but who actually does that ? save for 17years ? only rich people . for average people , its almost impossible to save for years and not touch that money over those years . just take that guy above as a person who smoke cigarettes for years . at least his chance with his money is to become a millionaire and not cancer .

5. i ' m not talking about that sort of camping . that ' s the proper way to camp and it still involves looking for fights so i have absolutely no problems with that at all . i ' m just referring to the people who sit in one spot for a long time hoping to catch players by surprise .

6. are you that daft or are you just trying to make the people who repost feel bad ?
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

7. i  m not saying you  re in the wrong . i  m saying you shouldn  t have to feel bad for something you actually are experiencing , just because other people have it worse . you  re not saying that you have it worse than they do , so you shouldn  t feel bad about having your own problems in a first world country .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

8. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

9. i was just all  out the whole way through . pedal to the metal , take no prisoners , digit  isn ' t good enough kind of stuff . overloads every semester including summer sessions so i could graduate sooner , plus working digit  digit hours a week . i was fucking insane .
   (ID: a31ab3f3ccb2d987e0948a7a8ed52f5d74b72960)

10. don  t assume anything . ask for clarification . in my workplace , people sometimes assume they understand a vague assignment and we wind up doing unnecessary or unwanted work because someone was too shy to ask an executive some follow up questions . please , just politely and confidently ask .

11. don  t they hate white people or something ? or is that just if we try to immigrate there
   (ID: 4654e3a9a75835f9ff28170ddf31d5d3cf296ea2)

12. no , but i watch people do it to all the time . usually in my personal case most people are afraid of me which is why i typically never approach people at all . i do watch while people insult friends of mine just for trying to have a conversations though .

13. oh boy lol . i don ' t fly anymore , but no i wouldn ' t ever fly under the influence of anything , even cough medicine . it would be very irresponsible for people to fly while stoned or under the influence of any substance . the reasoning is pretty obvious . you misunderstood my statement about employees . of course they should be working sober . what they do in their personal time is really none of my business although i mostly employ writers who work from home so i don ' t really care as long as their work is to my liking . my point was , if they are going to use a mind altering substance after work , i ' d rather they just smoke weed instead of drink . weed doesn ' t cause hangovers during work hours . i ' m not advocating people get stoned or drunk during working hours . you are just buying into the narrative , that ' s my point . you have these stereotypes about pot smokers that just aren ' t true , but you are still perpetuating them with zero basis in fact . there are plenty of motivated and successful people who smoke pot during their personal time .

14. assuming they both use the force they could probably counter it , there is a reason they don  t just use the force to unarm people in a fight .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

15. fuck you skinny bitches are fucking ugly if you don ' t have a little meat on your bones then you ' re probably a skank that thinks you can get anything in life just because of your slutty looks but you don ' t hear fat people talking shit about you why don ' t you just go slit your skinny fucking wrist motherfucker
   (ID: 1afb7597077681179430af152997f04fd73ba0ee)

16. not all parents do this . i have two kids and when anyone asked i would just tell them in years . " he ' s digit . she ' s digit etc " truth is , most people couldn ' t really give a shit about your kid ' s age down to the exact month . the nearest year is good enough in daily conversation .
   (ID: d02dbb1cf70aa95df2b9f1bbd0a0c5bf0a966933)

17. totally disagree , and frankly idk how people can agree , i mean when is it too much ? is notifying digit million people too much ? what about digit million ? why not just notify the whole planet ! digit  digit  digit we should all just be neighborhood watching for missing kids !
   (ID: 203253ab73b19e5cd1d950c82537271605475cea)

18. judging by your response , youre probably a terrible parent who doesn ' t take the time to enforce standards of good behavior in children , and instead says ' thats just the way kids are ' and lets them run around batshit crazy being a fucking menace .
   (ID: 20b71c431f98b1f88ec1b3e7ada79d31df65a8c2)

19. lmao what the heck dont let people tell u what to do this is reddit , this place is filled to the brim of people who just wanna start dhit because theyve been bullied their whole lives .
