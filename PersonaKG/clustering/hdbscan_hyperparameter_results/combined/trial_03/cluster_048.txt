2. hi , i hope i ' m not sounding too disdainful , here , but if you ' re only 13k , i guess you have not been playing that much like , not very seriously for several years . are you sure you are dedicated enough to the game to get a go  related tatoo and no regret it later ? that ' s more the kind of things i would expect from dan players . i also have my doubts on what black stones would look like as tatoo just big black dots . but anyway , that ' s none of my business , and i hope you find something that suits you .

6. it has significantly more edm than the first two albums but i still like it better than infamous . i ' m not sure this band will ever get back to the levels of geeving , maybe if they get a better screamer because angelo sounds pretty bad , but i can hope right ?
