12. well heres my opinion , the guys probably very paranoid of you cheating on him , im not saying you would but thats what it looks like . heres what you need to do , if you want to stay with him id explain how hes the one and hes over reacting . tell him that you need some breathing room to do whatever you want but that youll always come back home to him . you should only unblock the guy when he understands to give you space . if you feel like things arent working out anymore because of trust then youd definitely be in the right to break up with him . thats what id do atleast
