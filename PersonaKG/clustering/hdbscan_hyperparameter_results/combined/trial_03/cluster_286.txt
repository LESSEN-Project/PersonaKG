5. i  m not whining . i proposed that we make the world a better place while asking people if they can help me get a foot in the door so i can prove myself on my own merits . if you  re lifestyle and career aren  t making you happy than i empathize with you . you are my brother and you deserve better . you  re capable of so much more than they  re paying you for . your life has meaning , your time is limited , and your purpose unique .
