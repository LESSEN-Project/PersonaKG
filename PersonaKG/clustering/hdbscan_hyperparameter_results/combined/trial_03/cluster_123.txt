2. what i ' ve always heard isn ' t that the digit , digit is a literal number of beta access or vip access . it was equivalent in the time the book was written to saying a zillion . just with extra meaning . digit tribes of israel , squared , times digit so a lot .

3. we ' ve been focusing on talking about prepping with friends , family and loved ones , especially because we ' re all going to be together in the run up to the festive season ! plus my partner wrote this awesome post on the sensible about how she used to grow food in just her dorm room . we ' ve now thankfully got a bit more space for our homestead than that .

5. " not unconventional " doesn ' t make sense , and no it ' s not strange to wear plain clothes but it ' s just hard to believe that every single item of clothing you have ever bought is digit never had a logo , brand name or been designer of some sort and digit you ' ve never been asked by anyone you ' ve ever come in contact with where you have bought your clothes from .

6. hey guys , great place you ' ve got here . something struck me , and i decided i need to go ahead and grow out what i can and see where it goes . most times i ' ve had some degree of facial hair , but anything of beard caliber seemed a far off dream . then i figured , " why not " any tips ? also , and this may be an odd question . based on what you guys see here , could you link me to a picture of a beard that looks similar to how you ' d anticipate mine coming in ? just figuring since you ' ve guys seen many beards start off here , you can kind of read where it may go to a degree . edit  my plan is to let it grow at least one month , sept . 1st .
