1. i imagine a good relationship , and i think about all of the happiness that will come from a relationship . i mainly feel like society doesn ' t accept me , based on how i look . it ' s frustrating how people don ' t look for personality in relationships , and i have a good personality . it just , sucks .

2. it  s funny here your talking about rape . most male rape never is even told bc of the embarrassment of being a guy and then second not being believed . anecdote was sexually abused told my mom she didn  t believe me digit toodles females aren  t the only ones who can get raped and even more males aren  t the only  savages  . coming from a digit year old who has a lot of hormones . yea i like a girl and if she doesn  t like me okay . that  s life you sometimes meet people that you like and they don  t like you and vice verse , you just have to find someone who both of you like each other , no i  m never gonna go rape someone . if a thought like that ever comes to my mind i will just laugh my ass off and tell myself what the actual fuck are you thinking brain loudly . trying to push thoughts out of your brain is impossible so i just let my brain free roam as it wishes but i just control my body . basically what normally happens , i think with my brain sometimes and body just goes auto or i do whatever i want and brain free roams . some may say multitasking others may say muscle memory whatever flows your boat . i think more so people need to educate others about the whole idea of rape and yes some people even if it is morally wrong may think rape is okay when aroused or is one of their kinks is wrong . even more sometimes your brain will get thoughts you shouldn  t but the key thing is never acting on them and practicing control

3. i think people should be able to like what they like whether it ' s elvis or iggy azalea . i personally like a lot of different kinds of music and there ' s some i just don ' t like but i don ' t care really what other people listen to . the only thing i have a problem with is blatant racism or things of that sort .

4. i have this problem too . my trans best friend and i refer to each other as " tr    ies " all the fucking time because we both understand that we ' re doing it to take the piss out of actual transphobes . but then i really have to try hard not to refer to other trans people like this . it ' s really bad lol basically , you ' ve just gotta surround yourself with people who aren ' t going to use that language . we automatically pick up and appropriate the language of those we surround ourselves with something something egotistic in  grouping .

5. sadly , hormones can  t fix all our features  even though hrt for transmen is stronger than trans women most of the time . i know personally i  m a guy and all but after going on t , i got more dysphoria around my chest when i was pre op , female organs and bottom area . i changed drastically but that made things i can  t change stand out even more . that happens a lot when people transition . hrt is not going to make our lives perfect and amazing like many people think . i personally believe that  s why a lot of trans people are depressed and stuff after hormones , they imagined their life to instantly become perfect and all their problems go away . our problems will still be there after hormones , i knew this . i just knew that my problems will be easier to deal with as a man than a girl for me .

6. in watching my replays over this past year i ' ve noticed that for some reason a good amount of people seem to only press one button per input . i laugh at those people . i laugh at them because only an insane person would put even an ounce of faith in this game when it comes to online connections . if you ' re doing locals than you ' re gonna have to play like that or at least you ' d find some benefit to it . but online you ' re not only fighting your opponent but you ' re also fighting the connection . at any moment some frames could drop and completely cancel out your single button press . at the very least you should double tap or triple tap everything you ' re doing . triple may be too much in some situations on some characters but double tapping seems to be pretty solid on everyone in this game aside from the few digit hit combos in this game but you won ' t even be able to do those reliably online even if your execution is perfect anyway . tl  dr mashing  bad , just relax , it ' s just a game . the more knowledge you have the more confident you can be in your play . however , if you ' re playing anything other than at your locals , double tap that shit . don ' t trust this games online connection with your lp . it will leave you a rookie for the rest of your life .

7. i had a similar face with lsd , where i just wanted to trip at every occasion . because i never had a single bad experience , only beneficial ones . thsi phase ended after digit or digit months , my mind needed a break and i didn ' t want to trip even when there was a great opportunity . for me the craving for acid feelt different than to any other drug , it wasn ' t like wanting to recreationaly better my mood like with any other drug . it feelt more like having discovered something new , where you can ' t wait for your next time doing it . it feelt like when i got a new video game for christmas as a kid and after an hour , when my parents made me go to bed , i couldn ' t wait to explore it more the next day . but after some time this always stoped , only to be rediscovered years later . the same feeling was attached to lsd after my first spiritual experience . and the same way it got more and more unexciting until i stopped using for a year or so . and this wasn ' t hard to do , it just felt right to stop now . when the spirit of adventure came back i started tripping again . even if lsd helped me a lot to learn about myself like nothing else could even come close . thinking about my usage in honesty is only possible during times of abstinence . your post sounded similar to my concern at times of frequent use and your concerns are important and nothing you should be avoiding , especially when using strong psychedelics . i could understand my frequent lsd use after it ' s ending and also be ok with having those phases because i never feelt my frequent use was damaging . i would even say such phases are welcomed by myself , when they feel right again . do not rely on what i wrote . this surely isn ' t the only reason for somebody using lsd so often . if you think your desire exists because lsd lets you be happy when you feel depressed , confident when you are shy or just lets you be the person you want to be , but aren ' t capable of otherweise . thats how damaging and addictive behaviors start . lsd may not be addictive in the ways other drugs are , but it surely will make you dependent , if used to escape your sober self . i can ' t tell you what ' s best for you , just go with what feels right for you . just be sure to honestly think about your consumption . when you understand your behavior better , it comes easier to stop or continue . since lsd does not have a physically addictive side , the reason for an addiction arises from your mind . stopping or continuing depends on the reason why you are consuming in the first place . but if you are in doubt , its better to take a break . you probably wouldn ' t have asked here if there isn ' t something worrying you about your usage . i can only tell you that i personally say that frequent lsd use , is one of the least damaging drugs , if not pushed beyond what feels good . just take some time to really organize your thoughts , minds and goals . be honest , follow what feels right for you . lsd is exhausting for your mind , some time to think may offer you what you hadn ' t capacity and time to find out during the time of constant tripping .

8. i don  t think it  s women that like you less , it  s just not the best women who are acting like this with you . i mostly have female friends i knew before and after transitioning and they were all really supportive , same with any male friends i had . they are good people , so they accepted me wholeheartedly . i suggest finding those types of people in your life , regardless of gender yknow ?

9. i  m just emotionally dependent on people who don  t care about me and i  m sick of dealing with it . i mean there  s other stuff too but rn this is eating me alive inside . the only think keeping me going right now is the fact that my mom will be sad , and i get it  s like a meme or something but , eh , it  s true .

10. stop arguing with your brother , and have a calm conversation with your mom . listen closely to her , without interruption and without formulating any rebuttals . try to understand her views , and verify you understand by repeating her exact words back to her . when you think both of you feel like you understand her point of view , then ask her questions . an example  if you could dictate your children ' s futures , what would they look like ? do your current actions help put that in place ? what do you think dad would say about this ? how can i help to alleviate your worries or whatever negative emotion she shares . next step , request a certain amount of time for you and her , but don ' t say that to think about what was discussed , and schedule when you can meet privately again . do the same process as above , but allow her to change her stance without confronting her about the change . just make sure you both understand how she feels and why she feels that way . now you can share with her your feelings and opinions , just keep it calm . i bet you two are not as far apart as you think .

11. the other comments are kind of mean . you aren ' t obligated to be friends with anyone and it doesn ' t seem like you guys are being mean to him . as long as you continue to be polite you won ' t be an asshole . i also don ' t think its clique  y to have a group of friends you regularly hang out with . i would just continue to be polite , and maybe if he keeps signing up for your breaks say that " actually his name , we usually all eat lunch together . we aren ' t asking for you to switch the time you take your break at all ! but because only x amount of people are allowed break at once , could we coordinate a little better so that i can still eat with your friend ' s names ?

12. scum ? idk i started a brand new map the first day i popped it up and i got digit bears to hit and run me lol best day of my life . but i think it  s a really good game , they constantly keep it updated , then again i think there  s a lot of steam games that are good and under the radar , i just feel like some people are d  ks at times because it  s starting up

13. tending to attract attention    doing it for attention . i  m saying you are wrong because you are unilaterally defining motives for a large group of individuals without actually providing evidence other than  well i can  t think of another reason  . you are the one who made the claim that all flamboyance is for attention , you need to defend it . also , your definition of flamboyance doesn  t even serve your point . nowhere there does it talk about loudly talking about their sexual encounters . my reason for pushing he idea that is that , because you seem to be ignoring the fact that straight people literally do just as much as  flamboyant  gay guys . if your issue with it isn  t that they are gay , you need to have an issue with anyone talking about their sex lives loudly which again , straight people do not just people who are flamboyant . my point is , if people  s private conversations bother you , no matter how loud they are , don  t listen to it . whether they  re gay or straight , or male or female . it  s not a personal problem for all straight people , it  s an issue you personally seem to have . it  s also not really a double standard because loudly yelling about your sex life , regardless of sexual orientation , in a workplace is frowned upon . like i  ve said , you don  t seem to have an issue with the fact that , whether you care to admit it or not , straight people do the same thing as well , so yea , right now it does sound like your issue is with gay people .

15. i feel like i need to say something here so i will . all three games are phenomenal . when i think of a souls game i think of challenging gameplay . dark souls digit was my first game and i loved the shit out of that game , still do and plan on getting the remastered when it comes out . tried demon souls but it would constantly break on me so i just quit . played through dark souls digit and due to the changes in combat was given the chance to better myself and git gud again . it had a beautiful world that made you question wtf was going on . it had a plot that was there only if you took the time to look . these things to me are what make a souls game a souls game . i just started playing three recently and i  d guess i  m about digit  digit of the way through the game from what i know about it . its fucking awesome starting out already knowing how the combat works . but because of this , i can  t git gud at it because i was already good at it when i started . i beat gundyr first try . dark souls digit took away what i wanted from a souls game , to be able to proudly say that i got good enough at the game to beat the everloving shit out of it . don  t get me wrong i  m absolutely having a blast playing it , and i definitely wouldn  t call it a bad game . digit and digit feel like adventures , while digit , much like its predecessor demon souls , feels like i  m just playing a game to get to the end , kinda like chores almost . finally , how in the actual fuck are you gonna say digit isn  t a souls game ? have you fucking played it ? have you beaten it ? it  s just as much a souls game as demon souls and bloodborne . in fact dark souls digit is more a demon souls remake than a dark souls digit sequel , they just threw in the same item descriptions and a couple characters from digit . if you think dark souls digit is the purest form of souls which it is than digit , being totally open with a vast array of ways to start is more like dark souls digit than digit is . there it is , my thoughts on the matter . downvotes welcome here smiling  face  with  sunglasses

16. i don ' t think that ' s what i said , getting a perfect on someone doesn ' t make them lose more points , it makes you lose less . so say you ' re ultra silver and get tap ' d by a bronze rog , and it kills you meaning he takes the game . you ' d lose digit  digit points for that . but if you perfected him once then you ' d only lose like digit or something . in terms of closer ranked matches like ultra silver vs silver , you ' d lose digit  digit or so . so if you perfect them once then you only lose digit  digit or something . in this game where one good hit can lead to a crazy snowball , i feel like there should be some point buffer for getting cheesed out . so , again . i was not saying if you land a perfect on someone that they lose more . you just lose less should they win and they still gain the same amount .
