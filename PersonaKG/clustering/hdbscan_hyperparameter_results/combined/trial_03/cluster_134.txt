3. this post is actually a pretty good start . whether you realize it or not , you ' re reaching out . now you need to go to a doctor , or a therapist , or whoever you feel comfortable with , and tell them all of the things that you have told us here . i ' m no doctor , so i can ' t say one way or the other whether or not you actually need medicine . but that ' s all the more reason to go talk to a real one . if you really do have depression , you might need meds . you wouldn ' t leave any other disease untreated , right ? as for the girl in the pic , i ' m guessing you look nothing like her . the hard reality is that you probably never will . everyone is different . you need to stop comparing yourself to other people , because you ' re only hurting yourself more . chances are , that girl has insecurities of her own . everyone does . but you can ' t let it control your life .

4. your dad sent his flying monkey when he saw you were slipping from his grasp . treat the flying monkey like you would a narc . even less , i  d say , because this is no way their business and between you and your dad . nothing requires you to even speak with this person . you don  t even have to acknowledge them . because of this was so important , shouldn  t your dad say these things himself ? stay strong .
