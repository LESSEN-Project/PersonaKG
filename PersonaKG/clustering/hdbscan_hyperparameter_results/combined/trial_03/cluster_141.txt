1. not eat too much salt and get better sleep . sometimes a good adaptogen helps to keep the serotonin flowing , like rhodiola rosea . all in all it ' s usually an atrophied muscle you have to exercise . just like how people are full of shit when they say they can ' t run , focusing , socializing or managing can be learned because the brain is very plastic . just stick to subjects you enjoy and work to empathize with other people and listen to their stories . some people are simply boring or self centered , but there are also a lot of interesting people out there . like good books , you have to seek them out , and stick to being around them and then over time socializing because rewarding because there is commonality between you and the person you found . indeed , the beginning requires getting out of your comfort zone and making the effort . it is so worth it though .

2. i am sorry if thats completely wrong what i am gonna say , because i don ' t have experience . but wouldn ' t it be possible to stretch your skin slowly before engaging in penetrativ sex . maybe take some extra 10min before , where you stretch and work the skin back slowly with some lubricant . sure this may not be the most sexy thing to do in the middle of a heated moment with you so , but a serious partner should be supportive when it just during the waiting period . if this doesn ' t work , you can also find sexual pleasures without engaging in something like penetrativ sex , where a retracting foreskin is required . a oily handjob over the skin could probably make me come even without having direct contact to the penis glans . and if you are into butt stuff , this could be the time to explore some new ideas .

3. fuckkkk , this digit  . when it is my time to finally tell a story and they just have to interrupt every digit seconds because they have to say something or cant wait digit minute to ask whatever they wanted to ask . like for real shut the fuck up for once and let the other person speak .

4. thanks friend . i liked your poem . i am in the general habit of cutting much . i say lose traveled because life traveled nowhere fast is cliche and doing something so simple as i suggested freshens the idea and can challenge a reader in a good way . i also don ' t like a poem laden with prepositions , hence the absence of between . these are all just opinions from your readers , which after some trolling , i feel this subreddit lacks at least quality opinions  input

5. i don ' t understand how a person can allow their kid to act like a wild animal in public places . when i was a kid , we had " crazy time . when we were at the beach or playground or whatever , my parents let my sister and i go absolutely bat shit crazy . it ' s what kids do best . but when we were in restaurants or shops , we knew damn well it was not crazy time . how can parents just let their kids have total crazy time all the time ? inb4 " obnoxious people have obnoxious children . you ' re right , of course , but still . god damn
