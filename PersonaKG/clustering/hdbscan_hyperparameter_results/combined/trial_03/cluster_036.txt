2. i would love to use my most out  there as middles , because they might be too much as firsts , and it would get annoying dealing with questions or having to explain it , but i really do like weird names .

4. it sounds like you are already maintaining healthy behaviors . continue to be loving and pleasant to your mom but maintain your own life . do not allow yourself to feel guilty . identify what you are willing to do fowith your mom as a minimum each week , communicate that , and maintain at least that . talk to her about her wants and needs , and try to give as much as you can . maybe she just wants a phone call if you are out late to say you ' re ok . are you pulling your weight at home cooking and cleaning ? and remember , she is the only person aside from god who will ever love you unconditionally . she is going through a life change and needs to find more things in her life that makes her happy . maybe you can introduce her to some of those things , like an art class or genealogy research . good luck !

5. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .

6. you shouldn ' t be bothered about your weight in your wedding pictures because it ' s validation that your husband loves you no matter what size you are . since he ' s supporting you through your weight loss , it ' s only reinforced . lucky you ! you look great btw . love the jeans and , like another poster , i giggled at you standing on the chair . k4l !

7. at times it can be difficult , but i would say digit percent of your time is just getting people out having a good time . its not for everyone but most people would love it . i find my week is never the same doing all  sorts of different things , and you feel like your actually working for a reason not just to make money for someone else .

8. compulsions we love have a way of becoming obsessions we hate . you ' re impulsive , have better things to do , and are probably just very very young and not getting out enough . date people , go to social functions , go to the gym , do actual drugs like normal people .

9. fascinating ! thanks for posting , i love stuff like this . reminds me of the way this guyhttps    describes seeing numbers .

10. if you have low self confidence it ' s probably because there are things about you that you don ' t like . if having a girlfriend is the only thing about you that you don ' t like and you expect another person to love you without loving yourself , than you ' re going to have an unhealthy relationship . find out what you need to do to love yourself before looking for someone else and when you succeed the right person will come around . and if she doesn ' t , it doesn ' t matter , because you ' re happy .
