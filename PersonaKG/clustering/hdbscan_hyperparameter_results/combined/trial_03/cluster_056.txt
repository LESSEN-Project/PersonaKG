4. the president is telling you we need to go to war . does congress do everything the president says ?  you do not yet have the information about how gwb got a briefing in august that it was going to happen and ignored it . the president is not the only one who gets briefings . the democrats are on committees that get most of the same briefings . they have access to top secret information that you and i dont have unless you are getting e  mails from hillary clinton . they knew what the president knew and they did nothing either . to vote for war and then say bush lied is a fucking lie . they are as responsible as he is . im willing to admit that bush was pushing for war and was wrong to do so , but what you cant to is hold those democrats responsible for letting a war happen that they should have prevent if it was such a bad thing .

5. the human mind is extremely suggestable and memories are pretty easy to make up . go ask one of your friends about that time you went to the gas station to grab a drink and they where out and the cashier was a dick about it . then ask them what color the cashier was . odds are they will give you details about something that did not happen . now picture you are a tiny person with a steady stream of incoming information you can ' t fully process come and your understanding of the difference between real and imaginary is still pretty fuzzy . kids can make up some wild stuff that they believe this way .

6. hey ! nice . better than photoshopping a meme in digit minutes for nothing . so how did you do it ? do i need to farm karma here or anywhere else is fine ? does my account need to super old ?

7. that ' s honestly worse to me . none of the dozen people in the household noticed the kid was gone , or if they did none of them said anything . usually in big families the older kids are at least partially talked with watching the younger ones . several people dropped the ball .

8. ok i have a query , because something isn ' t right here and before everyone gets all got under the collar , no , i am not a holocaust denier , so keep your poison to yourselves please  why did this guy decide in digit to break into auschwitz to report on events there , when killings didn ' t begin there to any meaningful extent until at least the following year , and the wannsee conference without which auschwitz wouldn ' t have become what it did wasn ' t until digit ? either the dates in the historical record need revisiting or someone is bullshitting us about something . edit  in case i haven ' t made myself clear  the title of this thread mentions " atrocities " but at the time this man is said to have decided to get admitted to auschwitz the atrocities for which the camp later became infamous were still quite some time in the future . so why would he feel the need to do what he did ?
