1. proposals in front of a whole crowd would be terrible . i have always thought a nice one would be very intimate and just in a really nice location at a nice time of our lives . i think if a genuine man puts in effort and real thought that ' s what matters . my sister still lives at home underneath my mother ' s house . she got proposed to by him getting on one knee under the house . worked for her but i would be underwhelmed lol . nothing hard about going somewhere beautiful and secluded . but hey , marriage isn ' t about much of this anyway . it ' s a promise to someone to love them entirely as a human for as long as that person is alive . to be the other half of that human through all of life ' s journeys . choose wisely .

2. aw i ' m really disappointed that you took my comment out of context  this is thehandmaidstale so context is the one thing that should be assumed here . adoptive parents are real parents . i thought that went without saying especially in the context of tht . stealing someone else ' s baby because you think you deserve it more than they do is not the same as adoption ! not even close ! since my original comment was so misunderstood let me be perfectly clear . adoption is agreed to by both biological mothers  parents and adoptive parents . everyone involved wants the child to have the best life possible . biological parents typically choose adoption because they believe that adoptive parents will love and care for the child . i believe that the wives aren ' t capable of loving and caring about these children more than their actual mothers , even though they have been deemed better and more worthy . now as far as parents biological or adoptive go , no one can love you more than they can . least of all a random couple who thinks they ' re better or more worthy than you .

3. there is the other side to this . which is there used to be no other problems but the db is such a big problem that they don ' t think about the rest of it . when your so says , i love you i am sure your automatic response is , i love you too . but do you , have you actually thought about it or are you just saying it out of habit .

4. haha if you have not seen love death  robots on netflix this probably seems kinda crazy , but it ' s just a description of one of the episodes that i immediately thought of when reading the title .

5. well , i love bill burr , and i also think oprah winfrey is a mostly useless gasbag , and i thought the viral ad was retarded . but for the sake of a balanced discussion , i would point out the emotional attachment between mothers and their children . yes , it is more physically demanding to be a crab fisherman in alaska . nobody is disputing that . but i bet if you asked any mother who has lost a child , she would rather pull traps for ten years than go through that again . maybe it ' s possible that the word " difficult " might mean different things to different people ? reddit is usually home to the nitpickiest of nitpickers . i ' m surprised nobody has brought up this point . and now i get downvoted to oblivion .

6. although i love clannad and code geass with all of my heart . they arent flawless . and i dont think its good to keep saying to yourself that nothing will beat this anime . because then you ' re making it harder for yourself to find a really good anime . i recommend going in every anime with the thought that this could be you ' re digit  anime . this way you can enjoy more anime .
