3. i found it when i became independent . everyone has their own way of finding their self worth that correlates with their personality , soul , etc . i don  t usually like to think that way , i like to think more like   with all my flaws my ups and downs , it makes me who i am and i love myself for it .  some albums  love yourself  answer , love yourself  tear , and you never walk alone are some albums i highly recommend .

4. tie between uma thurman  fall out boy and i saw her standing there if someone was never introduced to rock n roll these would be the first songs i  d show them . they are just perfect songs . the boys are back in town  thin lizzy this song is fun . there  s not really another way to describe it . i listen to music for fun to to have fun riders on the storm  the doors i love this song . i think i like it because it is so simple . it  s a song everyone can sing isn  t overshadowed by either , vocals , piano , guitar . it  s amazing

5. glad to hear that , it ' s a shame they fell out of fashion . nothing fancy really . just normal bras and panties , but i have to wear stockings to keep the corset anchored so it wouldn ' t start riding up . yep , i ' d love to get a custom made one . they ' re pretty darn expensive though , at least about digit and i ' d have to get them sent from the us as that ' s where all the good corset makers are . most of them have noticed by now , and the feedback has generally been very positive . they think i ' m mad for attempting something like this especially on a daily basis when most people can barely stand regular shapewear for a few hours but the benefits are very obvious .
