1. i don ' t believe the earth is flat . let ' s just establish this . but what is the explanation for people who do ? a is it some deep digit dimensional digit dimensional , digit dimensional , other dimensional , warped energy kind of view that would imply that everything is kind of on one flat spectrum of reality and matter sort of deal ? extending to the universe and consciousness etc ? not just talking about the actual physical earth but more like some kind of perception of it ? like some deep kind of belief system behind it ? or b do they actually believe that if you were to walk long enough there would be an end to the physical earth that we live on and that the " sides " aren ' t connected ? like you could get to australia and say thats where the edge was , but then to get to nz you would have to travel across the world again to the other side ? because if it is a i could possibly excuse them and probe more about some kind of dimensional and consciousness explanation and possibly keep an open mind but if it is b iv got not a clue what they are thinking . let ' s remind us all again  i don ' t think the world is flat . at least not the one we live in on a daily reality basis ! lol !

2. funny that the place is so dirty yet people are alive ? or perhaps we live in a society controlled by chemical companies into thinking everything is out to kill us . i am far from saying i would go there but if you see an old person drinking that water , and they have been doing so all their life it makes you think .

3. i ' m getting my snow tires put on my 3rd gen tomorrow . here ' s why  better performance in cold weather think 35f and rainy although i can drive in snow just fine on all seasons , other people cannot , and i like having the extra grip when dodging idiots combination of 4wd , ground clearance , diff lock and snow tires means i don ' t have to worry if the roads are plowed i live in co and plan to do a fair amount of driving in the mountains this winter

4. didn ' t say i was against trump either . if your an american too then your my fellow patriot as well . trump has done some good and lots bad  just like everyone else . also why i get my news from lots of different sources as well bbc , cnn , fox , oan , etc . i live in a big world and i choose not to pick one side over another . what i hate these days is everyone seems to be on one side that is it pitted against another via corrupted parties . it ' s all a sham if you ask me .

6. than do it . i suffer just like you and at the end of day i must be emotionally responsible for my own negative and positive energy . who cares if kojima likes to mess with us . go live your life . you  re going to die one day  don  t waste it frustrated about some dude over in japan or trolling reddit posters for a quick sense of power . these things will haunt you on your death bed . life is about giving and what i  m asking for in this thread is we give both kojima and ourselves a little more space to just have fun with the whole thing !

7. we just kinda roll with it here , no on really talks about it . some people have whats called a  happy lamp  that gives off uv rays or something . i think digit  of the people that live here get sad , which is caused from the lack of sunlight . sad is a seasonal depression disorder btw i live in america , but alaska

8. it just is daunting to me to have such a large population for a city , and i would hate to move into the " bad parts " unknowingly . it would be like someone moving to townsville and accidentally going to live in vincent . they . would . die .

9. oh wow someone told you something so you threw years of your life away ? let me guess you didn  t work in this time frame either ! and i  m also guessing you live in a poor area to be in this position , for example i live in a place where you can easily earn  digit  and likely earn  digit plus no degree , no experience with low cost of living . i don  t think this is  something  bad that happened to you  just a result of poor decision making . luck plays a role , but not a significant one in things like these , and i am in my position in life basically entirely based on luck .
