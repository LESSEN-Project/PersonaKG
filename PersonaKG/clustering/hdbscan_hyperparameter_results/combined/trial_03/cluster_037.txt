1. declining invites is i think a bit too far unless you have reason to expect an immediate disaster , such as a hurricane or snowstorm . here ' s what i would do . digit  keep some basics in your car , primarily water , food , meds and blankets . if you ' re travelling without a car , keep basics in your luggage if at all possible . digit  introduce others to prepping , but be diplomatic about it  start with the absolute basics , and mention for instance how you ' ve been reading about hurricanes  floods  any other fairly common disaster , and you think a few day ' s worth of supplies is a really great idea digit  don ' t start off by saying ' the end is nigh and i will not come stay unless you have guns , ammo and twelve years of mres ' sounds far  fetched but i ' ve met very intense preppers . they ' ll almost certainly just think you ' re both impolite and crazy , which is unhelpful . digit  you have an advantage now that it has happened once . next time you go stay with these friends , you can say ' remembering what happened last time , would it be helpful if i bring some spare water and things along ? no big deal , just though it might help keep all of our minds at rest , what with the kids and all ! ' they ' ll almost certainly take the hint and stock up on a few basic supplies if they can do so .

2. i ' ve reasoned that because christianity was my coping mechanism for such a long time i never developed a way to handle life . that ' s a really aware and mature way of looking at it . but seriously , just enjoy life . don ' t worry about the big issues for a bit , find something that ' ll make you happy and do it . go out with your friends , play a video game , do something you ' ve always wanted to do but have never done before . reality isn ' t nice , but that doesn ' t mean we have to think about it all the time .

3. i  ll time it next time i sit down and play . i think it  s still about that though . i  ve never had my switch hooked to the tv . the dock has been left in the box since day one .

4. oh , thank you for the compliment  to divulge the circumstances though , it was on the way home from my last shift of the week and we didn  t discover the break until a few weeks later  so i actually had a few days to recover and by the time the injury was apparent it had already made enough progress to be ignorable my only regret is that i  ve got a four inch ridge of bone or tissue or something back there along the crack because of the way it healed . i  ll wear a hat until i die i think

5. the fear of spiders is not something humans are born with , it is something you learn . if your parents always start screaming and crying when they see spiders , you ' ll learn to think spiders are scary . dogs also don ' t have an instinctual fear of spiders , so they would have to be taught to fear them too . most dogs aren ' t afraid of spiders , so they don ' t have a born fear of them either . but i ' ve seen dogs that are afraid of spiders , and their owners are always afraid of them too , so it seems they can learn it too .

6. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him

7. people aren  t against you  they  re for themselves . let  s say you  re a local politician  city council maybe . ok . so your pay is shit . this is a part  time position with few benefits . you  re in your 40s and you  ve got two kids to put through college . you  ve got your normal job paying you ok , but not enough to take on thousands in tuition . there  s a vote coming up to decide if you should create a local landfill for a nearby city  s trash . it  ll make the town some money but also won  t be great for the local environment . it  ll smell bad in that area . some people won  t like it . a guy who has the land to sell for the landfill says he  ll give you  digit , digit if you vote yes . a guy who has trash trucks who will haul the trash for the coming years will give you  digit , digit to vote yes . you don  t have friends or family who will be affected and your kids have a jumpstart on paying for school . plus , the city gets some money . a few more people get employed . big reward for you , small downside for some . that  s how this stuff starts . innocent enough . i think the problem then comes from the slippery slope if i did it for tuition , it  s not that much worse to do it for the vacation house ! and the possible blackmail . the next vote comes around and maybe you  re opposed to expanding the landfill but now you  ve got folks who paid you and can tell newspapers other outlets that you got paid . your political career is now done .
