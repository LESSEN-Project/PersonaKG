4. as someone else said , you need to go with it . two ways to do it  have a comeback . you said you ' re not good at it , but keep trying to think of some even after the fact . if they ' re falling into patterns with what they ' re saying , you should be able to use one of those . build off one of their digs and take what they said one step further . part of this might all be part of being low man on the totem pole , but you want to show you have some edge so you ' re not always that guy . good luck op .

8. make the difference between what you really need and what you want . for the want , don ' t buy immediately , think about it , would that really make you happy ? often it ' s only a happy boost at buying time , an instant gratification and nothing else . many would think it ' s miserable life but it ' s all the opposite , the want i end up buying are things i really want .

9. let it slide off you . why would you care whether someone thinks you are unmanly or creepy . if they think so , let them think so . it should have no influence on you whatsoever . aren ' t you a man going their own way ? exactly doing that ? not caring what people think of the choices you make and doing whatever you want to do anyway ? that ' s exactly what mgtow is about for me .
