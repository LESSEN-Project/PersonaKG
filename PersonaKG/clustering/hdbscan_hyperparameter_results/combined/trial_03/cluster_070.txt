   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

11. okay i found one extremely common problem for your car that seems to be correlated with an intermittent start and occasionally poor running conditions . on your distributor shaft underneath the distributor cap where all of the plug wires stem from there is a crankshaft position sensor . these apparently are notorious for going bad on jeeps from that era . they can be expensive . my shop manual says  digit so id have your mechanic friends test it for continuity before changing it . im pretty sure i just heard a gunshot ill finish this comment in a minute when i know im safe

14. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

15. i know that . i was just saying that for an eli5  level explanation , x  x " equals " digit at digit . meaning that the limit of the function exists . of course , as others have pointed out , you can define other limits that are still indeterminate that come out to other values . or no values at all . at x  digit , ln1  x  sinx  digit  cos  digit x evaluates to digit  digit . but , as any mean girls fan knows , the limit does not exist ! but the limit of literally taking x  x to digit does , in fact , equal digit .

16. well , thank you ! at least now i know . just one more question  the bag they gave you already , just not the right size for the helmet ?

17. the best advice i can give to you is to either talk to your friend , let them know how you feel and give them the chance to become aware that their behavior is bothering you , or do nothing and slowly back away from the friendship . i am in a similar boat myself . as friends we should be able to voice our opinions and concerns within our friendships and not worry that the other will become defensive or misinterpret our motivations , but sometimes it just doesn ' t work that way because of bias or prejudice or just plain ol ' human error and that ' s when it ' s time to step back . good luck !
