1. as a kid , hell . i was the youngest , so i was constantly picked on , and my parents would tell me " don ' t provoke them " even when i hadn ' t done anything . they also acted like if one of us knew something , we should all know it , even though some of us had way less experience  education than the others . and yes , parents have favorites , and it makes the others feel inferior as shit . as an adult , we stopped fighting and now it ' s like we ' re friends that will never grow distant , even if we don ' t see each other for ages .

4. in that case , greet her and chat up . you can assess the friends interest in the same time . why do i feel like a wolf ? i don ' t know . it ' s probably because i read something about this in the game .

5. this sounds like a lack of training  impulse control issue and not the dog actually hating you . your friend should train her , it ' s not cute when an adult pitbull acts like that and is dangerous for the dog ! there ' s a guy in my area who brings his totally untrained   digit lb pitbull to dog parks . the dog regularly jumps on people and bites their hands  pulls on their clothes . the people involved have all been dog owners so they know to remain calm , but i don ' t see it going well if a dog  fearing stranger or child were the target .

6. i always wondered why people like you feel the need to be dicks on the internet . is it because in real life you  re pushovers who don  t know how to earn respect or stand up for your selves ? is this your outlet ?
