1. there are a few good ones on here like this , but for freshness , this would be best done as mf4a , just saying . my favourite twist , would be the wife on the phone , teasing the husband about what ifs , but it sounds like she ' s alone . she then hangs up , or at least think she does , and you get to ' accidentally overheard ' how amazing it is .

2. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting

3. you just completely contradicted your argument , you just said that the next person will use their phone and at that point you do need that phone . and how long do you think that the next person would randomly stroll up to you and be like ,  oh my , are you stuck ? let me call digit for you .

4. i think you should just look over joseki that you encountered in your games . if you feel like you got a disadvantageous sequence in a corner , go look up josekipedia , and see what you could have done better . that ' s all . if you play something often , you can also check wether it is joseki . who knows ? maybe you got used to play a slightly sub  optimal sequence . i heard someone that the path to progress goes  learn joseki   understand them   forget them , the last step being the most important .

8. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .
