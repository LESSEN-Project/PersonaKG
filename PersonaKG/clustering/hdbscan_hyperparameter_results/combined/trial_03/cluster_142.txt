1. yeah , my biggest is not the spoiling . i spoil my daughter a lot too , but i also make sure she is aware of the fact that what you have doesn ' t make you who you are , it ' s in your heart and how you treat people . my biggest pet peeve is the parents that are like , no honey don ' t scream , ssshhh , it ' s ok , and there is their cld having a stage digit temper tantrum in the store  zoo  park wherever and they are just so passive . drives me crazy .

2. lol ! but seriously , it ' s ok for people to talk about thing in hindsight , but if you are in a situation like that and feel threatened and are concerned for your families safety then calling ti an over reaction is slightly wrong . i mean , an over reaction would be to keep going right ? one hit and she was down , he didn ' t start stomping on her like so sort of berserker . that would have been an over reaction . he pushed her way after she pushed him to show that they shouldn ' t mess with him . she started to advance on him , in his mind he is surrounded by a bunch of teens who will most likely fallow her lead . one punch in self defence and in defence of his family . situation deescalated . obviously one punch could have killed the girl . but she and her pack of friends were the aggressor . should he just man up and let them feast on his bloody corpse while his family run for shelter ?   x200b

3. i mean it just objectively does , a signal , a loud one at that , that you can  t turn off ? when does it end ? why not just give a signal for any and every crime , look at it like this if the average person has digit , digit days alive and you ruined . digit peoples sleep , digit , digit , digit is it worth it ? there has to be some end , i don  t care . don  t amber alert me , i  m not going to pay attention to it either way .

4. i mean sometimes if there ' s a car on fire on the road or there ' s been an accident then if someone uploads it to like their social media saying avoid the let ' s say m25 there ' s been an accident ? i mean going in and filming dead bodies and injured people isn ' t the greatest move but what if your just taking a video of something while passing by ?

5. i mean it  s certainly possible just seems super unlikely to me . really a one trick pony company as solarcity probably isn  t going to take them there , and sure some of them tend to do good but just like other car companies there will be a ton of competition and to me it also seems pretty unlikely we will see a completely electric car world unless there is massive improvement in battery life and charge time . even so there are tons of other car companies . i mean we will see just seems a bit of a pipe dream to me , suppose we will see though . i mean if tesla completely eliminates all other car companies and electric cars take over the world we could see a multi trillion dollar tesla in digit  digit value , but even still it  s not  my kids will thank me later off my tax return  kind of money .
