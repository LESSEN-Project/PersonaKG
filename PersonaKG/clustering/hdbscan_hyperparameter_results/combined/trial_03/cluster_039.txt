5. i have the gamecube gameboy advance player somewhere , but i can ' t find it to save my life . if i could just find the disc , i could probably find the device itself on ebay pretty easily . i just miss the ability to play pokemon emerald on the big screen . maybe one day i ' ll get emerald on the switch . until then i ' ve got a modded mini snes , but it ' s just not the same !

8. take out the tutors . make a list of the cards you replace them with to ease swapping them . keep the tutors in your sideboard . you ' ll have a deck with digit power levels , and you ' ll have just as much fun without them knowing you ' ve challenged yourself . swap out fetch lands , too if it ' s still too strong .

10. this is hilarious . the difference is " so huge " you had to film it in slow motion and put it side by side for anyone to notice ? i ' ve said it before and i ' ll say it again  outside of the people determined to applaud or canvass every single fucking change apple makes to every device they release , 60hz is not choppy , 120hz much less 100hz still ghosts , and the difference is god damn negligible .
