1. that ' s just statistics at work . if you have ever even glanced at the numbers to see how many planets are around how many stars around how many galaxies then the idea of any single phenomenon occurring once and only once becomes so unlikely it ' s borderline insane not to think there is life out there .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

2. i think you ' re just bad at it , it ' s fun
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

3. i think you just clearly stated the concept of a ' starter home ' that you and your spouse are doing right now . as your family and income grows , you may find that house too small and if you are able to buy a larger home , you may do so .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

4. if there ' s nothing i can do , i just think .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

5. the planet or just life on it ? i think it would be cool if we explored to other planets and earth became obsolete .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

6. you think you have a brain damage , then you kinda realize that you are asleep and try to start a self induced dream about pornography and it does not work , so you just hang back until you wake up
   (ID: 53aa6c267ff5eccf891e178786d41ca5df80a5de)

7. just when you think it can ' t get worse , she keeps typing .
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

8. yep ! i think we also see her mention it briefly in a season digit flashback to the red center just before she mentions the colonies and we see the picture of junes mom too .
   (ID: e387b7eddf8ab01e3dd767dc2f5ca52494fbe9b0)

9. i think we got way of topic here anyway . the original question was well kinda why does gaming industry now day feels obligated to satisfy all those  pissy dickweeds  , can  t we have just  he , she , they  characters , maybe even white ones too ?
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

10. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

11. just when you think it ' s gone you hear the eeeeeee .
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

12. just because we disagree you think i ' m not as well read as you ? that pretty arrogant .
   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

13. why should you panic if there is nothing to lose . youre not playing in the katowice grandfinal . just try your best and if you fail , think . about what you could have done . better in that situation . you learn by mistakes
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

14. okay cool i think i will just go for it haha , i ' m ready to care for them and for sure i won ' t neglect that ! aww , thank you so much
   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

15. she invited you to her house , showered while you were there and was willing to let you see her in just a towel ? i think you missed some signals , buddy .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

16. surely there are other avenues to take this information . you reported it to the police department of which luke murray is assigned ? nothing seems to have been done ? take it to another department , go get legal advice , take it to a lawyer , any of these options are better than posting it on reddit , and if this turns out to be a false report then you are committing an act of defamation . i ' m not doubting your honesty , just think you should find another means of having the law look at this accusation .
   (ID: 9e8a44f7c55ebce4785906436a033b33a1ccb949)

17. im not . i just think its kinda bruh moment cuz no part digit character is gay . and no one can disagree . sorry but judt remember thats a weird fantasy . also you used the word hypocrite wrong .
   (ID: de0709ad19c458ffff0b96aab8fcfa9c40b24603)

18. remember that other one where he got the volunteer to murder stephen fry ? he also used the " anchor " and " color " concepts in that one . it think it is bullshit to suggest anyone can be persuaded in this way  as you mention , there are extensive screening and editing processes that db doesn ' t share with the audience . he just really knows how to pick em .
