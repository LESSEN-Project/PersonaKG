   (ID: a93c4b4e04523abdf134a40204e81619d6e659ef)

3. wow . aren ' t you just a big boy telling me how it is . look at you just put me in my place . thank god for you brave souls who take on the burdensome task of sorting out the know ' s and the know ' s not . and nobody even asked you to do it . you deserve a treat . that ' s a good boy .
   (ID: f15c79447707a6e701285e8c59cc3aa25d54daa6)

4. rock climbing . absolutely terrified me as a kid . i was too afraid to climb more than 15ft up the wall at an indoor gym . a couple years a go my friends got started doing it and i forced myself to climb to the top of the wall . after making it to the top a few times , and being safely lowered i found that i loved it ! i still get scared lead climbing , but it ' s a good fear if that makes sense .
   (ID: 9b41f9c0d7bce732d9af75c3b13bd58e9ce2a1e1)

5. just go to the gym . it sounds easy but that ' s all you can do . just do it . try to bargain with yourself . and in time , with baby steps you ' ll get out of your shell . i can ' t really imagine what your voice must sound like tbh but i find it super immature of ppl to openly make fun of something you can ' t really change . remember ! they are wrong . not you . you can ' t do anything to change your voice . there are weird ways to try but they may not work . ppl know you can ' t change it . and they make fun of you anyway . that ' s plain wrong no matter how you look at it . keep working on yourself and don ' t forget that you have the potential to improve . but they will always be assholes . good luck !
   (ID: f042043ff04e1f2bd28d7c34b7937eb8bf31c76e)

6. really glad i spent over  digit on this , haha , nah i still don ' t regret it , wish i could afford an index . so just regular velcro tape or should i get like gorilla tape ? would gorilla tape possibly ruin the plastic ?

   (ID: ba6d1d2cee95e9f30e06dc1584d5fa02e62221e8)

8. not all parents do this . i have two kids and when anyone asked i would just tell them in years . " he ' s digit . she ' s digit etc " truth is , most people couldn ' t really give a shit about your kid ' s age down to the exact month . the nearest year is good enough in daily conversation .
   (ID: d02dbb1cf70aa95df2b9f1bbd0a0c5bf0a966933)

9. you automatically pay taxes by default when you get your pay check . most likely you will be over paying and you ' ll get a tax return . what kind of work will you be doing ? some types of employment you may recieve a digit , but most forms of employment you ' ll receive a w2 .

   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

15. hey , first off , i wanna thank you for being real with how you feel . and congrats to losing 90lbs , that ' s absolutley insane ! the first thing i thought of was the concept of " stinkin thinkin " and how our mind sometimes plays sick games on us by saying we are " not good enough " in reference to tinder , , , anyone can make a profile so why would you deny yourself the opportunity to have one if you want one and try it . you may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome . but it starts with you making one and knowing that if others can have it , you can too . also youre so young that you can bounce outta this mindset . first i would take your chance on the girl you want . ask her to the gym or something , and if that doesnt work , go in on the tinder and try what have you got to lose ? nothin , but a mindset that needs updated . im sorry if thats harsh because i do empathize feeling that way , because ive been there but ive found the way out too by putting one foot in front of the other and takin that chance with a girl . i believe in you bruddah

17. thanks . i will be on my guard . i will try to work on myself too . i ' m actually away for digit weeks after he gets back with digit weeks here with him before i leave with a girl friend , so maybe some space will provide some clarity . maybe it will end us . the uncertainty is killing .
