1. without ever being clued in that i was any smarter than any of my siblings and with the way they handled it , you might not be , lol . you just don ' t know . btw i do think they handled it appropriately  i don ' t want this to come off like an insult .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

2. it is pretty gruesome most of the time . sometimes it ' s like far away shots where you can ' t really see anything but you know they ' re dying  dead . i ' m not sure why other people watch it , but for me it made death more real , if that makes sense . as someone who has never actually seen someone die in real life it has been informative . before i watched some of those videos it was like " oh , that sucks " when i ' d hear on the news that someone got shot , stabbed , in a car accident , died in a fire , etc . after seeing those kinds of videos i take more of a pause after hearing something like that . i take the moment to mourn a life that ' s been extinguished , and be thankful for how fortunate i have been . but that ' s just me . though i will say , i can ' t watch the ones with kids . i saw one video with kids and even now i want to vomit .

7. my psychiatrist says i have ocd tendencies along with aspergers syndrome . i don ' t know if i actually have ocd or not but from my experience i also get these impulsive thoughts . " i liked these girls when i was a young child , do i still like them now ? " that ' s basically my worry , i ' ve been an adult for a few years and i worry the same . " why won ' t these feelings go away , i don ' t want these feelings and thoughts . they were okay when i was younger but not now ! stop it stop it stop it ! " my psychiatrist says sometimes we have trouble shifting from developmental thoughts to adult thoughts . he also said to be in the present moment more . i don ' t want these thoughts , i don ' t want these feelings . i really think i have " harm ocd " but we ' ll have to see what my psychiatrist says next session in digit weeks
