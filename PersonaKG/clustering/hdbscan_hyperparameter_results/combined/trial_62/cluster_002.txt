Total from this dataset: 267

1. hon , you need to think about yourself here . i know that can be hard , especially if you ' re a giver by nature , but it ' s true . if you don ' t feel safe , comfortable , and respected in your relationship , you won ' t be truly happy . and that may not seem like the end of the world now , but it will in time . eventually , bitterness and resentment can start to grow and you ' ll find yourself hating the person you once loved . if you don ' t think you can be happy dealing with his bipolar disorder , it ' s ok to move on . it ' s better that both of you find partners you can truly be fulfilled and happy with , even if it means going through some pain first .
   (ID: 87dcb06b0e31b35730fe93ce7dcbef85e6078b40)

2. just take your time , i was in your situation too but in digit months i get better
   (ID: 5678e7d82af39057d98ff7906ce8fef81468ba06)

3. heres what id do ask her out one more time , if she says she has things to do without giving you a time where shes available then yea you did kill your chance . other than that , im sure youll find more people youll have a shot with
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

4. what am i suppose to say ? what ' s done is done , no need to keep feeling guilty and letting it eat me up for months messing with my mind and shit . just letting go now and not letting it bother me sounds way better then letting stuff fuck me up like most people do .
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

5. you should never look at sex as something that needs to be done just to say you did it . ask anyone that ' s been married to the love of their life , they ' ll tell you they wish they waited . its not that you can ' t because of anxiety , its just that it isn ' t the right time . there are no such things as missed opportunities because when you meet the person of your dreams , you will never let then go and vise versa with or without anxiety . those aren ' t friends , they are just cliche douche bags and it probably burns when they piss . fuck em , because the kind of anxiety you get from meeting someone new is something you learn to cope with . the anxiety you get induced from people you already know , you are stuck with .
   (ID: 51e06ea43809bd7f43c9c3b13a19193236a72570)

6. she probably doesn ' t have feelings for you , it was the drugs . that being said you still cheating on your boyfriend and that is uncool . you could keep quiet i guess , but the guilt will likely continue to eat at you . you should probably tell him the truth and not put yourself in a situation to cheat again .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

7. knock that bish off the pedestal . really , if you keep her there you  ll never be able to appreciate anyone else . including yourself ! ex is an ex for a reason .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

8. i can think you should be honest with your feelings . i say with experience and to ignore or overlook it can be more destructive than anything else . if she genuinely likes you , she ' ll come back . if it ' s just the physical stuff the friendship will fizzle out . that ' s the worst part though . fwbs ruin good friendships most of the time .
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

9. it sound that those people in your life are holding you back and that isn  t good for mental health . i  m not saying you should get rid of them but certainly make them aware that your life is more than chores or work and everyone needs a hobby and shouldn  t have to hide it .
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

10. what she is doing does not seem particularly troublesome . i mean it just seems like she is changing in ways that are really freaking you out . from what you have said i would let it slide as long as he isn ' t violent , extorting money or raping her . i mean as long as she is happy and not getting hurt right ?
   (ID: 2fd27f1218d4f8b9cf90988522a560a50a304dfc)

11. yes , our minds love to punish ourselves when we are low . i promise if you truly try you can feel better and once you do it will be easier next time and so on and so on . feeling like this i truly know can be dangerous . don ' t be afraid to talk . get it all out . it ' s ok to be sad . but you have to tools inside your head to make yourself better ! remind yourself that you are worth it red  heart
   (ID: dc0783c6951122c6edfc85430901cf133c146b32)

12. im gonna tell you , mate , taking your life only hurts the people around you . not one single person is thinking life would be better without you . high school is no determination factor anyway , life changes after high school and you can make life what you want it . you can start and entirely new life for yourself , you ' re moving on to how you want to impact the world . i know talking to someone isnt at the top of everyones lists when it comes to mental health but from experience , it really helps . reddit is a really good place to get your emotions out mate . there are lots of people on here with the same problems you ' re going through and we ' re trying to overcome it together . we ' re here for you , mate .
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

13. i ' m digit and feel some of your pain . i like some peoples answers of oh just feel better thats all you need . some days isn ' t that easy . i don ' t have a bad life by any means but struggle to motivate myself to do fun stuff or even daily chores .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

14. try to think about how you want her to feel about your exes . that  s how you should handle it .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

15. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .
   (ID: 6f13975ce6a8747ec3d0e2207b9ef86d80a28713)

16. well you are setting yourself up for a fall . you said she  s super religious , this will not end well for you . she will either make you go to some other crazy jesus freak that will attempt to rid these devils from you , lol , or she will blow a nut just like you said she does and call you a fag and want you to get out . now sit back and take all that in because you are heading down a path that has no positive outcome for you . sorry . you already said who she is . good luck dude .
   (ID: 3cd64a42c43aaba8bcfe70482cd19250f58de2f0)

17. sounds like a rough situation , if s is really obsessed i guess not doing anything don  t help , so you got to take action . i would suggest telling s you don  t like her , and hope for the best .
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

18. you  re at another fork in the road buddy . that  s normal life is meant to break you that  s how it is . go get laid spark a blunt and think .
   (ID: b2a2cd889183833ca9a753b2d28f6d89d867e1f9)

19. absolutely speak to your therapist . you trust them . they will help you . you need to get yourself out of that relationship for your safety , physical and psychological . this is not a one  off occurrence .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

20. i feel your pain . i was told a week ago that my wife has wanted a divorce for over a year . it hurts like hell when one minute you think your life and relationship are going well then the next minute you find out your partner does not want you anymore . it no doubt crushes your world . and i know what you are thinking and feeling . everyone keeps telling you the same things , and they are the right things but you don  t want to hear . you believe that there has to be someway to stop this and correct , but we can  t . the heart loves , hurts , grows and loves again . we just can  t control it . so good luck with your situation , we both know our lives will get better in time . take care .
