2. you should see his previous speeches where he essentially generalized the population of mexico as a bunch of rapists , murderers , and thieves . i can ' t figure out the exact reason , but this has to be a smoke screen . someone , somewhere is doing something diabolical , but we ' re fixated on trump and what he will say next . tl  dr illuminaughty touched my body .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

3. fair point and i fully agree with you , but you " should  have hidden paxter redwyne ' s username , or seek him out in the forum and inform him that you have exposed his opinion here . because as it is he sounds like an ignorant and may not even know . he deserves a right to reply and clarify his opinion  correct his mistake .
   (ID: 67ef96fb30756c49a9ffdff2579058eb2a3c1398)

   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

5. and your supposed to be an expert on englishology ? people like you are just there too show how smart you are and put others down , rather then lift then up . your just a looser and thats the end of it !
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

6. i understand but it seemed that your question didn ' t make any sense . a cop will give you a ticket if you break the law even if what you ' re doing makes sense as is safer than following the law . a cop will give you a ticket if he doesn ' t know the law or is having a bad day . your question doesn ' t matter , hypothetically or not . you do the best you can and try not to break any laws . sorry if i became outraged because i really wanted to understand and answer the question and really thought that i had , and it frustrated me that i didn ' t .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

7. except no , you do have responsibility . you know that word is offensive which , i would hazard to guess , is why you like it , and further you know what it means to call someone that . it ' s a legitimately offensive thing to call someone , and just because people have called you a faggot and you didn ' t care doesn ' t mean that other people can ' t be legitimately pissed off by being called that , or by that word being used . the idea that you can use a word like that and have no responsibility for how people react is like saying you can swing a baseball bat at someone ' s head and have no responsibility for them being pissed . it just doesn ' t make any damn sense . if you were as emotionally mature as you say you are , you ' d take some responsibility for your own actions instead of projecting that onto someone else . own your shit instead of forcing other people to pick it up .

8. say what you will , but your homophobic posts speak for themselves . check your priveledge
   (ID: 0847b0a0c2f6c5c595a8cbe2207c0959b37df0c4)

9. i think at this point your just upset that a little american boy has a different opinion then you and your trying to make me look like a dumb homophobic nazi
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

10. you are contradicting your own words boy . i would tag you as an arrogant asshole over everyone else over here . i  m done , have a nice day .
   (ID: abffa241a0eb33d4cf220980872adc9a148514b4)

11. we are literally destroying this world with consumerism . choosing quantity over quality . releasing carbon emissions into the air . and i wasn ' t talking about the u . s . i was refer to us human beings as a race . not everything is political .
   (ID: 4a5a9ac8eab027b38804427b3c8c5e19c8991de3)

12. so , do you understand my comment now ?
   (ID: 9286ff57fb4290178a79b38d20f6a95da9d2267f)

13. yea , i don ' t support it . you just can ' t change their mind by telling them these things , the only reason they are homophobic or racist it because they ' re ignorant , impossible to change their minds .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

14. . and you should , rightly , let reddit speak for an entire group of people , right ? you , as an american , aren ' t too bright .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

15. thanks for proving my point . what point did i prove ?  can argue that there is good and bad practical result from the study of physics results from the study of physics atom bombs is not the same things as physics speed of light in a vacuum or weight of an elementary particle itself .  not only in the physical realm but the spiritual realm . what is a " spiritual realm " , what evidence do you have that such a " realm " exists ? where is this realm ? how do we access it ? how do we measure it ? how do we test it ? how do you determine what is and isn ' t part of the " spiritual realm ? you will have to show that such a thing exists before i can debate with you about it .  see how we don ' t agree on the basic premises of the debate ? it ' s not a disagreement , it ' s a misunderstanding , on your part .  oooh , edgy . i don ' t coddle delusions . you can piss of with your snark and get off your high horse if you want to actually talk about this stuff .  but . i can argue that religion is an evolved mechanism for time binding moral and ethical meta  narratives that has aided people in learning how to interact with each other and behave in social groups . that is not mutually exclusive from my definition .  in that way it has alleviated suffering for millions of people over thousands of years . again , not mutually exclusive from my point of view .  who is right ? i have evidence for my claims . you do not . there is no evidence for any such " supernatural realm " on which a lot of what you claim is based on , and so , i am right .  that you even refuse to see that more than one idea can be true at the same time means you have no idea what you are talking about . i never said that " more than one idea can ' t be true at the same time " , but it ' s not something i would disagree with . the earth can ' t be flat and an oblate spheroid at the same time . the sun can ' t orbit the earth , and the earth orbit the sun at the same time . fusing hydrogen atoms together can ' t produce helium and beryllium . it looks like you do not know what you are talking about when it comes to physics . i can point you to some reading material if you ' d like to learn more , but i ' m not going to give you a physics lesson here on reddit .  the real answer , for people who think instead of just blurt out declarative statements based solely on their own opinion assumed to be objective truth you condescending tone isn ' t welcome . if you ' re going to talk to me like that , you can fuck off and scream your nonsense in to the void , or go over to  flatearth where they welcome conspiracy theories .  is that the debate cannot have a winner because   the two parties do not agree on terms , like what " good " means . you . never tried to establish what " good " was . nothing in your comment talks about goodness . you talk about some spiritual realm , and then make some bogus statements about physics , which leads me to believe you are not arguing in good faith and just want to push your narrative . i ' m perfectly fine if the debate does not have a " winner . we aren ' t on stage in front of an audience , and i would venture to guess very few people will even read these comments . that your goal is to " win " and not to understand , again tells me you are arguing in bad faith , with no intention of learning anything .  we have almost no detailed records of events from digit  of the time period debated . detailed records are not the only evidence from which we can derive facts .  essentially this debate is a farce for hanging your confirmation bias on pot , meet kettle . the same applies to you , bud .

16. i didn ' t imply that , you inferred that very incorrectly i might add . all i said was they matter , and you twisted my statement around to make it something it ' s not . you really don ' t know how mental illness works , do you ? tell a suicidal person to just buck up and see what happens . most likely , it ' s not gonna do a damn thing for them .

17. reddit won ' t recognise misandry simply because of the joking in regards to men ' s struggle . everyone believes the world is actually run by a patriarchy , and that men cannot be discriminated against due to that . it ' s a horrible concept honestly . dating is a dangerous game . that ' s where half of men ' s problems actually happen . the moment you sign your name on that marriage certificate , she owns you . forget her taking half your stuff , she can take all of it and you won ' t get anything in return . the worst part of marriage is that your own wife can screw you over before you even divorce . there ' s countless cases of men who are literally forced to raise other men ' s kids . even if they prove she cheated , they are the ones who get punished since it ' s " in the child ' s best interest " you would think a child needn ' t be raised by a psychopath , but such is life . the creepiest thing ever on the subject is that marriage isn ' t necessary to break a man . you sleep with the wrong girl and you ' re done . you risk not only basic stds , but possible pregnancy and even rape charges . some men have reported total strangers claiming against them . that just sounds like next  level sexism . if men want to really get back at these feminist outliers , they needn ' t be so radical in their own right . war is won not by attacking the other party , but simply by showing them to the world . expose the lies they make up and the ridiculous beliefs they hold , rather than becoming the thing you ' re fighting . if you really think you ' re incel , clean yourself up and be a human being , because you ' re probably wrong . if you want to be a sweaty neckbeard and complain about women , you ' re still pretty much in the same boat , and ceetainly not better . if you want to go your own way , stop trying to bring others down and build yourself up . if you want to make a change for the betterment of not only men , but people in general , get up and do something about it . the feminists go at it nonstop and are now making up problems just go remain relevant . all men have to do is explain to the world that their problems are real and must be fixed .

18. my my , you do a fine job of " discussing . you screech some hate , you lie and insult me . you sound like every other fox  addled right wing fascist the question is , if you live up to the stereotype , then why shouldn ' t i think badly of you ?
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

19. i see your point . i think it is safe to say that for the most part " they don ' t even know any better . ' they ' meaning everyone  rich , poor , middle .
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

20. wait . i never which side someone is on . please tell me if you are stupid or have common sense ?
