17. to justify spending the money i make , i ask myself " why the hell do you work so hard " it ' s to spend my money they way i want . why do you work so hard to give someone else a comfy life ? they didn ' t take your tests or experience your stress . you have no obligation to pay for someone else just because you make more . also , you ' re not her ex . you ' re you . be you , don ' t try to be them , they split for a reason . to answer your question , i say don ' t compare yourself to someone ' s ex . you can either feel guilty , or you can go broke .
   (ID: a93c4b4e04523abdf134a40204e81619d6e659ef)

18. because the heat of the sun , and the amount of water and salt and all the time that it ' s been there . there is more water and more area affected by that than in your glass of water . although maybe it ' s an interesting experiment if you put lot of salt in a small container , you heat it up and when you ' re gonna smell it , you cover you head and the container with a towel . if you try it , let me know what happens .
