1. nta but you might regret missing out on that special time with your loved ones later on in the future when it may not be possible anymore  and avoiding a chewing noise might not feel worth it .

2. pretty much all the time but it quickly turns to dysphoria and depression . i tend to find its more about who they are , how they carry themselves , what they wear , especially if its something i can identify with , rather then whether i feel there pretty .

4. fucking up happens . its okay  if you learn something from it . why not try drawing on yourself instead any time you feel like that ? keep drawing even if it takes up a whole leg or arm . i recommend crayola .
