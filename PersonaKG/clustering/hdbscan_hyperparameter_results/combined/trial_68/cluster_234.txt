2. in all seriousness , like the most heartwrenching thing i could find at the moment . usually its anime cause they take some investing . in the worst part i watched how to train your dragon many times cause that one scene broke me , especially after such a heartwarming moment . for anime i recommend clannad then clannad  afterstory , that shit will break you .

6. because i felt like my body failed , or was broken , especially since i already had one child , so of course i should be able to have another . so somehow that made me responsible . grief is a hell of a thing .
