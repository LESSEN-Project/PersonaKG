Total from this dataset: 3

1. for me anyway , it ' s the expressions of some of the characters that are giving me that vibe . like the guy in the lower right looks a bit like the devil from something ricked to me , and the busyness of the piece overall .

2. if your boss thinks like this , you arent working at the right job . find a different industry

3. well they ' re not . it ' s not like they kill or anything . terrorists and mental health issues kill , and i guarantee that any mass shooting would have the same number of fatalities , if not more , if it was carried out with a knife . gotta protect our guns above all else ! serious question  on this sub , surely we assume everything ends with  s by default right ?
