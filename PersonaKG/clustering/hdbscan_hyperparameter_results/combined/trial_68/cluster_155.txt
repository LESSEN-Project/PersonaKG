3. i can answer this despite being an english speaker . it ' s because you haven ' t been taught that cuss words in other languages are just as bad . we never snuck around our parents to say " mierda " , unless of course you ' re spanish , so yeah . it ' s just that it wasn ' t drilled into your head like it is with your own version of the word . like americans using bollocks

6. so he is name  calling and spreading gossip ? that tells you a lot about the person he is . it doesn ' t say anything about you . just be honest about what happened .

7. there is a kid in my school who is like this , except he singles me out for food and if i say no he tries to just take it from me .
   (ID: 01d091dafa86b9d15d91404a1a02a0fc98011e8c)

8. i wouldn ' t say they are not skilled at anything , that will give them a reason to argue with you cuz they are skilled at a couple of things  camping and survival . but they seem to forget that pubg is also a shooter not just a br so in my opinion they are trash .
