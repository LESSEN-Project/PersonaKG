2. yeah it ' s annoying but over time it does get better . it will always be there but you get used to it . i don ' t worry about it much nowadays . if i ever get a flare up or more pain than usual i do the exercises over a week or two and it settles down again .

4. my mom says ,  it  s because you  re on that game all the time .  while that  s partially a factor , i  m on the game so i don  t go into mental breakdowns every night

5. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .
