1. look up ygopro  devpro online and download it . it is a virtual version of the game , and i believe the percy client has an ai mode that you can test decks against . then i would lurk around the sub a little to see what people are playing , pick something that piques your interest , and start from there . warning  cardboard crack is an expensive and addicting habit , and devpro has cost me a fair bit of sleep after discovering it

3. depends how urgently you need an extra merge for scoring purposes . if this gets you over some arena tier threshold or makes it a lot easier , i ' d say merge . but as you said ,  digit merge doesn ' t do much in itself so i ' d say fodder her if you really want to do that build .

4. i think the strongest card you have is beelze , if you wanted to build a twilight deck around him you could pick up some lightsworn cards in conjunction with plague spreader zombie . maybe google " twilight deck " for some ideas .
