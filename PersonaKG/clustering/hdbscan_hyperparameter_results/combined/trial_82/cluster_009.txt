1. maybe it ' s just me but i don ' t think i ' ve ever really been around people who really care that much about how others get their rocks off , and i ' ve lived in three different countries all over the world . sure , people might crack a joke or tease someone for it , but i don ' t think anyone really cares any more than they would if they found out about any other fetish . it ' s simply a non  issue . that ' s why the parades  culture thing feels so bizarre to me . it ' s as if they are deliberately attracting attention and criticism by shouting about something that the general public couldn ' t care less about .
