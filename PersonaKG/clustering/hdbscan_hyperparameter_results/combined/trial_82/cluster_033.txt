1. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .

3. in defence of adventure time , i have never seen this orange thing , i feel you miss the point . have you ever seen young kids play ? they are random as fuck . get one to tell you a story and they will tell you about a girl whose best friend is a giraffe and they go on a voyage to buy a dress but they meet a witch who turns the dress into a wolf so they have to go to the underwater cave to get a special sewing machine . in this respect i cannot see that it ' s that far off the target audience . sadly like the fan boys hanging on to the super hero characters of their youth cartoon network has no obligation to keep things relevant to a market that is technically no longer their target . every time the selection of cartoons change i get pissed about it . but then in time i learn to see what ' s good in pretty much all of them

4. you can  t hate on under the bridge or dani california . you just can  t . also  any true music fan knows that they peaked in the 80s .  what a fucking douchey thing to say

5. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show

6. no mans sky always were a good game . you suckers just say it is  was bad because the creator overhyped it and lied about some features . blame the creator . not . the . creation . thats not just about nms , its about every fucking thing  your wife died giving birth to your child ? blame yourself for making her pregnant or dont blame anyone thats just one example . and also the game became really good after those updates . fuck you . haters gonna hate .  digit

7. that wasn  t me who said that lol . i played the shit out of the first destiny . every dlc , did every raid , all of it . the game is absolute shit . i understand that that  s my opinion , but i truly do not get how people like that game . didn  t even waste my time buying the second one . so disappointing that bungie abandoned halo for this garbage
