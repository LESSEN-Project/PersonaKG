1. depends on your comfort level with them . if you two can casually have conversations about anything just bring up the fact you have feelings

2. you gotta get out , this is the tip of the iceburg . if you want a red flag this is a huge one . as a matter of self preservation you get the hell out . been there it does not get better with time . don ' t be a schmuck

3. you ' re welcome . you know what you need to do . i ' m sorry , i know it sucks , but you can ' t change people . in the long run you will feel better without him . happy birthday !

4. it does take a lot of courage , but you have it in you . otherwise you wouldn ' t have made this post ! just know you ' re not alone . there ' s a whole community here that supports you . here ' s maybe an odd idea  instead of only looking at body types that you would want for yourself , try checking out all sorts of people with different body types . big , little , thick , thin . don ' t judge , just accept them for what and who they are . then after a time , try to find little things you appreciate in each one . maybe it ' ll help broaden your horizons a little , instead of being so focused on what you covet right now .

5. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

6. i don ' t really feel like he holds me back , but my life isn ' t the way i want it to be living with him . i ' m gonna say the same shit everyone else says , i do love him and i enjoy being with him . but lately it doesn ' t feel the same . he ' s a good person but i feel like i don ' t really like him anymore . maybe it ' s my mindset but i feel like we don ' t have fun or enjoy each other ' s company . but if i leave i know i ' ll miss him and be sad . i ' m not going to go jump on another guys dick .

7. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers

8. i find people who have a drinking problem love to judge those who don ' t . i was told once that i ' m only fun when i drink by someone i mostly saw through the bottom of a wine glass , so i stopped drinking and hanging around that person . don ' t allow anyone to cross your boundaries , it ' s not worth it even a little . best of luck !

9. the best advice i can give to you is to either talk to your friend , let them know how you feel and give them the chance to become aware that their behavior is bothering you , or do nothing and slowly back away from the friendship . i am in a similar boat myself . as friends we should be able to voice our opinions and concerns within our friendships and not worry that the other will become defensive or misinterpret our motivations , but sometimes it just doesn ' t work that way because of bias or prejudice or just plain ol ' human error and that ' s when it ' s time to step back . good luck !

10. you don ' t have to feel guilty about it during the day either . if you don ' t enjoy being around people you ' re probably just an introvert , and that isn ' t something to feel guilty about . it ' s just an aspect of your personality , the same way loving being with people is part of an extrovert ' s personality .

11. bad break up ? if so you got to let it go . if not , then go outside and explore somewhere where people are accepting , like a sports bar or social clubs or something where you can add to peoples conversations

12. she was too centered on me , for lack of a better articulation . not that she was clingy , but there was not enough " texture " in our relationship . perhaps someone who ' s experienced similar can say it more eloquently .

13. hum , talk to him and tell him how you feel , your fears , what you want and what you expect of the future with him , that you live him if you do . and ask him if he ' s willing to be there and take the compromise with you to make it work . depending on the answer just do what it ' s best for you and the baby . it ' s better to leave on time than stay and get more hurt . good luck !

14. it ' s a big mix of stuff but time is just one component . youtube is full of really socially intelligent folks that know how to help you navigate heartbreak . finding the right advice along with finding healthy distractions is key . you have to acknowledge your feelings , while at the same time giving yourself liberty to feel different emotions through other activities and diversion . you have to delve into healing while at other times work on suppressing certain emotions since they are not all constructive and sometimes even accurate . stay social . don ' t be afraid to hook with folks . i personally recommend tripping on molly , mushrooms or lsd to create an experience that could heighten your sense of how beautiful consciousness is . it sucks to say , but pain is a very helpful tool for progress . some people use it masochistically to self sabotage and wallow in a cycle of victimhood , self pity and depression . you could instead use pain to turn around and help other people , perhaps hold yourself to higher standards in important ways and above all use this opportunity to learn more about yourself and how to become the best friend to yourself you could possibly be .

15. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .

16. i don ' t think this is lying . i think this is something personal to you that you didn ' t feel like sharing , and that is ok because it is no one else ' s business . if you wish to tell them in the future you can say you didn ' t want to tell them before . but you don ' t need to explain yourself , like i said it ' s your business . not a lie .

17. just so i understand  you  re gay but have a girlfriend and this isn  t enough to keep up your charade . you need to make the guys you hang out with jealous by making this girl dress to show off her body . then you  re going to introduce this girl to your family and want her to dress like this again for them . what  s the plan here ? you seem like you don  t know what you want . in another thread , you say you  re coming out to your mother because you don  t have any money . you  re all over the place . any way you could just be your authentic self ? or if you  re going to remain closeted to some in your family , why march this girl around having her partake in your lie ? you could just be single .

18. well , it ' s that when it ' s just me and her , i don ' t know what to talk to her about , and it ' s silence between us . it ' s not that i have feelings for her , it ' s just that i feel like we need to get closer as friends . it is mainly advice . i don ' t really feel socially accepted

19. oh it is several things . the first thing you do is completely cut off all of the energy vampires in your life . try to figure out if somebody is making you feel bad . maybe they aren ' t trying to . that being said , many people are subtly abusive and you might not know that what you are feeling is not you , it is somebody else ' s toxic emotions that they have projected on to you . learn about adaptogenic herbs and supplements and start an adaptogenic stack . loneliness sometimes is just stress , fatigue or a chemical imbalance . i recommend , n acetyl l tyrosine rhodiola rosea , ashwagandha  ksm  digit , tumeric  curcuminoid with pipeline , magnesium citrate , fish oil and vinpocitine . make sure you are listening to positive people , positive music , positive messages and are engaged in plenty of self affirmation . then you want to reach out to people . being lonely means that you have to project onto others what you wish to receive so you have to give the right people your time , love and attention . loneliness sometimes isn ' t helped by being around more people even though i recommend this but is more ameliorated by improving your relationship with yourself . maybe you need to be a better friend to yourself ? do you think you should read more ? maybe exercise  jog  lift more ? do you think you should listen to more music or get out more ? do you need to clean or decorate your apartment ? do an all the above approach and remember that you can always give yourself permission to feel loved and cared for without a material manifestation to validate it ! often people feel warmth , generosity , compassion and admiration first , and then the outside world reflects that feeling . try to exercise your mind with meditation and being to dim certain thoughts and emotions . if you can fake happiness , after a while it becomes a muscle that builds over time .

20. being single does suck . i ' ve been single my entire life m16 . i usually cope by hanging out with friends . i know i ain ' t the best looking , nor am i fit . but yeah . i get how you feel . life does suck that way . whenever i feel down about being alone , i usually think " i ' ll find that person eventually " some day you will . just continue doing what you like , and hang out with your friends
