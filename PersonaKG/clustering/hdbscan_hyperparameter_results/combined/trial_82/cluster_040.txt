1. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

2. i see what you mean . i ' ve never played reach ' s multiplayer so i can ' t say much about the problems you mentioned , though they do seem pretty bad . personally my main draws were more from the single player modes , especially campaign . i thought the alien invasion story was actually quite good , since it showed how massive and powerful the covenant was , and how ill  equipped the humans really were to fight them . it was definitely more grounded and military  based than the other games , but i personally liked that sense of desperation and scale the setting gave off .
