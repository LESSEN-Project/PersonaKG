1. my area put up a stink about this because they put in an old time clock that barely works . we all manage to get clocked in before 5am but it ' s tough some days when it ' s malfunctioning . the supervisor has been nice enough to forgive a tardy so long that you were in line at digit  digit .

2. anywhere except where op works . i didn ' t even get a reprimand . the guy didn ' t ask to see any sort of supervisor . sounds like i was being rude , i know , but in my line of work , you can give as well as you get . its sort of the best version of customer service ever .

3. holy fuck me ! that ' s awful , i feel bad for your uncle ' s friend . , that ' s why i feel so bad for truckers , people are assholes because they think they are faster and can get away . what they forget is that the trucks are way bigger and will crush them like a bug , how did your he handle it after ? i can ' t imagine even though in a way the guy deserved it for being an ass , it still had to affect the driver . edit  spelling
