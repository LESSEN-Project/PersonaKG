1. the human capability of it being reactable is irrelevant as this works for me like a good digit  of the time . not to mention the tons of mix  ups you can use to feed into thoes lights , mid  combo

2. i play online vs exclusively . i ' m not saying this to piss you off , but i can poke check and stick lift all day long and hardly ever get a penalty . my poke checking could arguably be considered poke spamming i do it so much . it ' s all about proper positioning and timing for those poke checks , and never poke from behind . as far as stick lifts , they work very well during puck battles , especially along the boards . if your opponent gets possession , lift that shit right away you have to be fast and it ' ll almost always come loose and back to you . i ' m not saying it ' s perfect far from it , but if you ' re getting penalties on poke checks and stick lifts either your timing or positioning is off . go ahead and downvote me if you want , but i hardly ever get penalties for pokes and lifts . almost all my penalties are checks into the boards that ea will randomly call boarding or charging .

3. if you watch some higher level play like diamond  masters they do some crazy long combos . once you get your windows the other guy better watch out becasue you can digit to digit them in a digit second combo string .

4. i remember this being constantly offered when i was playing far cry . what does it do exactly ?

5. in watching my replays over this past year i ' ve noticed that for some reason a good amount of people seem to only press one button per input . i laugh at those people . i laugh at them because only an insane person would put even an ounce of faith in this game when it comes to online connections . if you ' re doing locals than you ' re gonna have to play like that or at least you ' d find some benefit to it . but online you ' re not only fighting your opponent but you ' re also fighting the connection . at any moment some frames could drop and completely cancel out your single button press . at the very least you should double tap or triple tap everything you ' re doing . triple may be too much in some situations on some characters but double tapping seems to be pretty solid on everyone in this game aside from the few digit hit combos in this game but you won ' t even be able to do those reliably online even if your execution is perfect anyway . tl  dr mashing  bad , just relax , it ' s just a game . the more knowledge you have the more confident you can be in your play . however , if you ' re playing anything other than at your locals , double tap that shit . don ' t trust this games online connection with your lp . it will leave you a rookie for the rest of your life .
