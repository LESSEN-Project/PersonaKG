7. apparently " triggered my trap card " comes from the yu  gi  oh show thing that was popular back in middle school that means , from what i understand , is that the other person is getting " owned " because they set off a reaction of events that works against themselves . so i dont really understand this statement as i ' ve never watched yu  gi  oh but how i interpret the ops statement is that " if you sleep with a girl that used to be a guy then you ' ve given them the upper hand and got owned by them by validating their femininity " . or something like that . i ' m not saying i agree with them , i ' m just saying i think thats what they mean .

13. alright i  m gonna be brutally honest . quit lying and bullshitting to your self , and be you . i looked at your history and read this post idk what you did or what you want , but the biggest thing to success will be accepting everything and not lying to cope . afterwards it  s a easy path of going out of your comfort zone and changing lifestyles . if that  s not possible then you need to live so your happy . you can live in the wilderness in alaska alone for example if you hate humanity so much . personally i would love to do this but i still have other goals that require me around humanity
