1. i still say there is a difference between having a right and what is right . but let ' s assume for the sake of argument , that there is inconsistency in my logic . i can change my beliefs based on new information . i would therefore say that bodily autonomy is never greater than innocent life under any condition .

2. can you explain why this is so bad ? if i ' m paying 20k a year to go to school my classmates shouldn ' t make it my responsibility to make sure they don ' t kill themselves .

3. oh , i still say israel shouldn ' t . but you wanted a answer from the left so i gave you one . me being from the right doesn ' t mean i ' m unable to give a left answer .

4. that ' s a really long winded way of missing the point entirely . it was digit words . you quoted it , you should know . if you think that ' s " long winded " then you ' re clearly not very good at reading . you managed to cram bias and agenda in there within the space of digit words as well . it ' s pretty clear where your priorities lie for all to see  in disregarding opinions you don ' t like by labelling them and disregarding them without being able to provide evidence against them , or even describe what they are . please tell me how how this is " bias and agenda " . let ' s make this clear  everyone should be treated equally . that means if someone in a wheelchair flags down a bus , and that space is already in use , they have to wait for the next bus , just like the rest of us . equality for all , not special treatment for some .

5. i was thinking something similar . it was difficult to see the way a lot of the americans think . it was also hard to not respond to any of them . what would be the point . my words won ' t change the way they think .

6. in objective reality , herding children into groups of thirty and having them close their eyes while they pretend to psychically communicate with a deity , does not do anything at all to prevent gun violence . it doesn ' t really do anything at all , period . it ' s pure political posturing and religious exploitation of children . i completely agree with this .  also in objective reality , instituting reasonable , nuanced , and tested gun control policies is strongly associated with reduced firearm  based violence , homicide , and suicide . these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . this statement is technically true , but misleading . let me quote relevant part of scott alexander ' s essay   " gun violence " is the wrong category to use here .   suppose that you went to your doctor and said " i keep having headaches in my bed at night "   your doctor says " you should sleep on the couch .   you ask your doctor " and that will solve my problem of having headaches "   your doctor says " no , it will solve your problem of having headaches in your bed "   this is a bad solution , because although the problem was phrased as " i have headaches in my bed " , the real problem is just headaches . if we get rid of bed headaches at the cost of causing exactly the same number of couch headaches , that ' s completely useless .   " gun violence " is a category much like " bed headaches . some criminologists very reasonably propose a " substitution effect "  that is , if someone wants to commit murder , they ' ll use the most convenient weapon they can get your hands on . if that weapon gets banned , they will substitute the next most convenient weapon , and so on , rather than just deciding not to commit any more murders .   so suppose there were digit , digit gun deaths in the united states . the government bans guns , it is miraculously successful , and gun deaths go down to zero . sadly , by a total coincidence there are also digit , digit more knife deaths .   this would not be a good outcome , but if we ' re looking at " gun violence " , we could hail it as a victory  " gun control reduced gun violence levels to zero ! our plan has worked ! hooray "   so if we actually want to look at effectiveness of policies , we need to be measuring something else , like the total homicide rate . another wordy essay from scott alexander in which he spends a lot of time analyzing studies of gun control efficacy and comes to the conclusion that australia  style gun control , if implemented in the us , will probably , maybe , tentatively , reduce deaths somewhat . maybe .  these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . i am not a usa citizen and second amendment is not relevant to me , actually .  when you consider objective reality , there is no argument . there is no debate , except over the details of the gun control legislation that we ' re going to enact . if scott alexander didn ' t remember to consider objective reality , then his advice isn ' t worth consideration . frankly , scott alexander ' s analysis is much more nuanced than " there is no argument " claim . there clearly is an argument , and pretending otherwise is delusional . if you have specific rebuttals of points made in the essay , i want to read them . claiming someone does not consider objective reality does not constitute a proper argument , though .   x200b
