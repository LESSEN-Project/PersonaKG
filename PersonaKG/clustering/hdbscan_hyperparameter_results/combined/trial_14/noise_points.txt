   (ID: 44477e54e9e15675b9ad5c3be02b0440724c674b)

8. my opinion , go out more . not to a bar or club more like a social event at the park find someone whose doing something similar to something you feel passionate about . ex girl jogging in the park go join her keep her company ask like how long have you been jogging here ? then improvise from there obviously ask her for her name just dont make it the first question so you seem interested at her hobby aswell as herself . next try to get into the friend area yes i know you don ' t want to be here but this stage is where youll learn the most truthful information about her . next start sharing life moments you wouldnt tell most people just think before you say it so it doesn ' t sound like extra baggage for the person . eventually youll know when to ask her on a date
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

9. i hate to ask , but i feel i have too . at what point in your moms illness did you realize the fight was over ? or did you never come to that point ? i ask because i ' m dealing with some stuff and would really like to know . when do i stop " pretending " and start preparing for the inevitable . i ' m at a loss .

10. i do all of that with my female friends when it ' s appropriate , but never when i have a girlfriend , or if they have a boyfriend . the fact that he is probably means he has feelings for you .

11. i watch the zombies with binoculars from my crow ' s nest at the top of my compound on the outskirts of my town . occasionally i ' ll see a car drive by , with a zombie or two lagging behind , moving as fast as they can to chase it . i have headshot several with my . digit rifle . the first time i did it i expected them to swarm toward the sound . but no , even the closest zombies seemed to look , acknowledge my presence , then shamble away . a part of me wondered if it was me , my gun or my compound scaring them off . i wouldn ' t really mind if they came . i have a huge fence , three towers connected by my underground home and a recently installed minefield clearly marked but luckily zombies can ' t read signs . i have a water purifier , solar panels and waste disposal , as well as medical supplies . i have enough food and ammo to last digit years . it is lonely . but even when people shake on my gate to let them in i don ' t open it . the virus is undetectable and passes through saliva . i have been quarantined here since the first recorded case in brazil . i have prepared myself totally for this but now the zombies seem to be ignoring me . that ' s fine though , it ' s a good problem to have . judging by what i hear from people over cb radio , humans are the ones i need to worry about .

12. she ' s only snored while i was conscious at least every few months before , last few weeks have been rough . i just sleep on the couch if it becomes a big issue . that sounds rough i guess , but i actually sleep at least as well if not better on the couch than in bed . i made sure to talk to her about it and make sure she knew there were no hard feelings and it was just a practical matter . i never start out there , and make a point to spend time talking to her and the bump before she goes to sleep every night , we just agreed i can bail if i need to .

   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

14. " sir . " i try to interject but the old bearded man keeps shouting . " i can ' t find a damn thing in this place ! " his face has turned a boiling red , in contrast with his milky white eyes . steam shoots from his ears . " sir ! you ' re looking in the wrong cupboard ! " i shout , " sit down ! let me help you ! " " speak up , boy , i can barely hear you . " he grumbles , " sit down ? oh fine . " i pull up a chair and he settles down into it . " teacup ! " he shouts , and i hurry to retrieve one . i place it in his left hand and he points his right finger at it . a stream of boiling water pours from the tip of his finger like the spout of a teapot . i hand him a tea bag . " so what were you looking for , sir ? " " ahh . just an old book . what ' s the point anyway ? i can ' t even read the thing . can you read ancient greek ? " i admit that i can ' t and avoid mentioning that we are in the kitchen , not the library . i also don ' t know my way around very well , so i ' m a bit relieved . the building we are in is not a conventional home . it is a grand , curling spire dozens of stories high . this would be a problem for the old man if he were not able to float , up or down , straight through the center of the spiral staircase , easily arriving at a floor usually the wrong one much faster than i can climb the steps . " why did you need the book , sir ? " i ask , " what are we doing today ? " " ah the village by the river has a bridge troll they need taken care of . the messengers are on their way here now . " i know better than to ask how he knows this . he continues , " i remember the spell anyway . no one else can be bothered to learn the stupid things . " or no one has the ability . the old man , while grumpy and difficult , is also the greatest wizard alive . he is known as the wizard with no name although he hates the title , assuring me he does have a name . he also says his name is probably unpronounceable for me and might make my heart stop beating . i have been his assistant for digit weeks , in exchange only for room and board . i am an orphan and this is the only apprenticeship i can find , although i know i have been treated much better in town since becoming associated with the wizard . just then , i hear the loud knocker at the front door bang through the tower . " well ? " the old wizard says , " get a move on . " i hustle down the hundreds of steps , watch the wizard float down past me , and arrive at the door as he waves his hand and it slowly opens . two horsemen stand outside with four horses , wearing the light armor of provincial soldiers . the messengers jump a bit then take a step forward . " great wizard ! " one begins , " we have traveled fifty miles to retrieve you ! our town is under attack . " " bridge troll ! " the wizard loudly interrupts . " it ' s just a damn bridge troll and you fools can ' t simply kill the thing . but fine , i ' ll deal with your troll in exchange for a small yearly tithe . " the messengers cringe , knowing how poor their town is , but the wizard doesn ' t see the reaction and they agree on a portion of the harvest for the payment . the wizard smiles , " good ! now that payment is settled , where are your horses ? i know i ' ve been smelling some . " i lead the wizard to a horse and he floats onto it while the soldiers gape . i mount one beside him . " take your time getting back , " he says to them , " it should all be cleared up by then . " we trot off but all movement by the horse seems uncomfortable to the wizard . strangely he nudges his horse to go faster and faster and i urge mine to match him . as we ride the horses seem to bounce less and less . one lets out a loud whinny and i look down to see that their hooves are floating above the surface of the ground . the horses seem to know where they ' re going because at this point the wizard is feeling around in his beard for fuzz or food . we arrive in the town in two hours , much faster than the eight hours the fifty miles would normally take . as soon as we near the perimeter i hear the sound of fire and screams . we slow our horses and trot forward until the troll comes into view . it is a monstrous beast , taller than rooftops , grabbing women and children where it can while the men fight to hold it back and secure the town ' s population in the large central church . " how big is it ? " the wizard asks . " about digit feet tall ? " i guess . he chuckles , " they ' ve been procrastinating , huh ? alright bring me to it ? " " bring you . to it ? " i ask hesitantly . " don ' t make me repeat myself boy . how else am i supposed to handle it ? " i shudder then grab his horse ' s lead . i walk our horses through the town . the soldiers shout at us to get back as we pass their perimeter and we ignore them . eighty yards away the troll notices us . " he saw us , " i say , " straight ahead . " " good , " the wizard smiles . he cracks his long fingers . suddenly , a flurry of words burst out of his mouth . in it , i hear what seem to be thousands of unique sounds adding up to dozens of languages . i hear a goat ' s bleat , snake ' s hiss and baby ' s laugh . i hear words that sound as powerful as crashing waves and silences as deep as the moment before dawn . my vision shrinks into a black tunnel until suddenly the words stop . i see the bridge troll frozen in place . it slowly falls with a huge crash like a massive tree . " good , " the old wizard grins , " now show me to the food . i ' m hungry . "

   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

18. the staring . of all the things i found difficult over there , staring was one of the worst . you might think that being taught not to stare at funny  looking people is common for children around the world . nope . and what do you do when it ' s a parent and their child , staring and pointing together , like they ' re watching an orangutan at a zoo ?

19. for one , it  s hosted on his website if you google mother  s against maddox . anecdotally , it  s been proven that he  s not above impersonating women to try and get people fired , it  s not a stretch to think that he  d do the same to create a narrative and get more publicity and traffic . whatever it takes to beat website juggernauts like pepsi and mcdonald  s i guess .
