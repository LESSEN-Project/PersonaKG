1. having ts on in the back ground shouldn ' t affect the way you play . if it ' s too much trouble , then perhaps a different alliance  corp would be better for you ? fly safe .

4. being able to see through water clearly , so when you stick your head in the ocean , you can see everything on the ocean floor and everything around you . you could find a lot of lost wallets that way , and also not be as spooked by sharks

7. the best frozen pizza is the one that gets you laid . here ' s my story  i was wandering through wal  mart when i came across a rather attractive female . as we passed , i shot her a smile and noticed a frozen pizza in her cart . thinking quickly , i made my way to the frozen pizza section and grabbed a freschetta pizza . i made my way over the sharpie markers , opened a pack , and wrote my name and phone number on the pizza box . i then tracked her down , told her freschetta was a better pizza and handed her the box with my digits on it . two days later she calls and invites me in for pizza . although we never had any pizza , i did get immediately introduced to her bedroom . freshchetta gets the ladies wetter .

8. perhaps he should prove his dedication to you by demonstrating his willingness to service another man . would an explicit video if him being used in every way by another man get your juices flowing ? maybe more than one man ? maybe he can recruit a male sub for you , and the two of them can perform on skype for your pleasure .

9. same here . my study of religion led me to conclude they were all manmade . the way that i see it we all have certain drives for meaning , for purpose , for morals and certain emotional needs getting over the fear of death , wanting to reconnect with dead loved ones , wanting a sense of meaning in life , etc . and religions each navigate a way in which they can fulfill these human desires . and i think that the religions out there today are still in existence because partially they tended to fulfill these the best .

18. ok . though a subreddit is only as strong as its hallowed parameters , and is only as worthy as its erudite membership , one still seeks that spark of humanity , that intangible whisp of a soul existing beneath the unyielding tradition of syntactical perfection . tragically , one would be on a fool ' s mission , and would be reminded of his folly in a manner most brusque . in a way , such bitter truth is its own reward , sharpening the rose  tinted myopia of the naive optomist so that he is able to alter his path before it leads him off the precipice .
   (ID: 5b02e2fd29e743c4c80de2b0919a03d95400c23a)

19. i was thinking something similar . it was difficult to see the way a lot of the americans think . it was also hard to not respond to any of them . what would be the point . my words won ' t change the way they think .
