3. we saw a definite and dramatic shift in behavior in our first child just after a vaccination day , starting with 105f fever . what we have done with our kids since then is not to stop vaccinating , but to attenuate the schedule so that they are not getting many vaccines in one day and shocking their system . also when vaccines can be obtained individually as opposed to a combination shot , we go that route . our pediatrician is one of the best in the area and is totally on board . we didn ' t have the same occurrence since that first event , but obviously that doesn ' t prove causality .
