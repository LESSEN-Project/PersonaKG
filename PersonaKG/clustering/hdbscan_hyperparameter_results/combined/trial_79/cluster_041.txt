--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 19

1. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

2. i ' ve heard it helps to start cleaning up something small , and then grow from that . even if it ' s just putting a fork into a drawer , it ' s important to start somewhere .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

3. thank you for the response , i  ve been considering whether she  s really worth keeping around anyways . it  s just so hard to cut out someone who you  ve known your whole life .
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

4. most guys just go for it . if your super uneasy you can ask her first . i ' ve been asked before , it ' s not a total killer either . don ' t worry if it ' s not perfect !
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

5. my son and i have been talking about a lego harry potter night ! you ' ve just motivated us to make it happen this weekend !
   (ID: 1b15fd08311192b471933a314f66dc758a923c02)

6. always ask for a lawyer especially of you haven ' t done anything wrong . for example  cop  " where were you yesterday around 2pm ? you  " i was at walmart buying groceries " harmless right ? yea , until you find out there was a murder next door to walmart at digit  05pm and you ' ve just put yourself at the scene of a crime . congrats , by being cooperative , you ' ve just made yourself a suspect . and that ' s assuming the cop isn ' t just straight up lying to you in order to get you to say something incriminating .
   (ID: 8f7369c6ebb47df350fec663be46dfd8481ee2db)

7. answered just the way it was asked . mom ' s been on different kinds of shit for awhile . last i heard she picked up a meth habit since my brother is out of the house now . i ' ve been no contact with the family .
   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

8. here ' s another sv650 fan jumping in . bought my first sv650s after digit years of riding . best bike i ever owned in the " what a hoot to ride " category . i ' ve since had two more and an sv1000 which , while far more capable in most respects , just doesn ' t have the same just plain fun to ride character .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

9. what i personally am afraid of are the open statements that mail won ' t be integrated any more . i ' ve never been a heavy e  mailer , but found out about the integrated mail and feed client around version digit and began using it just for the sake of convenience . it has been just fine as an integrated client , but as a stand  alone one is a big joke compared to thunderbird , for example .
   (ID: 32520dc340c18ed101e3d5ea02b3a7bca25dcc29)

10. not that i ' ve ever heard , this is just bizarre . it could just be an excuse to leave faster , if they don ' t get along  he doesn ' t get along with your brother . sounds super weird .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

11. while watching this , it occurred to me that they had sold millions of records at the time , and they definitely had played those songs enough times to play them flawlessly , every time . you ever see a band that has sold millions of records get wasted and play poorly , especially a punk band ? from what i ' ve seen , more often than not muscle memory is quite real . i am a musician too , but i do play " simple " music  more often than not , if you played the same sets hundreds upon hundreds of times , you will at some point just be able to play it without thinking at all .
   (ID: 5c9dd67e95ee5403b2bd9a6848c017674d46396b)

12. you could ' ve just made it into multiple pannels , that would have made it easier to read
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

13. " not unconventional " doesn ' t make sense , and no it ' s not strange to wear plain clothes but it ' s just hard to believe that every single item of clothing you have ever bought is digit never had a logo , brand name or been designer of some sort and digit you ' ve never been asked by anyone you ' ve ever come in contact with where you have bought your clothes from .
   (ID: d45001f1fdd37cda488cfddffabec23e83ee7b7e)

14. i ' ve never tried to bust it as quick as i can tbh . there are times where i ' ve lost concentration and bust it earlier than i wanted , but as no orgasm was had i can just wipe off and keep going .
   (ID: 75ca79d6c5cfc50533ff56cde25edfb593ae8568)

15. i grew up on a pig farm . my chores when i was digit were harder work than any job that i  ve ever had as an adult . pig farms are highly sustainable because they can eat just about anything , including communists . if the shit were to hit the fan , that  s exactly what i  d feed them . this guy !
   (ID: afb309c0f8d875957ab1e2c406a762b6127668b6)

16. be me , digit year old mexi boy , scared and tired of what i ' ve just learned my body could do . ' twas noon and the wall seemed hot . so yeah a wall .
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

17. i try to do the accents from whatever tv show i ' m watching . i ' ve just watched true blood so i ' ve been mixing in the occasional deep south phrase now and then
   (ID: 5dc1e0203cb86a245c4ede5cb73923b295b1fdc8)

18. i  ve been engineering for years and it still happens every now and then . you just realize it faster . this is how you learn .
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

19. i ' ve noticed a couple people pulling more dps but for the most part hasnt made a huge stink . i play a prot warrior and i was expecting alot of change due to the rage nerf but im just as tanky as ever . just made me change the way i play to be more patient .
