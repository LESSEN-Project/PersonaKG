6. yeah , true . there are so many worse companies . just the first thing i thought of . it ' s great for talking to my friends and family all over the world as well as promoting myself , but i hate to see how people are addicted to it and over use it as well as whatever privacy stuff they violate .

9. seeing a lot of negative comments saying get help . guys , this is a game where you time and time again , without thought , shotgun blast mofos across the room . op was just descriptive and obviously has a unique play style . at some point we have all saved , committed crimes against humanity , then reloaded . to the op , optionally you can attempt to be a pickpocket expert and just take the gun maybe never actually have seen his inventory in that quest .

11. correct me if i ' m wrong , but i thought that this sub was for ads on reddit , not on outside sites . especially not a financial site talking about the financial success of a company . which is their job . i mean , just look at this page

12. it was a very rainy day and me and my 4th grader friends decided playing blind man ' s buff inside . we had a mad teacher who had dwarfism . i thought he was one of my friends and pushed him he pushed me back gently and laughed . i slapped him very hard and he just waited for me take off the blindfold and left without saying anything . after i move on to the middle high i saw him on my to school i almost saw him everyday till 8th grade this year i ' m going to university and his disappointed face still enters my dreams

14. be aware that if you ' re caught and you probably will be , no matter which way you go about it , the consequences may be a bit more severe than them just saying " no , you can ' t do that " . you may well be ejected from the park , barred for life , or possibly have security involved . the only way for you to do it and feign ignorance and possibly get away with it and i am not condoning this at all would be to try going through hogwarts express or the main entrance and , if caught and chances are you will be , saying that you thought the parks were the same . but , if you try this , you ' re a bit of an idiot , and even more of a complete git .

15. this is one of those people new to tf2 who thought they would like to share a video with u , so lower those pitchforks , or just a kid who wants karma , in that case , shower him in downvotes
   (ID: 5a485308ca6e36eb17d7b0fc321fcf7695f3af53)

16. my biggest cultural shock was how kids in my class treated teachers . i remember seeing a kid yell at a teacher , and i thought to myself , this kid is about to get it ! but no , the teacher didn  t do anything and just walked away . where i come from you would get a slap , suspended , and your ass kicked at home for disrespecting a teacher , wether you  re right or wrong . it  s the way you handle things .
