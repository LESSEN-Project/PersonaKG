1. the game is too big to die . with all those mods , you can even play just terraria for your entire life . maybe the hype might die and player base will be lower but i don  t think it will die .
   (ID: a0849f7d6d0829c8bb5f820aa9bf63584c7471df)

2. take this time to learn about you . what are your hobbies and interests ? trying learning something , anything and become knowledgeable in it . that will give you some topics of conversation and help you find friends maybe girls too as you enjoy those hobbies . those guys you ' re jealous of . they probably think they are losers too  they just hide it better . don ' t be so hard on yourself !
   (ID: 0254dc2f43007419c5c3fd1e155e6bf15fce137d)

   (ID: 782311f0352356940fd2c1e77bc3cfa9f74b06fa)

4. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

5. not being preachy but maybe look at potential partners other aspects mental  spiritual , lifestyle choices etc . and see if those are healthy  attractive . people can change but if you are dating someone in a rut , it will be ten times harder for them to better themselves once dating and that ' s the real ugly side of relationships . if you think you are shallow about appearances then you might be using it as an excuse to not address other flags from that person . unfortunately it is so easy to rate people based on image so it ' s just a constant effort to remind yourself .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

6. do you really think that " getting really big " is a problem ? seriously ? what , ya think you lift a few reps , go to sleep , and wake up the next day built like a gorilla ? like it ' s that freaking easy ? do you have any clue what it takes to generate mass ? it required dedicated , disciplined work , and strict dieting . it doesn ' t just fucking happen . what i ' m saying is don ' t fucking worry about " getting really big . you aren ' t going to have that problem if the level of knowledge you have is so low that you even ask such a ridiculously silly question in the first place . go to the gym , work as hard as you freaking can , and you will be absolutely happy with the results .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

8. the planet or just life on it ? i think it would be cool if we explored to other planets and earth became obsolete .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

9. i just don ' t see how you are allowing yourself to go through the torture of bible camp . maybe you don ' t think it so bad , but i cringe of the even thinking about being forced to go to a place where i ' m surrounded by people who have completely different ideologies as i .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

10. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

11. and if that small chance does happen . what are you going to do without a way to get help ? get yourself out ? what if you were just hiking in the forest and you find yourself lost , without a way home ? i don  t think the ability to pay taxes will help in that situation , imo .
   (ID: 93c3b3d523de0afd404d3bcb4acdf023866f9281)

12. you think a decade and a half of blacklisting , effectively destroying his ability to have a career and a prosperous life , is a just reactioon to what you classify as dumb mistakes ?

   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

14. lol what are you going to say ? just straight up ask  what are your views on feminism ?  you think a guy that wants to have sex with you is going to say  oh i hate women  ?
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)

20. look up " romantic bpd relationships . not saying this is what she has , and not trying to shame anyone with this diagnosis . i just think this may give you some insight and useful strategies you seem like a lovely , thoughtful person
