1. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .

2. but he ' s an addict and i believe he was molested by his mother as a kid . he has done some nice things for his kid . he always apologizes or at least does something to get on their goodside . and honestly i think he did the right thing by telling fiona that sean still used .

3. i think they have found their niche , and as long as it ' s profitable they will continue going down the direction they are going . to my knowledge the vast majority of the consoles they developed were weaker than their competitors , and that in itself has typically not been a major issue . the limitations of the system outside of power i . e n64 not using discs , did lead to some limitations .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

4. it ' s pretty well established that jesus did exist , i don ' t think that ' s exactly the point op is trying to make .
   (ID: 0fbaeef283f7b2090f763028c227ed73724f3e6c)

   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

6. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .

7. fallout digit super mutants . they think that they can roam the dc area and kill , capture , torture or   rape   make them more mutants mean they are the ' master race ' " oooh i am stronger than you so i can kill you ooh . how the hell did those assholes get out of digit and roam all the way to dc anyway ?

9. dude you are my savior thank you soo much . last two questions and i think we ' re done . where is hide ? last i saw he was working for the ccg as a news boy or something ? also why did furuta kill ghouls and ccg operatives ? is that why people think he ' s a spy ?

10. wow this was super interesting , you  re a good storyteller ! i don  t think you did anything wrong considering you were having your own experience and you couldn  t possibly read her mind if she was expecting more to come out of it but you didn  t do anything out of the ordinary . . in the meantime , don  t go into her restaurant until this is resolved
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

11. ok so how did those people kill them if they did not use a gun ? nobody ever tells me that part . i dont really care how because i kinda think dying by anothers hand is the issue . so to balance yourself before your audience could you please include the overall death rates ? its a sanity thing for me at this point . thanks .
   (ID: 457d7d37e1181cc932693cd4220e6fbfd564a75d)

12. thanks for the info ! how did you find it in comparison to google maps api ? i read up it  s more simple to use and more cost effective . are there any other reasons besides maybe besides unawareness you think is preventing devs from adopting it for their websites ?
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

13. i think they did a reality show about that . a homeless man was given a lot of money . can ' t remember how much , but apparently he didn ' t really use it well . but we should try again and again .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

14. it may be a little unclear now that i think about it , but if you look at the timecodes , i also won the first lost run i did ever .
   (ID: c9b1e924c86788c982ec59df3d5704354a2a4ae1)

15. they shook your hand and smiled at you because their religion instructs them to do so . if you gave a neighborhood party and a guy from down the street came and did something disruptive , i think you would consider it disrespectful in the same way people here think you were being disrespectful . i ' m finding it hard to believe you are actually this dense .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

16. i think you did , unless you gave me the wrong info haha
   (ID: 3cc393500aaac3a2ee1cd96955cee486bb062a46)

17. lmao seriously tho what did she think was gonna happen how could that possibly ever go good for her .
   (ID: 3e906e06d59fb5c2993270f0b4efed5b9ab122f7)

18. right ? i was so glad they played maud gone at that show , though i preferred their version at shaky knees the most . what did you think of the new stuff ?
   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

19. i think they get an undeserved free pass from the us . i get the holocaust . i understand the pain . to me it  s no different than how i look at slavery and reparations . i didn  t do it nor did my ancestors . suck it up and take care of your own shit . it  s not my doing or my problem .
