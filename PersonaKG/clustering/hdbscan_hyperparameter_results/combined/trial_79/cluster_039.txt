2. this is a very unpopular opinion and for good reason . people do play video games to escape reality , like you might eat tasty foods because they taste good , and because you don ' t want a plain , boring meal . there is one gamer who gets paid 500k annually and is digit y  o .

6. if u want to get rich , try flipping . it ' s mad boring but you can get your orbs piling up really quick . what i like to do is put my chaos recipe items in a public tab because you occasionally get people who offer decent prices for them
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

9. i don ' t believe in a god that would allow a world like this . you can do what you want but i doubt itll change anything . if there is a god it ' s obvious he couldnt give two shits about me or millions of other people for that matter .
   (ID: f46d1bfdfed7fc05bbe39789c092019944471e9d)

12. in the days where everyone wants access to free information , we have plenty of sites to provide that access . sites like documenting reality , liveleak , goregrish and best gore . they help preserve the legacy of what rotten was . it ' s not some sicko fetish like reddit seems to misinterpret . we want to be reminded of how bad the world can get , so we may appreciate our own lives and those of everyone else .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

15. i would definitely say for you to go for it , however i would try something other than minecraft at first . minecrafts popularity on yt has gone way down and it would be better off to start with something else that is a bit more popular . like beamng or something . but it is your call on what you want to start out with .

19. sales should be on their way  but it might also help if you told us what sort of games you normally like , and what you already own  don ' t want ?
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

20. personally i don  t understand why an asian woman like me would want to marry another asian . all that misogyny . all that cultural chauvinism . that patriarchy . it  s like marrying your brother .
