   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

3. pretty sure that a person of interest isn  t the one who might have done it  but they just have some information on it . don  t quote me though
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

4. i ' m not sure how much it has to do with the time and how much it has to do with who your parents are . kids around me were doing plenty , i just had an overly controlling parental situation .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

5. no such thing as too much technology . just gotta make sure to keep the ai in line .
   (ID: 7ebdc00c75f6f836557e13d39a9efb279ed2ef7a)

6. they were trying to get rid of child porn on their site , but doing a blind generic sweep of just nsfw content with a weak bot didn  t do them any good . porn bits are still around , countless nsfw blogs , and i  m sure there are still pedos lurking on that site . i heard if they had been deleted off tumblr that they migrated to twitter
   (ID: 44eba9a0cf089ec615a77db5d42a2c01b63cb259)

7. me too . but i stopped playing actively for about a year now just making sure i do my deadpool daily . just be patience and play hardcore with a good alliance and you should be fine .
   (ID: a1ba9b657b043ce2934cc0ae7b42c0a0bf3ba2fa)

8. i ' m not sure i see how that relates ? fat acceptance , in my understanding , is just accepting people for what they are and not judging them . there ' s no expectation at least no reasonable expectation that we should have to find fat women attractive . could you elaborate on what you mean ?
   (ID: f3f34b7b903c833de2625265da4585abdc86ab7c)

9. hi just wondering if you have any pics with the jacket on ? i  m digit  digit  but much heavier 170lbs and i  m not sure how loose  long it would be on me . thanks in advance !
   (ID: 8d5aac58a9c3a7e883f9e90df39dc5ab7c36de53)

10. tl  dr i ' m pretty sure no one knows what the hell they ' re doing anymore and we ' re all just trying to manage .
   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

11. that makes sense . i have bought stuff for team fortress digit before , but they were weapons to be used in game . it ' s just hard for me to justify more than a  digit for an iphone game that you will get bored of in a few days . but i am sure there are many dedicated app gamers out there . someone has to get to the top of the leaderboards .
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

12. after reading some of the comments ive come to realise people find some of the magic eyes difficult . i assumed you could either see them or you couldn ' t . although this image is quite shallow in depth it resolves itself just as easily as any other . not entirely sure what point i ' m trying to make only that it was an eye opener so to speak
   (ID: e982e025c0604997a6e2072eb87b9bb01bed38ae)

13. if only . i ' m still not sure whether to sell it , take someone else , or just see if i can get any kind of money back .
   (ID: b42bcbaed0ea1f011b4d8c42d4ad9df732ecc5d5)

14. just talk to everyone you can . sure you may have some weird convos that are a lil uncomfortable but then its done and you move on with life . the more comfortable you are talking to people the easier life will be
   (ID: 6eb8259d7d6b7ae101dda44ceaaf3b9edaab4fad)

15. i just realised i gotta do this in survival mode on a top of any of my minecraft houses . and probably using posters or something , but i ' m not sure .   .
