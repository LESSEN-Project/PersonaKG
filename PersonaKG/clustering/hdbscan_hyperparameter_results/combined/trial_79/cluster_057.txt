--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 164

1. not eat too much salt and get better sleep . sometimes a good adaptogen helps to keep the serotonin flowing , like rhodiola rosea . all in all it ' s usually an atrophied muscle you have to exercise . just like how people are full of shit when they say they can ' t run , focusing , socializing or managing can be learned because the brain is very plastic . just stick to subjects you enjoy and work to empathize with other people and listen to their stories . some people are simply boring or self centered , but there are also a lot of interesting people out there . like good books , you have to seek them out , and stick to being around them and then over time socializing because rewarding because there is commonality between you and the person you found . indeed , the beginning requires getting out of your comfort zone and making the effort . it is so worth it though .
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

2. i didnt . i just pulled the old " sit next to them at the movies and put your arm around them " move . worked like a charm !
   (ID: 37aa751f14bbf132fc2f76d2c2c79142318c3e31)

3. is there one of these for the extra deck ? sometimes i feel like digit cards is just one to few , and theres so much nuance in deciding how many copies to run in the extra .
   (ID: 46f455b780faca36116964131a4d0622c465bf7f)

4. why are you asking this ? like other people said there ' s nothing wrong with it , they don ' t hurt anyone for me as long as they don ' t convince others to be gay i ' m ok with it , they ' re humans just like you and me
   (ID: 2a3d0cc7409627207d71d58affd421983020efbe)

5. i was born with something called microtia type digit . if you search it up you will understand , it is not gross it just looks like a bunch of extra skin and bone
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

6. it depends on a person ' s outlook  i work digit hr days with overtime its the actual law here where i am but i just see it as a " work hard and play super hard " kind of scenario . plus i guess it depends on if you enjoy what you do  again the whole playing your cards right , i like the amount of influence i have on every aspect on my life .
   (ID: bf662bc559367d8b6475102fe891d5e4eb072ffd)

7. they give me a reality better than my own . i get to feel like i matter . or like i ' m a badass . or hell , just plain feeling relaxed . it ' s just something for you to look at like hey , life can suck , but at least i ' m a hero to hyrule .
   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

8. you must do it if it ' s just because of laughter . either a  pokerface like your life depended on it because it will b  go to the bathroom and just stay in the hallway to unleash the pathowoyiffogen .
   (ID: 96167969642339382f3b9c4eeee4ea73aec3823c)

9. be polite and act as the adult you are . don ' t act like a douche just because you can shield yourself behind the anonymity of the web .
   (ID: c7e5f1c7a94109955f94d7acd2417ffad0ba60db)

10. someone called me some bad stuff and admitted that the intent was to harm me . took me almost a year to figure out that bad people just exist and can fit in with society like everyone else .
   (ID: c9b1e924c86788c982ec59df3d5704354a2a4ae1)

11. i mean you could just ask if he wants to hang out just the two of you , and if je suggests more friends to bring take it as a hint he doesn ' t like you like that .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

12. perhaps because he signed up for this job , or was kind of pressured into it . perhaps patriotism and duty and tradition and freedom didn ' t have as much to do with it as vague hopes of escaping a shitty situation . perhaps it was just family pressure , or a few mistakes as a kid , or a fucked up economy , and the service looked like the only option . maybe it was just a means to the gi bill , or a way to do right by a pregnant digit year old girlfriend . not everyone joins up to be a hero .
   (ID: 5b02e2fd29e743c4c80de2b0919a03d95400c23a)

13. i mean just a picture of her in that dress without anything else would get my upvotecos i ' m like that i don ' t hide it but this is just stupid
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

14. the action scenes were painfully average but it had something to say about race relations in our world today and it does it with a little , not a lot of nuance . while it wasn ' t the best picture of the year i myself am completely fine with its nominations especially considering the two biggest winners of the night were green book and bohemian rhapsody . it ' s totally ok if you didn ' t like it just acknowledge that it was trying to do more than your average blockbuster .
   (ID: a62b69d15e6c81a1a1acb2d0dd4bf9119038ff09)

15. tracing words repetitively . if i get a series of words that sticks in my brain wether i am having a conversation or watching tv  i trace the words on my right leg , and can do it for hours just impulsively . it honestly feels so stupid when you see a mazda commercial and get the tag line ' zoom zoom ' stuck in your head for a period of time and you ' re just like , why ? it ' s funny , and since it ' s one of my harmless rituals i have , it ' s not a big deal in my everyday life lol .
   (ID: 9e1be6964f5835f58b6cdaac71f8b557f0b4a42f)

16. didn ' t feel like reading all the comments . save your money just have a shake . it has them all .
   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

17. i dont have the subox but i do have some kanger tanks and i really like these  digit delrin tips from . i have bought several and they are all great . the tapered long black one might be just the ticket for you .
   (ID: 6778aa4e3cf401044823c475db231fc0b1d0ff4b)

18. it just seems like if i bought a share right now , say for  digit , i could always get my money back and possibly even more if the stock rises . it just seems like i ' m missing something because i can ' t imagine what could cause disney to lose value any time soon .
   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

19. i ' d also recommend showing your friends some of the really entertaining old films i ' d go with rear window , charade , and tootsie having friends who are into the same stuff as you can be very helpful , just don ' t start them off with really obscure stuff because you risk turning them off to old stuff if you show them something like the seventh seal or stalker first
   (ID: a62b69d15e6c81a1a1acb2d0dd4bf9119038ff09)

20. games like that are just depressing . the only reason people play it is to jerk off but if you have to put more than digit minutes into something just to start jerking off you ' re wasting your time . especially when it comes to this where you have to either spend digit hours or another digit bucks to see the outline of a tiddie . it makes no sense since you can just type in " anime tiddies " in google and get a million results instantly and for free .
