1. does anyone know where i can download this song for a ringtone ? the reds used to use this during rain delays , and i have a friend that is affiliated with the team and this song seems like the perfect ringtone for them .
   (ID: 5603c8fcb517a4b5745afb8c3f46248974edebe3)

2. i have time every single night when i rubber band my controller and go to sleep . yes i know banding isn  t necessary but i like my guy to stroll around carelessly , like andy dufresne
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

3. shmukatelli would do well to get to know someone with genuine gender dysphoria , and shmukatelli might learn some compassion for those with the condition . getting a sex change is not something one goes through on a whim . neither i , nor anyone in my family is like this that i know of but if my children ever came forward as such , i would support whatever decision they might make .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

4. well not really its the size of an ak bullet so its not like getting a . digit to the chest that would turn organs to soup . kinda all depends where it hits you and if you have armor and what kind its rated for . i have a friend in the corp and he was shot in the back with a ak and didn ' t know it till someone pointed out he had a hole in his sapi carrier body armor so its all relevant to the rifle and where you ' re shot .
   (ID: 72cfb7666d0a97ebe283c019ed67b8b62982ac18)

5. this sounds like bullshit , but i don  t know enough about the subject to call you out
   (ID: 61d850113b440da97216a14cfd8a5509352c72b2)

6. this sounds like a lack of training  impulse control issue and not the dog actually hating you . your friend should train her , it ' s not cute when an adult pitbull acts like that and is dangerous for the dog ! there ' s a guy in my area who brings his totally untrained   digit lb pitbull to dog parks . the dog regularly jumps on people and bites their hands  pulls on their clothes . the people involved have all been dog owners so they know to remain calm , but i don ' t see it going well if a dog  fearing stranger or child were the target .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

7. touch would be different than emotion . i wouldn ' t really like to know what is behind the dead eyed look .
   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

8. i would quite like to know how someone can use brackets and quotation marks on word without knowing how to use backspace  delete .
   (ID: e78c9eb3b69138ff8337dd896bc5bb1e02fc6559)

9. i know you ' re going to get downvoted and are using hyperbole , but that may not be bad for them . not a " forced labor " kind of thing , but something designed to show them the value of work . maybe they could help build a park or something like that .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

10. great info mr phellan , appreciate the time taken to write it up . does scanning take long ? which starter race gives the best options for frigates and above for salvage ? i know i can fly all ships in the game if i train for them , but for a moon like i will be , what would you recommend ? edit  noob
   (ID: a911ed792d3b26b115aedaee6218a4a944c38521)

11. i don ' t know why you ' re getting so worked up about this . it ' s not like it was anything more than meaningless sex in the first place .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

12. i can  t seem to remember any right now but when someone keeps saying  like  you . already know they  re making the story or dream they have right on the spot
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

13. thank you for the kind offer judge but it ' s not a scam i intend to run , but a proper business , you know , legit n like .
   (ID: a911ed792d3b26b115aedaee6218a4a944c38521)

14. to be fair i kind of find it interesting . being a straight furry is like being gay in the world . we ' re made fun of , some people ignore us very small minority , but still , and its very difficult to find people you can relate to . so you won ' t find solice here . it ' s the world upside down and its sometimes fun to see what would the world be with lgbt being the majority . i know it can sometimes suck , but hey , being a furry is a choice unlike race or in some cases , arguably , your attraction . you have to put up with all the bullshit , but you can quit at any time .
   (ID: 96167969642339382f3b9c4eeee4ea73aec3823c)

15. i dont know why you ' re getting downvotes . this is fucking hilarious . and its not political shitposting to say that the former first lady looks like a man .
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

16. it sounds to me like you should be talking to a lawyer instead of asking the internet . you make one google about a cough and before you know it google says you have aids . don  t expect any different . at least i gave you ideal advice .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

17. its like you know me . have another upvote .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

18. i know lol . she really is great . shes like a blessing in my life that came upon me when i was very confused and didn ' t know where to go . whenever i feel sad i listen to litterally any of her songs and feel better . i am not a robot has such a special place in my  . so does happy . especially becuase i have anxiety and depression so it makes it even better .
   (ID: 0ddaeffad510fe540496c0e0b97a1a85b13282eb)

19. actually what your describing is a thing that has nothing to do with anger . " call of the void " is when you see an opportunity to do something you know to be horrible and feel a sudden urge to do it . this happens to let your mind know it has control over the situation . like standing on the edge of a cliff . the mind goes " this is scary , i could fall , i could die " so the next step is " i could kill myself , but i won ' t kill myself , so i ' m not going to die . does that make sense ? tl  dr you ' re fine , everybody feels this , it ' s a way to feel in control .
   (ID: d54a04c3eba52404f5dd7abb0e459a949dbc7f93)

20. i ' m afraid that i really know nothing about the industry , except as a watcher . it seems like netflix is growing and is vastly expanding its home  grown content , so going that route would certainly be a valid one . best of luck !
