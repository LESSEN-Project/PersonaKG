   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

5. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !

   (ID: a778c9b10000a3e15377e87997ef5bea46cfe33f)

12. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

13. ummm . wow ! it wasn ' t the nazis who built that wall . yikes ! i correct my previous statement , you should have just learned history ! that was not such a wall , that was to keep people in . much easier to do if the gov ' t kills anyone you know if you escape . kind of puts a damper on escapes and the ability to plan them with others .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

14. wow . aren ' t you just a big boy telling me how it is . look at you just put me in my place . thank god for you brave souls who take on the burdensome task of sorting out the know ' s and the know ' s not . and nobody even asked you to do it . you deserve a treat . that ' s a good boy .
   (ID: f15c79447707a6e701285e8c59cc3aa25d54daa6)

15. how does it make you feel ? it  s just my opinion , i don  t know why everyone  s getting so defensive .
   (ID: 1bb2b5ec27ad0397aea65ab5151bd4a19742f52a)

   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

19. i get social anxiety too sometimes when i ' m in larges groups of people when i smoke . i don ' t know of a way to counter that , but alcohol makes me much more sociable , while when i get high i ' m just chill and spaced out . try smoking alone a few times to get used to the feeling of it , and try to smoke with people you know well i would suggest .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

20. it ' s not a odd question at all . it ' s a legitimate question that everyone asks . you know i don ' t really remember honestly . lol so i ' m just gonna say it didn ' t hurt all that much .
