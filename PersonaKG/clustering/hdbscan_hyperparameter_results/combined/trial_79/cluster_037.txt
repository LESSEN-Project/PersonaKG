6. some woman supposedly .  i  m not saying this didn  t happen but fuck me . you won  t listen to the fucking fbi but this is a credible source for you ? at what point will you realize that you just hear what you want to hear .
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

7. why would you want to hide your personality ? i see it as expressing your true self to people , because i have been liying to people for too long . on the other hand there is the argument that , well accourse it ' s just a hobby and that people shouldn ' t care what hobbies you have , but lets be honest , who ' s personality hasn ' t changed because of the fandom ?
   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

   (ID: 79fc72ea72532d39a039ecb4e47a630a601ff4a8)

11. maybe ? i mean most of say you want to feel loved , you want a relationship that includes sex , this would just make it meaningless .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

12. i just don ' t understand why anyone would want that instead of physical keys
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

13. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .

   (ID: 7542c8a6be5a118bef67d9539deb69c131fb4fbc)

17. for the most part , you have the freedom to go or do whatever you want . whereas , in a relationship , you have not just yourself but your so to consider . as far as what ' s the worst thing in relationships ? that ' s more or so subjective . everyone will tell you something different .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

18. mosquitoes . they cause the most human deaths compared to any other living thing . seriously , whenever i see one flying around , whether it ' s minding its own business or looking for a midnight snack , i get my zapper and dart to the other side of the room . i ' m literally fine with a spider , i even held a jumping spider to put it outside , with my bare hands ! but i can ' t even look at a mosquito without trying to reach for my zapper . i just realized that i made this a confession . sorry to those who didn ' t want to hear that .
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

19. yta , sorry to burst your bubble , but you can ' t make someone do anything to you . if she doesn ' t want to have sex , she doesn ' t . and making her give you a bj just fucked it up even more .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

20. what ' s the code then if i really just want an extra pillow .
