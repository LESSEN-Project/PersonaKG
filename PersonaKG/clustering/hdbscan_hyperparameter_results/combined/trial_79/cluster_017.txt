   (ID: 4136a1b6da64b3c5f49dfe23761d1a0ec8925dba)

   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

5. you don ' t see the problem at all . you don ' t know any of the complexities or the implications of the issue , and that ' s why you think copy  pasting your own method would work . how offended would you get if the us told your own government  hey , our economy is the most successful in the world , you should copy it directly . of course you ' d be insulted . you should run your own country to your own circumstances , and we should do the same .  copy pasted from question digit mins ago
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

   (ID: a8d677a357cabd8cb6d9bfa06e041b5b173582d8)

   (ID: f031a6829326f9097d63f90ad77c7cac6d8319bb)

8. kim kardashian . i dont think she has said or done anything to hate her . i think that her family have a succesfull business and know how to manage it and i never saw them make a scandal appart from kim ' s sextape . the only annoying thing is how much attention they get but thats thanks to media and people bitching for why are they famous every single day .
   (ID: 28b40f8090abf393e7d7a7cf1772fb2c16d434a1)

9. at least i find it easier . the one i know you have to line up approximately , and i think this has a better effectiveness  difficulty ratio than most .
   (ID: 6260fdfdc8a5feec78502a823b8de04ee318e260)

10. i see your point . i think it is safe to say that for the most part " they don ' t even know any better . ' they ' meaning everyone  rich , poor , middle .
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

11. i would think that ' s true for most of the old alfas . some have a bigger following and more support i guess . good to know
   (ID: 90779ea1e5aa2ec3ed3a1fa6b99a8207c0d66d3e)

   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

13. i dont know about pudding because even if she becomes good she doesnt have any purpose in strawhat crew but saying that katakuri will be joining im thinking u are trolling otherwise he is the strongest after big mom and lets say her security guard and if u say about her realitonship with the kids i think is the same will all of them they fear her and they are tools for her acomplishments , so katakuri doesnt seem mistreated or anything .
   (ID: 28b40f8090abf393e7d7a7cf1772fb2c16d434a1)

14. i hate when people call women hoes . what makes you think being a " hoe " is a bad thing ? what makes a hoe ? also how do they know you ' re a hoe ?
   (ID: c50abefedeeb0c19f834b1ebb28634054bccee26)

15. i think my dad trashed that computer more than digit years ago , so i don ' t know if i can find the original art work .
   (ID: a283688fea41e1110e58705ec74d4e325e46d87e)

16. yeah maybe with mammals and stuff but i don  t think snakes really understand the concept of help . from what i know they  re left on their own from the time they hatch and don  t receive any kind of assistance from mom . it  s possible but i doubt it
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

17. in what way ? wanting to know what specific thing you think makes it shitty .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

18. sometimes i think that no matter how hard our life is , no matter how much we suffer or put others in pain , the people who have passed on are laughing because they know it doesn ' t matter and nothing matters in life because there ' s something else that ' s better for everyone once we pass on . as far as i know , death only affects those that are living .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

19. im waiting for kunimitsu and negan , and i know several pros and cons . pros are you know the most of the match up , move , what safe and what can be punish . cons are sometimes you do wrong input for example yoshi ender i always use with f3  digit but some times i mix that with miguel button input . also , having your brain expand the size of the entire roster , sometimes i found myself think of all the move i use when i fight those character , for example like if i fight yoshi , i would expect my opponent to only use what i also used but nope he use other tech so i find it difficult sometimes . sometime you you underestimate your opponent because you know most of the match up , and other than that , you can mix some move into other character for example yoshi didn ' t have savage but you think he has cause you play most of the roster . in short it can confuse you .
   (ID: cd4ad4cc67fcfb39fcb1f11e52709d863f1c0215)

20. having my underarms touched . i don  t know why , but whenever i think someone is going to touch them or come close to them i freak out and hyperventilate .
