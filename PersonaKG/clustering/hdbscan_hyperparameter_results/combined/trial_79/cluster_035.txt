Total from this dataset: 68

1. do you think it ' d work ? maybe , maybe not . the biggest problem is that marcone is assuming that when dresden comes for him it will be a straightforward assault on marcone in a position where marcone has the advantage . harry ' s a lot smarter and sneakier that that . the thing is that marcone as a character is a lot like harry . underpowered compared to some of his enemies , but smart enough to win anyway . a conflict between the two of them is likely to be a lot more like a chess game than a straight  up fight .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

2. funny . i don ' t like religion because i think it ' s ' icky ' . i have a hundred other reasons of course but my gut instinct is ' it ' s icky ' .
   (ID: d02dbb1cf70aa95df2b9f1bbd0a0c5bf0a966933)

3. i think it was the first time i played the last of us , i absolutely loved ellie  s character and wanted to raise a badass kid like her . also , i felt the same way when playing god of war . so i guess if i ever have kids i  m naming them ellie and atreus
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

4. i think i found it ! something called " captain blasto . this article says that one of his lines is " honey i ' m home "  here ' s a gameplay video , though it looks ps1 instead of n64 . but this is definitely your guy , in space with a blaster with the wisecracks very much like the gex game i remembered
   (ID: abbe051c76bbb939d8594349cac549cb5435920d)

5. to be fair i used to think this . i agree that some women are not funny . however some men aren  t funny either . usually if you don  t like vagina jokes don  t watch amy schumer . she is the female equivalent to louis c . k . i do recommend you watch catherine ryan  s special on netflix for you to change your mind .
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

6. whenever people find their way here they always think it will be like " the one that flew over the cukoos nest " with lobotomy and ect though electroconvulsive therapy is not that medival and in reality greatly assists those suffering from long term depression , it is literally like a whole new person comes out . not lobotimized , more like a medical miracle . plus the media only focuses on the dramatic rather than the relatable , tragically .
   (ID: b5153b16e61f6bc5e4bf4d8db479b7093df1ae26)

7. im not hating but every time i see a pic of a joint like this it makes me think how much is being wasted or perhaps being offered to the gods
   (ID: e3f34e146ce06ba2b5fc5a249c73494f93f56e86)

8. i like how you have nothing to do in your life except type insanely long answers to a random persons question . does it honestly matter to you what i think and believe in ?
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

9. yeah . i dont get that . even as someone who likes trump , this is something i think is okay to make fun of . he even makes fun of his own typos like when he typed covfefe
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

10. ok , question time  do you feel like i should rewrite it with the events in proper chronological order ? how do i make it less jerky ? or do you think it ' s fine as is ?
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

11. hahah ! like they would make three matrix films . i think you might be trolling .
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

12. i think everyone pronounces their ts like ds if its in the middle of a word
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

13. i think the question is asking what industries you ' d like to kill off , i think you ' re taking it as an insult
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

14. cause trump would think of funny names for them like " beto the creepo " and " bad touch biden , " steal their thunder at every turn and make it hard to take them seriously . p . s . i didnt bother thinking up a name for bernie because hes too old to make it to digit .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

15. not that i ' m aware of , i think its " supposed " to work like this  you throw it in their vicinity . you click a button and it will revive them . whether that actually works or not is a mystery to me
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

16. oh okay , yeah i can see what you mean there but i think that there are more people then me that post stuff like this on here anyway . you never answered what makes me an attention seeking whore from this ?
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

17. so what do you think about it do you like it ? i mean sans in one of the best video game characters and fortnite is one of the epicest games so it ' s a good combo . what do you think ?
   (ID: 409a49cde6f1f65f92cac4d33c7c769f7ba9e965)

18. do people actually think like this ? you can ' t control the sex of your kids . well actually i think nowadays you can , idk how expensive it is what difference does it make if you have boys or girls anyway . if everyone had boys , there ' d be no one to reproduce in the next generation .
   (ID: 419b67e0e2cdcb7bd8ea9a89d34d0747a1f5f620)

19. its more like they dont buy any plastic . they definitely dont use microwaves . even i dont do that . but i do think the plastic thing is ridiculous .
   (ID: 91dc65ba6eef536f17becface16989de7f988dce)

20. what do you mean by incriminating ? like you would be in legal trouble if you said it ? i don ' t hate or enjoy facebook but it can be useful . i dislike some people , and human nature , and how facebook has made being dishonest and playing to the crowd more desirable . but i still think it ' s the individual ' s fault for giving in to that .
