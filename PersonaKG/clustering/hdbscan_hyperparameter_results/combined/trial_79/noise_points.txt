1. been there the before , i am sure that the teachersyes , this happened multiple times understood and gave them passing grades . i am also sure that this is not the only type of story in which i am the villain .
   (ID: 1f135ff98983a673a19c956d41be6fdeca8513e4)

2. just like any other job interview , the right answer to ' why do you want to work in this new position ' is always what does this particular position offer you ? what do you have to gain from it ? what can you do to help the company when working at this new position ? the only time that you talk about your boss and your challenges with him is if your interviewers bring the topic up since this is an internal interview and the reports you have on file may be up fair game for discussion . even then , you still have to be professional about it and don ' t just spend time trashing the guy .
   (ID: 1ebb4643f7e1e4d41ee2503d9b5d94ed0224c96b)

5. i was just like you at one point . i had no idea what i was going to do . take any job that sounds legit . no craigslist ads or anything and be upfront . everyone in the world wants to work in hollywood . i don ' t live in l . a . , and i never wanted to . there are jobs all over the country that you ' ve never heard of that go almost unnoticed because everyone ' s solely focused in hollywood . it ' s a really long story , but it was a lot of fun and good fortune getting here . p . m . me for a very long story . by the way , i was scared too . i just didn ' t want to live my life letting fear hold me back . if you try , something will come of it .

7. nah . i don  t think it  s really that big of a deal for her to go back and grab a couple of things while you are ringing up groceries as long as you  re not already done scanning and other people including you aren  t having to wait several minutes on her . on the other hand , i don  t think you were necessarily in the wrong . i mean , i understand your reasoning . if it is something that bothers you , you have the right to voice that . it  s probably something to bring up in the car on the way home or at home and not at the store , however .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

8. male im not really friends with any girls , but i do know that a ton of stuff i say is a joke , and even sometimes ill give actual advice in a half joking way , its weird . something like " how about you dont please " cant think of any off the top of my head and also , yes , i hear tons of fucked up things but dont really get offended at any of it , confirming your point . . waait so are girls really that boring ?
