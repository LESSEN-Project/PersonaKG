   (ID: f7713e4cd0a5245097f9f45a1194222bda369b48)

3. see it ' s hard to describe , but he ' s not one who likes to get embarrassed because he gets super upset and angry . he totally lashes out , so i figured with an instance such as this , maybe wait for him to come to me ? or is that the same as like we ' ll basically never talk about it ?

4. you need to find the right shampoo that ' s important . i generally liked aussie . a lotta girls like dove . invest in conditioner . now i ' ll tell you a secret . there ' s a bottle of anti static spray . its blue bottle with a women in a skirt spraying the skirt . i always use that before i brush . but i ' ll warn you , who knows what ' s in it , it ' s most likely flammable but your brush will have next to zero resistance

   (ID: b29114e3d39ee1086f5eb2abbe6cbec33bc7749f)

6. i  m loving it but it  s not for everyone . d2 is really a game that you have to realize that if you get hooked you  ll be playing it until it either dies or d3 comes out . i  m having crazy amounts of fun on pc . my friends and i have created a clan and been running strikes and stuff like that . the entertainment is subjective but it  s much more fun with friends .

7. you  re right . if you look at what i said you  ll see i was trying to explain that chickens produce and expel eggs like humans , not that they were the same . obviously i didn  t do a very good job !
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

8. but to act like by being born you ' re entitled to anything more than life is something i ' ll argue about all day . . unless you ' re rich .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

9. you should tell them that you like it . they  ll be proud of you .
   (ID: f031a6829326f9097d63f90ad77c7cac6d8319bb)

10. " one of the freest . " okay , i ' ll give you that one . no argument there . " no country has the mythical unlimited , repercussion  free , type of free speech " i ' ll agree with you there , too . you are absolutely correct . where i take issue  nobody proclaims it like americans do . it comes across like america believes it is the most free country , when it is most certainly not . it ' s annoying behaviour .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

11. are you somewhere weed is not totally legal ? if so , i would say mailing joints would be an unnecessary risk . i suggest you give them to a stranger that looks like he smokes weed and maybe you ' ll make a new friend .
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

12. as a child , i suffered a lot from ear infections and as a result i had these drainage tubes which meant that water at the time was a big no . even though that ' s a thing of the past now , my ears are still quite sensitive when it comes to pressure and i would very much like to avoid experiencing what the girl from your scuba class had to go through . i guess i ' ll have to stick to snorkeling .
