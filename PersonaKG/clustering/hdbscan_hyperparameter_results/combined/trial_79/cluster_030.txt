   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

7. did you read what you just typed ? if something has low odds and it happens it is generally considered lucky . doesn ' t always have to be , for example , two digit stars to be lucky . edit  yes i ' m aware that you could also be unlucky in this same manner . but i would not consider this to be unlucky .
   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

17. that is the kind of pos you are imagining trump to be . all trump did was respond to his supporters who were commenting to him on twitter and you are blowing it up to be something controversial when it isn ' t . it ' s actually quite disgusting what you people are doing . we just had a terrorist attack and you are doing everything you can to try to use this horrific event to judge and criticize trump .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

18. so , you racist dipshits of stormfront   did your lives improve under the bush administration ? because if the statistics are correct , you ' re all just as broke and ignorant as ever . so why are you so afraid of a president who actually gives a shit about people who work for a living ?
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)
