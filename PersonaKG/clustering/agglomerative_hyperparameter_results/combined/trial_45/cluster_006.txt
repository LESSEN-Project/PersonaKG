1. true and at the same time i ' m trying to get something from them . an example  i get lonely on my weekends and want some company so i ' ll call up this friend of mine and ask him if he wants to get a burger or get a drink . he ' s usually broke so i have to pay but i ' m okay with it because i need the company . he gets my company and some food or a drink off of me but i think the trade is worth it because i ' ve got someone to talk to and to get out of the house .
   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

2. ok ! today is the day i got my new pc case owo
   (ID: 1b5b08f1246e450c7da09e40c81570fba378da84)

3. the last of us . that game really got to me .
   (ID: a18adc4ad3b28b34dfa3063a1c77566b8681a79d)

4. gta v can be pretty easy going if you have no interest in completing objectives . i know a lot of people who just like to goof around in that game since they are not too involved with gaming . i always thought it got old pretty fast but they never seemed to think so .
   (ID: 0c93ab3ec35cab16ded3445fcca7b6045c1dd147)

5. digit weeks ago i got cross faded and became unresponsive . i entered what we dubbed  the abyss  and it was the scariest place  feeling i have ever experienced . it was basically like the place in get out or like being in a dark closet where you can hear everything but cant move or speak .
   (ID: c374848a7cde05ee9d6d14f7ab991b3b11f71a87)

6. never ever pay first for challenge services . if they refuse , find another person . i think this is the only way i got scammedwasn  t much , like digit chaos , but the act of being scammed leaves a bad taste in my mouth . item trades are much easier to avoid
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

7. so no debt from college and free healthcare , plus  42k a year net income ? that ' s not bad . my question would be is it even worth trying to excel in your job and get promoted and a raise because even if you got to  84k with the tax rate you ' d probably be making the same net income , right ?
   (ID: 73c241755308e15ea272f3060f9c0a430c541f1a)

8. man , this post is really convenient , i got kisuke yesterdayin only three singles and got really happy about it , i was thinking about not spending anymore until tybw3 , but then i ended up leveling up a digit star and thought  why the fuck not  and just did a random single and got freaking stark , i literally can  t explain how happy i am right now , two hours before the banner is gone and i get the only two i wanted , now i just hope this wasn  t all of my luck for the month cat  face  with  tears  of  joy
   (ID: d10c10d39129e1768465d09c5c492657be31ef47)

9. i honestly love the dc now that i ' m not in a trailer anore . it ' s just a bunch of digit year olds training eachother on power equipment . what could possibly go wrong ?
   (ID: 1885b01dd0970230fea2a9c9ae9c4eaeaceb59a3)

10. do you know where they got it ? i ' d like to get one for my friend ?
   (ID: eee9dc5129787c4d2a8fda055f09565efcf9322a)

11. somehow in middle school i managed to access the silk road through tor before i even knew what i was doing was illegal . not sure how i found the website link since it was always changing , but you could literally buy anything on there . anything . drugs , porn , people , weapons , stolen goods , exotic animals , you name it . i got pretty scared of what id find though , so i only poked around for about digit mins before i got off tor forever .
   (ID: 0c93ab3ec35cab16ded3445fcca7b6045c1dd147)

12. but the kids among to different parents so i don ' t understand the comparison of white kids have clothes and black kids don ' t . also , where did the mother get clothes from ? she must love right there . toddlers run around in diapers at home all the time when it ' s hot . they are typically the ones who strip themselves . lol . i got bored and stopped watching before the end . guy seemed to be trying very hard to push a narrative .
   (ID: 88c65ad9c962da115240776d5aa110748286db73)

13. we ' ve been focusing on talking about prepping with friends , family and loved ones , especially because we ' re all going to be together in the run up to the festive season ! plus my partner wrote this awesome post on the sensible about how she used to grow food in just her dorm room . we ' ve now thankfully got a bit more space for our homestead than that .
   (ID: 43758cbbc1bb7a8418a69b47911e24d1d2a082d3)

14. dude a hate fuck is literally rape . you guys are all brainwashed you might as well be isis and " hate fuck " the people you ' re trying to " save " if you ' re at least digit then you know what i ' m talking about . you know , one university student asked this question on face book . everyone who responded got banned and lost their money for the course . man little kids are stupid
   (ID: 917dfa16e92ce1db67ec3f88bc07b87b70a36c95)

15. i ' ve got scars all across my face and the best course of action is just not giving a single heckin fuck . nobody does , so why should i ? don ' t do it again . there are other , healthier ways , and everyone has one to blow some steam off , while also not being a comfort zone . best of luck uwu
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

   (ID: 4a03851d25b2526583af78261bff2af13796094e)

18. i didn  t ever see anything weird , but i definitely saw my share of disturbing . one of our clients was the state police , so we got some terrible pics of crime scenes . one i will never forget was a little boy  s face with an imprint of the bottom of a sneaketennis shoe . his mother had been abusing him .
   (ID: c0c5a7c74c41387a99afab68d3e9fe0bfab4b8b9)

19. that feels like lazy writing to me . things on got are rarely black and white , so to have this mysterious storyline that ' s been developing for the entire series only to end abruptly with no explanation other than some stupid superhero movie villain arc destroy all of mankind mwahaha is a disservice to the entire show .
   (ID: 169c51cc138a4161080068ded4dcf87863ffee36)

20. how does one know if they got banned ?
