1. got my left side  ribs done and it was surprisingly not that bad . it just feels like something scratching you over and over . line work is less painful than shading , in my opinion . i actually kind of like how tattoos feel but . i ' m a weirdo .
   (ID: e16a0d174adc309bd63cefcfaac2428d7ebba9e9)

2. that is a cats way of showing you that he likes you . smelling each other ' s butts is how cats show friendship towards each other . you should feel honored ! lol
   (ID: de5db66359e6314e9bac24fd9a10ec1d49584c4f)

3. what you ' re telling me sounds like he doesn ' t care and it makes you feel bad , so leave him . you deserve to be cared about . don ' t let anyone tell you what you care about isn ' t enough .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

4. i ' ve tried but don ' t really have the patience for it . the whole point is to take a moment to remember the dream before starting your day . if you wake up to a dream and your mind goes right into planning the day , you ' ll forget it quickly . dream journals help by preventing that and also help you to recall more of the dream . the more you recall your dreams , the more you ' ll remember them . it ' s a cycle that you need to keep doing . but that why i don ' t need a dream journal . i already remember at least digit or digit dreams every night . the other major advantage of a dream jounal is to be able to look through your entries and pick out the things that are most common . you can then take those things and make them a trigger to go lucid . for me , one of those triggers is a full moon . if i see that i instantly know if it ' s a dream and can take control .
   (ID: 9789fadf3a050c71c64ca7e31c4857fc9094d643)

5. man , i feel you , i prefer watching the anime too . i ' ve found out the hard way . if you search anything up about naruto , you are guaranteed to get spoilers . generally avoid discussion videos bc they dip into manga territory . this subreddit ' s rules are pretty good with spoilers , just avoid anything tagged with spoilers .
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

6. i feel for ya dude . i can ' t even begin to understand how hard it must be for you . is your home affected as well ?
   (ID: 3f3a13bda2e98055fc23d20ace4e5f76118b56c5)

7. i see . i feel people want others to exercise to conform to their standards using health and physique as a dumb excuse rather then caring about someone being happy . ofcourse it is different when someone is obese but you get the message . also , many sports are boring and gyms are full of toxic shits anyway .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

8. holy fuck me ! that ' s awful , i feel bad for your uncle ' s friend . , that ' s why i feel so bad for truckers , people are assholes because they think they are faster and can get away . what they forget is that the trucks are way bigger and will crush them like a bug , how did your he handle it after ? i can ' t imagine even though in a way the guy deserved it for being an ass , it still had to affect the driver . edit  spelling
   (ID: 45bf5c8227b94451beff1dce1059d0d2c683c40c)

9. my problem with all these lgbt changes as a whole is that the creators feel the need to have a speech planned for every single one . let the show speak on its on .
   (ID: 31010e05529816820e206497e04c189d0c81c647)

10. but you can get paid to fap . i don ' t do it often but occasionally i ' ll do the post  lunch poop n jerk just to get my head straight before heading back to the grind . the guilt i feel for beating off at work really gets my productivity flowing
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

11. i don ' t know enough about canada to know if this is stupid or not , so feel free to ignore me if it is . can you sign up with credit karma ? it ' s a free site that will show you your credit reports and they also will show you offers you might qualify for . check it out and see if they recommend any particular cards . discover cards are usually pretty easy to get , as are capital one cards . just be careful of things like annual fees and high interest rates .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

12. i never feel like i was born in wrong time period . i feel like this was  is the best time to be born . coming decades are gonna be the turning point in human civilization , wither we are destined to become rulers of the universe or vanish without a trace . everything will depend on the decisions we make , as a species and some luck . we get front seat to witness it all . what better time to be alive ? who cares if no one liked your fb post . winking  face
   (ID: a168763c82b90dc18ccbbd57533eec2e49d17dc7)

13. i feel horrible doing that , but i have to teach those guy how to tact roll or block
   (ID: cd4ad4cc67fcfb39fcb1f11e52709d863f1c0215)

14. if i don ' t get sleep , food . etc etc because of someone then i feel it is a love .
   (ID: b301c9554f2e76b5eecf80851921ba7c198de59c)

15. if i make a factually correct , logically sound argument and you don ' t change just because you don ' t like me , then you ' re the asshole . that means you don ' t actually care about facts , logic , and reason . what you really care about are your little bitch emotions . well i do not , and never will , give a fuck about your emotions . i make bullet proof arguments , and if you don ' t respect logic , then that ' s on you , boy . let me repeat that  i do not care about your emotions . i do not care if you think i ' m an asshole . i do . not . care . so you can feel free to shit the fuck up about it . and again , in bold  no one has to disprove the claims the paranormal exist . do i need to repeat that again ? i do not have to disprove anything . nothing , at all , ever , is said to exist until it is proven to exist . so when i say " the paranormal doesn ' t exist " , i am absolutely logically sound . that ' s basic logic . if you want my time again with your whiney little bitch garbage about my " attitude " , then i won ' t even bother reading your trash . it ' s a waste of my time , and i do . not . fucking . care . if you want to shit me up and change my attitude , make a better argument . fuck you and fuck your weekend .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

16. yeah , i feel like i would have a better chance being in a relationship if i were gay .
   (ID: 2af8a0ff2295d21473f0e6ff67565738eb8f4df1)

17. i feel like the incident had nothing to do with the lasagna . if he is stressed out he may have just taken it out on you because you were an easy target in the moment . which isn ' t cool . can you sit down with him and simply say " what ' s going on , something is off now and if it is because of me i would like to know . i don ' t think you are being an ass , or oversensitive to something that shouldn ' t have been a big deal or resulted in a cold shoulder . anything in hindsight that may have been leading up to his change ?
   (ID: 7911b1d92de80b0e1abd4e2a29e4f762a8a2908f)

18. it is pretty gruesome most of the time . sometimes it ' s like far away shots where you can ' t really see anything but you know they ' re dying  dead . i ' m not sure why other people watch it , but for me it made death more real , if that makes sense . as someone who has never actually seen someone die in real life it has been informative . before i watched some of those videos it was like " oh , that sucks " when i ' d hear on the news that someone got shot , stabbed , in a car accident , died in a fire , etc . after seeing those kinds of videos i take more of a pause after hearing something like that . i take the moment to mourn a life that ' s been extinguished , and be thankful for how fortunate i have been . but that ' s just me . though i will say , i can ' t watch the ones with kids . i saw one video with kids and even now i want to vomit .
   (ID: 28ecb35c880034ee5298d0c4abb71cabdafd1e4f)

19. yeah , you know , although i ' m not in their " list " , i feel like . unsafe , because these bastards exist in my country , they probably killed an activist and threatened some others , and the police is just doing nothing to stop them as usually , " you can come when you will be killed , we ' ll consider your report " this bad feeling when you realise so many good people may be killed just because some homophobic assholes decided it ' s funny to murder lgbtq  members
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

20. definitely don ' t shoot . the effect is much bigger , it is kinda tough to get the technique right in the beginning , and bigger health risks . if you wanna snort or smoke bth , ecp ,  digit ? , start with an amount that is no bigger than a matchstick head . wait digit minutes , see how you feel then you could take a very small amount more , and repeat til you are where you wanna be at . edit  and it ' s never safe . you are taking pills . with pills you know to some degree how safe they are because pressed pills are indentifiable . you know what to look for to know that they are legit . with heroin you never know what you get . it might be shit , it might be better than what you expecxted . and if you live in america and out of luck it has fentynal in it . it ' s a gamble .
