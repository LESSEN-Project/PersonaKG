   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

2. i thank you for you share , if you don  t mind , my opinion is that you hop off the medication . you did what you had to do for the greatest good . everything that happens has positive and negative outcomes and there  s always going to be someone that cause them , if it was you or anyone else it would  ve still happened . gladly here , the good heavily outweighed the bad . don  t blame yourself . things had to be done and time will pass , i wish you the best .
   (ID: a77a8bcaa391d8b6584d32e6ad243e71297d7258)

   (ID: 22a043d8284bd8c7c31748b5cc8c8b8efc757df6)

7. i wish that that was how i found out santa wasn  t real . my mom  s christian but my dad  s jewish , so he made it clear by kindergarten that i should be thanking him for the presents . i honestly can  t think of a better way . otherwise he  ll hear it from kids in school or elsewhere . you should be the one to tell him and be there for him if he gets upset
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

8. i mean , its your call . if you wish for me to stop posting these i respect that . but may i ask what qualifies as high content then ? this is an entire essay written about the characters on the show . yes , it has speculation about why characters acted the way they did . but all the events listed happened in the show and ultimately were just a different way to view the shows events . there is a lot that could be said about these posts , but them having low  content doesn ' t really make much sense considering how much longer , more detailed , and how much more i discuss the lore then many posts on this sub .
   (ID: a22b82fe301caa42c89cbd71b2e3733753f695d9)

16. i know someone said this already but i ' m saying it again because it got lost and i couldn ' t second it  if your parents ditch your wedding and your own father leaves you to walk down the aisle alone never speak to them again . never let them meet your children . ever ! all the other advice about talking to your parents ahead of time is good but what comes after they make their decision is just as important . i wish you the best of luck in this and the best on your wedding day , which should be solely about you and your fiance . how many days in your whole life are solely about you ? this one day . you absolutely deserve to have everything be just the way you want on your day .
