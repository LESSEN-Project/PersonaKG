   (ID: fada832baa55975057f6409e8926deefae094f1f)

   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

   (ID: 54920691b1e05863de734f0444f66749700c4331)

9. i had a friend . my best friend . i accepted who he was , whenever he has a girlfriend he begins to be on a high horse and judge everyone . he wasn ' t the greatest . college dropout , dead end job , but our clique of friends still loved him . then he started to have girlfriends and began to judge people for what they do . he judged my friend with benefit and so on . eventually he had his third girlfriend and essentially stopped picking up all our calls and invites to boardgame night and beer night . something we been doing for digit years , all cause a girl thought it was lame to have boardgames . eventually we started to do other stuff like go out and take trips . we never spoke to him ever again and from what i heard , he has two jobs just to support his gf ' s party habits . oh well . i cared . once .

10. oh i miss what unpopular opinion was chocked full of this juice . though i seriously gotta side with you . some men and women simply are attracted to children . having those thoughts alone does no hurt expect , potentially to the thinker but it ' s only when actions are sought that justice is needed . for example i guarantee there have been multiple times you ' ve thought of killing someone . isn ' t that just as bad if not worse than rape ? so why isn ' t that condemned
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

11. that  s not how it works , his powers are not brutal force , he has the powers to control everything that happened in the past , he is pretty much thanos with complete gauntlet or even stronger , he would  uncreate  pretty much anyone in any universe just with his thought . the only reason he couldn  t end everything in bleach is because he is too big of a ball of pride and protagonism
   (ID: d10c10d39129e1768465d09c5c492657be31ef47)

12. wait . you can look these things up yourself . crazy , i thought you had to post it with little to no effort of figuring it out .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

13. true at the time i didn ' t connect it , but afterwards i thought the same thing . he sort of just disappeared . the only other person i could think of being " the american " would be brenner , but i have my doubts about that .
   (ID: 36314aee005a03517f2446ec0da2834fe0f712d6)

14. hmm . i never thought about it like that . it seems as though i ' ve been out scienced again . i guess this is what they mean when they say " scientist will admit when they ' re wrong " .
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

   (ID: 2623e4996f6df0e5814dbede4fbc9c1f13de4382)

   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

20. i know how dumb it is to lock yourself out of the house , but i thought i would let it happen to me . i always check for that sort of thing . you seem to have misspoken , op . you meant that you thought you wouldn ' t let it happen to you .
