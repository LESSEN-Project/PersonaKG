9. the messenger by markus zusak , everyone raves about the book thief , and rightly so i think it ' s fantastic , but imo the messenger is a phenomenal piece of literature . the content it explores are real , hard hitting issues , and the narrative styles he uses are unlike many other authors i ' ve ever read . the just utter cleverness of zusak , the twist he throws in at the end is just unique . after reading this book i had one of those hand  over  mouth  rethinking  every  life  choice  what  the  fuck  did  i  just  read  wow moments . seriously read this book , it ' s fantastic and deconstructing it didn ' t ruin it for me , it helped digit year old me understand it better , and have more of the aforementioned moments .
