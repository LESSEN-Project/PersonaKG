7. i will admit i worried about that a bit when we went to new zealand for our honeymoon . saw a lot on the internet about rampant tourism being out of control , etc . it turned out to be fine . we went in the end of a shoulder season us thanksgiving and built an itinerary of all the " second best " or " less popular but great " things  for example , hiking isthmus peak instead of roy ' s peak near wanaka  spending time in wanaka instead of queenstown . never underestimate the ability of crowds to all take the same photo and go to the exact same digit places .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

8. i call you a reddit groupie because all you do is make up information or try to discredit me and yet you have no basis for your claims yourself . any scientist will tell you that the best way to solve a hypothesis is to do the experiment yourself . i apologize for not having a phd in organic biology , making it so i can ' t publish an article and receive scientific notoriety . i have done the experiment myself in a perpetual grow , so my experiment was built up over time with grow charts  nutrient schedules being compared to lab results to find which nutrients best work for me as far as thc ratios . personally , running into carcinogen rates was a complete accident , but i varied my study around that eventually as well . let me guess something about you . you grew digit years ago under fluros inside a trash can and you consider the time away from growing as time spent growing . i have been holding the same argument and you say i am all over the board ? you realize that nh person shut up after he figured out i was right ? stop asking me to post an article and just post one yourself . i will post up my lab results if you find me an article . just because i have less posts and just digit days of being active on reddit does not mean you are a better grower than me . a reddit groupie is someone who reads things on reddit and acts like that was from their personal experience and thus acts like they have that much experience . i am sorry dirtyhands , but those pictures of everybody ' s plants does not give you their exact nutrient schedule , distancing from lights , environmental controls , and other variables . thus you can not claim that looking at a picture has helped your grow experience in any way shape or form . another thing , if you are going to use a level of vocabulary that is higher than your own , you may want to use a thesaurus or dictionary . substantiate is spelled s  u  b  s  t  a  n  t  i  a  t  e not s  u  b  s  t  a  n  c  i  a  t  e . fyi the catholic church used to say that there was no such thing as bacteria . they said that there was no science behind it . the catholic church also said science and god said the sun revolved around the earth . we now know that to be false and that they made false claims . in this instance you would be like the catholic church . " more posts " and not a " reddit noob " and i would be like galileo in this instance trying to prove someone else ' s theory rightnot my own just like galileo and contradicting what someone of " a higher power " dirtyhand thinks is common sense , but that " common sense " is coming from someone with less ability to comprehend information than a digit year old .
