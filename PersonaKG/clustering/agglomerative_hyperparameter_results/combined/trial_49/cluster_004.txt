10. well , if you drive a piece of shit that you don ' t care about your car and own a dash cam , you can skip the police report and body work and collect the insurance money . or , if you really were holier than thou , you could tell them not to worry about the slightly scuffed paint and go about your day knowing that you are the one shining light in an otherwise dreary world . your gonna have to bite the bullet on this one  if i didn ' t cause the minor fender bender , then it ' s not my fault .
   (ID: 306fcce176e83db604dac17838eed1e669cd5a90)

11. ability of judgment is not binary absent or present . your decision making procedure takes things into account using different weights for different factors when you are drunk than it normally does when you are sober . that can make you misjudge some situations and make undesirable decisions . i think you are just politically against people who use their drunkness to excuse their misbehaviour . yes they suck . but they may be telling the truth as well as lying and using it as an excuse , you never know .
   (ID: d048a45810866f7b853972f50c2c2746bc339a21)

12. well i  m sorry you feel that way . i would never hesitate to help an animal in every way i could , including  vibes  i am so sorry for your loss and apologize if i upset you , i was honestly offering my condolences but did include my own belief systems and experiences . maybe not entirely appropriate for someone who is grieving but i was just trying to reach out and offer some sympathy . i hope things get easier for you with time and again i am so sorry for your loss .
   (ID: e8fea87ced4a86b7ba9c50ae33cf5b3dda99af88)

13. i used to do this , but several times , not just once , there was someone already in my lane even though i was still partially occupying the left lane . i ' ll wait a few seconds and not get sandwiched between two idiots .

17. should not be a problem even if you get by yourself , just be confident . you do know how to ride and drive then it shouldn ' t be problem passing the test . as for not having a bike , i suggest you borrow a bike from any friend or relative because they don ' t provide the bike . last resort would be asking one of the people who have got their bikes for the test . for car lisence test they gave me the rto car maruti digit which was horrible but manageable to pass if you know your driving . go through an agency only if you don ' t want to fill applications and are very unsure about the procedure . i got mine done through an agency because i learnt driving through their school . if you know driving and riding i see no problem for you to get it done yourself .
