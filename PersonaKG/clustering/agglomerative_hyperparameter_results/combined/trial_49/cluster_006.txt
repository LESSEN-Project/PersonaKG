1. i ' m assuming this is america . she ' s the kind of person i like to inform that the us has no official language . because we are the land of immigrants .
   (ID: 40e9f2306751118eda95174d093680e74831a34d)

2. yes , she does have a job . it ' s minimum wage but it seems like i have no other options ? we have to move out for a year because that ' s how long session digit will help for , so i guess my hands are tied ?
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

3. i came home with terrible back pain to a drunken girlfriend who started verbally assaulting me , and when i told her " it is over , please leave " , she sucker punched me . it took almost a half hour to get her to finally leave , with the threat of digit .
   (ID: 6b941223c20a9903b9878d0454cc676e8d7db91b)

4. i get the feeling from what you  ve written that she  s saying this to make you jealous . i think you need to tell her that you  ve been thinking about it and it  s bothering you that she seems so hung up on her and talk about where you want to go from there . do you want her to stop seeing this girl ? do you want the communication to stop ? i think you need to decide what your ideal situation would be in regard to their current relationship . make sure she knows why you feel like this and how it makes you feel when she responds so quickly . if you guys are hanging out together why does she need to be constantly texting this other girl she used to date ? it  s not like they were only friends  you said she was in love with her and it  s inappropriate for her to still be this involved with her . i don  t know if this is useful advice but it  s what i  d do if i were in your situation . best of luck .
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

5. yeah i  ve noticed most people do regret not taking up opportunities . not sure why i don  t , maybe i should . congrats on your girlfriend though ! is it going well ?
   (ID: b1f9e512a76d2c07b1eae248bca4e0bf140d4bc8)

6. if i were to stay with her , i would try my best to give her attention back and be the best boyfriend i could be . that  s not how i could see myself as an asshole . the way i could , would be me losing my patience and leaving in two months .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

7. don ' t appease her for risk of breaking your lens , shes just being uncanny . let her come around , , , dont fold my guy its not worth damaging your lens . let her be passive , but when she comes around hold to your strong points you have in why you refuse to use it . but you realllllly shit the bed by using the word psycho ahahaha i mean like , its like if the story of rosa parks went way south ? like if people didnt have none of that sitting down shit . well , you just did that . ahah she will show you psycho now that you called her out . best wishes on that part .
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

8. ask her if she wants ice cream , anything special for dinner , to go see a movie , etc . it ' s pretty clear that she doesn ' t want to talk , and pressing will only make matters worse . but it ' s also pretty clear that she ' s having a bad time and letting her know that you ' re there for her in the form of things that make her happy could be a good move .
   (ID: 3adf883c491ca030d52ee22ed62e166c87ed0d5e)

9. I have a girlfriend.
   (ID: f6b8978c4b660719e17dff38ba86c988b9bf86f5)

12. I have a girlfriend.
   (ID: 36314aee005a03517f2446ec0da2834fe0f712d6)

13. no , absolutely not . if your wife is monogamous , chances are she ' ll stay that way . if you really want to get with this other woman , do your wife a favor and leave her . it ' ll be easier for the both of you in the long run . i just hope that other woman is really worth it , or else you ' re fucked .
   (ID: 8889ee4547e570f04696e9cc7b50124dca69b82e)

14. i constantly have this thought in my head . but i like her , and i dont want to follow the same route i always do and leave after a month  digit months .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

15. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)
