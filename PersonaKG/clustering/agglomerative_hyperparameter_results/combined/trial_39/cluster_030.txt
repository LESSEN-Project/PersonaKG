   (ID: fbed02b3d7caf00e8d1533f452f8951cf390df73)

13. happy apple , there are several thousand of them left over from the 70s in little antique stores and it literally just makes a pleasant jingle when the kid pushes it or touches it and then self balances like a giant weeble . will generally run between digit and digit bucks depending on where you live . you can also find them online on amazon or ebay but then you ' ll probably pay digit or digit plus shipping . fascinates them for hours at this age .
   (ID: 6aca29520994a85891e32b7ad6030791dfa1cbe2)

14. parting them out ? it seems like the cars that sit there are really common cars . maybe they use them for parts . like a mini  junk yard .
   (ID: 7f3ed7262bf05d9d101b2b917869b90e43710a7a)

15. they ' re a hot commodity .
   (ID: a5abb0fc49ef940b208bd33b46b6b669a13fc83f)

16. they are on the menu as a breakfast item in japan . the  frankburger " in the top row , second from the left to be honest , as much as i love hot dogs , i haven ' t been impressed with dogs at hamburger shops . burger king ' s dogs aren ' t very good and neither are a  w ' s . i can ' t imagine mcdonald ' s would be much better .
   (ID: c3739aee1cfa0a286d1056b5d9225e9d6e4f6547)

17. you can tell by the map , if there are a group clustered together far from the street than they are being hoarded . or if they say last ridden is digit days ago but last located was digit minutes ago those are hoarded . anything that says last located longer than a few hours is probably gone . you can change the search setting in the bottom right corner . i  ve gotten lucky with one  digit bird that looked like it was in a garage on the map , but was actually behind a dumpster . typically any yellow and red ones are hoarded though . if you report them as hoarded or missing they will disappear from your map .
   (ID: a154763d4a1c7d2d412ab13eeed4849772817d9a)

18. my daughter saw two , i ' d didn ' t see any . lack of effort on my part .
