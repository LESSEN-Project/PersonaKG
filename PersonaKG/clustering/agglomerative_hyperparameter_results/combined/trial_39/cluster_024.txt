1. this card is basically a zero mana discover a spell . u can either play the discovered card or another spell but either way you are still paying full price it ' s not that similar to glyph because the discount doesn ' t last . it ' s not a true discount like prep because the card itself costs digit mana . personally i don ' t think it will see any play outside of hagatha .
   (ID: a5abb0fc49ef940b208bd33b46b6b669a13fc83f)

2. to sign things in your name that ' s all i ' ve really used it for
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

3. its not a scam in that you actually get what you buy , but the quality of the product is sometimes not very good . also it can take a long time to arrive
   (ID: 1fb7025aaa0b620e024c8abbaecd72d34f8418b0)

4. i think it  s still better than any other  regular  shop offer though . as far as i can tell , the best always  available shop offer is the token doubler digit gems  box while this is very slightly cheaper digit . digit gems  box and you don  t need to grind to get it . it would be worth it if you wanted a better deal than digit gems per box and wanted instant gratification
   (ID: 26831d6557d17492ae3b0b54585b32e08055f834)

5. yeh and i use it , but this is just something special
   (ID: 20704d953f0b1774a4782d2f049f69736ac4eea2)

6. then you could tell me if it  s good or not
   (ID: 9c91f42953bc8f6d2f718503a1924734b9da6acc)

7. you should like it , just giving you a warning about the place that did it . tattoos should look their best fresh , the lines will only get worse over time .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

8. don ' t get it if you ' re not sure you ' re going to like it . remember you can back out anytime . even when they put the stencil on and it ' s not what you really wanted , speak up .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

9. i did last week . last time i saw it it was still clean . might go check it out tomorrow .
   (ID: e789abcb610f0a5f370e66d59303168a7ff3308b)

10. can i ask why ? and i mean that genuinely , i just never found it to be very useful or interesting at all
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

11. wait . i thought everyone kept it ? it ' s an incredibly rare pokemon you get at the start , and it ' s your best friend ! how could you justify getting rid of it ?
   (ID: c6b2000b95ec54c8393c3ab07cc2c5acd2563345)

12. do you want some pat on the back or something if you ' re right ? don ' t like it ? don ' t buy it . i ' m interested and i ' ll be buying it .  ! opinions are great , aren ' t they !
   (ID: a85910e837bd841373d8a7b2a84f1bff22807d9e)

13. i used it for my first digit weeks then i figured id switch to dark theme because most people say they like old reddit better , old reddit is way better so take your own advice
   (ID: 153d8b303a8e2cf2226dbc301822060e43ceab6c)

14. i completely understand how you feel , i also like to have a " signature " weapon . i think this is the kind of thing that you could ask them on facebook , maybe you ' ll get an answer .
   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

15. right , i can see why you would make that decision . i was thinking about the dark base too but i wasn ' t really sure about it . is it any good ? what can i expect from a case like that ?
   (ID: 2971f819c4d7400b9fa7806434e9037b6af4dfae)

16. i think you ' d save yourself a lot of grief by accepting that this weapon isn ' t for you . you aren ' t gonna get it , i ' m not gonna get it , it ' s purposed specifically for a group of players that we are not , and never will be , apart of . it ' s tough but i ' m pretty sure we can buck up and accept the fact that we aren ' t pretty princesses that get the whole world .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

17. buy it on sale . and no it ' s not . you must be wasting a roll a day or something .
   (ID: 88c65ad9c962da115240776d5aa110748286db73)

18. i was going to buy one too to wear to the premiere . how ' s the quality ?
