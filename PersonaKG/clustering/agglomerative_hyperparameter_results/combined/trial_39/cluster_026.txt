7. main her because she deserves to be mained by someone as kind as you . do it because playing her means tilting the enemy . that means you will laugh at them . which means you will have fun . main her because she is mechanical and hard . you will actually learn things with her . you will outplay enemies . that means you will laugh at them . which means you will have fun and satisfy yourself . do it because she is a drag queen and support the lgbt community . do it to suffer the same pain as us for getting no good leblanc skin in ages do it for the skin charity and make riot give us a skin . do it just for the sake of trying something new and getting addicted leblanc  drugs everything about leblanc makes you happy . what are you waiting for ? maaaaaaiiiiiin her .

   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

12. it ' s a possibility , but we won ' t know for sure for a while . i honestly wonder why she ' s so scared in those scenes . did she incur salem ' s wrath somehow ? or , based on the fact we don ' t see him in the trailer , maybe salem killed mercury as an example of what will happen if she fails her again ?
