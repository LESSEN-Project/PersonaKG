1. iirc , icf it says that doing too many taxes your nervous system . you can do more but you ' re over exerting your body beyond your muscles . i could be remembering that wrong .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

2. i know that op draws really well . i have seen his watercolor and it ' s really good . what i was trying to say is getting out of your comfort zone with drawing is a good thing and it helps improving . i mean to say that op should exercise drawing the things which he ' s not really good at . i said this because a lot of the characters he draws have really similar faces and can only be differentiated by hair and such . i meant to say  hey draw something different next time . people can get bored if you do the same thing . i didn ' t mean to sound rude . sorry .
   (ID: 22864f9484c3c6d7f8c8dac79c58ea32865eb794)

3. came to say this . it ' s frustrating when everyone you know can play something but you
   (ID: ab5524e568131ce7cb4db227daae4d0f489838e1)

4. yes that might work . what if there were objectives that needed to be accomplished on each platform , so people would need to dismount and do them .
   (ID: dccaef8a6226163d8d10afb2d04eb5a7babea832)

5. our desire for things in this world cannot exceed our desire for god . it is a christian belief that who we are and the good we do stay with us in to the next life . you are still you and thus the good things that you liked in life are still part of you . if the creating of beauty through music , art , etc . is a good thing it will exist still in heaven . how we will enjoy it then , i do not know . the book of job is problematic on many levels . first of all it is a marriage of a folktale the prose beginning and ending with the work of a first rate hebrew poet who inspired by the folktale creates the bulk of the middle . the essence of the folktale is that god tests our faith . the essence of the poetry that suffering that we endure has a purpose even if we cannot understand or know what that purpose is . very small children may believe the rules and restrictions placed up them by their parents cause unnecessary pain and suffering , but parents often know it is for their good .

6. you  d have to pay me a lot of money to try that out .
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

7. i wish , that would be cool if you only did it in some spots .
   (ID: 9f31985e70e208f2dc692e2c378f1707cedd3bc9)

8. sort of yes , it would be myself playing both characters so im arguing the technicalities of one guy being able to be his own " teammate " and how i could be such if i have no intentions to help or hurt anyone . but thanks for the thoughtful reply
   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)

9. if you are asking what i doing naked on the arena only wearing the cat mask fighting odogaron , the answer is yes
   (ID: f2ddf323cbf1466909e7e09f048b5e781f523d4a)

10. i apreciate that you think my art is worth stealing but i really don ' t mind . i don ' t make art for the clout , i do it to practice and get better . it ' s only one drawing , i can easily make another .
   (ID: 8f5b0c902ce9c2bf19ecdb9205cb3d9f2a7c14fa)

11. she  s a great artist . it looks just like it did in the show . tell her a bunch of internet strangers thank she  s cool .
   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

12. for me , i  m not an  artist  per se , but i am pretty good at art . i just see the idea , and look up pictures to help with details . an example would be a dog , you see all of the main parts and some parts you want to add your own flair to , but stuff like the fur you have to look up online to get a good picture .
   (ID: 6710bef520e10a3963d2983d4b36ef411e442f22)

13. i appreciate the offer , but i ' m trying to learn how to do this . do you have any advice you could offer me instead ? your song is very cool . i like how it ' s pretty stripped down but doesn ' t feel empty or lacking in anything . very chill
   (ID: cb830ff94bb369e5db655e15ee074f392a52c14f)

14. but then you have to rely on somebody else and it would be fun being a pseudo pudge to make some cool play or smth
   (ID: 2dcd820eac167adf18c6706f1c0a26a39eb945be)

15. why does what others think about it matter to you ? it will sell millions and you  ll be one of them . you do you man .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

16. great to know that it doesn ' t affect too much ! gotta work on my longer efforts now
   (ID: af5ee378b1abffcc7a909dba267af824a56225d0)

17. you aren ' t allowed to do that anymore you used to be able to buy seed there to attract them
   (ID: 2ce191fd1043183c73daf2ab41afee9b122fd42b)

18. i see nothing wrong with it , nobody else is speaking out about it , its nobodys problem but yours so it is a personal problem . im sorry not everyone is an expert 3d modeler like you are
   (ID: 8f5b0c902ce9c2bf19ecdb9205cb3d9f2a7c14fa)

19. we ' re all entitled to our opinion . i doubt you ' re an artist so you really don ' t have a say in the matter .
   (ID: 5a15ed606a86674cb48abaf9fee4375ff6bbff09)

20. ahh i understand , but you know why i  m saying  bad  ? because i  m surrounded by friends and family that aren  t into the art creation thing so i have to make something  good  so they enjoy it as much as i do because i love to share my work with people , also this is like the  mascot  of my brand that i  m trying to make so i  m trying to stay away from copying people because i don  t want any problems or any legal issues with anyone you know ?
