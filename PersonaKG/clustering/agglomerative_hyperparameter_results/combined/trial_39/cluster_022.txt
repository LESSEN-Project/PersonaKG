1. if you ' re serious about it , get the digit sample pack for all the papers . it ' s a lot better to see , touch and feel it in real life
   (ID: e2865528dd17e86320ca523d3db462efa29e7ca7)

2. the best way i found to get people into it is you put forth the initiative , buy the stuff you need , do some reading , and kinda carry everyone through it . if they like it then they  ll start to learn  do more as you go . also i  ve never tried it , but i  ve heard using the starter set is a great way to begin
   (ID: b2c623940e1acb4e269cab1c8f1920e03da9e429)

3. stephen miller . i just know he ' s plotting the downfall of the world , which is pretty drastic if i do say so my self .
   (ID: e3aadeaf18df437e62f5c1614d251bf343fd2de2)

4. i used to so many many years ago . i never had a bad experience but i wouldn ' t do it now . i ' m glad it ' s been a positive thing for you . i hope you find yourself tomorrow healthy and safe . what had you done beforehand to prepare , if anything ?
   (ID: 8797828a745ecd521e3b219ff004d26777b4f4f7)

5. one that  s starting to emerge is the comic book movie conduit for the audience character . the funny best friend who says shit like ,  whoa that was so cool  and  can i wear the suit ?  etc . all the stuff the audience is thinking essentially . it  s witty and self aware and already reaching the point of diminishing returns . michael pena from ant  man and the best friend in spider  man homecoming are perfect examples of this .
   (ID: 9cfb696c79a211a1c5a060dfb2265f65983eeeec)

   (ID: 2319e968bf60fef4f281e564c6b126147e06cc04)

11. i think you should start writing everything about it first and write off memory , then take inspiration based on other scps or whatever , so your true idea doesn ' t get lost in translation
   (ID: 93e3d10c1d0bffae76c0adb5d9a96d6abf1aade9)

12. you  ll go through about an hour or so of practicing the moves on the ground with the guys who will be strapped on to you , they never once talked about what to do if you wanted to back out , so the thought was never in your mind . when you get up in the plane , they  ll talk you through it while you reach altitude . when you reach altitude , you don  t have much time before they pretty much throw you out of the airplane . it was fun , i was excited to do it so i was never scared of it .
   (ID: fe5860fea6be29c69501e1a97b1240375d594aa9)

19. you know what ? just give her a tank , a straight up trigger tank that uses continuous bagworm  sheild  chameleon , it moves by scorpion  raygust that can easily be changed from legs to treads or even fins , hound minigun turrets and an ibis barrel , drops meteor mines like mario kart banana skins , lol and even throw in geist for uber carnage . chika does not even need to be the pilot , she can just be the battery and let someone else take care of the raw destruction , i ' m pretty sure shiori or yotaro would love to drive it round like an rc .
   (ID: 64ee30820164d5febf4618f35085fd26a3387cc9)

20. litterally just whatever i ' m thinking at the time , maybe it ' s just me but i always run scenarios through my head , decisions i ' ve made what ' s happening ect and so whenever i sit down been mostly writing in it while i eat lunch and just before bed  like right now i just write whatever i ' m thinking , my entry for today is digit pages already of a5 paper . part of it is just talking about a conversation i had at work and how i was being stupid , it might seem weird but writing down concerns about how i messed something up helps me realise it really wasn ' t a big deal , like at all . also just been keeping track of what im looking forward to , relationships with certain people stuff like that .
