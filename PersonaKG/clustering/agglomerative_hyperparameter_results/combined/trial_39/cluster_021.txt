   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

3. i want us to be different from animals . as naive as that may sound . i don  t want us to operate on who  s the luckiest , who  s the meanest , who  s the most aggressive . i want us to operate on our empathy for one another . that ability should set us apart from animals . humans should not be actively fighting for their right to be animalistic . you should want to be as human as possible and look out for your fellow man . when present with this question , my question is the opposite . why do you feel that healthcare isn  t a human right ?

5. a little bit of humor and sadness combined . my whole family , except my father due to a recent divorce , was sitting around my dog comforting him in his final moments . i was holding his head petting him when he threw up on me . i start saying " ewww " as i ' m balling my eyes out and my entire family just starts laughing and sobbing at the same time . i ' ll never forgot how my dog kept lifting his head up and looking around the room to see if everyone , including my father , was there . he wanted to make sure we were all with him before he passed away . unfortunately my father never showed up even as after we called  texted him to at least come say goodbye . it ' s sad how short their lifespans are . a saying i heard is that dogs have shorter lives because they come into the world know how to love , while people live longer so we can learn how to love . tl  dr  my dog threw up on me as he passed away and kept checking to see if everyone he loved was around .

14. the fear of spiders is not something humans are born with , it is something you learn . if your parents always start screaming and crying when they see spiders , you ' ll learn to think spiders are scary . dogs also don ' t have an instinctual fear of spiders , so they would have to be taught to fear them too . most dogs aren ' t afraid of spiders , so they don ' t have a born fear of them either . but i ' ve seen dogs that are afraid of spiders , and their owners are always afraid of them too , so it seems they can learn it too .
