1. wow . just wow . lol , just based on what he has , i don ' t think you could sell it even . get the feeling he might be younger based on some of the comments . good for you for being respectable tho !
   (ID: 1cf567904675ac1ca7b5a90612e5479a5b6c9bef)

   (ID: 97a098bef8517b2080cad8aa73f738b95e795b18)

6. since it ' s under the table , i ' m guessing the money your parents give you can be treated as a gift . as such , there would be no taxes owed or paid since it ' s not on record at least i ' m assuming your parents did not note it in their business expense report . since it doesn ' t sound like an actual " job " job , then i ' m also going to say that this isn ' t something you plan on writing on your job resume in the future . if that ' s the case , pocket the money and save  invest wisely .
   (ID: 3a74a7f224822b70fc5b403157367714c46b161a)

7. clothing from my relatives . i would take any other sort of gift and keep with pride but i do take pride in my wardrobe . i have the best family but i have my own style and i  m not wearing that t  shirt with a sassy quote on it that aunt jodie thought was so me . it  s not . not even close
   (ID: 18e18998471794de2ee0ded08a5f57a45a336e24)

8. groceries most likely , it ' s never been enough to do fun things with really . maybe if we moved it to a yearly event !
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

9. it depends on the scenario . am i just trying to make it to the next paycheck and i will get my item back ? if so then i ' d pawn a gun . if i ' ll probably never see it again i ' d go with some of the random electronics i have . an old cell phone , video game console , etc .
   (ID: 238107f17ccd21a5cb87efbd00d55a861389ba26)

10. would u ever think about selling some of the stuff , like the songs she wrote ? i love little things from the past like that and id totally buy one off you .
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

11. yeah that ' s what i was also thinking about , like i understand it was declutter but she kept saying how much she loved it and how good it was , i thought it was a tad wasteful tbh and she wouldn ' t of been able to sell it or give it to a friend as it was so used . yeah i think if it ' s a tutorial you could just show the colour and i ' m sure unless it ' s the rarest colour ever majority of people would have the exact same colour or similar in their collection .
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

12. these are really special ! can ' t say i ' m mad about the mattel dolls but i ' m not about them either , if that makes sense ! i ' m not hating on them is what i mean .
   (ID: 23d8dae7213e264b515a84a02f18e02f44dbe192)

13. you can get the back embroidered to say " proud dad " or " best father " or something like that to avoid anyone getting butthurt on him having it . the nex can do it or a shop in town . if you know any prs they may be okay with doing the embroidery for you .
   (ID: 7632dd7ebcb664bfada5fff420a436f42e3721d5)

14. a compliment . it ' s been said before in this subreddit i believe  you could give someone you don ' t usually to a compliment and they are likely to remember it for years to come .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

15. that ' s definitely a good choice , timex is a solid entry level brand with a long horological history . if you ' re still on the fence , or want other options , consider what style he will use the most . does he like intricate , mechanical things , or is he more into the fashion aspect of it ? what sort of workplace environment does he work in  is he outdoors and  or working with his hands a lot , does he wear a suit and tie ? do you want this to be a watch to only put on for special occasions , or more for everyday use ? does he own any other watches ? watches are often one of the only pieces of jewelry a man will wear other than a wedding band , so it ' s usually worth it to put some thought into it , which it definitely looks like you ' re doing so kudos ! if you decide on the timex , you ' ve made a good decision . if you want other suggestions and can help narrow it down a bit , i ' m sure we here at  watches can help you out !
   (ID: 2e34fbd58bc49726f7e8c74b8ea82513ca226ab4)

16. i figured is less pressure than doing happy events . have you ever heard of anyone complaining about funeral flowers ?
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

17. maybe . maybe . maybe . i can  t art but i sure can write ! so i guess i  ll just describe the dress then ? it would be really poofy but not so much that it doesn  t disguise his body from the neck down . it would be white with gold highlights running along it , with translucent gold shoulder pads with the askr insigniasymbol ? inside them . the veil would be white with touches of purple to match who he  s marryingits bruno . and also a gold bow on the back . i think that  s a detailed enough description incase anybody wants to draw it ! just credit me for the design please !
   (ID: 6f88a57b804dffb05f07ee78e02223947d9055aa)

18. i have no reasons . i just want one .
   (ID: 016485853897f1b9f422dd4da7d83e7e4a5261b0)

19. he typically does that but that is why he didn ' t do that this year . he knew it wouldn ' t be used on me , but for the kids or household . i understand that he was trying and i appreciated that it ' s a gesture of love . but i ' d honestly would have preferred for a non  material gift like a morning where he took care of kids and i go do my own thing which i got the following week after having this exact conversation with him .
   (ID: 0eb234eb32f4a74b31c625730bfcb4190d403d56)

20. you shouldn  t do it for money . you should do it for the exposure . i  ll post it on my insta , then all digit of my followers will see it . think of how busy you  ll be . did i randomly mention that my gf is in the hospital and the only thing she wants to see is this commissioned piece ?  s
