Total from this dataset: 9

1. i was ringside , and saw things that cannot be unseen . the way the room was set up , i had no choice but to see what was going on . all i can say is that i give women some serious credit for childbirth .

2. no , you felt the price was fair . that ' s literally that matters . the value of an item lies in what someone is willing to buy it for and what someone is willing to sell it for . things don ' t have intrinsic value . could you have paid less for it ? maybe . the cheapskate in me wants you to get the best deal you can . but ultimately got what you wanted for what you felt was fair and you are happy .

5. who know what they gave me . seemed like they were having fun .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

6. i didn ' t get to make that decision , i guess my mom did . what i ' m saying is it should be a decision made later in life cause i ' m pretty my sure parents based it on their religion . as i do not partake in christianity it should of been my choice .

7. i think you may be right i personally think it was a far better trade off
