1. it is identity theft . it will seriously mess with your living arrangements . be prepared for some fallout , it  s all your roommates fault assuming it is what it sounds like . i couldn  t live with a roommate after that , the trust would be gone for me .
   (ID: aa10be53ada3d17528c17c60feb64d0669aed98f)

2. bob why did you have to leave me . you were my only friend
   (ID: 34ec1eee47d9e01bd9a5b29f2d3b8f2098f875d3)

3. not a girl , not interesting , don  t have money , boring as hell , all of my posts  comments are fuller than my imagination . ugliness
   (ID: 1ab03d054f341c1ede82c7eb9f871db0a696e44d)

4. i think i ' m most myself around my best friend who i ' ve known forever . i think people are therefore most themselves when they are least focused on trying to present a favourable image of themselves , and think less about others opinions of them .
   (ID: a98df1d16d4e1204ace7856449444a3afbb80743)

5. coz it often is creepy af and unwanted . especially if the person sending the unsolicited msg hasn ' t even interacted with the receiver on the comment thread or anything . and a lot of people are very sick of getting unsolicited msgs , and yeah , it ' s really not hard to quickly write , hey is it okay if i msg you ? it takes like digit seconds , and either they say yeah sure and everything is all good , or they say no and it ' s a good thing you were respectful and asked . and honestly , why would someone have a problem with simply asking ? do they want to hide the fact that they ' re msging people privately ? why do they not want anyone to see that ?
   (ID: 3019ca7bd07e9287b998767b6d0eb22d6049a635)

6. you  ve been  insanely in love with  a girl you  ve talked to once and have seen digit times in total ? no offense but i think you need a reality check . based on what you  ve said there  s really no evidence to suggest she likes you so i  m wondering why you  re so certain she does ? there  s no harm in approaching her , but you need to keep it at a casual level , perhaps ask her out to get to know each other . also try to realize that you aren  t in love with her because that  s honestly weird to say .
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

7. look inside your soul and deep down , you know he thought that too
   (ID: 8b19433dbfb0ab3e6640baf68f77c1640fa8c330)

8. i think it ' s because people don ' t know themselves well enough before committing to a relationship . whatever they think they like about someone might turn out , over however many weeks or months or years the relationship develops , into incorrect assumptions , both about who their partner is , and who they themselves are . this could explain why many marriages among younger couples end in divorce , they might still be in the process of developing who they are as individuals and might literally become a different person through the ups and downs of various relationships .
   (ID: dc123ff47fa4f2e85bbecd444342fe7d8fcb7db5)

9. most people have some form of guilt built up especially if it ' s a recent occurrence . if you raised the concerns and genuinely wanted to unfold the truth and try to fix things i can ' t see a reason he would continue the affair .   x200b  if you ' re that concerned once you ' re together , get him in a quiet space where you both have timesomething like a car and ask if you can take a look at his phone . straight up , no gimmicks , just say " may i go through your phone to make sure we ' re both on the same page . you should be able to tell right away if he has something to hide .   x200b  however , be careful because this could stir something up that wasn ' t there in the first place . this brings us back to the main point , that being straight forward is always better than snooping . no questions asked if i was dating a girl and she snooped through any of my personal effects the relationship would be done .
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

10. if you don  t do anything to stop it it  s your fault as he sees that as confirmation u like it or dont mind
   (ID: ad24fe51d61dbe3cddd863ba9cb6adae61265a06)

11. this is what happens sometimes when guys marry without doing a lot of dating  casual sex . you have been with your wife a long time and never got to be a single guy . you didn ' t have an opportunity to date a lot so you really weren ' t used to hot digit  somethings showing interest . oveunder on the wife making him sell the truck ?
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

12. i mean , that ' s possible . if you ' d regret not asking her out then just ask . worst that happens is that she ' s not interested and you ' re at no different a spot than you already are . try not to think too much about how things could go in the future , because you ' re not there yet . one step at a time .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

13. i figured . then you definitely owe it to yourself to back away . you are being forced down a path you dont want for yourself . danger ! danger !
   (ID: 2904e4959568457dd43970d8388e42064d7c7d34)

14. thats extremely true . it doesn ' t mean you don ' t like the girl . even the most thunderingly beautiful , intelligent and witty girl ' s names are still just tiny pieces of information bobbing on the oily swirl that is the short  term memory of a preoccupied inebriate .
   (ID: 54c02bf73569d6b7f5a88c3d841a214eee1a4d14)

15. grew up educated not to believe such nonsense , got into a relationship where i was unhappy that we don ' t have the same views on a lot of aspects . somehow it worked and after a few years i realised that we complete each other  all we need to do is to talk
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

16. yes that  s ok . you can do and like whatever you want and not be made to feel guilty for that
   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

17. what world do you live in ? and first of all , i don  t think relationships should be based on how much money someone makes or if they make any at all . i believe you should be with someone you love and that it shouldn  t matter if they are rich or poor . this shit you  re saying here is really disgusting and i feel really offended by it , you should probably reevaluate your life decisions and just think a little bit before you say this type of stuff .
   (ID: d10c10d39129e1768465d09c5c492657be31ef47)

18. no one is asking you to change anything other than the way that you look at things . stop blaming other people for your lack of whatever . go out and make it happen
   (ID: 2e747482ae2ee3fe66b8436d9138eb2bba4a7c4f)

19. fuck yeah , i love my friends and family but there  s a whole universe out there
   (ID: f9e9b1e6c59393102159142841e750ea90023928)

20. fuck . it ' s very likely my dream girl will not mean with me from a personality standpoint . meaning there s no hope for a relationship , so there no point in putting in effort to make love
