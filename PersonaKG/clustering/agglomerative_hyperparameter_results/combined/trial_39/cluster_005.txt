Total from this dataset: 28

1. when one enjoys a book , they tend to be pulled through it , not wanting to put it down . if you notice a young person struggling , bored over a book , they are not enjoying it . figure out a game they like , and find a book that follows a similar character on a similar journey . if they like kratos , sit them down with some greek myths or percy jackson . but give them cather in the rye and they ' ll go into a coma rather than read it .
   (ID: 0f8bca5cd80e9429ae58bb976857e3c5ab057290)

8. i ' d also recommend showing your friends some of the really entertaining old films i ' d go with rear window , charade , and tootsie having friends who are into the same stuff as you can be very helpful , just don ' t start them off with really obscure stuff because you risk turning them off to old stuff if you show them something like the seventh seal or stalker first

   (ID: 298dd327349771a27c9a14437b3b5a53d0bd9e35)

11. try munchkin . it  s pretty simple and really funny , not to mention that there is like a card pack for any addition , like x  men , tmnt , more of just the original stuff . it  s also something that you don  t have to get really into or have a lot of people .
   (ID: 7424e4821daf78f7a38983c3e1a291ee7ce757d2)

12. i ' d actually go with something like the lost boys . or evil dead digit . or dead alive . or shaun of the dead . i think picking something that ' s a good mix of horror and fun is a good way to ease someone in . someone else said tucker and dale . yes , that ' s a good one , too . i love to tell people i ' m having " a doozy of a day . "
   (ID: 311d770ebb499b987db7e44fdae56456f45a5918)

14. i don  t . such an animated series requires an iq of at least digit  digit . i don  t know where you got your digit from . showing simpletons such a show would taint it . only a plebeian would ask such a question .
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

15. use any disney movies and you ' ve unlocked their genius . taking surreal and sometimes taboo themes and turning them into friendly kids movies
