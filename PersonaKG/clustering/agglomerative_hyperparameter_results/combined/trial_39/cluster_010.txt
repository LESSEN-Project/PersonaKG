1. youtube can be so nasty ! i didn ' t want to be too judgemental . for all i know this was last month . kid  time moves very slowly from what i remember .
   (ID: 2266c34274940e2ea1a22a3dee5a3cbcdad25f53)

2. i ' m glad every day that i didn ' t . it was traumatizing enough to know we lost her but then the ob ' s attitude just made it all so much worse . i couldn ' t make any decision about the lose of our child then . i hope other mother to be see this and follow their instinct . do what feels right for you . she has been talking and walking for a few months now . we are truly fortunate to have such a smart and advanced child .
   (ID: ca13e283de9a99b9eb1cf4f68eed33eccff74e35)

3. thank you , it really means a lot because it was a decision that i struggle with a lot of the time and have struggled with a lot since now that my mom is aging .
   (ID: 699bf0afe2f1405d2208320e80156a99e90d356e)

4. i remember seeing this on the news . that teacher is the best , and i wish i had someone like that when i was going through something similar
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

5. thank you ! its amazing but she is living up to her name . and yes i am already looking into better brakes .
   (ID: c11592c54f6061d979d11af92c6289790a5bec93)

6. thanks ! i was thinking of getting her like a crystal necklace just to help and also for christmas . i  m honestly not even sure that i believe in crystals but i know she does and would appreciate the sentiment . i  m a girl of science so i  m definitely all for going to the doctor , but a crystal may help her because she can  t go to the doctor every day . not to offend anyone but like almost placebo effect her
   (ID: 19d727be6c2cbac7b528c7c522e3aa512e48025f)

7. im crying at this story fsr anyways , im very sorry for you and your brother
   (ID: 1b5b08f1246e450c7da09e40c81570fba378da84)

8. i discovered i was pregnant at digit , almost digit . just like you i want to be a mother but i want to have a stable situation to do so . i just began college so it was a really bad news . however i live in france so all is paid with the social security it ' s called like that in france . i saw a doctor and i had to do blood tests and an scan to know the stage of the pregnancy digit weeks . then they gave me a drug which provokes a miscarriage . it hurts and there ' s a lot of blood and you ' re going to bleed almost digit month after that but it ' s not that bad , a labour hurts surely more ! i was alone during the abortion because the guy didn ' t want to be involved and i never said my parents , i was too ashamed and i didn ' t want them to be disappointed by me . i ' ll maybe tell them one day . don ' t feel stupid , you took the birth control , you just didn ' t have luck . it ' ll be okay , your boyfriend will certainly support you during this event . you ' ll never forget but you ' ll know you made the right choice and that when you ' ll be ready to have a child , you will offer him a great life .
   (ID: 862cb85d93fa9b931c3c64cf2fd17ef592d48c50)

9. thank you for spending the time with your child . i wish my parents didn  t work so hard all the time because i could never see them . trust me , they  ll be grateful you were there for them because not a lot of parents are . i wish more people would spend more time with their children because it  s very important to their development . she  ll only be in your hair for so much longer . keep up the good work !
   (ID: 74d9c413c2cf59d223d7510b599edf6b6b1df3a2)

10. even if things go horribly worst case scenario it literally does not matter and wasn  t meant to be . anyone involved will forget about it quickly . if it goes well , it goes great ! and will only get easier . just trust yourself to get through it . also , i carry a small bag when i  m feeling anxious  nauseous so i can throw up in a clean manner in an emergency if i need to . i hope it goes well ! good on you for taking difficult steps , be proud !
   (ID: 4f1b65a581332b9d19507ccf0e921d0967e013e7)

11. i ' m going to use that fact , ' when you talk it feels like music to my ears ' fucking romantic .
   (ID: 4a03851d25b2526583af78261bff2af13796094e)

12. i hope you get to spend more time with her yet . long life is one of the perks of having a small dog , but it also means you have more time to get attached to them . i ' ve had mine for most of my life . i can ' t imagine him not being there when i get home , not sleeping my by side , not waking me up at digit am to go outside .
   (ID: b863480affffa35b0ead5c7bc5daa4c4099c0cee)

13. she loves hugs so i  ll be very happy to do this favour for you
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

14. your mum , by the way , when is she free ?
   (ID: b62d2865206257ab4ea65a5e489f9d4e1c8d5e9b)

15. as cliche as it sounds , there ' s very little you can do to help him if he doesn ' t want to help himself . i ' d recommend letting him know that you know he ' s using , don ' t make any threats , but let him know that his habit is hurting you and that you ' re concerned . for the most part it is outside of your control . that ' s the beauty and the curse of free will  we can choose for ourselves , but not for others . my half  sister estranged herself from my family because of her drug use . despite multiple rehab attempts , two broken marriages , and a move across the country and back she didn ' t change . sometimes people aren ' t willing to . i wish you and your brother well .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

16. glad you realize how cringeworthy that was  kudos to both of you for growing together and laughing about it !
   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

17. my gram is digit and my grandpa died ten years ago . we ' re all individuals , but her biggest complaint is that she ' s lonely . i think you could ask her what she wants , does she want to talk , be in someone ' s company , or alone ? i do worry that sometimes even when someone says they want to be alone , it ' s not always for the best as they may be just wanting to hide and be in pain alone . if there are interests of hers where she is with other people , i ' d encourage that and offer to help get her to those outings if she is unable to get there herself . i think you could make it a routine of visiting her or doing one of those activities , eating a meal or a few meals a week with her as a routine . i ' m not sure how much time you have or whether your family members have time to do the same , but you could set up a bit of a schedule .
   (ID: 345fbf1e655edda9a5f8099ba480dfe0a7a0bd47)

18. thank you so much . my dad also gets worse at christmas . it ' s horrible when you anticipate that special days will be ruined by them , it ' s really hard to not expect it . for me anyway . you ' re a good person for supporting her effort at recovery , i know that ' s a tough road . maybe next year i ' ll spend the day not at home we live on the same property . thanks again for your kind thoughts red  heart
   (ID: 8b7590cb8502d6abd38b320b842aa7642186b6d8)

19. if it was this next month , i ' d likely just cry . our kid is due in digit weeks . i ' m happy not being her .
   (ID: 1cf567904675ac1ca7b5a90612e5479a5b6c9bef)

20. that ' s understandable , i ' m sure the pain and study are more than hard enough to deal with without him making matters worse for you . i hope you can see someone helpful soon !
