1. i can understand that . so tom is still in denial about leaving the bandwhich i mean he probably still owns it unless mark bought him out and was talking in an interview awhile back about wanting to bring blink under his production company and let them make music as they please and all that stuff . so idk im interested to see the state of the band and were it goes on in the next few years with them if tom really does still own parts of it and stuff . kinda suck to see matt get kicked to the curb though if he comes back .

   (ID: 25a3a19690cf520ebb090d792f9aab864cc59254)

20. conspiracy theories . it ' s not as much a new trend , as one that has been blown up by every lunatic with a stray thought having ready access to millions of other lunatics . it ' s been my experience that two people can ' t keep a secret about where they ' re going that evening , much less god knows how many people keeping a secret like a fake moon landing , or wtc , or sandy hook , or all the other idiocies that abound .
