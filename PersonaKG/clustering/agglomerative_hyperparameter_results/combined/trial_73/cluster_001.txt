1. absolutely go with him . good odds on what he ' s offering is better than what i have now . bonus  if it sucks there , too , at least i had a transitional period of hope before business as usual .
   (ID: 2988ee1cd7a2bcf8e2d215c795ee2d06a985665a)

   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

   (ID: 6938adfadf158e773c1a81f3c3b4f7ef1aed3881)

4. that ' s awesome ! thank you for the knowledge . and that he is . which is why i was saying that if he had done this off the leash it would have been golden . but it ' s still pretty fantastic .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

5. he ' s definitely lucky you were there when he lost his family . you also seem to be very lucky to have found him . he ' s so damned adorable .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

6. naw , it ' s doubtful . his wife also works there , and she is both gorgeous , and keeps a close eye on those he hires as his secretaries . in fact i am pretty sure it did the hiring . besides , if he was going to cheat on her , why would he pick someone who looks so similar ? i just wonder how a guy who has digit kids doesn ' t know what it sounds like for the woman to give birth . like during the call for example , towards the end , he was amazed that she knew what she was doing , and she laughed and told him it wasn ' t her first time  he knows full well we have digit children at home . he ' s here for supper at least every few weeks so they can go over work while i take them out for some quality time .
   (ID: 720bf2762acb0f756492e6e40ae840126dae87ce)

   (ID: 7d84a169d4ddae2aee36640f218ff2b5b534792d)

9. reddit , anime , his twitter and marijuana
   (ID: 5a15ba0aaa5a6e6f9e3a2db25befda6ec40a9b88)

   (ID: 664b365f80ff1d51db95866fada8009f14d8e9b1)

   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)
