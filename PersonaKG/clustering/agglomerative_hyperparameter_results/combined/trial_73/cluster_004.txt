4. you really simply do not understand logic , do you ? let me spoon feed it to you , since you ' re such a little dumb baby  from your perspective , your beliefs are correct . which means you should be putting them out there . if you ' re right , you ' d be helping people . but you don ' t do that , because you ' re a fucking coward . from a logically sound perspective , however , your beliefs are completely unethical . why ? because you are selfish , and only give a fuck about your emotions while compiling them . as a result , you completely failed to base them on evidence , or reason . if you cared about logic , you wouldn ' t dare believe the bullshit you believe . doing so would be a fucking embarrassment . see , your confusion is what happens when you hide like a little cowardly fucking bitch . this is also what happens when your beliefs have such low standards  you aren ' t accustomed to needing to make sound evaluations , because you don ' t do that to yourself . you ' re logically fat and lazy . so now , you meet someone like me , and you can ' t see the differences between logical arguments that should be obvious simply because you never behaved like you ever had to . see ? those beliefs effected your behavior . they effected your abilities to use reason as a tool for discourse . and because those beliefs have low standards , you have low reasoning ability . if you demanded a high standard of yourself , you would have never made such a basic bitch mistake . see how i ' m right now ? see how beliefs effect behavior in unexpected ways ? you ' re welcome .
