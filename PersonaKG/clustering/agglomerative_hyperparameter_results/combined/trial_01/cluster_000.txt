12. first off , i like the thinking behind this and it was really well thought out . however i think i  d have to disagree with this . i feel like euphoria is trying to be as original as it can . they make it like no other show that i know of , and i feel like they are creating their own plot . but if this is some version of romeo and juliet , i wouldn  t necessarily be mad about itexcept for the fact that fez would die plz no .
   (ID: c0f309bee7152ab458da8ec03fbb1e17fa2876cd)

13. sometimes , growing up means discovering how little you have holding you together with your family members . it is pointless to try to sustain problematic relationships . it always ends in heartache on both sides . i mean , if you like each other , fine . i ' ve just had the opposite experience , and haven ' t been in touch with my family for a long time . there ' s baggage that we don ' t want to deal with . we are doing our own thing . and you know , maybe familiarity does breed contempt . some people really mean it .

16. thanks all . i ' ve done a large scale crown lift on the tree , so hopefully shouldn ' t be too bad with the light . it ' s a neighbour ' s tree but i took as much advantage as i dared when they said i could do what i wanted to it . the area got a fair bit of sun in the summer last year , before i cut the tree . so will risk it , i don ' t really have much option to go elsewhere with the plots . the daikon  green manure idea sounds good . but can i resist the urge to get growing veg this year ?
   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

17. yeah i think it ' s strange that first man got snubbed for every category that it was picking up nominations for .
