4. i have a friend who is a caregiver and the way he describes it it is the worst possible thing in could imagine doing for someone with bad social anxiety . he doesnt work with elderly but with disabled young adults and he says every little social interaction is so important . he says if the " clients " think they can get away with something they will . moment of weakness where they got their way ? you ' re basically their bitch and they will never listen to you again . look at them the wrong way ? literally get charged and assaulted . he has to take some of them and literally bathe them . how would any of that be ok for someone with anxiety ? constantly looking after someone is the worst possible thing in could think of . the point is to not deal with other people , not have someone dependent on you .

12. i couldn ' t tell from your post if you had tried this or not , but spanking is a good way to start . start slowly and get him aroused , then increase the intensity . it ' s a good way to learn together the proper balance between pain and arousal . it takes practice . start with your bare hand , then introduce a brush , etc as your comfort level increases . done properly it can be incredibly erotic . when you ' re comfortable , introduce verbal dominance as well  tell him he ' s been a bad boy and you ' re going to punish him , that sort of thing . i ' ve found it most effective when my wife whispers these things  it sets a very intense mood .
