   (ID: b6567f005c34603036e6119544386ff4f12ec3a9)

8. i really really hope i don  t get hate for this , but there is the medication like you said . but diets have helped people . there might not be proof from a medical standpoint , but people do post their stories with diet with updates , and some of them end up clearing completely like psoriaisbuddy on youtube . auto immune protocol diets as an expample . anyways , just suggestions .
   (ID: 79b35c8caff79f47f37bb4856cc6b57bcd49e5bf)

9. okay , this is really interesting question . i ' d like to know why the fuck dont you flush and give another person a huge anxiety and act so awfully . not the dude asking the question , but those who don ' t flush the shit .
   (ID: 8487a8406f04273c554e2e578c3a667648916790)

13. it is but it ' s better like that , plus if i really don ' t want to continue i just break up and appreciate my privacy again until the depression comes back .
   (ID: a80b8bc356414690d849369456d68876c95d5518)

14. doing what you want and whatever it takes to be happy .
   (ID: f2cec4af782c7d455288420e90648dc9c6d12538)

15. that really hit me hard man , but not as hard as that weed might have . at least someone else was able to have a good time for your sacrifice
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

   (ID: 395865cc8932d0b3d13214bce052e8915f32835b)

19. killing yourself is really hard to do . not only working up the nerve to attempt it but actually doing enough damage to die . my first attempt was at digit and i ' m continuously getting closer to death but fuck why does it have to be such a challenge ? why cant i just be done already ? i used to think if i suffered enough something would kill me out of universal pity or something like that but reality is if i really want to check out i and i alone have to do it . nobody is gonna hold my hand through it . in fact people will do the opposite no matter your reasoning .
   (ID: f46d1bfdfed7fc05bbe39789c092019944471e9d)

20. never assume how someone is feeling . it really hurts when people say " you look happy " " you dont seem depressed " " stop trying to seek attention " . you can never know how someone is feeling and always assume people are telling the truth when they tell you they have problems . people have different ways of dealing with their problems around people .
