17. yeah ! digit . cube inside a cube isn ' t a tesseract . digit . according to marvel , tesseract is a stone  object which converts random energy into usable energy without wasting any energy . but here this is just a cube which observing energy and just emitting the same energy which is stored inside the cube . digit . it implies that 4d object can fit inside a 3d object , which isn ' t possible , which makes the whole tesseract thing a flaw and eventually rest of marvel creations . digit . so i asked why can ' t marvel build a tesseract which was a mistake , my question should be as you mentioned why can ' t the the company marvel build something like an actual tesseract instead of some random cube . digit . they could have choose another name instead of a tesseract , which itself defines as 4d model . but i guess marvel can do better than just a glowing cube regarding what their story is completely based on . it ' s like iron man made out of plastic . correct me if i ' m wrong !
