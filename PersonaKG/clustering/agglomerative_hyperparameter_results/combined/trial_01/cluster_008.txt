2. wow i am so very sorry he dropped that on you like that . i ' m sorry you are feeling the way you are . but it seems like he genuinely did care for you and that he wants the best for you . judging by the note it seems like he is being respectful to you . to be honest when i first opened the image i was expecting some horrible words . but they were gentle , kind and sincere . written with truth . give him that . don ' t demonize him for your own sake . i ' m sure this is a big shock for you . maybe he just said you weren ' t intelligent to throw you off and be more mad at him . maybe something is going on with him . i don ' t know what to make of it . but at least he didn ' t rip you a new one in the note . and you will heal . i promise you will heal from this .

5. it would be overwhelming to articulate this subject , martin w ball does the best job at it look up your mate tom podcast with martin , one quote of martins there is just reality as it is  a unified being of infinite awareness that is playing with itself as an expression of itself . everything and everyone in all places and times is merely god interacting with itself , and it is you .

16. look at the sun first . then look at the data of the other planets in the solar system . you may find that there might be something similar going on ? you may also want to look into nasa ' s current observations on sunspots and solar activity and the average temperatures since this sun cycle ended . either your suv is reaching and has changed the heat of pluto  or . well , maybe i ' ll let you be the observational scientist . meanwhile , all the climate projections have been wrong since mr . gore ' s power point presentation . why ? it deals mostly with carbon dioxide , not the sun   and not a single climate projection that i have reviewed has ever taken in account of the heat sync ability of the earth ' s oceans .

17. i ' m sorry if i was confusing in my reply . i ' m not trying to discourage anyone . i actually consume soy products daily . i was trying to convey that if you are concerned with phytoestrogens you should check with your pcp . i would also tell a meat eater the same if they are concerned with a certain aspect of thier diet .
