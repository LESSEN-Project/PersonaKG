4. jesus no we didnt need a whole other film but i thought they made some questionable choices for the last act . visually i thought the snapped heroes returning was pretty meh . it shouldve been strange leading them out of digit massive portal , instead we get t ' challa first . why ? and the whole assemble felt too spaced out . get rid of all the filler warriors and have the main heroes together and get a better run  up action scene , they shouldve used the angle that was in the infinity war trailer that had hulk running through wakanda .
