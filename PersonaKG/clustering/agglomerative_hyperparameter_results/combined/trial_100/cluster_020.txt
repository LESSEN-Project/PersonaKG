1. i ' ve personally faced violence for being a transman more than once , and i live in a really bigoted place filled with truly awful people . i totally get where you ' re coming from  the point of my comment was actually to point of that transmen face their share of issues with being trans . most commonly , in my experience , misogyny that reduces us down to genitals and the use that men can have for them .
   (ID: 77e0b8c51dfb89ff57bd838b86ee4d78a9fe856f)

2. I use ios.
   (ID: 8a3698ce1bb32ad286b9d5063f6279b8c23a8f14)

3. i like facts and reason . why do you use words you don ' t understand ?
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

4. their goal is survival of the regime beyond all else , killing the us president and killing thousands of south koreans would not be useful for that purpose . it ' s likely that they would only use artillery  nuclear weapons when they feel there is no hope of survival for the regime .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

5. i can ' t stand instagram however i don ' t like the people who use the site , you do you , if you want to use that cesspool of garbage , that ' s fine . the reasons i strongly dislike instagram , is particularly because it is made by the owners of facebook . i ' m not saying reddit is superior , or anything like that it is just because of the history of facebook , history of anti vax users . i

6. your phone is what you use for porn .
   (ID: cfd691d6aeaf46cc644b0e21187d10dfc62b0bc8)

7. so you use static ip on the . machine instead of doing a dhcp reservation that seems like a headache i use static and its a horrible idea
   (ID: da770212ea31887c4be30925213eff0dc5d8687b)

8. I use mobile.
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

9. only slightly sarcastic . it annoys me when people use obscure acronyms without explanation and expects everyone else to know what they mean . this is reddit . you have a digit , digit character limit on your comment , and it ' s basic common courtesy to make your comments legible . if you ' re going to use an acronym , at the very least you should explain what it means . i honestly have no idea what those acronyms above mean . i don ' t have regular interactions with the police , i don ' t work for the police , and google is pretty shit at figuring these things out because acronyms can mean whatever you want them to mean without context .

10. wait wait . i get it . you do this before you use it . i totally understand you . why haven ' t i never thought of this before . i ' ll think of you next time i ' ll shit at my homies '

11. does it have to be with sccm ? you can use group policy preferences to accomplish the same thing .
   (ID: f8d48136e1ccbc739d4b7fb8db1e8f668422b145)

12. the post says not to bring a kuruma or other armored vehicles . you replied to my post , you must have that that digit statement . so what do you do ? you wring a car with weapons in a heist with you to use it in that heist . i couldn ' t care less if you used it to drive around in and then parked it at the side of the road . instead you decided to use it . i have explained why i rather not have people use those cars makes it more difficult for other players because enemies scatter , the passengers never gain any decent gun skills because the vehicle is doing all the covering for them  generally speaking people who drive armored vehicles are douchebags who ram into each other with their cars or drive over people . still using your car is the douchy thing to do if people ask of you not to use it .
   (ID: b25bdf3935142c93d642393810cba283ec3b801f)

13. you just completely contradicted your argument , you just said that the next person will use their phone and at that point you do need that phone . and how long do you think that the next person would randomly stroll up to you and be like ,  oh my , are you stuck ? let me call digit for you .

   (ID: 12a4255ed85f0655e8fd899838bf98179465eded)

15. as someone else said , you need to go with it . two ways to do it  have a comeback . you said you ' re not good at it , but keep trying to think of some even after the fact . if they ' re falling into patterns with what they ' re saying , you should be able to use one of those . build off one of their digs and take what they said one step further . part of this might all be part of being low man on the totem pole , but you want to show you have some edge so you ' re not always that guy . good luck op .
