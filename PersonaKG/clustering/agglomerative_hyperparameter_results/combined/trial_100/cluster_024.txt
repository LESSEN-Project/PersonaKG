   (ID: 3f0409a6efb16c26d2f9f7a14f5e75b8945ba427)

2. for once in my life i thought i had a close group of friends i could be close to and be happy with . we  d hang out regularly and support each other . it felt so nice to have this . one day they asked me to hang out but instead i was told i was being a bad friend . there were some legitimate concerns i could work on fixing but it was almost entirely petty issues . we talked things out for a couple of hours and by the end of it , things seemed to be sorted out and we could work our way back to the way things were . on another day i decided i  d say some of my concerns . these were things i wanted to say but couldn  t because it was digit v  digit and i was under a lot of pressure . when i spoke up i was ridiculed and almost everything i said was denied . it was a barrage of hurtful comments , ending with something along the lines of  you were never considered a friend , and you will never be a friend  . almost all of them cut me off . some stayed out of pity they felt bad about what they said . it turns out that they had a separate group without me for nearly a year , and they had been talking crap about me behind my back long before that . unfortunately not the first time this has happened but it  s still just as painful . i just wanted friends i could be myself around and now i  ve lost that .
   (ID: 7df89b558f49c9f710c5f928f61dae67f52229c7)

3. i know someone said this already but i ' m saying it again because it got lost and i couldn ' t second it  if your parents ditch your wedding and your own father leaves you to walk down the aisle alone never speak to them again . never let them meet your children . ever ! all the other advice about talking to your parents ahead of time is good but what comes after they make their decision is just as important . i wish you the best of luck in this and the best on your wedding day , which should be solely about you and your fiance . how many days in your whole life are solely about you ? this one day . you absolutely deserve to have everything be just the way you want on your day .
   (ID: d51e2f0207b67be3748f59fc0b78f82cd1e47a1c)

4. why care what other people think ? as long as your both safe it really doesn  t mater sand end of the day people are going to talk whether you do good or bad . it  s your life , live it how you see fit .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

5. than do it . i suffer just like you and at the end of day i must be emotionally responsible for my own negative and positive energy . who cares if kojima likes to mess with us . go live your life . you  re going to die one day  don  t waste it frustrated about some dude over in japan or trolling reddit posters for a quick sense of power . these things will haunt you on your death bed . life is about giving and what i  m asking for in this thread is we give both kojima and ourselves a little more space to just have fun with the whole thing !

6. let him sit and watch tv all day . ask him what he likes . tell him stories about the two of you and your favorite show  time together . listen to any of his stories , even if they are ridiculous . don ' t expect anything from him , so when he does remember it will be a gift . rotate caregivers frequently to avoid burnout . check out local care facilities , cost , and requirements . join a support group .

   (ID: 34de9309a5c02867b676757fa019c58a66bad300)

8. thank you for your answer . that ' s interesting how yours kinda sticks with being with other people . i scared a new acquaintence of a friend , i went from a feminine state to a strong masculine state during a conversation and my body language changed . as it ' s going to . normally my gender " feeling " isn ' t so far down the spectrum on either side but it was that day for some reason . she thought i had been " possessed by a male spirit " and i was like " yeah . my male side . it ' s still me . happens " but honestly i wasn ' t sure if it happened to others thru the day too or if most people just wake up with what they feel that day . so i appreciate that yours can also change . i feel better .

14. day digit  got the patch test added to my back . it was kind of annoying at first because of how it felt like my back had a brace on it . my shirts kept getting stuck on the tape as well . day digit  my shirts still got stuck on the tape , but i figured out how to lay down with it on . the tape started to itch really badly . day digit  i was told that i was smelly by my brother , but other than that i was fine . the tape was really itchy at night , but i just ignored it . day digit  i went and got the test removed . removinf the tape felt like a wax and was very uncomfortable but it wasn  t that bad . i had a lot of tape irritation . the only patch that my doctor is concerned with is  digit hydroperoxides of linalool , commonly found in fragrances , cosmetics , and hygiene products . i was told to wait a couple of days and to see if it got any worse because right now they can  t say for sure that it is a positive match . the other splotches are either dyes or common reactions , like polka dots from cobalt . i went out and bought fragrance free shampoo  shaving cream . now i just got to convince my girlfriend to do something similar . i hope you all are fighting the good fight ! don  t hate yourself because of eczema ! it  s just your body is confused and fighting itself ! don  t worry ! be happy !

19. and i was merely saying that day after day of the same kind of work , it was inevitable that you would get some build up in those deeper nooks and crannies of your fingernails . especially by the end of the week . my girlfriend at that time thought it made me look more masculine since it showed i worked with my hands .
