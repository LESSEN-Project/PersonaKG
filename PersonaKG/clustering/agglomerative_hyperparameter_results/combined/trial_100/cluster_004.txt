Total from this dataset: 71

1. ha i agree but in your own opinion with this scenario who would you go with and why ? based on what you know from comics ?
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

2. so what , you think an echo chamber is better for the community ? because i am being civil , i am following this sub ' s rules completely , and i am defending my points even if you don ' t agree with my defense or my points . the only possible reason for me to not be allowed to post here is because you personally disagree with the point i am making . that is not a valid reason to silence someone , and removing everyone with an opinion that differs from the preconceived notions of the community is how you build and echo chamber and kill all legitimate discussion all together .
   (ID: a22b82fe301caa42c89cbd71b2e3733753f695d9)

3. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

4. that ' s very true , i agree . but at the same time , i think " why don ' t give this life we ' ve got everything we have since it ' s not going to make a difference anyways , so why waste it ? "
   (ID: eca32d278abf2524af02edbb3cc3041ed8b0b880)

5. sure it ' s avoidable . kids can be very reasonable if you know what you ' re doing and address the problem correctly . let ' s say your young child does something wrong , and you spank them . do you think they really understand what they did wrong  why it was wrong , or are they suddenly behaving because they ' re afraid of being spanked again ? fear based discipline like that can often create kids that are better at hiding their bad behavior around authority .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

6. i agree ! to pretty much anyone in a western  hemisphere or of european lineage context it  d be a fist fight . but , in their context though they see it as innocent not to say it  s not ignorant of medical conditions and genetics , etc , caring and a less awkward way of telling a person they  re getting pudgy . if someone was really offended they would be profusely apologetic , but also completely not understand what they did wrong and still chalk it up to a foreigner not understanding the culture .
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)

7. i agree . especially a punisher rear slide plate cover . unfortunately a prosecutor can turn anything around and convince the layperson of wrongdoing . from what you saw with the young guys . officer how many hours do you spend in the gym ? how many hours do you practice with your firearm ? so it is more important for you to be stronger to carry more ammo than to be proficient with your gun ?
   (ID: 05dea10a374f0f09c767062f0a3d0b51b6d20b9d)

8. too be fair i never even came close to defending nazis so yes i agree with you on that
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

9. that still sounds like you are condrodicting yourself , someone can not be smoking hot and also be unattractive . but whatever , agree to disagree ?
   (ID: ba841e2486d1df5b5baefde5ead0636c7c03c79c)

10. i agree , they were quite trigger shy about embracing some of the more overt comic conventions that they believed wouldn ' t translate well to live action .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

11. why don ' t you agree with this one ? i feel like it ' s true becouse in the end you are the master of almost every outcome of your life .
   (ID: 4a03851d25b2526583af78261bff2af13796094e)

12. i agree . i originally misread the intention of this post and upvoted it . rescinded that upvote when i understood the intention . granted , i ' m only an occasional watcher of episodes post  season digit , so i don ' t know anything about the lisa stories the user who replied to you before me mentions .
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

13. thanks for all the comments i ' m truly elated , i ' ll do a deal . when we win the league , i ' ll come back to the best city in england and share this beverage with anyone that is up for a life threatening  dare experience , save this post and we will all agree a place to meet , stream it and open this bad boy , and all that attend get to taste it . what say guys ?

14. regardless of whether you agree with him , he ' s a fantastic speaker and debater .
   (ID: 0eb78cb406a9dd9e14938eca8822e3bb1e1ad60a)

15. got to agree , this is the first comic i see that doesn  t make me feel bad for john . oh yeah , it also made me laugh .
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

16. that i can understand . i communicate with him whenever he visits , or i would give him a call once a month . but i would agree that i don ' t share my feelings with him .
   (ID: 011a531fc3f706d76441a0f95cc8091fd4453dd8)

17. i ' m not sure where that stuff about lies propaganda and bullying came from i do agree with it tho but reason isn ' t inherently tied into things being fun or interesting , in fact fun is one of those things that we refer to as subjective , thing that may be fun to some people may be not be others there doesn ' t need to be any particular reason to enjoy anything
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

18. to be fair i used to think this . i agree that some women are not funny . however some men aren  t funny either . usually if you don  t like vagina jokes don  t watch amy schumer . she is the female equivalent to louis c . k . i do recommend you watch catherine ryan  s special on netflix for you to change your mind .
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

19. blowing up cargo isn  t griefing i disagree . in my opinion griefing is defined by the community of a game . most people agree that destroying cargo is griefing , that is the majority in the community , so by that logic destroying cargo is griefing . now ofc you don ' t have to agree with my statement considering i do not agree with yours too . now if destroying cargo is something that you can do , then it becomes a simple question of morality . you are able to " sacrifice " someone else ' s happiness and effort for momentary relief , sure go for it . don ' t get me wrong i don ' t judge you for being a bad human being , but not everyone is seeing it like me . would you say you agree with my statements ?
   (ID: d650356549ff32c6bfb797b13c80b5a0d715da36)

20. i liked that slightly in  depth breakdown of what you think is going on ! i have to agree with you that something is going on , digit  d  s state is concerning , light coming out of his eyes and all , didn  t russel do that when he was possessed ?
