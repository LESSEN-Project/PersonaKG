8. kim kardashian . i dont think she has said or done anything to hate her . i think that her family have a succesfull business and know how to manage it and i never saw them make a scandal appart from kim ' s sextape . the only annoying thing is how much attention they get but thats thanks to media and people bitching for why are they famous every single day .

12. love saying  yeet . mostly cause you can just emphasize different parts of the word , plus i ' m just a loud boy  o so it does me good . hate  the word ' hate ' in all honesty . too hurtful of a word , i just say strongly dislike or was mediocre . hate is such a strong word towards some things people just dislike .

16. thanks for the reply . would you be okay if they didn ' t wear their uniforms and instead marched as a group like companies do wearing a t  shirt that said which police force they were from ?   x200b  i guess what i ' m trying to figure out is if people just hate police being allowed in the parade all together or if they just don ' t want them in their uniform . i see a few comments on these type posts where people just seem to hate police period .   x200b  i feel it ' s important to mention that i didn ' t get that impression from you , which is why i decided to ask you for your opinion . i figured i ' d get a well thought out answer , which i did . so thank you for that !   x200b  p . s . reddit formatting is always a surprise , for me anyway . haha .

18. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .
