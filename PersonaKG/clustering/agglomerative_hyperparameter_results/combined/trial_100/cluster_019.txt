   (ID: 9e2852bcfafecccb1e60211326f5fc70d0bbb428)

5. for some the shittiness is worth it to have a kid at the end of it . plus , brains tend to protect us by diminishing the memory of how shit the process was . there  s also some women who have  unicorn  pregnancies and feel mostly fine the whole time . maybe the woman got pregnant by accident but can  t or won  t abort . the existence of babies doesn  t disprove the fact that pregnancy can suck worse than you think it does . you think i  m arguing because of my  hurt feelings  ? lmao . i  m arguing because i disagree with your views on something you  ve never gone through . imagine if i told you  broken bones don  t suck as much as you make it out to be , stop complaining  but i  d never broken a bone whereas you had . you  d think i was full of shit . where did i say pregnancy is the ultimate suffering ? honestly at this point i think you  re just being stubborn and contrary for the sake of it
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

6. being the youngest of digit , i ' m not the biggest fuck up . i like the fact that i am able to make my own mistakes and still remain one of the top kids . that ' s really shitty to say , but my family has a really shitty dynamic .
   (ID: 9e1be6964f5835f58b6cdaac71f8b557f0b4a42f)

7. could you say that again
   (ID: 7e8d23b8f1f993c239648b064d6f3e414288a7dd)

8. no , murder is not better than depression or poverty although when i was dealing with that crap i would have been more than happy for that . but when it comes to it actually being considered murder is a completely different subject , to me , no it ' s not murder to destroy something that cannot even be considered conscious in the first place . i do think there is a limit to how long you can wait before an abortion is performed and that time differs between person to person . but it ' s not my body , not my child , and not my choice . if someone performs an abortion passed the time i ' d think it ' s wrong , then i ' d be upset , but i would still have no say in it . and for the not getting pregnant before your ready argument , i ' d say that is very subjective as well . some people don ' t realize what they got themselves into until it ' s already happened , maybe new information came up that they didn ' t know before . health problems , relationship or even financial could very easily affect someones choice to have a child , and those things could easily pop up after you ' ve made the decision . this is even worse for younger couples like teens who have no idea what they were doing until they already made the mistake , would you rather have two or three lives ruined or would you rather they mature and become stable before taking on a task like raising a family . one of my good friends i met in the hospital , tried to kill herself because she couldn ' t handle all the pressures that came when she had a child . i ' m not saying you have to support anything you don ' t want to , but if you really wanted to help a child , then you would be better off supporting things that help single mothers , homeless children or familys in poverty . but this is all up to you , listen to me or don ' t , just know that the only person that knows what they can do is you and the same goes for them .

9. im diagnosed with anxiety and all i have to say is a couple things . i used to have panic attacks everyday . it was the worst years of my life . there is no way to get rid of anxiety . everytime i see someone ask " how do you get rid of anxiety " i just tell them my story and say there is no way . ive had it for so long that i get used to it . im aware its not going to go away . i listen to music , that helps . i meditate , hard but helps . i paint my nails and chill .
   (ID: 0ddaeffad510fe540496c0e0b97a1a85b13282eb)

10. i ' d say kratom is mind altering . i ' ve taken it daily for so long and it has definitely altered my mind . it ' s psychoactive and gives a mood boost , euphoria , and much more . hard to not generalize all substances because where would you draw the line ? is weed okay ? is adderall okay because it makes you focus ? what about alcohol ? can you drink kava ? that ' s why they generalize and say any psychoactive substance . basically they want you sober and stone cold sober .
   (ID: 229018d265fee53903659270acea70a8c7f46caa)

11. and there ' s no reason for them to not understand it , they just mentally disconnect . ask if they know what a penpal is , they say yes . ask them if it ' s possible to fall in love with a penpal , they say yes . ask them to imagine having a penpal over the internet , they can handle that too . but ask them to imagine falling in love with an internet penpal , and suddenly they don ' t know left from right .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

12. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

13. all of the detroit lions players . its like when you say " fuck it " and work for a shitty company that pays way too much .
   (ID: d8b92be4e0b1e639cde4ac3fc3f079b296813fc5)

14. i ' d be worried that my ' fork a nibbles ' would get me into trouble . for me , that ' s arbitrary and could end up victims of my carb addictions love both pb  ab . can you guess how much pb  ab you ' re consuming , say with digit eggs ?
   (ID: fe374743dd856c29f2117723cef01c1fdc3b3b5b)

17. i neither said he has progressed or regressed . what i was trying to say is oli is the best answer to the question at hand because he is one of the more polarizing and well  known vocalists in the genre and people tend to feel strongly one way or the other .
   (ID: 50e37e2011f73f739f76098c3c746e27b8422fd7)

   (ID: 9a96ba583f43f670f5797ea5031052161bf613cf)

20. it only seems to apply to certain numbers , and i ' m not sure why we do that honestly . i ' ll say the digit , the digit , the digit , but i would just say digit for that highway .
