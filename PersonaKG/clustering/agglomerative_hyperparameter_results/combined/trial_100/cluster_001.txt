4. if you try and eat a little something at meal times even if you  re not that hungry then that might prevent you going all out after you  ve gone a long time without food . you  re probably a lot more hungry that you realise
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

5. could just be an awful texter ? if you  re worried about getting your hopes up , perhaps try not to think about it too much and if they want to take it further they  ll let you know ! or you could even let them know what you  re thinking and if they don  t respond then you know where to go with it . good luck !
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

12. i feel like that might have to do with the quality  nachos arent a gourmet food , but i feel like if you were to try making them at home the meat would certainly be better than most anywhere that serves nachos stadiums , arenas if you still enjoy soggy , meatless nachos after accounting for ingredients . then thats cool , healthier too
   (ID: 85ac769b0cb349e567cb91e8109645bd1ac28b9f)

   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

15. first and foremost you ' re doing great already . to some extent a stubborn stressed woman in the third tri is going to require you to roll with a lot of punches no matter what . it ' s entirely possible that what she needs most sometimes , fair or not , is a punching bag to let off some of the steam she has to keep repressed with nearly everyone in her life . my best advice otherwise , try proving to her you ' re doing what you can by getting her to expound on her feelings rather than trying to refute them . she says you ' re not stepping up to the plate ? fine , instead of arguing , ask what you could do better . write the list down , check the items off or at least make progress on them and report back within a couple weeks and ask the same question after . it ' s not a contest or a way to show her up , it ' s an exercise to show in an enumerable way that you ' re doing the best you can not just to be a dad in general , but to address her specific stress points . it ' s important that it not become a contest of any sort . you may have to do it over and over , or different variants for different issues but if you can show her that you ' re addressing her specific concerns instead of just doing what you believe to be responsible which is great , again i applaud your efforts and preparedness it can go a long way to relieving some of her stress on that specific issue , proving commitment to her and validating her feelings .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

16. i sleep fine weirdo . young men are useless in the world . try to accept it , because it ' s not going to change .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

17. what did you feel when you made the choice to start them ? is that better or worse than what you feel on them ? a lot of people feel better on meds , think they don ' t need them , stop the med , and then relapse . know that other meds are an option , too . if you can ' t tolerate the side  effects , you can try a different dosage and  or another med totally .
   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

18. you  d have to pay me a lot of money to try that out .
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

19. it does take a lot of courage , but you have it in you . otherwise you wouldn ' t have made this post ! just know you ' re not alone . there ' s a whole community here that supports you . here ' s maybe an odd idea  instead of only looking at body types that you would want for yourself , try checking out all sorts of people with different body types . big , little , thick , thin . don ' t judge , just accept them for what and who they are . then after a time , try to find little things you appreciate in each one . maybe it ' ll help broaden your horizons a little , instead of being so focused on what you covet right now .
   (ID: 603a231fe5a5d93e7d1121f6265baf1dcb11f624)

20. how do you " try it ? do you just save up the proper items for months beforehand ?
