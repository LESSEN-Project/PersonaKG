1. offers the option to share music through facebook messenger i admit i don ' t know the full story behind the apps , i read the article though . i suppose i could have been more specific . i have no clue why these apps would need read access , writing is fine , that makes sense its a one way street . read and write access though ? why ?
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

5. come for the odd1sout memes , stay for the furry memes . i don ' t think he ' s salty either , he ' s just being honest . modesty should be appreciated , not expected . ya ' ll acting like you wouldn ' t do the same in his shoes , yet calling him salty and egotistical . the whole post nuking thing is probably more of a strategic decision than anything else . if he ' s still around here , let him be and don ' t call him out . that way you get the best of two worlds  you know he ' s a furry and no odd1sout low quality memes . and james , if you read this , no one wants you to leave , but please , stop gilding stuff , it ' s not a reward , it ' s encouragament . you ' re already a " popufur " , furries will go to the moon and back to kiss your butt , gilding them just amplifies that .

8. yeah its celebration but if you actually read the quote   x200b   somebody will give us a breakdown of what was happening out there without us having to actually experinence it they know the reaction will be madness
   (ID: e84ec39cf97c9609b6feb31cbaab5faf551f372d)

9. i am using the word can as a verb the second definition of being permitted to do something . now i was using it in the way to ask someone to allow me to do something and not the first definition of can . so please read a dictionary and come back to me when you have educated yourself . or just say , " you ' re an idiot "
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

10. those are some interesting and sad statistics . for the record though , i did think you were talking about men being victimized in the dating scene as the post is about the dating scene , that ' s why i asked for the source , because it goes against a lot of statistics and views i have heard from many people and studies that i have read . but that edit definately helped me understand the point you were actually making . thanks for posting it , it ' s an interesting read .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

11. my first crush , one of my favourite movies . just read the book he wrote about the making of the princess bride . it ' s really good too .  sigh crush still going strong

   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

13. clearly what you read doesn ' t hold up against real  world experience . i encounter this a lot these days . me  " i did a thing " internet stranger  " i read you can ' t do that " me  " but look , here is the thing i did " internet stranger  " i dunno . it ' s probably photoshopped or something " me  facepalm .
   (ID: fcec87cb8b541d87ad0eb8b52c3541c8fc49132b)

14. also i have read a bit about whspace and tbh it confuses me , but i ' m willing to give n e thing a try , and what ' s better than going right in at the deep end ? hi  sec boredom ? not for me .
   (ID: a911ed792d3b26b115aedaee6218a4a944c38521)

15. do you know where i can read it ?
   (ID: 48e565f53f18e7fed27267c945fb81bb868c90f3)

16. ah , my mistake . i ' ve only built hgs so far so i ' m not too familiar with the rg scene . that said , i read on an old post that the rg grandpa was pretty badly designed , with tons of poor design choices , easily breaking parts etc . would any of you agree ? post in question
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

17. well , its been a while now and nobody got it , so here ' s the comment again with slightly easier to read formatting . you ever met a gay person ? or asked them about their experiences growing up in abusive atmospheres with people using language like this ? up until very recently this kind of talk was pretty common , and it shouldn ' t be tolerated just because it ' s " some guys down the pub " . fuck that . all it takes for this kind of crap to be perpetuated is people like you who dismiss it as " pub talk " , and " banter " . good job there , i hope you ' re proud of yourself . read the first letter of each sentence .
   (ID: f7356e924b370675e942b29b9c2184dc895ea5b7)

18. that is a deeply reductive line of thought . i don ' t deny the fact that sex is fun . but we live in an age where we no longer have to be slave to our primal impulses . have you read about maslow ' s hierarchy of needs ? you ' re stuck on the lowest level . your biological duty , as you put it , is to procreate , yes . then what ? what is the point of just fucking around if you have no other reason to live ? take it from me , living a shallow existence like that is incredibly unsatisfying .
   (ID: dfcca9c384a4fff7bbeb3cd1fb2f40aacb47fd7e)

19. is the stoning for adultery pertaining to both genders ? because every time that i do read or hear about it , it ' s always the punishment for women . what if the man commits adultery ? not trying to toss gender  equality into an already cans  of  worm belief . just genuinely curious .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

20. oof , i fucked up . for anyone who hasn ' t read that horrible series , the guy has this problem where he doesn ' t like to be touched , but the main character sort of cures that .
