3. i think you should just look over joseki that you encountered in your games . if you feel like you got a disadvantageous sequence in a corner , go look up josekipedia , and see what you could have done better . that ' s all . if you play something often , you can also check wether it is joseki . who knows ? maybe you got used to play a slightly sub  optimal sequence . i heard someone that the path to progress goes  learn joseki   understand them   forget them , the last step being the most important .

7. I play runescape.
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

8. it ' s a fun little demo to show people your watch , but i don ' t think it will improve the way you play at all . the ui is a little confusing , and the data updates a too slow for my liking . the only other thing you can do besides find portals is normal hack them , which can help you get gear easily , but is useless in the long run .
   (ID: c23be0b501278176a288ed6b3ab6669ac6b9896a)

9. if there is one thing that i learned about drumming from whiplash is tempo is all that matters lmao . i ' m psyched to hear that though . i grew up on rock band and guitar hero myself and drumming was always my favorite and best instrument to play . i never had enough to get a proper kit though , and i have to imagine my roommates would find it unacceptable for me to do so . what are some trademark songs you know how to play ?

16. what convinced you to play minecraft , and how did you start ?
   (ID: 9c91f42953bc8f6d2f718503a1924734b9da6acc)

17. i play online vs exclusively . i ' m not saying this to piss you off , but i can poke check and stick lift all day long and hardly ever get a penalty . my poke checking could arguably be considered poke spamming i do it so much . it ' s all about proper positioning and timing for those poke checks , and never poke from behind . as far as stick lifts , they work very well during puck battles , especially along the boards . if your opponent gets possession , lift that shit right away you have to be fast and it ' ll almost always come loose and back to you . i ' m not saying it ' s perfect far from it , but if you ' re getting penalties on poke checks and stick lifts either your timing or positioning is off . go ahead and downvote me if you want , but i hardly ever get penalties for pokes and lifts . almost all my penalties are checks into the boards that ea will randomly call boarding or charging .

18. i would try harder at the kink  fantasy with the soul mate . dress up ? blind fold ? role play ? porn ? i could fool myself into thinking i was fucking someone i wasn ' t i think . if she thinks as highly of you as you say you think of her . she should be open to ideas of some fantasy type things so you can get the next best thing to some " strange " . which is still her but you get to pretend on some things . i wouldn ' t give her up . compatibility like you describe is super rare in my experience . plus maybe a few years down the road her mind might change again and she could get more willing to a threesome or something
