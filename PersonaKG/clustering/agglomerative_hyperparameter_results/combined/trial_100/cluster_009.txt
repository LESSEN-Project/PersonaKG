11. you describe parts of a thing called scientific method , and do it rather well may i add . by earlier description it may have occurred to some flat  earthers that they are wrong . i often watch odd youtubes and such about things like that  it doesn ' t mean i believe in them , it just means i find them entertaining

13. that ' s good ! when i say as an avid moviegoer , i mean that the encroaching on space maneuver would annoy me even if it was an agreed upon date just because it can be distracting  if i go to the movies , i want to watch the movie . but i ' m glad he ' s found someone . he can ' t be faulted for explicitly being told it was a date . the virtue of it being valentine ' s day though isn ' t a defense i would hold up in court though . how did you end up liking deadpool ? did you see the second one ? do you have any thoughts about once upon a deadpool ?

16. there was a mom in michigan whos kids starved to death because she said they wouldnt eat what she made for them . the old adage " they ' ll eat when they ' re hungry " isn ' t true for all kids . it doesn ' t mean they jave autism , either . doesnt mean you have to give into junk , but they should at least have milk or vitamin shake . kids usually like those . sustenance is important for kids especially .
