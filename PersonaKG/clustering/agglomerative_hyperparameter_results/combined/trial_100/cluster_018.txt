1. hmmmm . what would be a good place ? get everyone to head out to a wheeling spot like hot springs ? i ' m not coming up with a good one between me and you .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

2. agreed . learning how to manage relationship conflict in early relationships is one of the most important life skills to practice at that age . i usually start with asking questions to understand why exactly the teen is upset . i then rephrase that in a way that states what the teen wants to happen , " so , you wish he saved a seat for you next to him at football games " and then suggest they tell the person and ask for the thing they want , " i want to sit next to you at the next football game . will you save me a seat " teens relationship problems often stem from difficulty verbalizing what they want to happen and expressing that need . to be fair , most adults are not so good at this either .
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

3. so what do you think about it do you like it ? i mean sans in one of the best video game characters and fortnite is one of the epicest games so it ' s a good combo . what do you think ?
   (ID: 409a49cde6f1f65f92cac4d33c7c769f7ba9e965)

   (ID: 3f0409a6efb16c26d2f9f7a14f5e75b8945ba427)

   (ID: 11d16c1ced94665eed03bc34f590f8fafeed40d2)

   (ID: a8b3c82ca36eb4e48fd6b6674a642f96d401743e)

9. i think the amount of toxicity a person experiences can and will be different from someone else , so asking how toxic the game is won ' t give you a good answer .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

10. as a guy , i can tell you , he  s not stopping . it  s not a matter of you or the other girls , it  s a change . i agree that the pictures over video is probably i  m the minority but to each their own . unless you  re always there to have sex when he  s horny , probably nothing you can do about it . the best thing to do is just what you have , express your discomfort and how you feel and leave it alone . let him work through and compromise for you , or not . its not worth starting a fight , not for either party . i hope your bf calms down on it though so you feel more comfy , good luck .
