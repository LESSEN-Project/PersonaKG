" i wonder out loud , " why would i panic ? " just then i hear a knock at the front door . i walk over to it and peer through the blurry glass . it seems like my girlfriend sophie . " sophie ? why are you home ? " she stares back blankly . " shouldn ' t you be at work right now ? why don ' t you have your key ? " no response . i back away from the door just as her jaw opens like a snake and a dark forked tongue crashes through the window and nearly reaches me , three yards away . i turn and run to the bedroom closet . i pull out my grandfather ' s long double  barrelled shotgun and load it with buckshot . as i click the barrel back in place , a monster comes roaring through my hallway , now barely recognizable as sophie . her face is distorted , dark and cavernous and webbed tentacles flow out of her dress and pull her along both walls like an ooze . i fire both barrels in quick succession . the blast is powerful , and leaves my ears ringing badly . the monster is thrown back to the end of the hallway . the remnants of sophie ' s face were removed by the blast , revealing mottled gray reptilian skin . the impact of the buckshot was substantial , and covered the center and left side of the creature with green blood . within moments , however , the worst of the wounds begin to close and its yellow eyes snap open . i back away , ejecting the spent shells and fumbling for more from my shirt pocket . the creature ' s face opens into a wide , horrible grin . the tongue shoots out again , farther this time , and locks around my chest like a steel cable . it pulls me in while flying toward me like a smoke cloud . i am engulfed into the abyss of its mouth . i regain consciousness while walking in the middle of the street . i have no control over my body , and i notice other people walking nearby , although i can ' t turn my head to look at them . there are no cars on the road . i walk for miles , feeling no fatigue and keeping a steady pace . i arrive to a house and knock on a door . my mind is foggy and i feel numb , but i know this house . this is my parents house . i haven ' t written in a long time and i ' m rusty . nice prompt !
