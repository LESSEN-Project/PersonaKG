4. if you ' re sure this is something you want to do . make constant sexual innuendos around him . touch him just platonically enough so nobody bats an eye about it , but linger just long enough for him to know that it ' s something you want . you could just straight  up tell him . i don ' t know that many men who would turn sex with a willing 16yo especially if it ' s legal where you are .
   (ID: fe56409176d2a6089f323227d5b07061f851d63b)

   (ID: 3cc393500aaac3a2ee1cd96955cee486bb062a46)

7. personally , the 5x3 is my normal carry around town , but i take the f8hp when i know i will be further out of town , that 8w really does help a lot . as for the mentions of antennas , i do suggest the na  320a for the 5x3 , but the stock f8hp antenna is already on par with the na771 and digit . just make sure you buy the radios from btech  baofengtech , and not some unknown seller , never know what crap you will get from others .
   (ID: ef02e812d417ba40d4b3e2f97601e54e4a68c5c5)

   (ID: 02cf76dae1fda8da1d2e5bbbaeb0da5a77cb6e3e)

10. in a small claims court   digit you do not need a lawyer . you rep yourself , so if youre not valuing time , itms free .
   (ID: dd1a306ab5abb82ade20a2c7f74d928797a35a61)

11. why you tryna change your post , title it exactly as you did here . you can destroy and create mass . also , i understand the difference but doesn ' t take away from the analogy .
   (ID: 3b13182e9a13b392bb9f89990f71d9043459e21f)

12. I have a son in my family.
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

13. a friend of mine told me about this slasher film called " santa ' s slay " . the premise is that santa is actually satan ' s son but was cursed to be nice and give presents to the world for digit years and now that time is up . haven ' t seen it yet but it sounds great .
   (ID: 3c135c69a8a47980440b74978da03e89463d9df6)

14. it sounds pretty conflicted to me , it felt wrong to discuss your feminine side but equally you hated some masculine traits . right now that doesnt make you either or and thats okay if you can put your hatred for your male traits in context to feeling more feminine then potentially it might be some dysphoria , then again you might hate big feet because you can never buy the right shoes . i think you have some more self exploring to do , to see whether you are really comfortable with the idea of being feminine  female , when you do you will notice any big red giant flags saying " wrong " or maybe like me you will not .
   (ID: 2e1439e8eb18b181a69a66cc4c1b2dc22ce774f0)

15. i like to solve problems . if someone complains about something to me , i ' m ready to jump in and fix it . apparently , people enjoy the act of complaining , and me leaping in to correct the issue startles them or something . i ' ve had people even tell me , " i don ' t want your help , i just want you to listen " . it ' s really difficult for me to just let people whine .

   (ID: 3b45915d58b20f0e2abb6b26d4534980a5d3aa68)

19. i think you ' d be right if a person told their kid " you ' re a disappointment " or " you ' re an idiot who cheats " or something like that but saying " i ' m disappointed in you for cheating " allows that a parent has feelings about the child ' s behavior and lets the kid know that the parent has expectations for the child to not cheat . it is a fine line but i do think there is a big difference in saying " i feel this way about that thing " and " you are that thing " .
   (ID: 1293e72aa7301baf0ecb3a2509e46cdcca834cd9)
