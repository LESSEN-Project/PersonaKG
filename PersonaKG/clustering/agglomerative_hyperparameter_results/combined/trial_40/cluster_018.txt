8. killing yourself is really hard to do . not only working up the nerve to attempt it but actually doing enough damage to die . my first attempt was at digit and i ' m continuously getting closer to death but fuck why does it have to be such a challenge ? why cant i just be done already ? i used to think if i suffered enough something would kill me out of universal pity or something like that but reality is if i really want to check out i and i alone have to do it . nobody is gonna hold my hand through it . in fact people will do the opposite no matter your reasoning .
