6. i agree . once the achievement hunters get their aps , everything will be back to somewhat normal .  the only real bad thing about leagues so far are the pve commanders . yeah , there ' s a ton of them  but on the flipside , they probably really want to help . it just so happens they get overwhelmed with all the things they need to do . they may have been used to running with their guild then decided to try it out on the server . i once commanded our guild run in wvw and it ' s really different when you ' re working with your guild and when you have pugs with you . with your guild , you know what they are capable of so you always know what to tell them . with pugs , there are a lot of probabilities with them  are they upleveled ? because they might not survive the first clash . are they here just for the karma  xp  loot ? then they won ' t follow instructions if you tell them to " stack " , " blast statics  might " , and so on and so forth because they would be like , " whatever man let ' s get this over with "
