   (ID: 009af0be6850d8d1ff9d388a3c7f39f0f7727594)

2. because being with someone shows that you ' re desirable . people see that somebody else wants you , so they want you .
   (ID: f39e591889b6331bd255039773030c1b50c7e201)

   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

5. One of my favorite things is people.
   (ID: 9adb5fb6fb9aeeeb65afe41002460d73817044b0)

6. at first i thought i ' d pay for lawn mowing and gutter cleaning , but then i thought i ' d be liable and get sued if the teen got hurt doing either of those , so they ' re out . on the other hand , i ' d happily pay  digit to have someone install a turnkey linux setup on a refurbished windows pc that i ' d provide . i might pay more , but with less happiness , ha . tell them something like " i want linux with gimp , a photo managing  display program , something to edit  play videos with , something that will play mp3s , a word processor , and internet ready " and have it all set up for me .
   (ID: a31ab3f3ccb2d987e0948a7a8ed52f5d74b72960)

7. i see your point in a sense . it ' s not that they ' re being confrontational , it ' s that people come up to the camera . there are plenty of   boring   videos where nothing happens . there are also videos where people learn their rights . there are auditors i disagree with and auditors who react well to the public better than others . suspicious activity is only suspicious to the person who doesn ' t understand what ' s going on . i suggest watching a bunch of different auditors and see which ones you like best , or none at all . i really like the boring ones where nothing happens because it shows that they ' re not out there to harass people .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

8. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .
   (ID: 45bf5c8227b94451beff1dce1059d0d2c683c40c)

9. i ' m not surprised so many people are supporting him  the cognitive dissonance must be a total mindfuck for them . that ' s what religion does , turns people in to mindless sheep . the person i feel most sorry for is the pastor ' s daughter .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

10. just tell me your underlying opinion . the ultimate goal is just to have as many animals as possible on this planet ? why ? well i guess asceticism , isn ' t necessarily religion , it ' s just that a lot of people who practice it do it because they don ' t want to go to hell . still , no one at all is obligated to do it .  digit . dogs eat animals .  digit . in a lifetime a dog will eat more than digit animal . my dog never killed a single animal in all of his twelve years of life . he was fed meat because he is a carnivorous animal . humans have a choice . most animals don ' t , they kill and eat meat to survive . should we kill lions so that wildebeest can survive ? cats so that mice can survive ? bears so that fish can survive ? regardless of how you look at it , not only is nature only taking its natural course , these animals are simply more intelligent than the ones you are fighting to keep alive . dogs are smarter than cows . dogs don ' t have a choice of whether or not to eat meat or plants . we do . they don ' t .
   (ID: dc000fb877b86a0bbd3d65fe6040b512b4f5b042)

11. why do you make life so miserable for so many people , you fucking cunt ?
   (ID: b42bcbaed0ea1f011b4d8c42d4ad9df732ecc5d5)

12. actually meeting and socialising with people who are muslim .
   (ID: 37f1dd54cc7fbf9961db909e5dce33ca94dc5b82)

13. may i add that i was not spawn killing . i make a point to not do it because it pisses me off when people do it to me .
   (ID: a8b3c82ca36eb4e48fd6b6674a642f96d401743e)

14. i was on my phone but even if i ' m using it i ' m aware of what ' s happening around me , i was in class , the lesson is about to start , two people enters and say  we can seat there near me the person in front me say no with her hand , all of this in front of me i was like wtf , how dumb are you to not notice that i ' m looking at you doing that
   (ID: 2a3d0cc7409627207d71d58affd421983020efbe)

15. apparently such people do not exist
   (ID: 9e2852bcfafecccb1e60211326f5fc70d0bbb428)

16. so does blind people , they never see what you ' re showing to them . so rude .
   (ID: 60d49a425809d6f450335028a75a5202d3b84678)

17. calm down ? what was not calm about my one sentence ? lmao .  your comments could be less dismissive towards people who do care about the service they ' re paying for . how is it dismissive ? someone said they didn ' t understand why people are ok with it . i said some people , like me , don ' t care . you should stop perceiving things that are not there .  what is there to gain from coming here and saying things like " i don ' t let such trivial things upset me ? you mean explaining my point of view . i guess add it to the list of trivial things that anger you .  cloud saves are purely beneficial , let people care without trying to make yourself feel superior for not wanting them . i never said i was against cloud saves , just that i do not get upset about the few games that do not have them . " just because you don ' t care about a feature doesn ' t mean other people shouldn ' t . stop being so self  centered " you should let people speak their minds and not be so insecure about it .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

18. you never truly know someone until you live with them , and even then some people can keep their walls up for years
   (ID: a93c4b4e04523abdf134a40204e81619d6e659ef)

19. so many talk about climate change because it ' s cool and do a couple of meaningless actions that make them feel better about themselves . if you truly care then don ' t have kids , that has a real positive impact on climate .
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

20. that  s sad but some people suck . i  m sorry to hear that happened .
