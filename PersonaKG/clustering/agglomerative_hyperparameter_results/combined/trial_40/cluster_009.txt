1. tbh i never even seen that until you pointed it out
   (ID: 41ecb08cd807b953da29a82cba9ddfcf32745fc3)

2. ehh no that  s not quite what i  m getting at , i know what you  re talking about . like someone looking off in the distance or distracted while talking , that  s not what i  m referring to . i  ve seen several people who talk with their eyes closed , like speak full sentences with their eyes closed . or they look up while their face is facing you . it sounds bizarre but if you know what i mean then i bet you agree it  s annoying . idk why people do it . some strange social phobia maybe
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

3. brother , i ' ve seen you falling all over yourself in this sub tonight defending jones . aren ' t you exhausted yet ?
   (ID: e5fd25110413c69853218bbcbb0169f73c8f06e1)

4. i seen what you did there
   (ID: 1bb2b5ec27ad0397aea65ab5151bd4a19742f52a)

5. i ' m digit  would love to cosplay . i ' ve seen some online images of costumes people have made  it looks so amazing  fun . something like elizabeth from bioshock infinite or elsa from frozen . but i ' m probably too old to start  would probably be called mutton dressed as lamb if i dressed as these younger women . i have no idea if cosplay existed when i was in my 20s in the early ' 90s when the internet was a noisy slow dial  up affair , but if it did i wish i had known about it . it looks so fun . especially steampunk . i ' d love to go steampunk . but at my age i ' d probably look ridiculous .
   (ID: b7464d681f64ad88cda3f6014fd0dd3a8bebed33)

6. oh no ? have you seen the video of it ?
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

7. i ' ve still never seen a physical release of any shantae game . are they specific to certain regions ?
   (ID: 2ac4d2cea574e655d7fdb1ab9b4886989929ca96)

8. oh , sorry to hear that . people are dicks . not sure whether you  ve seen the edit , but he did listen this time and is now quite excited , which is good ! sorry your ex wife  s a bitch .
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

9. yta you don  t have to be a dick about things and from what i  ve seen in this thread i feel sorry for the girl i would if said nta but from how far up your arse you  ve been on this thread i doubt her work was that poor quality
   (ID: 77ab4860c32a7084ca81fd91302df6690ce56731)

10. i have never seen one of these things before now , thank you .
   (ID: dc1fd340b3e0a603d715d06c129c512b8197c37b)

11. i mean , we haven ' t seen them since , i thought i remember reading something saying he can ' t manifest them anymore
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

12. yeah , we got a ton here in seattle , and they ' re almost all great . one of the best ways to keep shops like that open , in my opinion . if you don ' t want to do a lot of food you can always do a coffee shop and allow outside food with a small cover i ' ve seen  digit or partner with a nearby shop to allow their food exclusively in return for a discount for your employees .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

13. i haven ' t seen this week ' s walking dead yet , but in that particular example from what i ' ve seen , it ' s treated as something that ' s in people ' s minds . that ' s realistic and entirely valid . it ' s when they start actually showing afterlives and such that bothers me . lost went too far for me . there have been a few others but none are coming to mind .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

14. yeah i  ve usually seen it from middle school , but looking back at what i saw i still think it  s f  up . but you can  t change people  s ways on this sadly
   (ID: d9e6e1ecc09dc9affbcc8ccb0191ff241370a782)

15. what do you mean you ' ve never seen blade runner ? oh , maybe i was a little too wild in the 70s back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
   (ID: f72a72c8ffe94061edd962dd3f8293ca75595021)

16. you should have seen the terminator . and the institute has no control over their emotions , they are self aware , not even knowing they are robots  synths , and they are just like ghouls , they don ' t age .
   (ID: 2731a84ac27fa3325bd3e2bf989471ffcb1456fe)

17. not a worker , but the lady behind me got upset about the bill she got over  digit and thought that she could refund it by puking it up back on to her plate . she got even more upset when they wouldn ' t accept it , and started to trash everything ! of course , they had to call security to get her out . by far the weirdest , but funniest thing i ' ve ever seen !
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

18. in what way was it clear that he had assistants feeding him information ? i ' ve never seen his live show but i know he has been under intense media scrutiny for his entire career . if he was cheating in this way i can ' t help but feel he would have been publicly busted for it .
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

19. my thoughts on them , while not having seen them , is that i probably won ' t watch them . documentaries are supposed to be even  handed approaches to complex situations , but often end up being propaganda with a little egalitarian flavor . i have absolutely nothing against vegetarianism or veganism or pescatarianism or whatever , just documentaries with a mission .
   (ID: df28c2a39b633ca418192316a199668289382292)

20. fuuuuuuuck ! what is seen can not be unseen !
