17. this sounds like a lack of training  impulse control issue and not the dog actually hating you . your friend should train her , it ' s not cute when an adult pitbull acts like that and is dangerous for the dog ! there ' s a guy in my area who brings his totally untrained   digit lb pitbull to dog parks . the dog regularly jumps on people and bites their hands  pulls on their clothes . the people involved have all been dog owners so they know to remain calm , but i don ' t see it going well if a dog  fearing stranger or child were the target .
