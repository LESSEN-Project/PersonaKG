1. i feel like it depends what you use it for ? if you use it just for fun and  or as a little treat for yourself , then no . but if you ' re using it as an escape from shit like " negative emotions , " then you might . i was always told to be responsible with pot and that it ' s best not to resort to using it if i ' m having a bad day . because then the day might come where you ' re having a really bad day , and you try to find your pot , only to find that you ' re out ! you ' d have no idea how to then cope with your emotions and would be , in essence , " addicted " to it . honestly , i feel that the only exception to not using pot to deal with your emotions would be if a doctor prescribed it to you for that reason .

17. what ? " god " may know what my choices will be , but that doesnt mean that " he " is influencing said choices . the influence is the deciding factor here . that is what determines " free will " , not the mere knowledge of what will happen . say you put a mouse in a room with digit buttons . one button releases great treats and the other releases good treats to the mouse . once it learns which is which it will always choose the great treat . the mouseyou has " free will " to choose which ever button it wishes . the scientistgod knows this , but isnt influencing the mouse in any way . does that mean that the mouses choice is pointless ? i have been drinking for sometime now and that example may be convoluted , sorry about that .
