1. nah . you two are obviously looking for different people . you want a first date hookup and she wants something more long term . at least you were blunt and now you both know how the other feels .
   (ID: 90779ea1e5aa2ec3ed3a1fa6b99a8207c0d66d3e)

2. i can see flak jacket and camouflage being crutch picks a crutch is a choice that is not the most efficient one , but makes things easier for the user . something is a crutch when there ' s a more powerful , harder  to  use solution  think low risk low reward versus high risk high reward . " crutch " is not a synonym for " overpowered . camouflage is not a crutch as there is no other option concerning hiding within spot flares besides smoke , and those defeat the purpose of hiding . flak  juggernaut is not a crutch because the only other way to reduce explosive damage on the fly going prone is stack  able with said specs . my advice is to get better at locating enemies without the use of flares and minimap . even a walking enemy makes a fuckton of noise in this game , as does the sound of somebody spawning . the moment that hidden enemy gets an ally is the moment where you can easily figure out where the enemy is hiding  the new spawn is almost guaranteed to start running away from their ally .
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

3. i see your point but for an equal relationship where both parties are happy you need to care for your partner too , maybe it  s something you don  t really care about but i mean that  s how i do my thing and you do yours .
   (ID: fe4ddb52a6f20437e3f3c6003b775cb72c3d048f)

4. well the moc only helps you with getting trade prices for gunrunning vehicles and the bunker unupgraded doesn ' t make you any money if you buy supplies , you just break even , not even considering staff cost , so your best bet is to make around 2million and buy the equipment and staff upgrades and then you will make 135k each time you buy suppliesthe staff will cost more tho , but that shouldn ' t be a big problem
   (ID: a443986595c715cd541cd3925619cb6f1e8ada83)

5. move out . do you know how many people have problems like this because they live together first ? he has no incentive to marry you . you ' re probably sleeping together and living exactly like you ' re married . so either you need to take all those privileges and perks away to motivate him or let go of being sensitive . not trying to be harsh . but you got yourself in a pickle here . honestly ask yourself if you ' re in his shoes , why should you go through the risk and trouble of getting married when you can have what you want ? why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free ? old saying
   (ID: 2904e4959568457dd43970d8388e42064d7c7d34)

6. well heres my opinion , the guys probably very paranoid of you cheating on him , im not saying you would but thats what it looks like . heres what you need to do , if you want to stay with him id explain how hes the one and hes over reacting . tell him that you need some breathing room to do whatever you want but that youll always come back home to him . you should only unblock the guy when he understands to give you space . if you feel like things arent working out anymore because of trust then youd definitely be in the right to break up with him . thats what id do atleast
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

7. movies . the one way to know as little as a person as you did when the date started
   (ID: e564e7a04c6cafd6927ead32dbaf13efc4322c04)

8. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

9. wait i have another question , sorry for bugging you , but should i just say  hey  or should i open up and go straight to the problem ?
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

10. okay but what about men who sleep around ? it  s fine to think this as long as you hold men to the same standard
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

11. people with special needs , intellectual disabilities and autism aren ' t often good with hints . tell him it ' s time for him to leave , it will probably be more a lot more comfortable and less stressful for him than trying to figure out why you ' re acting strange and different to when he first arrived .
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

12. so when you meet , talk about everything . go with your guts , if you don ' t wanna then don ' t and if you do just be patient . i don ' t think you ' re on the same level atm . overthinking is bothering , make a decision and stick to it and if you changed your mind after you ' ve met that ' s ok too .
   (ID: 9adb5fb6fb9aeeeb65afe41002460d73817044b0)

13. wait so your gay or you ' re not interested but want to talk to her . harem ? either way you should say no since it will only end in disappointment for her . just be kind .
   (ID: 6ea82786a74ccdc85dc1fddd809a575aa4e4efcf)

14. ask him how far down the rabbit hole he is . is it fun ? fun with problems ? or just problems ? give an ultimatum , and stick to it . it ' s you or heroin . there are no half measures . if he doesn ' t get help , leave him before he drags you down too . speaking from experience .
   (ID: 5603c8fcb517a4b5745afb8c3f46248974edebe3)

15. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

16. dude , if you have an attractive so , let her show that shit off . you should take it as a compliment when other people want to fuck your girlfriend . if you really can ' t handle her style , then maybe she ' s not for you .
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

17. ok let me say the exact same thing you said  cassie cage needs a hawt skin
   (ID: de0709ad19c458ffff0b96aab8fcfa9c40b24603)

18. i feel like you don  t really have a right to be angry at her in that regard since as you even said you cheated on her digit times due to bad friends so why would she not be concerned about you going out doing certain things ? in this case i think it  d be healthier to break up so that you can use the lessons you learned in a new relationship where there  s not so much trauma to undo . you  re a better man now , you won  t do the shitty things you did in this relationship again , but getting your gf to trust you completely again will be at best a monumental task , at worst impossible . if you don  t wanna go through with all that entails , then i  d really recommend breaking up .
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

19. it sounds like he genuinely doesn ' t care about you . the fact that he said he could tell you weren ' t enjoying it but not only carried on but got a camera out as well wtf . sex is part of the relationship , not all of it . leave him .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

20. as a guy , i can tell you , he  s not stopping . it  s not a matter of you or the other girls , it  s a change . i agree that the pictures over video is probably i  m the minority but to each their own . unless you  re always there to have sex when he  s horny , probably nothing you can do about it . the best thing to do is just what you have , express your discomfort and how you feel and leave it alone . let him work through and compromise for you , or not . its not worth starting a fight , not for either party . i hope your bf calms down on it though so you feel more comfy , good luck .
