Total from this dataset: 538

1. i smoked weed only only a half tab of lsd and had the most intense trip i ' ve ever had . full hallucinations and an emotional overload where i had no idea if i was happy , sad , scared etc . resulting in my crying involuntarily . overall i had a good time but i ' ve taken full tabs no more that 100ug i think several times and never fully hallucinated like i did when i smoked as well . i was seeing red dragons laying on the grass out side our car and a see  through red tribal pattern on all of the car windows okay now mind you i had digit . 5g of shrooms my first time with shrooms earlier in the day however they had a very small effect on me i had no visual just a slightly happier mood . that is why i decided to take lsd about digit hours later in the day .
   (ID: e564e7a04c6cafd6927ead32dbaf13efc4322c04)

2. not a psychopath , just a sufferer of  bpd  . the intrusive murderous thoughts , the abandonment paranoia . we  ve all been there . the good news is the monster has a name . now you know you don  t feel that way ,  it  does . it  s like a dark thing in your head that pretends to be your friend , tells you it knows you better than anyone . that your other friends will all leave when they get to know the real you . but that  s not the real you .  it  is a leech that  s gorges on your unhappiness . and like any manipulator it  s goal is to isolate yoget you far away from people that care about your wellbeing . don  t let it trick you into thinking you hate people , that  s how it wins . best of luck friend , remember that you  re not alone .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

3. what is normal ? is it bad ? is it good ? i miss all my exes and my relationships lasted digit  digit months each . not sure if that ' s full blown but i miss all of them .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

4. all i know really is that if it doesn  t get better somehow , you should definitely think about moving jobs as shit and unfair as that is because my god happiness and good mental health is so so important !
   (ID: 91fce15f80cee843edc2c92559e78e027c94f5d0)

5. well it looks like you took their advice the wrong way . talking to people doesn ' t necessarily mean you have to act like someone else . to be honest , everybody is really insecure in high school . chances are that if you don ' t have a horrible personality , you ' ll be able to find someone with the same interests as you .
   (ID: dc000fb877b86a0bbd3d65fe6040b512b4f5b042)

6. think back to something you did or something that happened and figure out why it was done or why you acted like that . how it effected you or others . that reflection best way i can describe it .
   (ID: e982e025c0604997a6e2072eb87b9bb01bed38ae)

7. when i was little i never made friends , i would let people approach me , which didn  t happen often . i learned how to be confident and started talking to people and making friends , which gave me a lot more confidence , ever since that i  ve had friends and people to talk to , i  ve done significantly better and am a lot happier .
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

8. i  d say talk to other enby people , they may have a similar experience . it may help you find yourself . ultimately , though , it  s you who  s gotta take the information given and figure yourself out .
   (ID: 12803a9aad224d0537b68ab83a6cdc6a45d3160f)

9. i do not lack the needed intelligence . i know i could lose some weight im not obese but just close to overweight with a bmi of about digit . digit . i don ' t really want to be appreciated or liked for having a good physique or expensive clothes but for who i am . unfortunately my generation grew up to be materialistic . i feel like even if i do shit to grow my self worth and confidence i just try to conform to society which kind of makes me angry inside . it seems it is more important how you look like then who you are nowadays and it is igniting some kind of fury in my mind . i understand being fat for example is unhealthy but even then , why wouldn ' t any one be able to love you for who you are .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

10. oh sweetie . you ' re not alone . we all feel that way sometimes .
   (ID: b4b3c5b3797986d94531e12d74354970a19f91bc)

11. do extreme steps to stop yourself from gambling . that ' s the only way now . if you really have the mindset to change , go way way extreme . ban yourself from casinos , websites , or anything . cut your internet . find a therapist . call addiction hotlines . ask a friend , family for help . this will only get better if you make moves . i suggest do it now while your in the ' zone ' of making a change in your life .
   (ID: a3bc874aed8bb8421b25930723a7210bcd9b2aec)

12. youre right , life sucks . people suck , the world sucks , just everything sucks . your problems are not going to be magically fixed one day either . for the most part , everything is going to keep sucking forever . so now that thats out of the way , just take some time for yourself , feel better , talk to a friend . just think of a time when you didnt feel this way , and do that
   (ID: ae9e10cc82b9b20c52f819c70c83f657724f9f44)

13. don ' t want my penis to be lonely
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

14. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .
   (ID: 4422c1db26c9be5bec35694a448a490c2761d985)

15. feel for you . having insight into knowing you are manic is so important . you got this !
   (ID: aa8abed66c32a0519ab922c1a606563d97de28fc)

16. good luck finding a job you enjoy that gives you enough money to survive . seriously . if you find one , let us know .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

17. how am i ridiculing incels ? i only asked a question . nothing about this post was meant to be derogatory .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

18. what ' s the one thing you think about everyday or just often that makes you upset ?
   (ID: 8b409a812bfe5e21e6e8924b5c822fc50d0d2c9a)

19. not really what i like to do but something i find myself doing is self sabotage . working on that though
   (ID: d78765bdf49a3df577dd2523ce864393d4d0d2c9)

20. exactly , no way to win . only thing to do is avoid the situations with people who are like that and try to have worthwhile conversations with people who are more reasonable . the stuck up sjws aren ' t worth you time
