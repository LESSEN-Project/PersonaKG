1. can be knowledgeable , but loves to micromanage and isn ' t always there when you need them .
   (ID: 664b365f80ff1d51db95866fada8009f14d8e9b1)

2. i ' m sorry to hear that . that can ' t be a good feeling to live with your entire life . i know it ' s a bit harsh but yes , there should be some personal responsibility directed towards not having kids if you don ' t intend to care for them or raise them . but i also feel like the kids are not at fault and it ' s not fair to punish them for it either .
   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

3. i hope she shocks the hell out of you and knows sign language im in college learning it and it is one of the best things ive ever done for myself . hearing aids ideally arent a big deal but im curious so i wonder , do you have photos of you wearing them ?
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

4. how many are going to be that dad ?
   (ID: 718ff22055f41bd70e24ec98f0898a1526112965)

5. sounds like someone really hated that whole family . maybe more than one person , poison and dynamite  bombs are very different weapon choices . it seems weird that she would lean over looking at the package for an extended period of time instead of just picking it up like most people would . i guess she could have been extra cautious because of the dynamite at her brother  in  law ' s place but if she was suspicious , why not call the police to come and look at it ?
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)

6. my parents are abusive shits . i hope they die already be .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

7. i mean , how hard can it be ? same for homeless people . just buy a house
   (ID: 5a15ba0aaa5a6e6f9e3a2db25befda6ec40a9b88)

8. what you doing to me op , my tears are not from happiness
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

9. get really close and do the whole " i ' m not touching you " thing . then if i get bored with that just start copying them .
   (ID: 2623e4996f6df0e5814dbede4fbc9c1f13de4382)

10. i dunno if i ' m really qualified to answer that because i don ' t really a definitive crush on someone . but i haven ' t told the person that i find the cutest , so . i guess no ?
   (ID: 3e1762624e55cdfb0929da3e1a1c438675e0c217)

11. that ' s what i ' m going through , there are a few connections but the rest is pretty foggy . for example , i remember being alone a lot and abused at home from my mom . other then that i can ' t remember anything else
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

12. that ' s true . let ' s put it like this , your digit year old is an early bloomer and a digit year old man wants to marry her at the age of digit . what do you do ?
   (ID: d8b92be4e0b1e639cde4ac3fc3f079b296813fc5)

13. grew up educated not to believe such nonsense , got into a relationship where i was unhappy that we don ' t have the same views on a lot of aspects . somehow it worked and after a few years i realised that we complete each other  all we need to do is to talk
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

14. i never really understood the " surprise " argument . it was a hell of a surprise in the ultrasound room , but we get more time to prep , are able to call the little guy by name already and generally just have an easier time getting ready . if this is a hard and fast point for your wife there ' s probably not a winning answer for you , here . that said , don ' t let yourself get railroaded . we ' re not biologically capable of equally sharing the load during pregnancy but that doesn ' t mean dad ' s feelings are completely invalid on every issue . might be a big help if you could convince her to talk to some women or read articles and such by them that decided to find out ahead of time . if most of her family is of the same mind , that probably means you ' re fighting a lifetime of female influence on the issue that would be very hard to overcome on your own , a little girl talk from the other side could potentially make a big difference . i don ' t know your wife or your relationship , so you ' re just going to have to pick that battle for yourself , but plan for it carefully if you choose to take a stand .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

15. we can go outside and still not talk to people . remaining " quiet and invisible " while socialising gives us time to observe people . for me , that makes it easier to see if we ' d have anything in common and so be able to have a proper conversation . having lots of inconsequential small talk with numerous people is very tiring for me . i want a conversation that stimulates my brain .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

16. it will be ok and just imagine the relief when it ' s all over and in the past ! your doctor will not scold you for holding off on appointments , she will be happy you came in ! even if you have the worst case scenario , you will be in the right place , plus most cervical cancers are treatable when caught in time .
   (ID: d8014467041b98317d9f1dec2b0dae4ff9405b91)

17. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

18. when they become old enough to be free labor in the house . they believe everything you say . more enjoyable food in the house who the hell doesnt like chicken nuggets and macncheese . with a digit  digit job you only have to seem them during dinner and rush to your man cave , cough i mean study  office for solitary man time , cough work time . if they are really good at something like super smart you can make fun of other peoples kids . you can learn current pop culture from your kids . if a kid in the neighborhood is a dick , you only hope your kid beats the shit out of them . no jail time . best of all the " i told you so " or " wait til you have kids " or spoil the shit out of your grandkid when they stay over cause the end of the visit that kid isnt staying its your kids problem .
   (ID: 9d6cadbef277b68098e82945a77678dbb2a079c6)

19. you are what we call a practice girl
   (ID: 87173aaf55980a77c94bd30c851c39fb0b52ff2e)

20. i don ' t have experience with cheating parents or spouses , at least not that i ' m aware . i do agree with you that is wrong and harmful to both women . however , if i were in your shoes , i would have to ask myself some questions . first , what do you want to accomplish by speaking with your mom ? you clearly cannot change her behavior by talking to her about it , as you have tried that . secondly , what kind , if any , relationship do you want with her ? if you intervene in some way call the wife , confront the man , etc , you will be further alienating your mom . and lastly , can you live with this knowledge and not intervene if that is the only way to save your relationship with your mother ? if you answer these questions honestly and with great contemplation or not rashly , i believe you will know what course you should take . good luck !
