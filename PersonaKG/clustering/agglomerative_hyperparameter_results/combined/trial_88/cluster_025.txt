Total from this dataset: 895

1. well you were correct which does say something . i will say that i would hope more minorities would agree with what i ' m saying , those who have experienced the worst of discrimination are usually the most motivated to end it .
   (ID: 90779ea1e5aa2ec3ed3a1fa6b99a8207c0d66d3e)

   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

3. i mean it just objectively does , a signal , a loud one at that , that you can  t turn off ? when does it end ? why not just give a signal for any and every crime , look at it like this if the average person has digit , digit days alive and you ruined . digit peoples sleep , digit , digit , digit is it worth it ? there has to be some end , i don  t care . don  t amber alert me , i  m not going to pay attention to it either way .
   (ID: 203253ab73b19e5cd1d950c82537271605475cea)

4. i get what you ' re saying , but i think that by not doing homework you ' re making their job really difficult , because they rely on you doing some learning  work at home so they can get through with everything they are supposed to teach you .
   (ID: e6c4a2b8e8c999b54ade342babc3d7b48868cc6d)

5. terrorists who do nothing but play into the hands of other radical groups . whether or not their ideologically is inherently as bad as say a nazi is irrelevant , it ' s more that they add fuel to the fire so to speak .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

   (ID: 161e54996257552df993f906d6f848a053922141)

   (ID: e5fd25110413c69853218bbcbb0169f73c8f06e1)

10. i think you ' re overanalyzing this pic , op never said anything about men or women , he probably meant something along the lines of " from ' having a penis ' to ' not having a penis anymore ' " , without mentioning gender , sex or self  identity , this is literally only about losing a dick , it doesn ' t matter if it was an operation or an amputation also this is a meme about a tv character , why on earth would you be offended
   (ID: 4cd63391f1644eb1dde02717bf6a72fc6c22acc7)

11. posting something that i as a muslim support doesn ' t make me a cunt . you using a generalising term clearly shows the upbringing you ' ve got . wow . shows where you stand ? oh wait . nowhere !
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

12. i would like to join a raiding guild for legion but what if the spec i want to play is not the top spec for that class ? are you going for world first ? no ? then no one will care . play what ' s fun . edit  typo
   (ID: 2e464b2732570f16afced14ab79d30fa92622627)

13. you have a friend ?
   (ID: ce0130e0736ec79181ef08a51b107514a8021d5c)

14. digit he didn  t make another post about all religions digit he can have whatever views he wants to have , just as i can call out a potential inconsistency in the view . why the fuck do you even care anyway ? do you disagree with my point ? or do you just have some ridiculous need to argue about absolutely nothing .
   (ID: dc513faaa334954cbf68db2825ec42a31e42fac2)

15. at least at club level i know loads of bowlers who can get the ball to swing and these bowlers are often ex  county or professional overseas players . in terms of spin , i wouldn ' t go as far as saying the threats neutralised because sometimes the ball will skid in and sometimes it will grip ? just a personal opinion . ofc having played both in england and india . the surfaces in india and i assume countries with warmedrier countries are a lot nicer to bowl spin on but the challenge british pitches set are unique !
   (ID: 44477e54e9e15675b9ad5c3be02b0440724c674b)

16. the hold music is really terrible . it ' s hard to imagine who thought that was a good idea or why . i end up muting my computer between calls but then when i alt  tab sometimes i miss a call .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

17. do you really think the game is " unplayable " on consoles ? the fps problem is the only thing holding me back right now . i like the game concept but unblockable fast attacks sound like a big problem , and i ' m a casual gamer , i just want to play for the fun , so i don ' t like that . don ' t you think it ' s possible for ubisoft to fix this ?
   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

18. digit the lady at the pizzeria said she would serve any customers who came into the shop but that she would not provide pizzas to a gay wedding . digit i seriously doubt the law would have covered her in this instance . no doubt she would have tried to use the law to cover her but i don ' t think it would have been upheld by any court . digit if she is really against gay weddings personally do you really think its right that she be forced to service a gay wedding or loose her business ? if you think its ok to force someone to do something they are morally against then i think there is something wrong with you personally . if you think its not ok for a person to make a living if they dont have the exact same values as you do , then again , i think that there is something wrong with you .
   (ID: 35eb47890f8874bbb988ec8308ba762f8377b3b8)

19. i think that unborn children should also have bodily autonomy . i use the scientific definition of life , which does begin at conception . the resulting embryo has dna independent from it ' s parents . it ' s a unique , human life . i would say that life is the most important right . freedom as opposed to slavery is highly important , but you cannot have freedom if you are not alive . therefore both killing of the innocent and slavery should not be allowed by a moral people . additionally , i would like to say that the parents of a fetus have already made choices leading to the resulting baby . i think you should be responsible for your actions . if you don ' t want a baby , either don ' t have sex , or use contraceptives . then the whole issue can be avoided in the first place .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

20. why is there so much hate for that scene ?
