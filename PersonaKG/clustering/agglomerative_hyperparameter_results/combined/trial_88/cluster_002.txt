13. r1d29 . i have no idea what i really want to have on d31 but i have noticed oddly that i have been generally craving various non  compliant foods more in the past few days than i did throughout the first digit days . weird . i would have thought that the cravings would have been very strong in the beginning and not the end . i still feel like i can maintain eating healthier though . this is huge for me as i had the diet of a digit year old before this . sugar , burgers and fries and then some sugar . i ' ve eaten foods that i " hated " or would never try during this round . after making the spinach frittata with added avacado on day digit for my wife , i girded myself for trying to just get through eating it and keeping it down . i kinda started crying halfway through it as the ingredients were the antithesis of what i would normally eat and yet it was delicious . i felt pretty foolish , but man , this has truly changed my perspective on food and i ' ve become so much more adventurous . i can ' t thank my friends enough who recommended we try whole digit . easily the best thing i ' ve ever done for my body and my health .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

14. my wife and i began this morning and though we know it will get tough , we were so happy with this breakfast ! i ' ve been a sugar addict all of my adult life and indulge in way too much fast food . my wife said she would do it with me to make it easier and i ' m determined to see this through . just made the spaghetti squash with the tomato sauce and some ground turkey for dinner . if we can keep making food this good it will certainly ease the pain of not indulging my bad habits .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

15. i like thinking about this sorta thing and enjoy reading this collection of predictionshttp    .

   (ID: 622ae5e8e0ffe2c066a3d94dcee004b5696643bb)

17. its nice to here all those things . i could give you one advice for creating memes dough . have you heard of meme generator before ? its a mobile app for free with all sorts of meme templates and lots of customizability . the great thing is if you are not home you still can make a meme on the go ! that is atleast what i always do and i can ' t recommend it enough . still thanks for all the support dough , it has been kinda hard making memes lately because i have a sorta writers block . you may have noticed that i upload daily which i dont recommend . so its always nice to hear nice things like that

18. i really want to just say thank you , i was nervous opening up about my fear on such a large platform . i wake up knowing i have so much potential with how i ' m able to handle myself in different situations . i often ask and find myself noticing how much lack of common sense their is in the world and i ' m quick to pick things up and feel like i have great communication skills . i feel torn inside my heart and mind at times but i need to get my shit together one step at a time and just focusing on my future . it ' s just i still find myself not knowing how with what field i can excel in . so i will need to work on the basics .
