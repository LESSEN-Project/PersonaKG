11. absolutely . you could also create a personal grooming schedule where , for example , each friday morning you wax  shave to his specifications . in fact , a " standard work " schedule where each day of the week you have an assigned task might help you stay focused and occupied . for example , maybe each monday you wash your panties by hand naked of course , tuesday you practice skills naked , wednesday you study the sub culture online , thursday you practice skills again , friday you groom . you can identify whatever regular tasks you think appropriate and schedule them so that you have something to look forward to each day . if your husband likes you could even document your schedule and keep a journal . good luck !
