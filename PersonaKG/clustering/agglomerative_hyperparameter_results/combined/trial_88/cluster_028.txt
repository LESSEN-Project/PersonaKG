1. this is probably impractical , but i thought it might be cool if it was like the raid equivalent of ditto , since they both know transform . like you defeat a common raid boss like magikarp or something , and one out of every digit times it transforms into mew probably before the catch , so it ' s still a tough throw and you don ' t accidentally waste golden razz on a magikarp .
   (ID: fc70415de2435c629ec792dbd90c954786c0bd16)

2. crap , i like playing support characters because i am not too great at gw2 when it comes to playing against people as it is my first mmo and i don ' t even know if my builds are any good . the server i play on is henge of denravi , when i play , there is hardly ever anybody on because of the time difference . over the past month i have not been playing gw2 as much because i have hit a wall . i do love jumping into a zerg as a sup gaurd or just tailing a small group i don ' t enjoy pve much since i have run all the dungeon paths multiple times , farmed the crap out of world bosses and getting my ass handed to me in pvp over and over isn ' t appealing . the only thing that has got me coming back is my guildies and doing living world because my so likes living world stuff so we do that together . i have the nbn where i am so latency is not an issue for me tbh , but i spent most of my time playing on an adsl1 connection with an average digit . 5mb speed , latency was a killer . but now the only issue i have with being able to play the game is the constant drops in connection , it ' s not my pc or internet connection either , if my so is playing at the same time she usually drops a few seconds after me . have run a tracert on the hod ip address , it always seems to time out around the 40th  43rd hop so there is nothing i can do about it . because of the drops i can hardly play let alone compete lol .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

3. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

4. better than ? whatcha growing ? what make led ' s your choice currently i have had both
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

5. oneshot . its an undertale like game , but would be even better only if it had gameplay other than speaking with npcs
   (ID: a0849f7d6d0829c8bb5f820aa9bf63584c7471df)

6. swagbucks . is that gimmicky ? i  m not sure . but i get a gift card here and there
   (ID: 4f1b65a581332b9d19507ccf0e921d0967e013e7)

7. man i wish i didn ' t get so motion sick playing pavlov . this looks awesome . i ' ve found that if i jog in place while i ' m moving i can stave off the sickness for a while but it does catch up to me . otherwise i ' d be playing all the time .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

8. One of my favorite things is mw2019.
   (ID: c6b2000b95ec54c8393c3ab07cc2c5acd2563345)

9. when you don ' t have to ask this question .
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

10. how do i do the bronze pack method ? what players am i looking out for ? what do i sell and not sell ?
   (ID: 48e565f53f18e7fed27267c945fb81bb868c90f3)

11. probably one of my favorite game . the combat and movement are fluid , and the maps are very well designed . if you want to play stealthily , the maps offer many different ways to achieve your goal . if you want to don ' t want to play stealthily , you get a large array of weapons and powers . just watch stealthgamerbr on youtube to see what i ' m talking about . great replayability , and the dlc that comes with this bundle is excellent as well  they ' re not just short missions , but lengthy sets of missions which introduce you to new characters and powers . the only drawbacks i can think of are that some people may not like the artstyle , and that people complain about some powers being op . also , if you ' re a completionist , finding all gold in every stage is a pain . for  digit , it ' s a must buy imo
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

12. if you think that way you  ll never make money .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

13. put the good deathrattle minion in your deck i found the problem in the good word . there are no really good deathrattle minions right now .
   (ID: f2ddf323cbf1466909e7e09f048b5e781f523d4a)

14. you know what ? just give her a tank , a straight up trigger tank that uses continuous bagworm  sheild  chameleon , it moves by scorpion  raygust that can easily be changed from legs to treads or even fins , hound minigun turrets and an ibis barrel , drops meteor mines like mario kart banana skins , lol and even throw in geist for uber carnage . chika does not even need to be the pilot , she can just be the battery and let someone else take care of the raw destruction , i ' m pretty sure shiori or yotaro would love to drive it round like an rc .
   (ID: 64ee30820164d5febf4618f35085fd26a3387cc9)

15. you realize that you have to go to sleep at digit pm . is not fun sometimes but it makes waking up a lot easier . oh , and coffee . lots and lots of coffee .

   (ID: b5f9b695867ef3b560a4fe7610f75e43b62809f6)

20. might and magic digit  the mandate of heaven . i don ' t remember how old i was , but very young . i ' d sit on either my older brother ' s or dad ' s lap and use the directional arrows on the keyboard to move , they would do everything else . still remember everything about it , what i wouldn ' t give to hear another goblin growl " hahroo " great game for beginners , especially if you want to learn how to use a computer .
