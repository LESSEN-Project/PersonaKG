4. thanks all . i ' ve done a large scale crown lift on the tree , so hopefully shouldn ' t be too bad with the light . it ' s a neighbour ' s tree but i took as much advantage as i dared when they said i could do what i wanted to it . the area got a fair bit of sun in the summer last year , before i cut the tree . so will risk it , i don ' t really have much option to go elsewhere with the plots . the daikon  green manure idea sounds good . but can i resist the urge to get growing veg this year ?

5. you can still flip while ur mapping . just go to trade channel and spam your desired ratio make it somewhat realistic tho . someone is bound to hit you up . it ' s how i do it . be warned though , trade chat is pretty bad so feel free to mute those low  no challenge ' players ' selling brightbeaks at 1ex .

   (ID: 35c328d4a335c5fd9ddfe5f40bbfd2580065561c)

11. there ' s a few good youtube videos on it . watch mark kermode revisit on the film , where he feels more warmer to it . take a look at ' the philosophy of cloud atlas , how beauty will save the world ' and the in  depth analysis by ' the angry hippo ' such a shame the film is so polarising . as jim broadbent ' s character says " if you extend your patience for just a moment , you will find there is a method to this tale of madness "

20. so did i , actually ! one day it just all fit into place and so i started devouring everything i could find about trans lives and the science behind it . you can never know too much exactly and to be honest , you don ' t really need to relate to or understand someone ' s struggles to be able to support them through it . it ' s called being a decent human being . thank you , friend  digit
