3. me ? i dont have an existential crisis anymore i accepted we probably live in a simulation a while ago sounds stupid but look up neil degrass tyson ' s video on it he explains it really well but you should probably just take your mind off of it and or work toward accepting it and like me it might give you some weird peace knowing that nothing you ever do will matter .

6. whenever people find their way here they always think it will be like " the one that flew over the cukoos nest " with lobotomy and ect though electroconvulsive therapy is not that medival and in reality greatly assists those suffering from long term depression , it is literally like a whole new person comes out . not lobotimized , more like a medical miracle . plus the media only focuses on the dramatic rather than the relatable , tragically .
   (ID: b5153b16e61f6bc5e4bf4d8db479b7093df1ae26)

7. until adolescents a child would not live without interaction and warmth of others . after that they would probably just go crazy . but i think there was a study using chimps where they took away all interaction with living species from the baby chimps and even though they had all the necessities to sustain their health they simply refused to eat and died .
