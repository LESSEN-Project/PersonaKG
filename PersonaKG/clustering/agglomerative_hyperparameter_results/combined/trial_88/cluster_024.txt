5. i think removing all the seagulls and talking would make the video a lot better . you don ' t even have to talk yourself you could let some computer voice do it . also instead of the seagull screams . you could play some music in the background . i think if you do that the video is a lot more appealing

   (ID: d45001f1fdd37cda488cfddffabec23e83ee7b7e)

16. in nyc it ' s tough . pretty much the only way you ' re going to get a shot at going up at a club is through a bringer show drag digit to digit friends out on a weekday night for digit minutes of stage time . you need get an audition and do well to get passed at a club , and that ' s not easy . if you ' re really interested in stand  up , go to some local open mics , write jokes , perform regularly , learn  listen to other comics , and see if any of them book their own shows . most the comics i know in nyc start their own shows at bars  venues because stage time is so hard to come by , so getting booked on one of those is probably a good goal to aim for .

17. they ' re just doodles i felt like sharing with the sub . there ' s plenty of great fan art out there , so go look at that if you want something more professional . don ' t gatekeep what other people can post .

18. your post reminded me of one where a woman responded to someone saying that she really liked the idea of getting a sword , but didn ' t know what she ' d do with it . the responder said that whenever she got dressed up nice to go out , or had a job interview or whatever , she ' d take down the sword and just slowly walk round the house with it , and it gave her a sense of calm and power . you could rock the cape in the same way . sorry i can ' t find the link .
   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

19. i made a built for my dad recently and we went with a rm550x or rm650x if i recall . it might be the digit
   (ID: d9e6e1ecc09dc9affbcc8ccb0191ff241370a782)

20. ahh i understand , but you know why i  m saying  bad  ? because i  m surrounded by friends and family that aren  t into the art creation thing so i have to make something  good  so they enjoy it as much as i do because i love to share my work with people , also this is like the  mascot  of my brand that i  m trying to make so i  m trying to stay away from copying people because i don  t want any problems or any legal issues with anyone you know ?
