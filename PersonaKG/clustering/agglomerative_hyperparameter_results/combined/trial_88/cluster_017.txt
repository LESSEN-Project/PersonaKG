10. it ' s not rude at all ! i do enjoy talking to folks with different thoughts and opinions on the world , as long as its a respectable conversation . i ' ve always believed that god lets us have our free will . i mean , what a life we would have if we where micro  controlled by a guy we didn ' t really know . i also think that bad things happen , because we don ' t live in a perfect world , and while i don ' t know what a perfect world would be really , i could say that it would be no harm to anyone . the world we live in is thanks to the fall , and is a consequence of that decision  thanks , eve !  unfortunately . humans , in my opinion , also need to have something to look up to , something greater than themselves , whether that be science , a public figure , a deity , or even an object .

   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

20. just one point of advice . i don ' t care if you take it or leave it . when you disagree with someone , keep the argument on  topic . if you are talking about latin american revolutions , just talk about that . resist the temptation to bring in things like mao , etc . you might feel justified , but it ' s not a productive way to interact , because  a the topic of latin american revolutions is complicated enough on its own , without bringing in the chinese . you ' re just opening a new can of worms , trust me . b the other person will take it as a personal attack , even if it wasn ' t . c it feels to the other person , anyway like you are deflecting . that is , it feels like you are trying to change the subject , and refocus the conversation on her shortcomings , rather than dealing with the topic at hand . she will see you as immature , like a school boy who gets caught cheating , and then screams , " but jimmy cheated last week , and got away with it ! " it does not matter if jimmy got away with it . we are talking about you cheating right now , and talking about jimmy is off  topic . again , this will only make you seem immature .
