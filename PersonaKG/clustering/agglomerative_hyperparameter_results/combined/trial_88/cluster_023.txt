1. it ' s been implied that the infertility problems are due to pollution and bad farming practices . during the visit by the mexican delegates i remember either fred or serena talking about the improved pollution problem . also in flashbacks to the red center we see aunt lydia talking about pollution lowering the birthrate and she also pins some blame on women who can give birth but refuse by taking birth control or aborting . edit to add  i ' ve read the book too and know it was much more nuanced than that . my comment is based off what information they ' ve given us in the show so far .
   (ID: e387b7eddf8ab01e3dd767dc2f5ca52494fbe9b0)

2. is that like an emt ? if so , i would count first responder as medical professional . is there no reason you can think of why they would not want to put the brace on a person with an injured neck ? i don ' t know one , i just got curious after you mentioned it in your other post . just those guys seemed like emts so i would hope they knew what they were doing . lol
   (ID: 88c65ad9c962da115240776d5aa110748286db73)

3. if they already know everything about you how could it hurt ? i thought they were the feds who else has this power ? the first step to getting help is proving the problem exists . you ' ll notice that black people are starting to get help with police violence now that they ' re able to film the police . do you have everything to gain and nothing to lose but your delusions .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

4. this sis literally the stupidest thing you ever heard ? someone maybe doing some diy instead of purchasing the finished product ?
   (ID: a283688fea41e1110e58705ec74d4e325e46d87e)

5. and then they  d likely sanitise it or not serve the food . what do you think happens in a regular restaurant when that happens ? they just leave the blood and hope for the best ?
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

6. i mean it  s certainly possible just seems super unlikely to me . really a one trick pony company as solarcity probably isn  t going to take them there , and sure some of them tend to do good but just like other car companies there will be a ton of competition and to me it also seems pretty unlikely we will see a completely electric car world unless there is massive improvement in battery life and charge time . even so there are tons of other car companies . i mean we will see just seems a bit of a pipe dream to me , suppose we will see though . i mean if tesla completely eliminates all other car companies and electric cars take over the world we could see a multi trillion dollar tesla in digit  digit value , but even still it  s not  my kids will thank me later off my tax return  kind of money .
   (ID: 203253ab73b19e5cd1d950c82537271605475cea)

7. how idiotic do you have to be to not tell if something is hateful ? you don ' t get to decide what is hateful or not . i thought you were supposed to be tolerant of other people ' s views , but it seems if people have a different pov than you , you are ok with censorship . doesn ' t that make you a hypocrite ?
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)

8. because some people ' s lives are so perfect that their biggest worry is what some rich dude is going to say on twitter . i envy the people who don ' t sit there counting hours so they can afford to eat dinner .
   (ID: 7008f149db59fea91167255eafa8bc84beab0f01)

9. are you somewhere weed is not totally legal ? if so , i would say mailing joints would be an unnecessary risk . i suggest you give them to a stranger that looks like he smokes weed and maybe you ' ll make a new friend .
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

10. yeah . you work with money and we ' re never trained to spot a fake ? everything from  digit up has a security strip inside that says the denomination on it when you hold it up to the light .
   (ID: 8f7369c6ebb47df350fec663be46dfd8481ee2db)

11. oh yeah , sure , go kill your own men just to bug someone to where they want to fight . unless the us is run by some digit year olds , i ' m pretty sure that ' s not the case .
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

12. it ' s not only russians . there are a lot of groups like albanians , servians etc . that are portrayed as villains and that is because it is known that there are mafia groups in those countries .
   (ID: e059f82a0624202d909920e56dd76f76efa711d2)

13. could his terrible decision making and chronic lying and inordinate greed and hate mongering not infect every aspect of life in america ? i will stop talking about that guy and will actually stop thinking about him forever when he is in jail where he belongs . frankly , the fact that a person could commit this many freaking felonies with zero repercussions and still have people saying , " ew , can we just stop talking about him " let alone actual supporters denying that he is a con man and a criminal are a lot more remarkable to me than the fact that his behavior comes up every time the topic is " something stupid " or " something evil " or " something that needs to be changed  fixed " people who actually like america should be talking about it more . it will already take decades for us to repair the damage he ' s done so far . so yeah , he might come up in conversation proportionate to his impact on the world . if you would rather live in a place where nobody feels safe offering their opinion on politics , you could move to china .
   (ID: 54097549786e78808b0d9772bb36b401b5761588)

14. yeah i ' m guessing so . it would have to feel weird as hell though . they probably have a drug to duplicate that feeling .
   (ID: b5942acb07bb8a74e4924ef75fa70edb4f626161)

15. who on earth has such an appalling lack of class and manners that they would feel it ' s appropriate to joke about someone with an illness that ' s going to kill them ? how on earth could you do that and still live with your conscience , knowing what kind of utter douchebag you are ?
   (ID: 514a3ecd0d04716c9225352c4a3a5d5424dd8056)

16. when you care for your child so much that you don ' t even care what happens to the world , that ' s some hardcore loving for your child right there .
   (ID: a63ea1e6bf1e972229635648a0b3371aeddb4f3d)

17. One of my favorite things is corbyn.
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

18. you wont get charged with a hate crime . that ' s something he cant dictate anyway , only the prosecutors office can and i doubt this will go that far at all as long as there was no damage .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

19. you should see his previous speeches where he essentially generalized the population of mexico as a bunch of rapists , murderers , and thieves . i can ' t figure out the exact reason , but this has to be a smoke screen . someone , somewhere is doing something diabolical , but we ' re fixated on trump and what he will say next . tl  dr illuminaughty touched my body .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

20. why ask a question if you ' re going to incorrectly assume the answer ? i know you were trying to be sarcastic , but it just comes off as smug . i ' m sure you could convince me and others of your argument if you actually tried , but that doesn ' t seem to be your goal here . if you do want to engage in meaningful discussion , i ' m all ears .
