1. i make music . my advice is no matter how " bad " you think you sound compared to whoever your current favorite artist is , and no matter how much you want to give up , if it ' s your passion ? dont stop . eventually you will make something so beautiful , you ' ll say to yourself " wow , did i seriously make that " , and later in life you will come back to those artists you loved and say " huh , i actually am as good as them . it ' s a process . and some of us are slow learners . but if you love it ? don ' t give up on it .
   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

2. why does what you do in your free time have any bearing on what you do at work ? in your mind , is it impossible for someone who likes to get high to refrain from doing so at work ? if you drink beer or alcohol , how is that any different ? should having a beer at home disqualify you from driving a forklift at work the next day ? these are genuine questions .
   (ID: 74058c90ada3aae7a59703064acbf3ced38f3681)

3. this . thank you i was trying to figure out a good way to explain it .
   (ID: a8b3c82ca36eb4e48fd6b6674a642f96d401743e)

4. learn to do something you ' ve always wanted to know how to do .
   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

5. I follow world news.
   (ID: 9414b9913220ebe2601862e3001aac74ebcffe33)

6. i ' d cheat at gambling . roulette and craps would both be very easy to win lots of money on with a little practice . you could also do it a bit more subtly by betting on horse races or sports games , then attending them and using your powers to make the team you bet on win the game .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

7. proved i was good at a card game by winning at the card game is how i see it , but yeah fair enough haha
   (ID: 8df56ee782672f11aeb0f19bf7978b1b1c04e678)

8. I follow world news.

   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

10. it should be legal , and like every other business where people provide a service like hair dressers , nail techs , etc it should be regulated for health and job security . psych services should be provided as well .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

11. you sound like you do this for a living . am i in the ballpark
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

12. i think some people have mentioned that unless the sandbox is encouraged through narrative play , it won ' t occur even if the mechanics allow it . i like this idea , though , of sandboxing the game . here are some ideas off the top of my head   like orig dnd allow servants , slaves , and followers as rewards for quests , until your party is full of them  reward players with real estate  introduce a need for it and then create submechanics for things like smithing a sword , building a battering ram , or even modifying spells  introduce combinable elements . perhaps the magic shop doesn ' t sell potions , just ingredients . i hope these are helpful jumping off points !
   (ID: df28c2a39b633ca418192316a199668289382292)

13. i ' ve thought about this . i don ' t want a cure mainly because that would require change and as an aspergers guy i don ' t really like change . my life , it ' s not great but it ' s not the worst thing in the world . once i ignore society and their expectation and definitions of success i ' m doing alright . i ' ve got enough to eat , a place to sleep and a pc to game on . i ' m still trying to get a job but that ' s the only thing i want but can ' t seem to get . a girlfriend would be nice too .
   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

14. is english not your first language ? you don ' t need a degree , any degree helps . but you can show up to some smaller towns and look up lesson plans online and just start teaching . build your clientele , develop a reputation , and grow your business
