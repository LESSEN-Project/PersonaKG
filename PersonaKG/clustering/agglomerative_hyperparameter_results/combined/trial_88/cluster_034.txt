1. the most recent happy world daddy and kstv2 were very funny
   (ID: 5c9dd67e95ee5403b2bd9a6848c017674d46396b)

2. i lack the basic knowledge of markets and the economy and whenever i try to watch a youtube video for beginners i can  t understand anything . this book is pretty good i  m on the first chapter right now and it  s digit pages long so i don  t know if it will solve the questions i have . this is all good , you can ' t instantly know everything in all honestly , i would load up a paper trading account on and have at it . just try to figure out how to trade , put on the stoch rsi and macd . these are two very basic indicators that cover momentum and moving averages . then you can maybe employ some very basic ta . i can ' t vouch for the more " advanced " ta as i feel it gets into overfitting territory and i don ' t use it . as always though , whatever works for some you use that . learn through trying and failing . honestly my favorite way to learn . if something doesn ' t work you can rule it out and move on . keep improving with each attempt and you ' ll eventually reach your destinations ! you ' ll quickly learn the things you need to learn to progress . i would maybe also read trading in the zone , by mark douglas . ironically , do this after you have done some paper trading , some of the concepts won ' t resonate as well until after you have some experiences under your belt .  if you guys could recommend any book  udemy courses  resources or learning plan i  ll be really great full . thanks ! i hate to sound like a shill , but i ' m starting a youtube channel to help with some of these things . it focuses a bit more on the tech side of trading but hopefully has some interesting stuff nonetheless . here is a video on how to create your first indicator . getting a handle on indicators i feel is really important , you ' ll start to understand why data presented this way or that is good or bad . how stuff works pretty much . also , there ' s several types of daytrading , i personally like to scalp , whatever works for you work though . at the end of the day as long as you ' re getting a return without crazy risk you ' re doing great . this is what i ' ve been able to do with btc over the past few months . basically , i look for opportunities to score a quick digit  here and there and go for it ! lastly , if you have any questions you can ' t figure out with google , you can always come back to this sub . i ' ve found it to be a lot more friendly than most places out there . also with the " self policing " there ' s a few less " snake oil salesmen "
   (ID: 555e0a759f14862796f4bd93bf9906c2cd011ab7)

3. One of my favorite things is hamilton.

4. i have not played the first game . but i hear the second one is a massive improvement over the second one . it has gotten some pretty nice reviews .
   (ID: a70e276355baaea2f732281343d3f63ea5d96365)

5. don ' t stop me now by queen .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

6. there ' s really no difference functionality  wise between the newer generations of smart phones . do we really need more powerful phones if we won ' t even use the to their full potential ? do we really need to go thinner instead of thicker for more battery life ? and storage is really dependent on how much money you throw at it . the only thing i see separating iphones and android phones at this point is the os and a headphone jack .
   (ID: 395865cc8932d0b3d13214bce052e8915f32835b)

7. you  ve finally given me something to look forward to .
   (ID: 6b89f03adeaf831281bcca46ec5a469e09e400c0)

8. the texas chainsaw massacre remake . must have been six or seven , don ' t get me wrong , it was an awesome movie , but it got a lot harder to sleep after that .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

9. i think i found it ! something called " captain blasto . this article says that one of his lines is " honey i ' m home "  here ' s a gameplay video , though it looks ps1 instead of n64 . but this is definitely your guy , in space with a blaster with the wisecracks very much like the gex game i remembered
   (ID: abbe051c76bbb939d8594349cac549cb5435920d)

10. One of my favorite things is onward.
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

11. i prefer for comic book worlds to remain mostly static . i ' m not totally against change . without change , dick grayson would still be robin . however , i don ' t like when characters have been one way for their entire publication history and the writers change them for the sake of " diversity " . that ' s lazy and insulting to the fanbase . if it ' s really so important for them to include more minority characters , then they should write new and interesting minority characters . it would be so much better if riri williams were to fight alongside tony stark rather than in his place . have amadeus cho join the hulk family along with rick jones , jennifer walters , and betty ross . it annoys me when writers basically say to their audience , " oh , you ' d prefer to read about johnny blaze rather than robbie reyes ? too bad . johnny ' s gone . robbie is your only option . " i wouldn ' t mind these new characters if i still got to keep the old ones . you can always count on brian michael bendis to ruin everything . the only good thing that man ever gave us was jessica jones . other than that , everything he ' s written has been trash . he ruined iceman and turned iron man into a digit year  old girl because he ' s a terrible writer who can only continue to sell books with pure shock value . marvel is a pathetic shell of its former self and i ' m not sure it will ever recover .
   (ID: 17d6f5fb6fdd1b0ceedb5ec118276bdbb72a462f)

12. watch precure . it  s super underrated compared to stuff like sailor moon and madoka magica and that saddens me . also the community is really chill compared to ahem others on the internet . sadly there is no official way to watch it on a platform like crunchyroll , as far as i know , but i  ll leave a link to the kissanime page for the current season
   (ID: 6f88a57b804dffb05f07ee78e02223947d9055aa)

13. my take on it is that  how can we prove they really kicked us out of the group just before the final boss ? a screenshot doesn ' t really prove we got kicked out . for all anet knows we might just be out to give this people a bad time for whatever reason .
   (ID: 261413214c13676b8aee2ce20a47107c4ccfe6b8)

14. this . its one of the best cartoons made in the last digit years , watch that shit , you pompous ass .
   (ID: d8681af7ff5797fb2ffcb9a4a08f377463526e2d)

15. when i first heard about the cast for the greatest showman i wasn  t impressed . zac efron and zendaya . but damn i love that movie .
   (ID: 74cc8b596c27cbe385709690baaf3b68f39b3915)

16. it ' s about the dust bowl . especially if you ' re from the states , it ' s worth a read . it ' s hard to believe this happened not that long ago . pretty horrific stuff .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

17. although i love clannad and code geass with all of my heart . they arent flawless . and i dont think its good to keep saying to yourself that nothing will beat this anime . because then you ' re making it harder for yourself to find a really good anime . i recommend going in every anime with the thought that this could be you ' re digit  anime . this way you can enjoy more anime .
   (ID: 622ae5e8e0ffe2c066a3d94dcee004b5696643bb)

18. it ' s based on a novel series which does go further than the anime . there ' s digit novels and the anime adapted the first four .
   (ID: fdf9c56e21cf61fb3b2852da66f6506ce908651c)

19. the movies from digit and i wouldn  t say it  s a must watch classic either so .
   (ID: bdf7e254fb732651bb0373067c57200731f7ca55)

20. i saw that movie once in elementary school , teacher skipped all the good parts including the end , always thought it was a bad movie since . even worse it was the same teacher that allowed i am legend to be shown in full
