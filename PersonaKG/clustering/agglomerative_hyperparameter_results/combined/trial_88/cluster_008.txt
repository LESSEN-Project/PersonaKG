   (ID: 20b71c431f98b1f88ec1b3e7ada79d31df65a8c2)

7. " everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth "  mike tyson imagine having a lot of knowledge about eye contact , but once you actually interact wifh anyone , you can ' t apply any of it . practice and experience will go a lot further than asking someone , and they tell you . but still not having a clue on how to use that knowledge . yes , looking anywhere but down can help . what will also help a lot of going out there , make mistakes , and learning from them . have you ever mistakenly thought someone was looking at you , but turns out that they are actually looking at someone else ? now apply that to looking at their mouth , they won ' t notice moral of the story is , practice makes perfect . you can have all the resources but never be able to do it if you don ' t practice
