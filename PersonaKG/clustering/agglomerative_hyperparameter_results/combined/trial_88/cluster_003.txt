9. i dont know about pudding because even if she becomes good she doesnt have any purpose in strawhat crew but saying that katakuri will be joining im thinking u are trolling otherwise he is the strongest after big mom and lets say her security guard and if u say about her realitonship with the kids i think is the same will all of them they fear her and they are tools for her acomplishments , so katakuri doesnt seem mistreated or anything .

17. we are finding it fun and manageable as we enter month digit with our digit month lab . he  s definitely not an adult yet and there is training that needs doing regarding occasional rude behavior and overstimulation , but he  s very nice to the cat and has a great temperament . for a first time owner having a baby at the same time as a puppy or young dog might be crazy . a new dog is kind of like a baby , you  re always trying to figure out what it wants and how to get it to go to sleep ! perhaps i  m speaking too soon but as long as we have a dog walker and have like . digit hours outside of work to train  exercise  bond with him , he seems very happy and sleeps all night . we ski on weekends and feel bad about the alone time , so usually try to spend one day doing a lot of dog  centric active stuff with him .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

18. honestly after talking to allot of people . i main her and i basically use the sweep as a mental tool . people will almost always dodge the sweep on reaction bc it  s so rewarding , if you delay the sweep it turns into a gb . the only buff she needs is a damage boost .
   (ID: ef2135d90df57b27df5e96791848d8d9201afd29)

19. when i saw her appear on the news i instantly thought " fucking useless " . i honestly don ' t have any animosity to her , barely knew she existed before all this , but now she ' ll always be " fucking useless " to me .
