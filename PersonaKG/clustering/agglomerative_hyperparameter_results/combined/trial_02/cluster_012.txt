2. as a child , i suffered a lot from ear infections and as a result i had these drainage tubes which meant that water at the time was a big no . even though that ' s a thing of the past now , my ears are still quite sensitive when it comes to pressure and i would very much like to avoid experiencing what the girl from your scuba class had to go through . i guess i ' ll have to stick to snorkeling .

   (ID: 50043497a219924fd275a92e5dadb6e04bac5936)

14. ok . i ' m genuinely curious . what possible course of action could you have done differently , to " save me " from the " burning world " as you put it . that required me beliveing in you ? what possible new resource do you gain from my belief in your " prediction " that will stop the world from burning ? or at least save me from this fiery premonition of doom ? p . s . i don ' t think listened and end is a good rhyme , and it maybe would have helped your case more if you rhymed all your " song ' s " verse .

16. yes , i would do it in an instant . sorry to be depressing , but i ' ve already tried committing suicide for this reason . i was and am tired of waiting for whatever is beyond this life . as a person who lives kindly , i feel i have already learned what i was supposed to . i see that " reality " is intentionally vague  every answer poses even more questions . to search unendingly for answers in this life would drive someone to insanity as they roller coaster between enlightenment and confusion . tl  dr i already want to learn what is next by dying .
   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

17. hey man . i ' m sorry , but one thing you will find out about growing is that the hardest part is getting a nutrient schedule that fits you and the strains you grow . with the list of companies i gave you , it might be easy to figure out what i use , but how much i use is the tricky part . what would you consider a big company ? llc vs inc ? i may be considered a dick for not giving away my schedule that only needs minor tampering based on strain , but to me that is my intellectual property . i am willing to help people with their schedules , but i am not willing to give them mine , nor will i recommend a specific product i use unless i think it is the only product available that is suitable for mmj . if you ever need help with a nutrient schedule that fits you or what your plant needs , lmk i ' ve messed with quite a few different companies . i haven ' t used roots organic , botanicare mainline nutrients , gh maxi series , cyco and nectar of the godsi quit growing in soil before they came out . one thing i have found makes a difference is using fertilizers formulated specifically for marijuana . one thing i would recommend is using advanced nutrients sensi if possible for soil grows along with other nutrients , and connoseur a and b for your base nutrients in hydro .
   (ID: e978c4c5dd931b8985b65369abe1ef855c833aa3)
