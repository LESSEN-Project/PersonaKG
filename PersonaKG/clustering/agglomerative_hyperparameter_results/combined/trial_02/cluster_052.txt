Total from this dataset: 885

1. i have the right to my life , and i will defend it from those who wish to take it until i am no longer able . if you choose to lay down and be walked on , well , that ' s your choice . and i feel sorry for you .
   (ID: 74058c90ada3aae7a59703064acbf3ced38f3681)

2. i ' m not the one overreacting to the point of personal attack . it takes a minute at most to type this message , and far less than that to type two words into a search bar for an example . if your first reaction to somebody pointing out a simple mistake of yours for the sake of future improvement is to claim they ' re painting you as a felon and that they ' re a psychopath , i don ' t think i ' m the one who needs to take a step back and analyze their own actions . if a normal person would just downvote and move on , then why are you demonstrating otherwise ?
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

3. i ' m not going to downvote anything you say because i ' m open to anything you have to say . the question wasn ' t asking for evidence . the question was asking about what makes each individual believe in god . and you don ' t , so you kinda wasted your time by coming in here and generally just trying to start an argument . when you say there is no evidence , you are only approaching reality through what you see and feel from your own perspective , which is all any of us can really do . thing is , everyone has a different view of reality . that in itself is mind boggling . we are a collective consciousness trying to make sense of this whole thing . even me and you right now are like synapses firing in a huge brain right now trying to imagine two sides of this coin . but yeah whatever man , blow jobs and garbage , everything is nothing , and we may as well just fuck the earth to death because it ' s gonna happen eventually , right ?
   (ID: cb830ff94bb369e5db655e15ee074f392a52c14f)

4. i ' d have to say more agnostic then anything . if there is or are gods however , they aren ' t the kind i ' d consider worth any appreciation .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

5. all you have to do to avoid them feeling attacked is not get charged up emotionally . easy as a psychopath . not sure what exercises for that to suggest the rest of you peasants .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

6. there should absolutely be gun control . let ' s face it  if the only reason you want guns is " to be able to defend yourself against the government " , it ' s the bloody government . they monitor everything and have by far the best weapons , soldiers and training . if you want to go against them , do you really think you ' d last two minutes , even with the best weaponry you can get ahold of ? as others have said , other countries have gun control and have comparatively little issue with mass shootings . digit or is it digit ? people have just been killed . at sandy hook a few years back , digit or so infants . there have been many others . if this were a terrorist attack , where mr mohammed abdul or someone stereotypical name , sorry killed even digit people and said he was doing it for isis , then you ' d get so many people saying " kill the brownies " not the uk girl guide " brownies " , you understand , trump would be banging on about his wall and travel ban and so on . it would be an act of terror . but some standard , everyday american does it and chances are all we ' ll get is " gun control is a complicated issue , things like this happen but we can ' t control guns as we need our second amendment " . for those who still want things to stay as they are  why ? what does your second amendment mean nowadays , with a government who could do away with you easily no matter how hard you resist ? when was the last time you rose up , and with how much the government and digit  control your lives , why are you not rising up now , guns in arms ? is the second amendment really worth all the blood ?

7. anyone who makes fun of someone  s deformity is a total faggot . try to roast back if someone makes fun of you . usually just telling on then or something like that wont usually do anything but make it worse .
   (ID: 701f8001d10c04dcd53d9b13ab2a896b452e50f7)

8. i don ' t mind a bit of rugby although i prefer league to union , but the thing annoys me about rugby fans is that they are incapable of not comparing everything that happens on the field to football . they love to talk about the superior moral code of rugby to football , but imagine if wayne rooney had been found guilty of eye  gouging , biting , punching , swearing at a referee , elbowing , headbutting and striking , and still not been sacked as england captain . it is absolutely not an exaggeration to say there would be questions in parliament and general moral outrage . but of course dylan hartley is a nice middle  class boy playing a nice middle  class sport , so it ' s all good .
   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

9. i like facts and reason . why do you use words you don ' t understand ?
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

10. i ' ve personally faced violence for being a transman more than once , and i live in a really bigoted place filled with truly awful people . i totally get where you ' re coming from  the point of my comment was actually to point of that transmen face their share of issues with being trans . most commonly , in my experience , misogyny that reduces us down to genitals and the use that men can have for them .
   (ID: 77e0b8c51dfb89ff57bd838b86ee4d78a9fe856f)

11. in a crowd recording  taking pics with smart phones instead of being in the moment
   (ID: 7c0a90108389e898ab80f1c7af44e170b85c6d76)

12. you are clearly wise beyond your years .
   (ID: af0db6dfe4be67a6b6915437597ea564bbb33830)

13. i ' m a buddhist . the thing i admire about atheists is their sense of responsibility . there is no divine push that guides them to do right , nor is there an evil corruptor that guides them to do bad . there are no excuses for their actions beyond their own intuition . if you do good , it ' s because you wanted to . if you do bad , it ' s because you chose to acct poorly .
   (ID: 6735159236fd8a4634f1974d6eba7f027dbd1aa7)

14. i get that , and agree with the bit about wasting police resources . what are you up to these days ? i remember your company let you go in the wake of that shitstorm .
   (ID: 6eec77fe98b9dc85ec1e5e7edc37cdb415794719)

15. well , as harsh as it might sound , there might be people in your life who have slept with everyone but you and they still don ' t owe it to you to sleep with you . that said , i guess it ' s one ' s own choice whether one wants to hang around with a person like that , not out of spite , but out of being annoyed by being regaled with all the fine details which might be tmi .
   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

16. amping up teh st00pid , eh ? fine . wtf are you talking about with " opposites " some sort of straw man , i must surmise .  looks who ' s racist now . oh please . " no , you ' re the real racist " glenn beck ? is that you ?  so , where ' s the asian history month ? where ' s the gay history month ? where ' s the deaf history month ? women ' s history month , hispanic heritage month , american indian heritage month , and asian pacific american heritage  these are all stupid ideas . there ' s only one history . there is only one history in fact but the whole point of of such things is not the actual history but the presentation of history . the only history that people ever heard about was nearly devoid of blacks save for demeaning stereotypes . bhm was intended to bring an awareness of the missing history . actually , gay pride exists for precisely the same reason . prior to very recently , the only public images and perceptions of gays were nothing but gross caricatures .  i ' m aware that the blacks have had a hard time of it . i don ' t think that ' s relevant to this discussion . what ' s relevant is your apparent ignorance of the meta  history . the very fact that you are decrying bhm clearly shows your ignorance of that very thing .  where does it end ? when people no longer feel the need to complain about black history month , gay pride , et cetera , there will be no need for black history month and gay pride celebrations , et cetera .

17. apparently such people do not exist
   (ID: 9e2852bcfafecccb1e60211326f5fc70d0bbb428)

18. real world , it defeats the purpose of what you  re born with their shouldn  t be any confusion on gender when it comes to that topic . video game  i honestly don  t see it
   (ID: d9e6e1ecc09dc9affbcc8ccb0191ff241370a782)

19. but i ' m sure you can win people over . i ' m not a politician , i couldn ' t care even less what other people think , nor do i have such responsibility to do so . what ' s best isn ' t the same thing as what most people think .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

20. i don ' t believe in a god that would allow a world like this . you can do what you want but i doubt itll change anything . if there is a god it ' s obvious he couldnt give two shits about me or millions of other people for that matter .
