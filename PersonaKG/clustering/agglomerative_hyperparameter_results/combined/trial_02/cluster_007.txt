1. she invited you to her house , showered while you were there and was willing to let you see her in just a towel ? i think you missed some signals , buddy .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

2. go for it . what  s the worst that could happen ?
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

3. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

4. i did this an awful lot in high school , and in my experience it ' s like applying for jobs . after the first couple of dozen you just come to expect it , and the rejection isn ' t so crushing .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

5. first and foremost you ' re doing great already . to some extent a stubborn stressed woman in the third tri is going to require you to roll with a lot of punches no matter what . it ' s entirely possible that what she needs most sometimes , fair or not , is a punching bag to let off some of the steam she has to keep repressed with nearly everyone in her life . my best advice otherwise , try proving to her you ' re doing what you can by getting her to expound on her feelings rather than trying to refute them . she says you ' re not stepping up to the plate ? fine , instead of arguing , ask what you could do better . write the list down , check the items off or at least make progress on them and report back within a couple weeks and ask the same question after . it ' s not a contest or a way to show her up , it ' s an exercise to show in an enumerable way that you ' re doing the best you can not just to be a dad in general , but to address her specific stress points . it ' s important that it not become a contest of any sort . you may have to do it over and over , or different variants for different issues but if you can show her that you ' re addressing her specific concerns instead of just doing what you believe to be responsible which is great , again i applaud your efforts and preparedness it can go a long way to relieving some of her stress on that specific issue , proving commitment to her and validating her feelings .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

6. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

7. thank you , i just find it to be quite logical honestly . checking yourself in the best way you know will work to see if it ' s worth the wait , if your results were different emotionally you would know not to waste your and your so ' s time , which is better than starting the official relationship just for you to find out you don ' t really love her , now that ' s fucked up . goodluck with whatever you decide !
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

8. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path
   (ID: 261413214c13676b8aee2ce20a47107c4ccfe6b8)

9. if you need to scream . then do it , there is more room outside than inside .   x200b
   (ID: 39ba9a65a55c27b50eef7c5cecbc66cc866c4a4c)

10. it depends , honestly . were the charges nolled because you did some type of ar  jail diversion program ? how far is your army recruiter from you ? if they ' re local just bring all your documents if you still have them . if not give them a call , and explain the situation . they ' ll probably tell you right off the bat . i don ' t have my regulations in front of me at the moment , plus i recruit for the national guard so we have our own regulations on top of the army ones .
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

11. i feel like the incident had nothing to do with the lasagna . if he is stressed out he may have just taken it out on you because you were an easy target in the moment . which isn ' t cool . can you sit down with him and simply say " what ' s going on , something is off now and if it is because of me i would like to know . i don ' t think you are being an ass , or oversensitive to something that shouldn ' t have been a big deal or resulted in a cold shoulder . anything in hindsight that may have been leading up to his change ?
   (ID: 7911b1d92de80b0e1abd4e2a29e4f762a8a2908f)

12. i ' m not that much stronger than you are uh ? aren ' t you digit or 11k ? modesty is good , but don ' t contemn all that you ' ve already achieved . you are much stronger .
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

13. i don ' t know about the falling in love and all that . but if you ' re looking for advice take it from someone digit years older than you . forget about her . don ' t even think about it anymore . you ' re young as fuck and there ' s plenty of women out there . and don ' t fall in love .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

14. honestly man , those long hard days at work are what got me through a lot . especially when you have to think about alot of things at work , it keeps your mind busy . i worked digit  digit hours a week at one point just to keep my mind at ease . theres nothing worse than sitting around by yourself , it ' s good to be out doing things . you ' ll find another girl , and you ' ll realize the error of your ways from the first relationship and you won ' t make those mistakes again
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

15. then tell her that . in a nice way . it could start as simply as ,  do you mind asking me before you plan to invite your mom to stay over ?  she may also benefit from getting a more substantial friend group in your new area .
   (ID: 5d0b750bf77c2c6e8b41ebf03caf4038a907b876)

16. compromise . you need to find a way for both of you to get a little of what you want . often time teenagers are completely oblivious to what they really need as support and same goes for parents not knowing where an appropriate line should be drawn usually out of fear or anxiety for their child  s well being you may see improvement if you take on more responsibility around the home or in the community  but that  s only a vague suggestion because i have no idea about your specific circumstances .
   (ID: 238316960c030f561912bd63e9f572a4170f991b)

17. we did acid with two other people , one of them had a fucked up bad trip and was eventually going to hurt himself or us he already tried to shoot us with a gun he hallucinated . before i called digit , the two other people including my former bff left . the other guy could have killed me and no one would know . it was then i realized that he didn ' t actually care about me and was toxic .
   (ID: e7d4349520d7fd2b6b8d8e41558874e7ce55f7c3)

18. when anyone says  good morning  i always respond  not bad , yourself ?
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

19. if i were to stay with her , i would try my best to give her attention back and be the best boyfriend i could be . that  s not how i could see myself as an asshole . the way i could , would be me losing my patience and leaving in two months .
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

20. i understand that it helps you feel better , and that staying away from it is stressful , and that there ' s so way for me or anyone from this community to make you stop , but even though i don ' t know you , i want you to be safe , i hope that you ' re able to pass that digit day mark of no sh one day , i believe in you .
