1. she ' ll drink water , no worries about that . allow the cat to be around you while you ' re doing stuff around the house  the curiosity will make her come closer . and not the least treats

6. i ' m a cat owner and have received many ' presents ' over the years . they are predators to be certain and i agree with you there . my point though is that the rats are unbothered by the cat and vice versa  neither of them views the other as competition for the food . i would guess that this is because people are always refilling the dishes .
   (ID: e387b7eddf8ab01e3dd767dc2f5ca52494fbe9b0)

7. only if its animal or child abuse , rest is just cringy .

8. this . my dog died a year ago . my parents had also surprised me with him . the first thing i remember is the sound of him shuffling out of the bedroom . all of digit months old and the size of a rat . he was a dalmatian and you could count the number of spots he had at the time . digit . i was a bullied child and an introvert . that dog changed my life . i would love to live that first day we met again .
   (ID: 25a3a19690cf520ebb090d792f9aab864cc59254)

   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

13. so at what point are you blaming the breed the pits that you have known have any of them attacked anyone what about the ones you know still make you feel like they can  t be trusted ?
   (ID: 89a759866debf6704efa0f603c1b9c4476abd731)

14. im a male and ladies if i am wrong please let me know . their dog will be there when you cheat , lie , and steal . their dog will love them on their darkest and brightest days . their dog will be by their side no matter what . a large number of the male population cant even accomplish one of those sentences that a dog can do without trying . does this make them  obsessed  ? nope . it merely shows their loyalty to those who are loyal to them .

15. i dont know if you are bucket by trying to gamejack by making an alt account and talking about your account or a normal petscopper , if you are a noraml petscopper then its a joke

   (ID: d3491a90d756046acac8c3053e9e99c3e6c231f9)

17. you arrogant prick . ive known this dog since i was digit and always kept her close . i made this post to have people talk and all you do is be an asshole . why do you think complete strangers not care about dogs ? have you not been in he street and see people talk to strangers about their dogs when they are walking them ? its human nature to be sympathetic and curious . you shouldn ' t have to be an asshole just because you don ' t care about something . just know you make a kid cry . thanks .
   (ID: ea5cdb41822e9eac6a4230514be598981cadabcb)

18. the reason the different categories exist is because some pets they don ' t have the time or interest in making the necessary animations for them to overrides , every pet that they don ' t make the animations for become followers instead . i do wish they ' d stop releasing new pets as followers because they ' re universally ignored if they can ' t be used for overrides , but hey they ' re a lot cheaper to produce and pad out the content so jagex likes them .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

19. yes the nose holes are still open , thank you so much ! i got a little worried haha , but i ' m still going to the vet just to be sure
   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

20. so my cat , franki , recently came down with a pretty severe stomach virus . the vet gave me some anti biotic drops to put in his food but when i  d do that franki wouldn  t touch it . so , the vet suggested using a small dropper tube to insert the medicine directly into his anus . the first time was absolute hell , my cat fought me the whole time but once the tube was in and the medicine pushed out he seemed to calm quite a bit . well the next day he was acting strange , he has always been an independent cat , rarely coming around , never wanting to be held , but as i sat on the couch he started walking back and forth meowing and rubbing my leg . he then went and jumped up on the table where we  d done the application the night before and meowed louder and louder until i decided i guess we will go ahead and do the medicine treatment . this time he didn  t fight me though , and when i inserted the tube he closed his eyes , stretched his neck , and let out a noise that can only be described as a moan of pure ecstasy . maybe the medicine made him feel better , i supposed . that night he slept on my bed curled up right next to me , which he had never done before . for the next week he  d do the same thing every day , meow on the table until he got his  fix  . but then the medicine ran out . even though i had no medicine he  d still cry and beg for it , i thought maybe if i insert it without medicine he will realize it doesn  t make him feel better anymore and forget about it . well that was digit weeks ago and he is only getting worse . he walks around me all day with his tail up presenting his rectum and trying to entice me . he is demanding insertions more and more often . yesterday i caught him looking longingly at the turkey baster . when i sit he jumps in my lap purring and rubbing me affectionately . it was then in horror i realized my cat thinks i  m his gay lover , and that i  ve been sexually pleasing him for weeks now . needless to say the sexual tension between us is palpable . how do i let my cat know that i  m not gay , but still like him as a friend ?
