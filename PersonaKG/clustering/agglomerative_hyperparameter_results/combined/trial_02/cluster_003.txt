1. the reason the different categories exist is because some pets they don ' t have the time or interest in making the necessary animations for them to overrides , every pet that they don ' t make the animations for become followers instead . i do wish they ' d stop releasing new pets as followers because they ' re universally ignored if they can ' t be used for overrides , but hey they ' re a lot cheaper to produce and pad out the content so jagex likes them .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

2. yeah but who actually does that ? save for 17years ? only rich guys . for average people , its almost impossible to save for years and not touch that money over those years . just take that guy as a person who smoke cigarettes for years . at least his chance with his money is become a millionaire and not cancer .
   (ID: a3bc874aed8bb8421b25930723a7210bcd9b2aec)

   (ID: 6735159236fd8a4634f1974d6eba7f027dbd1aa7)

7. i do this as well . if you ask your vet about catch and release services you can find places that will loan you traps and fix the cats for free . i ' ve been feeding  fixing feral  stray cats for years . i hate seeing animals that have been abandoned go hungry .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

12. One of my favorite things is dogs/animals.
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)

13. i wouldn  t call him racist . what happened is that when he was young i believe in ireland but don  t quote me on that his close friend told him that they were raped by a black guy . so being an irrational young teen who was brought up with violence , neeson went out looking for black men to kill . course he didn  t actually kill anyone but still . he also added that if someone of another race , say maybe east asian , he would  ve done the same thing . so i think people are taking it out of context saying that he just went out trying to kill black people . he even says that he knows it was wrong and he  s changed a lot over the past decades , is not racist , will not do that again , it  s just a part of his youth and thought it was an interesting story to tell .
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

17. i would think it  s the least of his worries . why invite more public commentary ?
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

18. it ' s funny that you have this ego centric idea that everyone that disagrees with you is a whiny snowflake baby , and you , the one that supports a reality tv star known for being a whiny baby , are somehow the superior man . i seem to remember a whole eight years of crying when obama was in office . the media did to him much worse than what ' s happening with trump . trump is literally just giving fuel for the fire . and honestly , i think of him as a distraction from actual governing . he acts out more when important things happening . i ' m crying not from dispair , but from laughter . you think he ' ll get a second term . now i ' m gonna sit back and wait for the ' beta cuck ' insults to start rolling in
