1. ooh good point . just because something or someone has left you , there is still the emotional trauma left behind . i have no idea what that trauma would amount to when it comes to an extra sliver of someone else ' s evil soul inside another .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

2. my best friend was homeless at the time we met during high school . he never complained about it or anything and was a great guy overall . when we used to hang out with our digit other best friends digit of us he wouldn  t ever have any cash but we never cared cause he wanted him to be with us when we wanted to go out . still friends digit years going .
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

3. oh , well yeah i can understand that i guess . how long did it take you to recover from it ?
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

4. that is awful ! that must have been so hard for you  so sorry you experienced such an awful thing .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

5. sorry if this is true , this is really sad . do you actually know what your mom died from ? your post makes it sound like it was just you and the body the whole time , like no one else ever saw your mom ' s body . we ' re police contacted ? or did you really just wake up , see her dead , and think the best thing was to just throw her in with the luggage ?
   (ID: 4c696d3f1d19d74a8b9e25c3dddb75deefc97a4b)

6. i didn ' t even know it was a crime at the time , it ' s kinda fucked up to say , but i thought things like that just happened . now i ' m older , and don ' t think about it much , probably because i ' m a guy , which is even more fucked up , i know .
   (ID: 199ca187d50b43aebb52968a5525289cb65a1520)

7. i came home with terrible back pain to a drunken girlfriend who started verbally assaulting me , and when i told her " it is over , please leave " , she sucker punched me . it took almost a half hour to get her to finally leave , with the threat of digit .
   (ID: 6b941223c20a9903b9878d0454cc676e8d7db91b)

8. dont take this the wrong way because im not trying to sound like a dick here . it was a dream man , dont read too much into it . granted some psychologists say you can discern alot about people from interpreting their dreams dont put too much faith into interpreting them . your grandfather obviously had some minomajor impact in your life . are you single ? going through a rough patch in a relationship ? or perhaps life is shitting on you pretty hard right now . so perhaps your brain created this dream to ease the hard times your going through . or maybe your girlfriend  wife  whatever is pregnant or expecting or whathaveyou so your sub  conscience is trying to tell you something . anyway whatever the case may be dont read too much into a relative who has been relegated to the past tense coming to visit you in your dreams

9. i believe it . i sometimes think about spirits as the human part of the deceased that didn  t want to leave . they want to stay , for some reason . and they aren  t necessarily hostile or scary , they just have unfinished business and are hanging out until they can complete it . it appears he may have cared about you so much that he wanted to meet you before he left .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

10. i just want to make sure you  re okay , op
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

11. none . i think it ' s ridiculous to cry over the death of someone you don ' t know .
   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

12. if i did what i want to do to the devils that took the child away , i  d be in more trouble than them
   (ID: 6f88a57b804dffb05f07ee78e02223947d9055aa)

13. im crying at this story fsr anyways , im very sorry for you and your brother
   (ID: 1b5b08f1246e450c7da09e40c81570fba378da84)

14. we all experience emotions differently and with different triggers . not surprised you didn ' t feel anything since you weren ' t close . its like when a stranger dies , we don ' t feel much if anything . btw i don ' t like the downvotes on your comment . you had a genuine experience , it shouldn ' t matter what you felt . you answered my question . thank you for sharing .
   (ID: 1b15fd08311192b471933a314f66dc758a923c02)

15. no , but you ' ll think you did when you get to middle age .

17. how can you even know who you are anymore !
   (ID: cd0b72d117bf74908c3edaaf3947b089a9dafc0c)

18. thank you . there ' s more to the story . it was truly heartbreaking for us . we mourned the death of our first child for a week . i can ' t even imagine how parents feel who lose their child . i experienced a week of it and it broke us both .
   (ID: ca13e283de9a99b9eb1cf4f68eed33eccff74e35)

19. it is pretty funny when i think about it now , but it was pretty hurtful at the time .
   (ID: 78a7be65b9d2e7cebf18280c07d4f44e6f2b3417)

20. it ' s ok man . can we talk about it ?
