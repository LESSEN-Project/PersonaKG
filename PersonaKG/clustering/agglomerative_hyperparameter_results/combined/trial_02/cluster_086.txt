6. oh ok i understand , but like for now at least i want a small start like let  s say digit designs you know ? but my biggest problem is that i can  t find a site that does what i want and i  m not sure who to ask if they know a good site , like i really want to do the shipping and other things by myself but it  s literally physically impossible for me to do so that  s why i need something like redbubble you know ? someone would order and they print and ship without me needing to bother with anything else other than designing .
