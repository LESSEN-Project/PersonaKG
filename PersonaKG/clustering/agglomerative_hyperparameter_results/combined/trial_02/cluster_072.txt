1. she acted like you took up sooo much of her time whining about your poor baby . no . this woman is a cold lizard . she gave you the minimum and you are victim blaming yourself ! sorry . she sounds peeved that you are so sunk in your grief that you  ve forgotten the planets revolve around her ! well screw her . you are grieving your baby . what was her name ? where is he buried ? and what did she look like ? these are all such basic questions , for god  s sake that she could have asked ! because they mean something , and like any parent , you want to share your memories of your beloved infant . and you deserve to .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

2. i had to read this question like digit times because i couldn ' t get it . i thought it is completelly opposite , at least in my country it is . i suppose , because i ' m just digit and don ' t know many single mothers . as far as i can learn from media , single mothers are respected . in poland they are portrayed as " strong , independent women " but in a good way . of course there are some people who would strongly put a single father over a single mother for some reason . probably a priest i know is one of them .   x200b  from my experience i can tell about one case where a man left his wife because their child was mentally disabled and now she has to earn for everything alone and deal with the kid ' s illness . who in the world would hate on her ? in addition , i kinda wish my parents had got divorced years ago because my dad had mainly negative impact on my life but the main problem is money that my mom doesn ' t earn very much . which maybe wouldn ' t be a problem if my dad hadn ' t spoiled everything after all .

3. aha ahh . stupid women . no good sir it is not inappropriate at all to say that we had a child because , " we " your partner and yourself did have a child .
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

4. hmm . my parents give me the same bs about not getting enough sleep too . i  d tell them about it and see if you could give them a solid argument as to why you  d like to have the ability to stay upsmiling  face  with  sunglasses
   (ID: 870d9d198f856764296262192823c935f1daf781)

5. it ' s still a bit of a lottery . your kid might still have a combination of the worst of your traits and your partner ' s traits . and there wouldn ' t be anything you could do about it . and you ' re unlikely to find out until much later .
   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

6. why put a child at this age through this ? where do you live that this is allowed ?
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

7. i made my flair for this subreddit " anti  natalist " , meaning i ' m  by definition and for the convenience  a child hater . i can ' t stand them . i ' m completely pro  government sterilization and am a supporter of voluntary human extinction movement . does this make me a bad person ? no . do i despise parents for breeding ? in many ways , but teen moms are usually the only ones to receive that hatred . will i ever abuse a child ? absolutely not . in short , the only difference between me  an anti  natalist  and the more " child tolerant " of our group is that  they ' re child tolerant .
   (ID: 9d1e879011bb23fa9a0cff4c99a536feb2705b86)

8. parents should never love their child or anyone else ' s any less , simply because that child is gay . it saddens me to think of your struggle . i come from a conservative family , and was raised very much anti  gay , but you know what ? when i grew up , and learned to think on my own , i realized that the bigots are the true evil in this world . i told each of my children that if i ever found out they were gay , that i would be digit  cool with it . as a parent myself , let me tell you that you need nobody ' s approval to be who you are .

9. for some the shittiness is worth it to have a kid at the end of it . plus , brains tend to protect us by diminishing the memory of how shit the process was . there  s also some women who have  unicorn  pregnancies and feel mostly fine the whole time . maybe the woman got pregnant by accident but can  t or won  t abort . the existence of babies doesn  t disprove the fact that pregnancy can suck worse than you think it does . you think i  m arguing because of my  hurt feelings  ? lmao . i  m arguing because i disagree with your views on something you  ve never gone through . imagine if i told you  broken bones don  t suck as much as you make it out to be , stop complaining  but i  d never broken a bone whereas you had . you  d think i was full of shit . where did i say pregnancy is the ultimate suffering ? honestly at this point i think you  re just being stubborn and contrary for the sake of it

10. answered just the way it was asked . mom ' s been on different kinds of shit for awhile . last i heard she picked up a meth habit since my brother is out of the house now . i ' ve been no contact with the family .
   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

11. this is awesome . and point  digit is so spot on . i work at the airport not a pilot or anything like that , but i ' ve heard a lot of stories from co  workers or from people who do work on the airplanes . i ' ve seen a lot of families fly and i ' ve seen all the pissed off business travelers . when i first flew with my son , i got one seat to save money since he could still ride on my lap . i decided to bring a bag of chocolates for the people sitting near me in case my son cried and ruined the flight for everyone within ear  distance . the flight attendants saw me settling in and after everyone boarded the plane , they asked me to move to another seat . i was already worried about flying with my digit month old , and this made me nervous . but . they ended up opening an entire row for me and my son . we had three seats to ourselves instead of one next to other people . that made my day ! and i ' m sure other passengers appreciated it as well like the guy who was sitting next to me originally , lol . it ' s kinda simple  you can be an asshole about things and get your way sometimes because people don ' t want to deal with you anymore . or you can be nice and respectful and that goes so much further .

12. yeah maybe with mammals and stuff but i don  t think snakes really understand the concept of help . from what i know they  re left on their own from the time they hatch and don  t receive any kind of assistance from mom . it  s possible but i doubt it
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

13. i think most people miss the problem with her name . the problem is stupid parents naming kids stupid names . that is the real problem .
   (ID: 34d7a41f0778ab80ac97d43bcbe30cde5ab458d8)

14. what can you do when you have kids like that , just throw them away and start over again ?
   (ID: a80b8bc356414690d849369456d68876c95d5518)

15. a  draw some still life b  download mediocre normie art and pray they don ' t ask you to show how you draw . i ' ve done a combination of both when i was living with my parents , worked well enough .
   (ID: 96167969642339382f3b9c4eeee4ea73aec3823c)

16. i guess i  ve always thought too much of my future child as a baby . i just see molly may and think ,  wow , what a cute baby name .  i suppose i never really think about her as an adult . it doesn  t fit me . it probably wouldn  t fit her either . thank you .
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

17. that is quite a bit of difference my guy . do you have a sister ? would you be comfortable with her dating someone nearly a decade older ?
   (ID: a9b07d3f94647dffebe730771c20ee3ca1af7ec4)

18. idk kids need a healthy balance . they need to understand boundaries but i completely agree that kids are allowed to be in public just as adults . good luck getting your child to give a shit about a digit . digit hour movie though lol
   (ID: b40d1d3ae1e77bcbdcb98e62deea24396d4b4d40)

19. people aren  t against you  they  re for themselves . let  s say you  re a local politician  city council maybe . ok . so your pay is shit . this is a part  time position with few benefits . you  re in your 40s and you  ve got two kids to put through college . you  ve got your normal job paying you ok , but not enough to take on thousands in tuition . there  s a vote coming up to decide if you should create a local landfill for a nearby city  s trash . it  ll make the town some money but also won  t be great for the local environment . it  ll smell bad in that area . some people won  t like it . a guy who has the land to sell for the landfill says he  ll give you  digit , digit if you vote yes . a guy who has trash trucks who will haul the trash for the coming years will give you  digit , digit to vote yes . you don  t have friends or family who will be affected and your kids have a jumpstart on paying for school . plus , the city gets some money . a few more people get employed . big reward for you , small downside for some . that  s how this stuff starts . innocent enough . i think the problem then comes from the slippery slope if i did it for tuition , it  s not that much worse to do it for the vacation house ! and the possible blackmail . the next vote comes around and maybe you  re opposed to expanding the landfill but now you  ve got folks who paid you and can tell newspapers other outlets that you got paid . your political career is now done .

20. i think what he  s saying is misinterpreted . the horde has always been a family with honor bringing them together . it  s their appreciation for honor and spirit which guides them in accepting each other and bringing them closer . they  ve each faced oppression and fought to restore it . it  s the economy and empathy that brought goblins into the pool as well . i think what he  s getting at though , is  because we see sylvanas becoming more and more unpredictable  volatile burning down teldrasil  killing innocentshonorless targets there is turmoil in the horde . everyone is essentially watching her delve into madness and thinking  whoa hey that  s not cool  . literally this entire expansion has been saurfang and baine trying to stop sylvanas from her actions . they don  t mess with her entirely though because the honor that comes with vol  jin  s decision in appointing her as warchief . it  s kinda reminiscent to seeing a family member go way overboard and the rest of the family being put in a difficult decision . do we make the effort to bring this individual back to earth or do we separate ourselves ?
