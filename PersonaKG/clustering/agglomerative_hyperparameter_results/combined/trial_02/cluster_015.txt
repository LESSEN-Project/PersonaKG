Total from this dataset: 2215

1. i never meant should have joined salem ' s side . saying " wrong side " was a poor choice of words on my part . i merely meant that cinder had to finish that fight , and had to succeed . it is a tragedy that the towns people were made into obstacles on this missing . it really is . but that isn ' t cinder ' s fault anymore then it is the townspeople ' s fault .  but , logically speaking , if given the options , which side do you think most people will choose ? safety . most people i think would be willing to give up almost anything in the name of safety . nothing wrong with that in fact . that doesn ' t mean those who aspire for something greater are evil just because they value some things above safety though .
   (ID: a22b82fe301caa42c89cbd71b2e3733753f695d9)

2. yeah i checked his post history . kinda a attention whore but sometimes attention attracts people who will help . i had the same thing happen , depression is not fun . but i eventually got help and here i am . i can see your point but sometimes getting people upset just adds fuel to the fire .
   (ID: ea5cdb41822e9eac6a4230514be598981cadabcb)

3. sure it would be creepy if the guys were random strangers . but op hasn ' t specified that . it could just be people she knows . in view that , i think it ' s alright . quick to jump to conclusions aren ' t we !
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

4. if that was my sister i would do the good old " listen here you little shit . " talk . i broke many people ' s bubbles this way . i would tell her off , break everything into her face about how embarassing she actually is . you do everything she says and ignore her tantrums , try to not accidentally push her buttons etc and expect change . it ' s not happening and you ' re giving her more control over you . iron fist for people like your sister !
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

5. i think a lot of people who are at that point don ' t think anybody cares to listen to them , and they have thought that for so long , that it is very hard to reach out to anybody
   (ID: 4d69affb6415148eda5d5103b282ce15476169d5)

6. unless your arm is as long as your leg or you can dislocate your should on command i don ' t think the thing you ' re attempting to do is possible . if you ' re feeling a barrier , you might still have some hymen left , but really , your vagina stretches . it can likely accommodate anything a dude has to offer . listen , there ' s no right way to finger yourself . the whole point is just to feel good and it sounds like you ' re freaking yourself out . either get a toy or wait until you have a person you trust enough to talk about this with and let them put their fingers up in you .
   (ID: 54097549786e78808b0d9772bb36b401b5761588)

7. yes because i am that and i am used to that more . if i knew them the exact same then i would pick the white person because we have more in common at first glance
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

8. I am constantly.
   (ID: 1955f382f8fc2d10480017d73817b8c3b41c2a02)

9. i do have a question , what are you doing to get the digit or so million you spent on gear ? you should be pretty decent to be able to pull that over the last let ' s say month or so . change your environment maybe a a shoreline run with a pistol and take it slow , slow play it and let them come to you .
   (ID: a3982a84363698446960e86a440ed3314f4325a3)

10. you should do the thing you want to do . otherwise you ' ll just give the wrong impression and just have dead end conversations with people you don ' t care about and waste all your free time for the rest of your life .
   (ID: aac8075b69856b11cb4307ac267b902010d66e3a)

11. eating ass . super hot when a guy ' s been basically pressure washed clean . super gross irl .
   (ID: 280643182527d573e119c7952a08fea10d62edd8)

12. for those wondering  this was apparently some crazy lady who kept demanding the people in the car to get out . she said she was a cop or some kind of authority , but had nothing to back it up with . she continued to chase after them for a while and then i think the people who originally posted this either called the cops or they shook her .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

13. also , most people get the poops hard core at the start of labor , so you don  t have any poop to go .  with all my births , they give me an enema at the hospital . they don ' t do taht anymore ?
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

14. i always , well almost always , fight for position . if you can out manuevar your opponent . control center , unblocked bishops , smart trades . stuff like that
   (ID: cca2db8a0bcb7aff323abdba1f381d7388c9f713)

15. and even after pulling this shit girls dont get classified as lesbian whereas if a guy were to do this , then he ' s considered gay . mind fucked
   (ID: 84fcf7fe73da3fe1849c81f9adb5f3cc411427d2)

16. one where you ' re actually attractive to other people . which in my case , is never .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

17. upvotes dont validate my existence so do downvotes dont eliminate my opinion just to tell you once again , the person you call indogs has way way more stars than you i believe , you ' ll never even get to digit stars yet you call the person dog ? do u even know why he changed his flag to singapore ? so pathetic , throwing shits with no valid reason
   (ID: e4e6a770eda3d8a5505365978baee4568affe531)

18. that ' s probably not google . from what i understand google will start in salt lake city proper first , then west valley . i haven ' t seen anything that says there are plans to go anywhere else yet . my whole neighborhood is having fiber laid right now . i asked a worker and he said it was utopia . i wish it was google , but i ' ll take utopia !
   (ID: 22a043d8284bd8c7c31748b5cc8c8b8efc757df6)

19. simple logic of my sense of morality . it is always wrong to take innocent human life . anyone who is not a monster agrees with that statement alone . pro  abortion people will then complicate that simple moral logic , usually by pointing out the evils that may be prevented by terminating the life of the child . but those evils are never greater than the taking of innocent human life .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

20. my favorite was rise of the triad . i don ' t really have a solid reason , but i also played wolfenstein 3d and doom  doom digit .
