   (ID: 2ab410cb3dc233b072c65fa9acc3c6323d05914e)

   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

5. i would love to use my most out  there as middles , because they might be too much as firsts , and it would get annoying dealing with questions or having to explain it , but i really do like weird names .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

6. i think digit middle names is fine  i draw the line at digit . i think your partner ' s concerns about hurting feelings would be a bigger reason to reconsider . personally , namesakes are not my thing , but i get that they hold a lot of significance for other people . i would be cautious about using a living relative as a namesake if other people could get offended .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

8. i ' ve always find that if you maintain eye contact and say their name during the conversation reaffirms to them that you respect and appreciate them . also , sometimes it ' s nice to just give them a hug once in a while and maybe throw in a hand job to make them feel relaxed . little things .
   (ID: 39ba9a65a55c27b50eef7c5cecbc66cc866c4a4c)

10. pretty sure my mother feels the same way about my brothers kid , but when it ' s just a fun visit ma is downright giddy . if you do have grandkids i hope you enjoy it just as much as my mom does .
   (ID: 72155748e939f50a6f3bde77aee5ae7b7c499725)

11. if you can come up with a name you both like , it would be nice if you changed it together so you have that connection even though , like you say , a name doesn ' t equal family , but it ' s a nice thing to have in common . if you ' re serious about changing your first name too , have a look at lists there are plenty online or ask around i ' m sure people here would be happy to give you suggestions . pretty soon you ' ll work out which styles and sounds you like and dislike . i ' d also recommend having a look at the top 100ish names for the year you were born and maybe a few other years from around that time as a starting point , that way you ' ll know if you want something in  keeping with your generation or something a bit more unusual .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

12. most of the time is parental pressure or self pressure to be with what is perceived as the ' best ' group . somehow our monkey brains haven ' t worked out that what we enjoy and what is the best for us is the same thing safety aside , i mean where you feel like you belong

   (ID: ec299e39e931c010d0d98b62058c9ccb814797dd)

15. i ' ll admit , some days are really rough and the world can make it difficult to want to keep moving forward . but when times get really rough , i find a nice quiet place to be alone and think about how , some where out there , some dumbass is getting hit by a car . brings a smile to my face everytime .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

19. yeah , i suppose may as a middle name is nice . thinking about it more , i wouldn  t wish the whole cutesy name thing on my child either . i hated it growing up , and even now . thank you for the response
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

20. i would like to say loyalty but in all honesty it ' s probably just as simple as my capacity to relate to them overall . maybe you could call that open mindedness .
