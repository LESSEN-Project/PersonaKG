13. and then cry rape the next day . you said that . not me . women do go to bars , drink , meet men and have sex . i doubt their intention is to accuse someone of rape after such an event , but it does happen . if you say it doesn ' t then you ' re not being honest .  edit  you also said  i have never heard of a woman needing to get drunk to have sex with someone . again , i dont think this is an honest statement either . i would almost be willing to bet you that more than half first time sex between couples involve some alcohol . its going to be hard for me to find anything statistically on that because every time i try to google it all that comes up are alcohol related rapes .

   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

19. can i let you in on a little secret ? and it ' s going to make a lot of people who make their living killing them angry , but you could kill a werewolf with a little lead . 22lr bullet or even a particularly sharp stick if you knew what you where about . see here is the thing yeah silver will give them a nasty bout of the anaphylactic shock and otherwise they heal pretty quick , and going back human fixes most of what ever other problems are left , but they are still flesh and blood . now don ' t get me wrong they have the durability of a pcp addict on meth , but still flesh and blood . if you let enough blood out or put a whole in something they can ' t live long enough to heal they will die . so if you can put a bullet through the base of the brain , the aorta , or believe it or not even the old top of the double boiler they will go down and stay down . however , here is the problem . most people struggle to make that shot on bambi , when they are in no danger , the deer is completely unaware , and the shot is short and static . this is why you got jackalopes out there thinking you need a digit win mag or an anti material rifle to tip over a little ol ' deer . now imagine instead of bambie you are trying to make a precision shot while also being charged by an digit foot tall slavering monster . that does not make your shooting better , but as any one who ' s ever spent any time around a hunting camp knows a hunter never misses a shot was always their lousy gear . thus the myth you " need " silver bullets . that being said please use silver bullets . its safer for you cleaner for them . every one comes out better .
