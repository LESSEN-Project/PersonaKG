   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

7. i don ' t mind you asking in the slightest  but i ' m afraid i don ' t have much in the way of a logical reasoning for that particular like  kink  etc .   x200b  most of it probably stems from my own ideas of what driders would be like . i view them as powerful or cunning predators , so there ' s probably quite a bit of power play involved , if i had to make some kind of guess . sure you could get the same kind of power play with a human , but it can be enhanced wildly by a drider and whatever their abilities might entail .   x200b  i also like to think that weaving something out of silk and giving it as a gift would be something deeply personal and intimate for a drider . that doesn ' t really turn me on , mind you , but i find the idea incredibly romantic and something you can ' t really replicate with humans in the same manner .

11. your post reminded me of one where a woman responded to someone saying that she really liked the idea of getting a sword , but didn ' t know what she ' d do with it . the responder said that whenever she got dressed up nice to go out , or had a job interview or whatever , she ' d take down the sword and just slowly walk round the house with it , and it gave her a sense of calm and power . you could rock the cape in the same way . sorry i can ' t find the link .
