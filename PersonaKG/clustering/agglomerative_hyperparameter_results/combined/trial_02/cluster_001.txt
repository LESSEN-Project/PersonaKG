1. drug use for sure
   (ID: 6b2e7201275c9aa1dcb6d1b24840765a41796c3d)

2. your knowledge or lack of knowledge is irrelevant to the question of you being an atheist . if you don ' t hold a belief in a god then you are an atheist by default . it ' s like having a car . either you have a car or you don ' t . the fact that you haven ' t decided if you want a car is irrelevant to the question of whether or not you have a car at this moment . it doesn ' t matter if you can ' t decide to get a car or not . if somebody asks you " do you have a car now ? " you dont answer " i haven ' t made up my mind " . you say yes or no . if you don ' t have a car then you just say . no because you are a non  car owner . ndgt doesn ' t have a belief in god therefore he is a non  theist , otherwise known as an atheist .
   (ID: d02dbb1cf70aa95df2b9f1bbd0a0c5bf0a966933)

   (ID: afdf67bb8f008481f179013844deeffa5b1b9a03)

20. i haven ' t heard of that book . i wonder if even if they read it if they would realize what they ' re in for . they are such amazing , hard  working people that are in it so deep that to admit defeat . well . i just don ' t think they could do it . wouldn ' t it be so embarrassing to say you tried and gulp failed . it really really makes me so sad for them . and i agree , it sounds like a book that could be quite dry , but i bet it would actually be quite interesting if you know someone personally involved . i would probably cry for them .
