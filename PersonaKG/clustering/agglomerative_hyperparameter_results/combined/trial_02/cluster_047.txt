1. not necessarily , i  ve noticed that as long as there  s communication the manager is willing to work with you . however , since we have so many people on our team holidays is usually the  you have to work your scheduled shift  type of schedule .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

2. i know ! it would have been so much better to have stuck with the hendrix . i can only imagine they changed it because they couldn ' t find anyone to make it work .
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

   (ID: 7911b1d92de80b0e1abd4e2a29e4f762a8a2908f)

5. that ' s fair , one year is a pretty common tipping point in a relationship in my experience anyway . if you feel you have truely put in the effort to address this and seen no improvement , than i think you know what to do . let him know you ' re unhappy and that you want to be with him , but his lack of attention is hurting you . if he still does not put forth the effort than it ' s time to move on .
   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

6. honestly man , those long hard days at work are what got me through a lot . especially when you have to think about alot of things at work , it keeps your mind busy . i worked digit  digit hours a week at one point just to keep my mind at ease . theres nothing worse than sitting around by yourself , it ' s good to be out doing things . you ' ll find another girl , and you ' ll realize the error of your ways from the first relationship and you won ' t make those mistakes again
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

7. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

8. dodo . i want to know what all the fuss was about . i suspect that garlic would work . it makes most things taste good .
   (ID: aa4c399e0083dd1bf730546e6c4fbd9b75104d67)

9. by god its a little baby . what country sends babies to school ? i ' m not judging per say , if that ' s what your country does that ' s fine . it just seems odd from where i ' m sitting . then again my kids came to work with me from the age of digit to digit when they started school . you probably think that is weird .
   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

10. a question for the downvoters  why ? is it hard to give actual feedback on what makes you dislike my work ? edit  reddit appears to be fucking around . if someone ends up downvoting me anyway , why ?
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

11. server for digit years here , this is what i tell everyone i  ve ever trained at my job . also i know this is a day late , but advice is helpful i  d think  never be afraid to ask for help , little things can really help get you out of the weeds . even a refill or someones extra dressing is one less trip .  figure out the best way to maneuver around your section i call these laps this will come with time and being comfortable with your restaurant and each section you could be in , so take your time with this one .  make the most of every lap around your section , and understand what each table needs .  always check on your kitchen staff and see if they need water , plates , or anything from the fridge that doesn  t require extra prep or knowledge from you like sauce or sliced veggies  be yourself at tables . even if where you work has a strict script most chains and commercial places will that you have to stick to , be yourself . tables like confidence and personality .  don  t lie about mistakes , but don  t place blame if you have to mention it to customers .  there was a miscommunication but we  re getting your calamari out right now .  sounds more professional and comforting than  the kitchen lost your ticket and they are redoing it .   milk your tables that you  re new , some will give you better tips , some will forgive the smaller mistakes and slips , most will congratulate you on being solo .  find comfy shoes and get some insoles . most importantly  although you  re here for advice and genuinely seem excited about this job , so i don  t doubt this will be an issue  have pride in every facet of your job . from side work to bottle service to talking about the food to how you present yourself at your restaurant . and welcome to the server family . we  re a bunch of bastards cause we have to be nice to everyone else all damn day haha .

12. is usa really that fucked up ? where i live , you must be paid for time you work regardless of whether the hours are billable or not , or anything else .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

13. i mean , i guess if you ' re able to you might as well . i don ' t really get how that would work though
   (ID: dc000fb877b86a0bbd3d65fe6040b512b4f5b042)

14. solid advice . i encourage my wife to go out after work too but if she ' s home with the kids and i want to go out i ' m selfish for not wanting to spend time as a family .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

15. a laborer in construction . without experience you may have to find a smaller company willing to take you on but if you make it , you have plenty of room to work your way up the latter . moving to a better company in a few years or a better position in the company etc . whatever you end up doing , good luck man
   (ID: 80d504f68f5028edc4d8e5926e3a2a93b0c84d8f)

16. severe social and generalized anxiety  depression . makes life hard but oh well . all you can do is push forward and make it work . i chose a profession journalism that challenges my fears and i  m so glad i did . you can  t let a mental illness define you and what you  re capable of !
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

17. and back to your original premise , i believe that governments are not the answer . i see large central governments are the forces that hinder growth and human potential . i look at the current western governments and all the rules and regulations , paperwork bureaucracy covered in red tape and piles of waste  and , more importantly , the cousins and cronies who suck off the tit of the people ' s hard work . i think governments should be limited in their tasks and duties . i view the constitution as a contract to the citizens that clearly spells out the limits of governmental reach . the larger question , though , is why communism ? why do you believe that an overwhelming state structure is the way to go ? what appeals to you that you think it is the best system , especially with so many failures throughout history ?
   (ID: 30506e41c4121e1e7573a25d4985de191de679c9)

18. all i know really is that if it doesn  t get better somehow , you should definitely think about moving jobs as shit and unfair as that is because my god happiness and good mental health is so so important !
   (ID: 91fce15f80cee843edc2c92559e78e027c94f5d0)

19. placebos have been known to work but brain chemistry is not something you want to screw with .
   (ID: 3e510494aac4d4cfd98d8ee4e7b04dffd5534bee)

20. no , not just free stuff . you want to force the wealthy to work for free for you .
