1. well i was in the red light district once .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

2. i lived there as a kid  looking at this meadow , i ' m like , " i think i ' ve actually been there ! "  then i get sad because i never appreciated being there as a kid  now that i ' m grown , i can ' t just pick up  move back .
   (ID: 649605988d72e34fdcf0c170b6b9fa959a7d483e)

3. yeah , me and mine are already starting to think about migrating out . none of us have or want kids , but we ' re looking for places where we can get a dog , have a garage that we can use as shops to make things . so it ' s looking like tacoma might be a good investment for us .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

4. it ' s my first time visiting and i loved it !

5. the regional pokemon are supposed to be something special you get for traveling . i ' d always assumed that , once trading came out , it would become something that players who didn ' t have the means  opportunity to travel could get by engaging with other community members . this was kinda the expectation i had , and i knew a lot of other people that shared it . having it come out as a special event was kinda cool , but it changed farfetch ' d from this cool , insanely rare thing to another event pokemon . farfetch ' d went from being more rare than a legendary to essentially another pikachu in a hat .
   (ID: fc70415de2435c629ec792dbd90c954786c0bd16)

6. i found a good price on alaska  singapore airlines , which wins " best airline " every year . route is jfk to lax to nrt so it ' s not direct . jal or ana direct would definitely be the best , but they will all have hot towels and good cabin crew .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

7. oh hell yes . just the problem was that i was bad at swimming so i didn ' t really think about participating there not that i had a possibility tho
   (ID: 8487a8406f04273c554e2e578c3a667648916790)

8. you ' re not wrong . the hike to get there isn ' t all that easy though takes just under digit hours and covers about 600m in altitude . it was pretty dangerous at times due to the rain , yet you see people walking up there in flipflops . are they the real  life equivalent of someone driving around in winter without snow tyres on their car and putting themselves and others in danger ?
   (ID: 5fe12b36dc6d3370836c6683997c005efb656c99)

9. it just is daunting to me to have such a large population for a city , and i would hate to move into the " bad parts " unknowingly . it would be like someone moving to townsville and accidentally going to live in vincent . they . would . die .
   (ID: 7a3a98777bf2cebb6bd14409075a19b82035e535)

10. so not inthesoulstone ?
   (ID: 01d4ddab8cb9e73e5e85941c592482da1b3c6bcd)

11. went to north korea because i was an idiot . while i did survive the trip , i would not recommend anyone to visit a place where secret police agents follows you everywhere .
   (ID: 943cc5e526975c71d69ca1804666ab2f83b06a27)

13. it ' s because no one who lives from delhi is actually from delhi . most other teams are centered around states whereas delhi isn ' t classified as a state and it ' s tiny compared to other states . new management have gathered loads of new fans . mostly college students but good nonetheless
   (ID: 44477e54e9e15675b9ad5c3be02b0440724c674b)

14. great trip report and your photos are amazing . those donuts are too cute . how were the flights ? we  re on sq12 and sq11 for our upcoming trip and i  m really excited about flying alaska and singapore airlines .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

15. crime is all over in my opinion but i live in a relatively safe area so i don ' t have much security other than locking my front door at night , but in major cities you do feel the need to go above and beyond keeping yourself safe .
   (ID: 597db748e9e223db2b7d3a7e2d79893e3cc7cd0a)

16. i think it ' s gotten worse recently . police will always harass you until you give them money . lots of shady businesses that are obviously run by cartels and shit . also depends on where you go . i sure as hell will never step foot in juarez . but long as you don ' t do anything stupid then you ' ll be ok .
   (ID: a90f01f580b7cc08038958d5c1f659fd492b1f2c)

17. as someone who has lived in utah my whole life , i can attest that there are some stunning vistas within a short drive of salt lake city . if you spend any amount of time here , you can venture a little further out , and see things like the mirror lake highway , the nebo loop , the alpine loop , and boulder mountain . i can ' t even compile list all the places i ' ve seen in my digit  years here .
   (ID: a4cf7bd5112d789bb0b45477a071f936cf9b4ba7)

18. i love bars ands skiing . i worked at and managed a fairly successful bar for seven years and have also lived in colorado . let me rant  coat hooks . everywhere , but especially under the bar top . the bar must have a bar for your feet . while being in touch with the local brewery is rad , if you are not trying to alienate anyone have one canned macrobrew option . i love beer but after a few craft brews i just want an ice cold bud . it ' s ok to have a small menu but make sure you do what you do well . make sure the menu does not alienates non  drinkers . which is to say if its boring , generic , or if there are good vegetarian options . what ' s the outside space look like ? could you park a food truck tacos ! outside to better maximize indoor space . on space  maybe run a standing level bar around the perimeter for people to congregate and have a place to rest drinks . jukebox . not all the time but if people want to guide the energy of the environment , let them feel comfortable . mountain bars mandate a good bloody mary as well as a good margarita . don ' t fuck those up . do not make it " no ski boots " on bathrooms  i always like the urinals that go all the way to the floor because i get to pee on the floor . however when i am layered up from the cold , doing the business in a union suit gets weird and my aim isn ' t the same . these are just some of my initial thoughts . i have a wealth of ideas and even more opinions . i have dined out for almost every meal for the last decade . i enjoy dining and drinking more than anything  it is my favorite hobby . i love both the dives and the fine dining . be one thing and do it well versus trying to juggle things and not really have an image or vibe or feeling or whatever the fuck you wanna call it when people think of your joint and are like yeah that ' s the spot . good luck i want to open my own place someday .
   (ID: 109fa004cbb85f6a703624f8b4393d7d7d685509)

19. so i moronically got the season pass , one of the upcoming bonus missions has something to do with a manson family style so that ' s what i reckon that creepy basement is about . it ' s a shame .
