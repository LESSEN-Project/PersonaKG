1. when showing friends who are new to csgo or counterstrike in general i always go to community or casual classic servers just to get the " counterstrike " feeling and learn the maps . if you have no idea about what you have to do in the game it ' s no real use to head for competitive . ive met so many people in matchmaking who didnt even know that you have to plant or even defuse the bomb . knowing how to " eco " or what to buy is something you will learn on your own later on . to learn how the game even works would be my first priority . a lot of my friends are coming from games like cod and are new to the fact you have to buy your weapons and they still dont understand why you cannot buy your weapons you want every round .
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

2. everything you just listed off can be said about alot of other places outside of the united states included i guess they ' re influential pop culture wise , but not much else
   (ID: 95f6209d0c49920f0309625c4cec2ea88e4ae469)

   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

5. yes , it was incredible . particularly given that the ferrari f310 was an absolute dog even in optimum conditions . schuey had irritated the hell out of me for the previous couple of seasons my flair will probably tell you why but nobody could deny his genius after that digit season .
   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

   (ID: 14bd1366b004b74cfd8c9cb269849740d12cff80)

8. thank you so much for answering my questions ! i have some follow up questions . regarding the shower situation , in the navy , are you allowed to wake up earlier than your peers to shower or does everyone have to shower at the same time ? like , can you wake up earlier , quickly shower and get dressed ? so while most are asleep , i ' ll avoid having many people surrounding me ? open showers aside in boot camp , will i go through any other situations where i ' d be openly nude among my peers ? or is everything regarding medical  etc . you will have privacy ? i don ' t mind being " known " if it ' s one or two other professional doctors  etc . but i ' m worried about that when it comes to other cadets .   x200b  when you say steady supply of t , do you mean at home or physically with me ? thank you again ! i truly appreciate it !

   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

10. please note  i am sorry if i sound ridiculous or well off the mark . i ' m from nrth qld , and have no real sense of what the city of adelaide is like . i am happy to not live near the heart of the city , so long as my labouring  standard job type partner can work close enough to the home , there is a nice school in the area , and there would be a doctor or hospital close enough if one of us or my kids needed emergency care . also being from the north , our threat is cyclones so i would be clueless and terrified in a fire . so i would not be the best to live in the middle of a fire threat zone etc . thanks for being patient and i do google earth the area a lot . i like the look of the suburbs in the area i circled but i ' m not sure if they are actually suburbs or if they are small communities considered " way out .

   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

14. i ran around like a crazy person on my honeymoon in new zealand and have no regrets about trying to see digit different places in digit days , but we had a campervan .   x200b  consider how frequently you can handle  want to pack and unpack and carry your luggage to a new location via public transit . using luggage shipping carriers is useful but they don ' t transport it for you in the same real time you ' ll need your stuff . what are your top priorities for this trip ? do you like crowds or nature or a mix ? will it be obon stuff is expensive , closed , and japanese people are all on vacation ?
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

15. i don ' t even know what to say , like do you drink wine and read books all day explain please cause being in france on holiday and try to get someone to speak english is impossible just because they refuse it ? i myself prefer the very down to earth , high all day on herbs  tea mess around with chemicals dutch lifestyle .

17. i found a good price on alaska  singapore airlines , which wins " best airline " every year . route is jfk to lax to nrt so it ' s not direct . jal or ana direct would definitely be the best , but they will all have hot towels and good cabin crew .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

18. where the hell are you finding this for  digit a bottle ? i ' m in tn , so just south of where it ' s made , and it ' s like  digit here .
   (ID: ecc98de1e575d7e863a2124b364b8ed586778ba5)

19. this is stupid . how can we call for a better america then specifically arrange breaking the laws we set in place . i guarantee you there  s nothing left at area digit , we all know about it , it  s a tourist zone . we should probably be worried about area digit or digit , that  s probably where they moved anything . lol
   (ID: ef2135d90df57b27df5e96791848d8d9201afd29)

20. depends what you mean by culture . i ' ve lived in several i would say and i ' m currently living in an east asian culture . i wouldn ' t really say i respect cultures as a whole rather than certain aspects of them .
