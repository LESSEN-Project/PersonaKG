   (ID: ee2906681b3174a80cefe2bcfb40bd3a110c1b29)

3. twas a joke my man seriously speaking , that ' s just the way the world is right now . i ' d say every human being that is breathing right know is depressed , but on different levels and degrees . teenagers are a fucking mess . it ' s not weird for thing like these to happen
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

4. oh my god if his fetish has this much of a hold on his love life you don  t need to be with this person . have you told him everything you mentioned here ? about how uncomfortable and skin crawling hes being ? it  s cruel of him to expect you to change your body for his fetishy desires .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

5. yta you don  t have to be a dick about things and from what i  ve seen in this thread i feel sorry for the girl i would if said nta but from how far up your arse you  ve been on this thread i doubt her work was that poor quality
   (ID: 77ab4860c32a7084ca81fd91302df6690ce56731)

6. glad to hear that , it ' s a shame they fell out of fashion . nothing fancy really . just normal bras and panties , but i have to wear stockings to keep the corset anchored so it wouldn ' t start riding up . yep , i ' d love to get a custom made one . they ' re pretty darn expensive though , at least about digit and i ' d have to get them sent from the us as that ' s where all the good corset makers are . most of them have noticed by now , and the feedback has generally been very positive . they think i ' m mad for attempting something like this especially on a daily basis when most people can barely stand regular shapewear for a few hours but the benefits are very obvious .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

7. for some the shittiness is worth it to have a kid at the end of it . plus , brains tend to protect us by diminishing the memory of how shit the process was . there  s also some women who have  unicorn  pregnancies and feel mostly fine the whole time . maybe the woman got pregnant by accident but can  t or won  t abort . the existence of babies doesn  t disprove the fact that pregnancy can suck worse than you think it does . you think i  m arguing because of my  hurt feelings  ? lmao . i  m arguing because i disagree with your views on something you  ve never gone through . imagine if i told you  broken bones don  t suck as much as you make it out to be , stop complaining  but i  d never broken a bone whereas you had . you  d think i was full of shit . where did i say pregnancy is the ultimate suffering ? honestly at this point i think you  re just being stubborn and contrary for the sake of it
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

8. as fucked up as a situation that is the only person suffering right now is you because of that hatred . find something to take your frustration out of course within the realms of the law . then let go of that anger and forget them . enjoy your life . it is far too short for hate . that  s just me though .
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

9. talking it is not the same thing as complaining . discussion is not the same as whining . when you complain you want sympathy or agreement that you ' ve been hard done by . you should look at the past to avoid making the same mistakes , you should not look at the past and feel bad about the present . rather you should look to the present and see the mistakes still being made that need to be fixed and put your focus there . you can say it shaped their lives it did . but they still wouldn ' t exist otherwise . a shitty life is better than no life .
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

10. so he is name  calling and spreading gossip ? that tells you a lot about the person he is . it doesn ' t say anything about you . just be honest about what happened .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

11. what the fuck ? why ? mils be crazy holy shit . if you dont want to invite her , dont . you are able to choose the guests , so make it a happy place , cuz you know mil is going to make planning a nightmare
   (ID: ee2906681b3174a80cefe2bcfb40bd3a110c1b29)

12. i absolutely hate the threads that are deep  seated in woman hating . yet these people cry and moan about not having friends or a life outside of reddit . gee , i wonder why ? maybe if half the people on reddit stopped whining , stopped giving into the hivemind and show girls some respect . maybe , juuuuust maybe , she will like you . also , reddit is not a reliable source of dating advice ! when a single woman goes on a date with you , all your karma points don ' t mean shit . show her you ' re not an asshat and she ' ll like you .
   (ID: 9d1e879011bb23fa9a0cff4c99a536feb2705b86)

13. i ' ve thought about this . i don ' t want a cure mainly because that would require change and as an aspergers guy i don ' t really like change . my life , it ' s not great but it ' s not the worst thing in the world . once i ignore society and their expectation and definitions of success i ' m doing alright . i ' ve got enough to eat , a place to sleep and a pc to game on . i ' m still trying to get a job but that ' s the only thing i want but can ' t seem to get . a girlfriend would be nice too .
   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

14. no private sc is worth it . you  re better than that . don  t let some dumb slut take advantage of you . she  s not unique . there  s tons of free porn out there . she  s not doing anything for you that you can  t go out and get all by yourself .
   (ID: cb8cb80756996949fe8fa5c308bb091367a0c6ff)

15. this is tough . it changes . when i met my wife it was exciting . not like a roller coaster more like consistently looking forward to the next time we interacted . what would happen next , talking about the future and of course the sexual appeal . butterflies . i knew we would be married one day even though we were in our late teens . i just knew . i didn ' t have " what if " thoughts to dissuade me . it ' s been nearly digit years now married digit . it ' s not excitement now it ' s deep deep caring . what would she think , how does she feel , how can i make it better . how can i ease a burden . she is my best friend . that old question about if you could go back and do it over knowing what you know now always stumps me . could i make different choices and still end up in this relationship ? because if i couldn ' t i wouldn ' t . sorry for the novel .
   (ID: 02cf76dae1fda8da1d2e5bbbaeb0da5a77cb6e3e)

16. how long have you been crushing on this girl and do you still see her often ?
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

17. you ' d better feel sorry , i could ' ve looked at like two cat pictures instead
   (ID: 3994e1d32967dee02bf170d70c0ccc2d7dbd99d5)

18. we had a player in my city who came from a different , larger city for work . back then the lgs was new and so were the players so he ' d shark trades and crush fnms and other events easily . anyways eventually i learnt how to play properly and became a better player than him , so he stopped coming the actual bad experience however was when i was to his old store back in the larger city  he knew the owner personally and that was where he went to sell off his robbed cards and stuff  he ' d given the town a reputation as a place where everyone can barely play and he gets to sweep the trades and tournaments without trying . me being one of the few people to stick with the game after he ' d ruined it so thoroughly , i guess he ' d really made up some stuff about me out of spite so i get in and as soon as i ' m asked where i ' m from it starts getting whispered around  the standout experience was me asking how much they wanted for their foil tamiyo ,  i wanted it as an anniversary gift for my girlfriend but depending on whether they used f2f or scg pricing it would ' ve been better to get her the expedition hallowed fountain  and the clerk just told me " more than ten bucks still want it ? " and walked away without ringing me in i didn ' t spend any money there , but i drove back up for an edh tournament and got second , and then again and got first . now they ' re nicer to me but having to earn respect from strangers after being the butt of rumours soured me on the community , i go to a different place
   (ID: 8df56ee782672f11aeb0f19bf7978b1b1c04e678)

19. i don ' t think they believed i would go anywhere in life . i was never told exactly why but she lost interest and wasn ' t " attracted " to me anymore . not for looks but perhaps out of boredom or fear that there could be someone better .
   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

20. i can understand why you ' re uncomfortable but i think the term rape gets thrown around too much sometimes and this is one of the times . would this have been such an issue of he didn ' t cum in you this time and just did what he normally would do ? i think the issue is more of him just not being careful about pregnancy not about the sex itself right ?
