19. moai is the best emoji . it ' s beautiful . i love it . the point of emojis is to show emotions , but what emotion does this show ? do you just wake up in the morning and think " wow , i really feel like a massive stone today " ? yes , thats how i feel and it ' s useful . i love it . it just provokes a deep joy within me whenever i see it . i want to drive on over to the fucking emoji headquarters and create a new moai emoji just to spam it . if this was the emoji movie i ' d go watch it infinitly . people just comment moyai as if it ' s funny . it is . moai deserves to be immortal . he deserves to have his smug little stone rested forever in a sculpture . oh wow , it ' s a stone head , how hilarious , please , continue to say it , it gets my day way better . dont stop it . it deserves to get in the gate of heavens . why is it so goddamn sexy . you ' re a fucking stone , you cant be sexy they said , but it gets an erection deep in my heart and soul . i hope you live forever
