1. the thieves guild found when me when i was a young child on the streets of taichan , the wide slums adjacent to the walled capital city samhai . at some point in those first few years they found that i didn ' t trip magical alarms and that made me much more valuable to them . i became a burglar as a child while the other children were pickpockets , ascending quickly to a middle ranking position by the time i was thirteen years old . however then things became a little strange . magic is typically an endeavor of the wealthy . magic books are expensive and complicated magic is usually learned in the academy in samhai . but nearly everyone of a certain age learns some piece of magic . there is an internal force that takes time to develop and usually begins to express itself with puberty . in strong magicians it finds ways to come out , like sparks from their fingertips or burping fire . if those magicians are found in taichan they are whisked off to samhai to be adopted by powerful families and trained in magic . even the thieves guild will make deals and surrender their talented magicians . this is why i began magic lessons at thirteen . most other burglars used magic constantly to evade magical defenses . i had never needed it , and just focused on quietly slipping through the house and identifying valuables . a part of me didn ' t believe my job was dangerous until i saw a veteran burglar ripped apart by magical wolves in a house in samhai . i wanted as much protection as possible after that and sought magic instruction immediately . the problem was , i couldn ' t do magic . everyone laughed when they heard and joked that it was good i was a talented thief because i wouldn ' t get anywhere in high society . over time however , and through my own small experiments , i learned that not only was i incapable of preforming magic , i seemed immune to it . i put my finger into a magical flame , had the best con artist in the guild try an illusion on me , didn ' t even feel the attacks from our best combat magician . at this point everyone was amazed and sort of unsure of how to treat me . even our leader was perplexed . " see , i ' m sure the academy wants you , but for what ? i ' m just as sure you wouldn ' t want to be their lab rat . " oren said . he and i were alone in his office , part of the tunnel network underneath taichan . " they would pay me for you , but you make that much every digit months . i would be a fool to give you up . in fact , i think this means we can go bigger . " " what do you mean , bigger ? " the image of ghostly wolves ripping into theo ran through my head . " i mean what ' s the one target we have never hit before ? " oren said . " there are two , " i frown , " the academy and the king . either one would be a terrible idea . " " i meant the academy . the king ' s guard has swords and spears , i ' m pretty sure you aren ' t immune to those . " " but you don ' t know if there ' s magic in the academy we ' ve never seen before . i don ' t really want to push my luck . besides , what ' s to stop them from destroying all of taichan and our tunnels if they wanted to ? " " only one thing . the thing you ' d be going there to steal . ruan ' s stone . " great prompt ! i might write a part digit if there ' s interest .
   (ID: ba6d1d2cee95e9f30e06dc1584d5fa02e62221e8)

2. i know more than one because my kids drug me through it . i still think it ' s a kid thing .
   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

3. being able to call out your president and other leadership on their constant bs and not get sent to a concentration camp
   (ID: 36314aee005a03517f2446ec0da2834fe0f712d6)

4. is english not your first language ? you don ' t need a degree , any degree helps . but you can show up to some smaller towns and look up lesson plans online and just start teaching . build your clientele , develop a reputation , and grow your business
   (ID: 85ac769b0cb349e567cb91e8109645bd1ac28b9f)

5. apprenticeships ! you can work and get a degree at the same time . you do it with a company , you get a reduced salary , but it means you don ' t have to pay anything , and you get experience in the workplace . you do come out of it with a degree in whatever field your apprenticeship was in

6. so sorry , i ' m one of those women that marry jocks because i don ' t know what ' s good for me .
   (ID: bf662bc559367d8b6475102fe891d5e4eb072ffd)

7. someone on reddit recommended duolingo to me for learning language and i literally have been recommending it to everyone it amazing . i ' ve been using duolingo for digit days and i ' m digit  fluent in spanish  don ' t sound like much but believe me it ' s an amazing app . it has almost every language in it to learn .
   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

8. again . it ' s unlikely you ' ll ever like the way it sounds , because it ' s not what you ' re used to hearing of your voice . but others may like it more than you think .
   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

9. i assume it does take a toll . perhaps that is why we forget them , your brain probably can ' t handle too much unnecessary information . so it ' s probably a good thing that i forget them .
   (ID: 89e5ffcdc3b9c2cbc19f7274b7643ce26a8e2bbd)

10. you can try . but engineering is hard , it can be really frustrating when you don ' t understand something . i ' d tell you to get a teacher , but you can certainly try to do that on your own . who knows , it might work . you ' re doing something really challenging . be prepared to be frustrated , but be patient and persistent .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

11. i understand what you ' re saying , but these are true to a certain extent . very few of us are stuck in the situation we are in . most have the ability to get a new job , save some money , get an education , etc . what we lack is the willpower to change it . if you want a new job , find out what it takes to get the job you want and find a way to get those skills . in some cases , we already have the skills , but we don ' t pursue the job we want because we are comfortable in the job we have , even if we don ' t like it . i just landed a new position that is my dream job , because i finally got motivated to look for a new job , and i prepped myself for the interviews instead of winging it . want to save some money ? learn to separate wants and needs better . i bet you ' ll find some extra cash when you realize that you don ' t need a lot of the stuff you purchased . can you get a second job for a few hours a week to bring in some extra cash ? probably , but it would involve sacrificing some time that you could be doing something else . want an education ? have you really looked hard at all of your options ? probably not , because pretty much everyone can get an education of some sort if they really want it . traditional , online , night school , community college and then transfer to another school , vocational training , even free online classes that could set you up to test out of a subject so you can save some cash . the question is how badly do you want it ? are you willing to put the work in ? i ' m tired of listening to people complain about their lot in life , when they don ' t do a fucking thing to change it , and they want to blame everyone else for their failures . we had a kid live with us for a year who was homeless before we took him in . he had every reason to make excuses for why he couldn ' t succeed . he is mixed race , his dad is a thug , his mom can barely take care of herself , he had no money , he didn ' t have anyone to help him , he had never even had his own bed . in spite of that , this kid has used all of that for motivation . yes , we helped him out , but he did the work . he is now in college , has a decent job , has joined a frat , and he will be successful because he won ' t accept less from himself and he is willing to do the work . tldr  unless you have a disability of some sort , you can improve your life , but it requires motivation , discipline , and determination to do it . if you don ' t put forth the effort , quit bitching about it !
   (ID: 5603c8fcb517a4b5745afb8c3f46248974edebe3)

12. why do you even want input for this question ? thats a personal decision that shouldn ' t be influenced by anybody but yourself .
   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

13. decide that you want something and put some effort into it . even if it isn ' t worth while long term , working earnestly towards a goal can alleviate that feeling and help you realize what you are capable of

14. not really what i like to do but something i find myself doing is self sabotage . working on that though

15. hey all , so i ' m currently a 1st year physics student in one of the better uk unis and am starting to fear for my future . the thing is i only have enough money to sustain myself for the duration of the course , that means that i will only have the opportunity to do one internship because of how the uk system works , no masters studies , no digit year industry placements . so after digit years i will have a bsc in physics and will be looking for a job . i ' ve tried reading up online what a physics graduate can do , however most of the conversations are geared towards masters and phd ' s and for undergrads they usually talk about majors  minors in the us , which isn ' t a thing here , i only have physics to my name . now , i don ' t care that much if my job has little or nothing to do with my course , as long as it doesn ' t feel like my education was a complete waste of time . though it seems to me like i can ' t get into nucleaoptics  medical  meteorological physics , because they have enough masters and phd applicants . i like programming , but i won ' t be qualified enough to compete against compsci  engineering graduates , even if i take extra modules in them .   x200b  so besides teaching which i really don ' t want to do , am i completely screwed ? i only have one chance at an internship , what sector should i aim for that has no problems accepting physics bsc ' s with a little bit of experience ?

17. yeah yeah , so it doesn ' t really fall under the category of what your saying as " learning religion " .
   (ID: 8eba9c7d48a60bfbded2227dacd3275ae756fcce)

18. i have no advice , as i am in a very similar boat . i ' m digit and have digit years in admin , hate it , am considering a new career but have no idea what to do . i too love reading and writing but don ' t want to pursue writing full time for the reasons you mentioned . i just wanted to say that you are not alone . there are so many people our age who feel unfulfilled with their current career and feel that it could be too late to start a new one . it isn ' t . think about the average life span . we have a whole lot of life to live , it ' s never too late to pursue happiness . have you ever considered that for people like us , perhaps there will be no aha moment ? some people simply don ' t have digit purpose to devote their lives to . that can be so scary because it can leave you feeling restless , directionless and lost . i watched a ted talk that referred to this as being a " multi potentialite . here ' s the link if you care to check it out  maybe you should do some searching . find what naturally gives you joy . it doesn ' t matter if it ' s a profession , a hobby or an interest that captures your attention . identify things that you are excited to do and go from there . some of the happiest people found their dream job completely on accident while just doing something they love . i hope that rambling helped some . best of luck to you !
   (ID: a9b07d3f94647dffebe730771c20ee3ca1af7ec4)

19. if you know you want something , just do it . the earlier you start the better . i promise you that you ' d rather go for it right now than to doubt yourself either because of peer pressure , parent ' s expectations etc . and regret it digit years later thinking why didn ' t i do it there and then . at the end of the day , you are the one who is going to work in that field so don ' t let other people dictate your life .   x200b  but also , don ' t be fixated on one career path only . have back up careers cuz just because you have set your mind to one doesn ' t mean it won ' t suddenly change because you were inspired by something or someone or otherwise .   x200b  if you have no clue what to do , work hard in school and study to really understand all the subjects , then you will realise what you subjects you find interesting not saying that school is your only option but its a good place to start
   (ID: a77eb45bf2cf0979852baa624e4a728cd8c1b85b)

20. i worked like this for a while digit years or so , and liked it . bosses understood we had to have breaks every now and then and we did when we wanted to . i do not think it ' s too bad , each brick  thing moved being less than digit kg and you can do the work how you like , it was more freedom than in most of my it work most bosses didn ' t know what they were talking about . so basically , i didn ' t see negatives  you got   from bosses for doing " hard work and not complaining " is good in any later work you like  apply . if you don ' t get decent wages then that ' s a different issue altogether .
