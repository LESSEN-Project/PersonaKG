3. i would return it or sell it online as a cushion , and buy a new one when you get a steady job and savings built up later on . it will give you a goal to strive for as dumb as it sounds and when you buy another one you ' ll feel like a kid at christmas . hope you find a job soon , stranger !

4. woodworking man . go pick up a stack of free pallets , and you can tear them down with an hour and a hammer . after that , you know you have free wood , so even if what you make is crap , it didn ' t cost a dime . make a shelf , box , whatever . if it ' s something you ' re into , it ' ll grow to making cool stuff . and if you ' re not into it , no harm no foul , didn ' t cost anything but a few basic tools if you don ' t have them hammer , drill and circular saw will handle most everything , and are cheap online  craigslist . good luck man ! hope it works out

5. yeah , i think you ' re right . my partner wrote this because she feels as though her grandmother would appreciate her story being used to get more people interested in basic homesteading  we ' ve built in beginner ' s homesteading stuff , nothing super complex . that said , apparently she had a recipe for what she called ' emergency rabbit stew ' that i really wish we could track down , and i saw myself how she could make clothes out of literal scraps . i think maybe a compilation of more detailed things of hers like that would be more useful to this sub ! we ' ll work on it .

6. hey it looks pretty neat , i guess she wanted a already built computer , but you did your best and stop worrying , it ' s all right !
