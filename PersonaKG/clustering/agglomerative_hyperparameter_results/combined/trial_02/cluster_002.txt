10. we are finding it fun and manageable as we enter month digit with our digit month lab . he  s definitely not an adult yet and there is training that needs doing regarding occasional rude behavior and overstimulation , but he  s very nice to the cat and has a great temperament . for a first time owner having a baby at the same time as a puppy or young dog might be crazy . a new dog is kind of like a baby , you  re always trying to figure out what it wants and how to get it to go to sleep ! perhaps i  m speaking too soon but as long as we have a dog walker and have like . digit hours outside of work to train  exercise  bond with him , he seems very happy and sleeps all night . we ski on weekends and feel bad about the alone time , so usually try to spend one day doing a lot of dog  centric active stuff with him .
