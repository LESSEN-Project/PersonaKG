   (ID: 52630a8de60c1fa7b1adc6ce63b9b05563b7b9f2)

   (ID: de5db66359e6314e9bac24fd9a10ec1d49584c4f)

19. i don ' t consider it a waste . at the risk of sounding ignorant , budget has no impact on how i grow . my personal grow is my hobby and stuff i want to do like plant manipulation or literal pet projects . if i get the right seed combo , i could make potential f1s that yield ungodly amounts per ft2 . if i get the wrong seed combo , i just made a new genetic that none of my friends have . so to me , that sounds like a win  win and not the loss  loss you want to present it as .
   (ID: e978c4c5dd931b8985b65369abe1ef855c833aa3)

20. i  ll double check with him and see how it goes , thank you !
