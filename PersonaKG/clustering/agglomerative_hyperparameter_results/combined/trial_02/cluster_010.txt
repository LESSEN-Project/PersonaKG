   (ID: a8d677a357cabd8cb6d9bfa06e041b5b173582d8)

   (ID: 9f681f3dedb4dcecbe41b42dada5f72caae05ebe)

3. if anyone ever said they knew how to do it themselves i ' d let them , but i would always always always double check the harness and make sure they were clipped properly . after every attempt too . when it comes to safety , it takes a lot to be " too careful "
   (ID: 2e464b2732570f16afced14ab79d30fa92622627)

4. not sure what the microphone thing is . but thanks .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

5. plan . make sure you have enough money . be willing to take time off . be ready to not get much sleep .
   (ID: 718ff22055f41bd70e24ec98f0898a1526112965)

6. there ' s nothing you can realistically do about this apart from get a hold of yourself and learnt to move past it . remind yourself that you have no reason to be angry about it and make sure you never treat your girlfriend poorly because of it
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

7. how you get them is how you lose them . why would you think that he would be faithful to you ? i ' m pretty sure he ' s reassuring you the same way he reassured her .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

8. i think it is a system that disallows hidden identity . you will now have to go elsewhere to post anon or suck services someone else is paying for . other than that , those crap solicitor phone calls i keep getting can be blocked , and my competitors cant hack up my adwords account when they have no business and cost me money . i am sure its a problem though . somehow .
   (ID: 457d7d37e1181cc932693cd4220e6fbfd564a75d)

9. so why is nobody investigating conflict of interest ? im sure if there was a proof for such thing the fbi would be all over it ?
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

10. duuuuuuuude . now seriously  this is impressive for a first release . sure , they ' ve been working on it for some time , but it already has features that are still missing from opera and people are complaining about  digit versions after the abandonment of presto . everything is looking good , it even works on , although a bit sluggish on the machine i ' ll be using for some more months . i noticed it has some gestures , but it seems they are neither documented nor customizable for now  e . g . down  right closes the current tab .
   (ID: 32520dc340c18ed101e3d5ea02b3a7bca25dcc29)

11. oh yeah , sure , go kill your own men just to bug someone to where they want to fight . unless the us is run by some digit year olds , i ' m pretty sure that ' s not the case .
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

12. that ' s what i thought , go and let them see how sick you are but risk getting others sick and look selfish too . i ' m not sure .
   (ID: 8797828a745ecd521e3b219ff004d26777b4f4f7)

13. not sure why it went bold . i certainly didn  t do anything extra on my phone . i noticed it to and being new to reddit i didn  t know what i did . lol
   (ID: 4126a6a9d5a548a6bed5e0c4992792b1c10f2b92)

14. makes sense . would you happen to know of any good resources i could check out about setting up a vm that i could use for plex ? while i understand the concept and use vm ' s at work i have never set one up for this purpose so i ' m not sure whats all required .
   (ID: 237175707a16a7382ac8130de85ed85b63dc9442)

15. i  m not entirely sure how i should respond to this reply ? i don  t think my opinion is nonsense ? and it can  t be proved either way . agree to disagree i guess ?
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

16. i think a lot of people have fov all wrong . i ' ve been playing a couple weeks on digit fov . but now i ' m thinking that digit fov is the way to go . with digit fov enemy ' s hitboxes are much larger . i tested that out in training mode with the bloodhound . sure you can ' t see on your sides as well but on console i use a headset and feel like it doesn ' t bring that much benefit since usually enemies aren ' t on my sides . another downside is that you don ' t look like you ' re sprinting as fast but i reconcile this by thinking that you run at the same pace no matter what .
   (ID: b30983a02e6c6ad80a50a521eee441b9f454a5e9)

17. not sure if you saw my vivic . love this ordinator . great job ! upvoted !
   (ID: 4126a6a9d5a548a6bed5e0c4992792b1c10f2b92)

18. i disagree . it does do something . it helps thousands of people have food for a short while . i am sure that you ' d be pissed if you were part of the famine affected communities in somalia and someone said " we were going to send you digit tons of food but some guy on reddit said that there isn ' t any point in it , so we decided to spend the money on big screen tv ' s and taco bell " maybe it won ' t solve the problem but it ' s better than doing nothing .
   (ID: 3f3a13bda2e98055fc23d20ace4e5f76118b56c5)

19. don ' t own a pixel , but get the same from my ' common ' iphone using friends . hahah . i even won a contest at my school because of my camera quality . pretty decent i must say !
   (ID: 17d5718d86b2560f3a04d8427f0e5fb4b969bed3)

20. i haven ' t run into a bad troll sub but i ' m sure there are . i dont take anything that serious specially on ask reddit .
