1. being single does suck . i ' ve been single my entire life m16 . i usually cope by hanging out with friends . i know i ain ' t the best looking , nor am i fit . but yeah . i get how you feel . life does suck that way . whenever i feel down about being alone , i usually think " i ' ll find that person eventually " some day you will . just continue doing what you like , and hang out with your friends
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

2. well , if we accept ourselves  just as we are  then nobody should ever work out because you  re changing your body , put on make up because you  re changing your physical appearance , wear clothes because you  re covering your natural body , or change yourself in any way because if you do , you  re not accepting yourself just as you are . everyone  s perspective of self acceptance is different . some people don  t believe in getting butt lifts or boob implants , some do . regardless , people still get them . people getting packers is trans guys accepting themselves as who they are a man . hypothetically , and assuming your a male , if you were in an accident and lost your dick it  s happened to many guys , you wouldn  t do anything to help yourself feel better about the loss ? i mean , since you should just accept how you are now . i do recognize that i sound very condescending in this comment and i  m not going to deny it , i  m just trying to counter argue and use your logic against you .
   (ID: 3510b342268f3bc4c3f1e402201d7c565dfb7648)

3. unrealized potential . hahahahaha you don ' t have friends and you say crap like that . so you fully realized your potential ? and no one cares about how much you paid for a xbox . people who could actually care would be friends . seriously , try to get friends , it would do you some good . i ' ll help lesson digit  be cool , don ' t be so sensitive lesson digit  the term " bro " is better used when talking to a close friend lesson digit  don ' t insinuate that you have more money than other people . it ' s really douchy and you might be wrong . let me know how it goes , as a fellow human being , i am actually concerned about you
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

4. yeah hot for sure , as long as it ' s not a swimming pool worth of love juices .
   (ID: 2971f819c4d7400b9fa7806434e9037b6af4dfae)

5. so , because not all men are out to hurt women , which i agree with , if i get a gut feeling that someone is standing too close , staring too much , looks me in the eyes and then appears to have a realization and then crosses the street is he going to double back on me ? why did he look at me like that . , i am going to trust it , because i want to not be raped or assaulted . i  m not putting myself in possible danger just to save sole dude  s feelings . for example , the same man coming into the empty except for us toy aisle digit or digit times in digit minutes to always stand too close to my small daughters while they chose toys . we left with no toys and lots of tears because my spidey senses told me to gtfo . i don  t care if i upset him , because i know my kids are safe . i don  t understand the downvotes for women who are saying instead of risking rape assault and murder we treat strangers in dark  quiet  unpopulated areas with a lot of suspicion . i just can  t choose some dudes feelings over my safety . as i  m sure you wouldn  t ignore your instincts if you were getting a shifty vibe from some woman on a dark street .
   (ID: c28c39847d1ec88851aadf063f6e8baf4594b35c)

6. i  ll take the money , i don  t care about love , a nice friendship is enough
   (ID: 2a3d0cc7409627207d71d58affd421983020efbe)

7. if you  re four months into the relationship , i think they  d be happy to hear  i love you .  that  s just me and my partner , though . best way to do it is  hey , person  s name ? they respond  yeah  or  what  etc i love you .
   (ID: 12803a9aad224d0537b68ab83a6cdc6a45d3160f)

8. honestly didn  t read the body just the tdlr cause you  re digit and you just need to do you for a bit . seriously young people are on here constantly asking so many questions like this but you just need to find yourself and not listen to strangers opinions on your choices in life . why not just try to meet new people and not worry about who is your  most compatible  . have some damn fun
   (ID: 238316960c030f561912bd63e9f572a4170f991b)

9. by the way , the  tell me about yourself  move i stole from terry gross . listen to her podcast if you want to see a master . she gets people to open up like none other .
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

10. i talk to people every once and a while they hate me at first then get used to me and friend me out of pity . i don ' t know why they do that they could just stop talking to me if they hate me but it ' s just what happens .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

11. there ' s a reason " corporate drone " is a saying . eyes forward , yes sir . just shut off everything but your brain ' s section that stops you from telling people what you really think of them .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

12. because if you ' re booking it that close to the date you probably really want or need to go , so you kind of bend over and they fuck you . if they tried to fuck you sooner you might be able to travel another way .
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

13. talking to us normally is the way to go . i get it , you ' re nervous about a date  we are too .
   (ID: 8889ee4547e570f04696e9cc7b50124dca69b82e)

14. well it mostly came from me talking , so i talk less .
   (ID: 9ec97fcc6f16d54d7e24ba1cdb5ebe5785854536)

15. i kind of have to . bc no one likes me enough to make the first move .
   (ID: f5639f88927d467b89189ab179bb30d8a5705552)

16. dude , i think the main part of social skills is knowing different social clues  hints people give . for example  someone on their phone  they are busy and find it rude when people try to interrupt them someone looks really happy and approachable  most likely would be willing to talk to you someone is responding in few words , doesn ' t sound very engaged  probably not interested and sometimes , these social ques can help you determine how well the conversation is going , and maybe signal that you ' re doing something wrong
   (ID: 3e7b07ddd384cb288bc529e6aeb73f840aa5a294)

17. just ask her  random question . if i asked you if you  d date me , would you ?  or something like that . don  t make it seem like you want to date her , just like a funny question .
   (ID: f491028c794855d1611365b07d4525f7b98173ae)

18. i am so sorry to hear that . i  m sorry you have to go through this but if it makes you feel any better , most women with big boobs are insecure and we don  t like them ! hell , men would much rather prefer smaller boobs on their significant other as opposed to big boobs there was a study on this . plus , you get to wear so many pretty bras ! and , you will always look really good in clothes
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

19. i think it makes an easy segue into talking to him , if you can be kind of matter of fact about it . it gives you a reason to discuss it with him . and to discuss about how what you see in porn isn ' t how it really is in life . and how you want him to have good information . and how you should have talked to him before it got to this point where his curiosity got the better of him . plus , it lets him know that you ' re keeping an eye on what he ' s doing with his phone . i know this sounds silly to some people but i find when i have to get ready for conversations that might get uncomfortable that if i practice saying it out loud it gets easier . there is something about hearing the words coming out of my mouth before anyone else does that makes it much less awkward . you ' ll do great . i have faith in you .
   (ID: 1293e72aa7301baf0ecb3a2509e46cdcca834cd9)

20. im really interested in how your scar looks . i know i sound pretty creepy , but i just like seeing some wounds but they are being really not nice to you , as if it was your fault that you happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and get injured by the wrong person . i understand that it may make people especially kids feel uncomfortable , but if they just see things like that from a young age , they just won ' t grow as discriminant as the people are nowadays . i wish you best luck , and don ' t let people limit you just because of some damn scar . that doesn ' t make you a different being . you ' re still the same human as everyone .
