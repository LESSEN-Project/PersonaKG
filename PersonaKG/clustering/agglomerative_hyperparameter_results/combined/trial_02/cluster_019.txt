1. got a new job , wanted to use up all my sick time about digit weeks before giving my two weeks . they ended up firing me for taking too much time off in a short span . they were surprised when i was totally fine in my meeting , and i told them i was planning on giving my notice and was going to our competitor .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

2. i jacked off in there more than i would like to admit . got paid to do it though !
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

3. cast away was probably the most egregious . they told everyone he got off the island , must have taken a lot of tension out of the raft scene .
   (ID: fc70415de2435c629ec792dbd90c954786c0bd16)

4. would wearing a queens helmet cause this ? i have the raid cloak , but the queens helmet . i figured since the event was over , it wouldn ' t effect anything ?
   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

7. you know , i often wonder that myself . i myself wouldn ' t fall into the hot category , but there seems to be a disproportionately large amount of young , attractive people coming into the industry . i honestly don ' t know why , but i ' ve also noticed it . plus  uniforms always make people just that little bit hotter
   (ID: bb79791c3753a1fc8ece696b3835b0f59ddccc90)

8. of course i don ' t fucking think that . i ' m just trying to point out that the whole " he could ' ve just got an illegal gun on the black  market " argument is bullshit . if in the future there is a gang driven black  market for semi  autos in nz the gangs will need to be very careful about who they sell them too , and a some neck beard 4chan weirdo would almost certainly be told to fuck off .
   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

9. not a worker , but the lady behind me got upset about the bill she got over  digit and thought that she could refund it by puking it up back on to her plate . she got even more upset when they wouldn ' t accept it , and started to trash everything ! of course , they had to call security to get her out . by far the weirdest , but funniest thing i ' ve ever seen !
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

10. i know im late to this but my curiosity finally got the better of me and i read digit . anyone got pictures of puppies or something wholesome ? i am in need
   (ID: 41ecb08cd807b953da29a82cba9ddfcf32745fc3)

11. have been depressed for god knows how long and never got any treatment . neither can i afford ot nor do i think that it will help because the treatments are shit aroud here .
   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

12. i also got a message from what i think is the same guy . the dude is probably on this sub , looking for people to harass . what a sad human being .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

13. tough to say for sure . could be bi , or just genuinely curious . also sounds like you ' ve got some underlying fluidity to your gender identity or expression that warrants some exploration . you ' re asking questions only you can really answer purple  heart
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

14. you can not report people for griefing . idk from where you got that .

15. they ' re all rescues , so they know a good gig when they ' ve got one . they ain ' t squealing .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

16. several questions . why is the dad calling his digit year old sexy ? why did she supposedly call herself brave instead of something like smart or kind ? why do her feet look that damn big ?
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

17. let me guess , she didn ' t ask what you got ?
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

18. when you find money in your pockets and have no idea how it got there
   (ID: 4220698c420fc0ae5858bf747f40efb2251b9ed8)

19. she made me dress in rags and basically clean all the time . i never got to anything i wanted  i was essentially her servant . i got treated horribly whilst my two step sister ' s got everything they could ever want . it was disgusting . however , it all changed one day when i go to go to a royal dance . it met a great person there , but when the clock hit midnight i had to leave ! luckily for me , however , the person i met at the dance was very resilient and searched all the land to find me . when they did find me , we got together at my step mother was punished by my fairy godmother . to this day , i still live with the person i met at the dance and life has been uphill ever since .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)
