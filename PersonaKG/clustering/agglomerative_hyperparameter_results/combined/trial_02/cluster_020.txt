1. how did you feel about the g302 ? and what other mice would you compare it to ? which ones are your current favourite mice ?
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

2. no you handled it well . i would of done the exact same thing . think of it this way  if he did kill his self and you didn ' t inform anyone , you would feel a lot worse . you ' ve done the right thing . you ' ve broken up with him and told several people so now it ' s their job to look out for him . not yours . you are free .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

3. i feel like the less of a filter you have on your mind and the words you say , the less small talk you have and the more interesting it is to you . don  t get too overboard though .
   (ID: 7a36b5607ec030b33a99723097f6d67b04c38d99)

4. it ' s awkward because after the breakup , it is always weird to celebrate your own birthday by yourself , especially if that person was toxic or abusive . i just haven ' t celebrated my birthday in years because i feel like i ' m celebrating their birthday instead of mine . in the moment it was awkward too . when it ' s your birthday you get special treatment from friends and family . when it ' s someone else ' s as well , it sort of makes you feel like you ' re not unique or special in any way .
   (ID: 6c99329e90a867248b7cd3a376f1a2fd57ae3994)

5. well you just did it , how does it feel ?
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

6. true , i think what makes america the  best  is the culture that anything is possible if you put your mind and effort into it . i know some people disagree with that as it can make people feel like failures if things don  t work out for them but that  s just how life is , i  d personally rather fail perusing my dream then not attempt it at all .
   (ID: 350ebf5f22b005c6fa011b8241361bb7184ec8d5)

7. its ok take your time you can tell me when you feel like it
   (ID: 409a49cde6f1f65f92cac4d33c7c769f7ba9e965)

8. i feel like this is going to be the new normie meme
   (ID: 6260fdfdc8a5feec78502a823b8de04ee318e260)

9. i want to downvote these post because of how shitty this makes me feel , but i remember it ' s not the posters fault
   (ID: 1955f382f8fc2d10480017d73817b8c3b41c2a02)

10. i have thought about it . i want some money to sustain myself with , like , food and stuff lol . also , i just don ' t feel like i am in a place where i could right now . the closest i have gotten is through plotting to run away to alaska or utah haha
   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

11. i really fight not to feel lonely in the fandom , but regardless of reaching out to people , joining websites , going to fur meets , chatting online , being in a bigger city , writing , drawing , etc . i still feel pretty lonely . regardless of the fandom being a community , it is still a community of human beings , and just like there are lonely people in the real world , there are going to be lonely people in the fandom .
   (ID: ecce6e894db30f245f1073ca0e270a3bb87eaa71)

12. how are you ? well , now that you ask my hemorrhoids are acting up again and i feel really constipated today . so when i leave the room it is probably to take a shit .
   (ID: 53aa6c267ff5eccf891e178786d41ca5df80a5de)

13. no children and i never needed to create life to feel like i have a meaningful life . i ' m honestly super happy with my choice and think it ' s just ridiculous when people force the idea that everyone needs to have a kid . there are too many people who should gave never had a baby in the first place tho but that ' s my opinion . haha
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

14. we can both agree on that bro idk why i know x has his own style and i fucking love that but for some reason it reminded me of eminem  s mockingbird or kim or hopsins ill mind in the sense that it  s very minimalistic but it tells a story and i fucked with it so heavy because of that . there isn  t a lot going on but you feel that emotion you feel the message
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

15. that ' s why i challenged him on it . i ' ve never heard it myself , but i feel like every musical niche is fulfilled by someone somewhere . i guess it doesn ' t even have to be popular , i just want to hear an example regardless !
   (ID: 3994e1d32967dee02bf170d70c0ccc2d7dbd99d5)

16. honestly i could make the value whatever i want it to be since air is just floating out there and has no production cost . but i feel like i could single handedly crash the economy by charging people for every breath
   (ID: 36314aee005a03517f2446ec0da2834fe0f712d6)

17. theres a very famous philosophical view not too different from your idea . unfortunately , i cant remember the name but i learned about it in college . it  s that people only do things for themselves . basically , you can rationalize that any act of kindness is just to make you feel better about yourself . for example , working hard to support your kids could be so that you dont feel guilty about being a bad parent because you dislike the feeling of guilt . the only way i make it through long work weeks is by accepting short term gratification for a single days hard work
   (ID: 0c93ab3ec35cab16ded3445fcca7b6045c1dd147)

18. sounds like they might be a bit envious of your successes and they are picking on the tattoo out of spite . why see them at all tomorrow ? it will be more crap about the tattoo and nothing about your new job . reschedule and say you are sick . it  s your bday , you deserve to feel cherished and loved and you aren  t getting it from them .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

19. do you have to fight it back ? being sad can be a beautiful thing too ! you can ' t always bother your friends and family but it ' s definitely an option . does it feel like you care a whole lot about those people , so much that it actually hurts , like , in your lower chest ? sort of like something is squeezing ? cause i ' ve had that before .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

20. in what way was it clear that he had assistants feeding him information ? i ' ve never seen his live show but i know he has been under intense media scrutiny for his entire career . if he was cheating in this way i can ' t help but feel he would have been publicly busted for it .
