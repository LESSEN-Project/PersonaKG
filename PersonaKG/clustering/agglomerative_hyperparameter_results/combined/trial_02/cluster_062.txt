1. im not sure what to think of this to this day .   x200b  so my family and i were visiting the main island of hawaii , we were visiting the black sand beach at the time and some older asian people wanted to take pictures with me , keep in mind these were complete strangers . now , i was about digit at the time so i agreed . they took pictures with me and then asked where i was from and all kinds of personal stuff . i answered all the questions honestly being a naive little kid . then once they had just stopped asking me a question , they pushed me away . did they see my parents and let me go ? am i overthinking this ? what scares me is that they probably still have the pictures of me .

   (ID: 8a4ed3ff6aeac985870de52972da8599efd48ae2)

4. i think a sudden lane change before the ice may have been risky ? given that the vehicle didn  t roll when we were sliding sideways i think the whole road was rather slick . either way , i think we learned our lesson here . my friend had only driven my car once before and i believe he did the best he could in the moment . we were going too fast , for sure . a combination of fatigue , speed , and the fact that my 4runner does not handle quite like a jetta got us in trouble

6. holy fuck me ! that ' s awful , i feel bad for your uncle ' s friend . , that ' s why i feel so bad for truckers , people are assholes because they think they are faster and can get away . what they forget is that the trucks are way bigger and will crush them like a bug , how did your he handle it after ? i can ' t imagine even though in a way the guy deserved it for being an ass , it still had to affect the driver . edit  spelling

14. i was still kinda am a theatre nerd in high school . i was in all the plays and musicals . my senior year we did how to succeed in business without really trying . i played the role of mr . gatch . gatch is basically harvey weinstein . my friends and others seemed to love how i portrayed mr . gatch so they kept calling me gatch off  stage and after production . the name stuck . i added attack at the end cause i thought it sounded fun . its funny how out of all the roles i ' ve played , gatch , the pervy co worker is the one that stuck . it ' s got to the point where people think of me instead of the character when they hear gatch .

17. continuing the ideas of the nice spooky story from chimichenghis i heard about the first person to go missing at digit am . by digit pm three more were gone . no one seemed to know where they were as the storm hit land and we could barely see through the torrential rain . i kept my family locked inside and all day i peered into the gray , my shotgun by my side . this had never happened before in our town . we live in a quiet fishing town . everybody knows everybody , and we haven ' t had a person go missing in digit years , let alone four people in two days . i ' m not a superstitious man but i know when something isn ' t right . at digit pm my wife was cooking dinner in the kitchen , fresh blue crab , when i heard a woman ' s scream outside . i saw a shadow running down the street in the downpour . i saw another shadow , slower but steadily giving chase . i threw on my parka , grabbed my gun and slammed my front door open . " hey ! " i shout in my booming voice . i am a large man , six foot , six inches , and i have shouted over storms on many boats . " pick on someone your own size ! " the first person continued running but the second turned toward me . they began walking toward me and i can see shaggy strands of something hanging off of them . " who ' s there ? " i call out , " identify yourself ! i ' m armed ! " the figure , apparently male , continued to shamble in my direction silently . his head tilted to the side . i shoulder my gun . " come on boy ! you want some buckshot ? " i have never shot a person before but i was an engineer in the navy and i would not hesitate . the shambling sped up . " screw it . " i mutter . i pull the trigger . my wife screams in the kitchen when she hears the shot . the figure stops for a moment , then continues forward . i missed ? i pump the action then fire again , the bead dead center on the figure ' s chest . he is rocked back but does not stop . i rack my shotgun again and pull the trigger . no blast . i look at my gun , puzzled , and see the water dripping into it . moving quickly , i duck back inside and slam the door closed . what can take two shells of digit buckshot and keep moving ? my wife screams again . she is in the living room with me now , staring out the window . i look out with her and see the ghastly figure . it looks like a drowned man , covered in seaweed . his eyes are gone with bloody , sunken cheeks , as if his skin had been eaten by fish . " get my other gun ! " i yell at my wife , mostly to get her out of the room . i don ' t know if any gun can stop this monster . a million thoughts race through my head but i fixate on one . our father , who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .

18. how did i not see this coming ?
   (ID: 3de4b885645ecd39fdcb6a1daf410341eb118d2c)

19. i feel a buzz in my pocket . i reach and pull it out and see an emergency alert across the screen . " emergency  lock all doors and stay inside . do not panic . " " panic ? " i wonder out loud , " why would i panic ? " just then i hear a knock at the front door . i walk over to it and peer through the blurry glass . it seems like my girlfriend sophie . " sophie ? why are you home ? " she stares back blankly . " shouldn ' t you be at work right now ? why don ' t you have your key ? " no response . i back away from the door just as her jaw opens like a snake and a dark forked tongue crashes through the window and nearly reaches me , three yards away . i turn and run to the bedroom closet . i pull out my grandfather ' s long double  barrelled shotgun and load it with buckshot . as i click the barrel back in place , a monster comes roaring through my hallway , now barely recognizable as sophie . her face is distorted , dark and cavernous and webbed tentacles flow out of her dress and pull her along both walls like an ooze . i fire both barrels in quick succession . the blast is powerful , and leaves my ears ringing badly . the monster is thrown back to the end of the hallway . the remnants of sophie ' s face were removed by the blast , revealing mottled gray reptilian skin . the impact of the buckshot was substantial , and covered the center and left side of the creature with green blood . within moments , however , the worst of the wounds begin to close and its yellow eyes snap open . i back away , ejecting the spent shells and fumbling for more from my shirt pocket . the creature ' s face opens into a wide , horrible grin . the tongue shoots out again , farther this time , and locks around my chest like a steel cable . it pulls me in while flying toward me like a smoke cloud . i am engulfed into the abyss of its mouth . i regain consciousness while walking in the middle of the street . i have no control over my body , and i notice other people walking nearby , although i can ' t turn my head to look at them . there are no cars on the road . i walk for miles , feeling no fatigue and keeping a steady pace . i arrive to a house and knock on a door . my mind is foggy and i feel numb , but i know this house . this is my parents house . i haven ' t written in a long time and i ' m rusty . nice prompt !
