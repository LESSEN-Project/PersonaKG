1. i hear you . you believe you are unworthy . you think that deep down , you don  t matter . all i can say is that the voice that  s telling you that is lying . it  s a lie that you are unworthy and undeserving . it  s simply untrue . the truth is that you are a person worthy of love and happiness and stability and help . you don  t have to do this alone . your therapist and your hr rep will help you . your therapist can get you the right kind of treatment and your hr rep will help you make sure you can take the time off . do you think that you could experiencing cognitive distortions ? and that maybe you aren  t seeing things clearly ? what if you spoke to your therapist about the possibility of getting help ? what if you  re jumping to conclusions about how treatment will really be like ? are you jumping to conclusions about  subjecting  other people to helping you ? i would think that therapists and counselors would want to help you  it  s their ultimate goal , after all . could it be that your brain isn  t letting you think clearly right now ?
   (ID: 827584bdc66e3c4749f22f0ad0a9420dc64ac2b5)

2. confidence , man . i always think about what could go wrong rather than what could go right . i guess putting effort into something doesn  t seem worth it when negativity is the most likely outcome in your head .
   (ID: 23394798067974e95a922a95c6609d16ca1b11dd)

3. i don  t think you can find yourself that way . it takes deep thought .
   (ID: 2bef35da312e37edc8bab504f87f6973d3b8481a)

4. i really don ' t know how to describe it to other people , but i just don ' t let myself react to emotions or thoughts that are unproductive . something starts to seem a bit overwhelming ? ignore the fact that it is overwhelming and focus on what you can affect . someone does something that pisses you off ? think about what you can do about the situation and if that will be productive . if so , take action , if not , drop it . edit  thanks for the gold , folks ! my first gilding !
   (ID: 7e67f2109db2f138225338a090de78cfd116cfca)

5. find other things you like to do . volunteer at an animal shelter , pick up a new inexpensive hobby , start exercising regularly . whatever you do , don ' t let yourself have too much free time , it ' s easy to get really down on yourself when that happens . take that time to work on yourself and your life outside of your career during that time . that way you are still moving forward .
   (ID: 3adf883c491ca030d52ee22ed62e166c87ed0d5e)

6. can you know for sure what ' god ' intended for anything ? i say just live in the moment , get high and enjoy life .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

7. you have it now , it  s just hard to see in the moment . it  s one of those things that you don  t realize you have until you look back on all of the stuff that you  ve already been through . the fact that you  re still here and you  re talking about it proves how strong you are .
   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

8. that i was a fantastic father . you always wonder if you  re doing the right things .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

9. my kids . made me think how devastated they would be without me .
   (ID: aaee7c28c6f1f83a427cf3dccf635bb78656a19d)

10. when was the last time you remember feeling happy and content with your life ? and did something happen after that moment that made things change ?
   (ID: a9b07d3f94647dffebe730771c20ee3ca1af7ec4)

11. how do you become likable or how do you not want to shoot yourself every second of the day .
   (ID: 870d9d198f856764296262192823c935f1daf781)

12. once i fully realized i was an alcoholic and couldn  t control myself like i had been desperately trying to do , i was like  fuck it , what can i do to make this downward spiral faster !  . eventually , i had a moment of being willing to try something different , even though i didn  t know how or what to do . six years ago , i went to a crappy rehab , where we couldn  t even have coffee and i didn  t always want to be there , but , i  ve stayed sober every day since . i  m totally not extraordinary in any way , i just decided to give doing something different a chance and be open to not  knowing  what was gonna happen . i hope you find some comfort , regardless of your next move or circumstances .
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

13. hey . firstly you need to speak to someone be it a doctor or the samaritans , someone . secondly why are you looking up reasons instead of looking inwards and seeing what the actual issue is . do you have depression or something that maybe people around you don ' t know how to handle ? what kind of person are you ? are you kind ? thoughtful ? generous with your time ? empathetic ? honest ? nice ? these are all traits that people like . or are you selfish ? negative ? deceitful ? apathetic ? narcissistic ? irresponsible ? egotistical ? you can change your behaviour and your characteristics . you are not always going to be the person you perceive yourself to be now . everyone has the potential to change and grow . believe in yourself . only you have the ability to make yourself happy . don ' t depend on others to validate you . mind yourself .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

14. yes , it can . please don ' t misunderstand me , i ' m not putting you down in any way , or being negative . consider that more than digit  of the people on the face of the earth have never cut themselves on purpose , even once , in their whole lives . we don ' t have something wrong with our minds that drives us to cut ourselves to be able to feel something . i can only hope that you get yourself some psychiatric help to figure out why you do this to yourself , and learn how to feel something that isn ' t pain . i can ' t imagine what put you in that place . i hope you can find a way out of it .
   (ID: 514a3ecd0d04716c9225352c4a3a5d5424dd8056)

15. me too friend . it is quite nice to hear the other side of it . i see how stressed you guys are , i humble myself frequently . i remember when i loved in tucson i had a doctor who really cares about me , but that was digit years ago , and my condition has gotten so bad , i can ' t even remember things anymore . i ' m digit and feel digit so many issues , hard to push through the day , pain in every limb . lack of motivation , bipolar tendencies . i feel like something is eating my life away and no matter how i have tried to describe it , no matter how much i sleep , stretch , or exercise nothing gets better , i use to operate at higher intelligence and now i suffer with basic logic puzzles . remembering acronyms , etc . i have no idea what is important to tell a doctor .
   (ID: a2ca7f9e05e83928ce894848f01290dbcd0f654e)

16. myself from the past . just to tell my self of the things that i shouldn ' t do
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

17. the way i see it either everything matters or nothing does . it ' s up to you . life it ' s not about where you end up it ' s about getting there that ' s were the beauty is .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

18. something really similar happened to me . a doctor , upon only spending a short time with digit year  old me , decided that i was just slightly above being mentally retarded , that i would never learn , and that i would depend on my parents forever . i reality , i ' m just mildly autistic . now , i ' m a college student in a stem major and life is going pretty well for me , all things considered . i like to think that doctors are usually right , but when they ' re wrong , they ' re very wrong .
   (ID: 17d6f5fb6fdd1b0ceedb5ec118276bdbb72a462f)

19. all of it . i  m about to be digit and every day is surprise . teenage me wouldn  t know how to deal with any of it . or maybe she would have . i don  t know anymore .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

20. sounds like you are unmotivated , depressed , or a pestimest . i enjoy my life . if you really try to enjoy every single minute , you will . i hope you see that soon , living like what you described sucks .
