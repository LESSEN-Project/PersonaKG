1. great video good audio . i have nothing to improve about the video . only the intro is very generic . if i where you i  d make a new one . that  s a little bit more original or maybe skip an intro . still great video . if you go on with this quality you  ll get pretty far with your channel
   (ID: 4ae54d4dcad6354406284af9bc07ffc708ce92a2)

2. great job ! i only got to knowing what actraiser was , and finding the coordinated . i dont have access to anything that can change the contrast , so thanks . does this mean we just have to wait until the second gate open ?

13. hi , i can see that you  re really talented and you played really good if i would change one thing though i would play the original music clip in the corner so everyone who is not an guitar expert and doesn  t know what everything does can look at the original clip and the rest can ignore it because the clip is in the corner
