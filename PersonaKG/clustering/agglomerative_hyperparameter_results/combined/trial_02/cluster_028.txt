1. haha true indeed ! but for me , my nc and bis could do it , it ' d just get tiresome . i might finish the first task and get the supercontainers just to say i did it ! i ' m sure you ' ll get it all done very quickly ! share what you get with the next containers !
   (ID: 9f681f3dedb4dcecbe41b42dada5f72caae05ebe)

2. as we all know each person earth owns digit . digit xboxes . also that other stat is way out .
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

3. i ' ve considered that ' blacking out of the sun ' idea  and unless it ' s yellowstone taking out most of the northern american continent , there would still be coal and nuclear power plants  we can manufacture glow lights . while not pleasant , yes , disruptive , but not exactly " the end "
   (ID: 30506e41c4121e1e7573a25d4985de191de679c9)

4. they don ' t fit my points at all . you shoehorned them in there which i suspect you ' ve done in previous arguments about this . they are not designed to cause harm , they are not so ridiculously easy to do it with that any child or animal or improper cleaning procedure can set them off on me , and it is a lot easier to react to a giant red tank approaching roaring at you at 150mph than a tiny spec flying at 1700mph which is literally impossible .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

5. in about digit years from now
   (ID: e059f82a0624202d909920e56dd76f76efa711d2)

6. fair point . it does seem like they specifically released these few seconds of footage . we need to see the whole fight .
   (ID: 3b00a7fe72d71c6162850ad66e6322e5d78fb79d)

7. im in the middle of all of it since i actively have to secure all my government systems from potential intrusion , they are creating a gargantuan closed loop system for their entire country and sealing them off from the world
   (ID: 41a67e67cad6d49fc85ef1ed0bf4549a04d9e027)

8. tl  dr i ' m pretty sure no one knows what the hell they ' re doing anymore and we ' re all just trying to manage .
   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

9. well . what i ' m trying to say is , niantic could of done something really cool for everyone that showed up and surprised them with something special like a shiny nidoking . next time they have another event advertised for a sticker . no one may show up .
   (ID: a1ba9b657b043ce2934cc0ae7b42c0a0bf3ba2fa)

10. ypu got all digit yet ? how long for one god ?
   (ID: 4a03851d25b2526583af78261bff2af13796094e)

11. so if zellexe is unofficial leader of the yuri fans , what about for the other dokis ? i suppose maybe i  wanna  sex  natsuki for the natsuki fans most recognizable at least . what about for monika and sayori ?
   (ID: 0b52265db13bf8bc27ad36aad94e870706eb6689)

12. why didn ' t they just double the resources ?
   (ID: 6adb1b89bb74c203724e574d02e0735080effe2c)

13. if you take another set forwards . your going to have a bad time .
   (ID: fe118d67d3de6f10ede2239bbfe55c4eff297d7a)

14. i don  t know about your prediction in digit but i  d say at least within digit years for sure . i could be wrong , could be within digit years . we  ll see . but i believe in jesus and his return and there  s a few things that need to happen first but the momentum is gaining .
   (ID: f8dc0ff928f07f3c544894b03ad92f5944e13321)

15. i think what  s happening is now everyone knows about the show so the typical applicant might br madly in desire of their digit minutes rather than madly in love . collateral damage is what worries me . there are people who would do whatever necessary to get on tv etc , when the shows  s over , their spouse and new families might be over too .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

16. as long as we are on earth , chance of things going bad is high not only tech  wise .
   (ID: a168763c82b90dc18ccbbd57533eec2e49d17dc7)

17. religion will always be relevant no matter how smart we become or how advanced our science and technology become because that doesn ' t matter to people who turn to religion as a moral compass . religion provides some sort of hope for those living in hard times as well . obviously , large portions of mainstream religions today are pretty fucked up , but religion changes . so that ' s my answer without resorting to reddit sarcasm and typical " hurr durr religioius people stupid " answers . i ' m not religious , btw
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

18. hmm , i ' m not gonna lie . as a guy who loves the minions , i think this is the dream scenario for me
   (ID: 4e289af5e18133c4578deba659b7e1d2784a925d)

19. i mean it would be a dlc where you travel to a different country but the main game would be in the us
   (ID: 77a6bff8693a174b55d34fc32fdd8a87710fecb7)

20. the end of star wars a new hope . they all get their medals and stand there looking at other for a few minutes and then han says , " hey kid , let ' s get out of these fancy duds and go get a beer or something . " they head to the locker room and then wander around the base looking for a place that sells tacos and coronas .
