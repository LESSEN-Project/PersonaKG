10. gillian , i just loved your performance in bleak house . you were amazing in that . such a subtle heart  breaking character sketch . i thought , " that is the best uk accent i have ever heard an american do . i later found out you lived in the uk as a child and like john barrowman , were pressured to change it when you went to live in the us . which do you feel is your ' natural ' accent or like jb , does the one you use change depending on who you talk to ? do you prefer working in the uk or the us ? i for one really think you ' ve come into your peak since working in the uk . and you ' ve never looked more beautiful . and thank you for being an inspiration to smart , feisty girls around the world . you ' re awesome .
