1. for me it was oregairu , when i first watched i was at a point in my life where i acted very similar to the main character , and i hated that . the main characters actions never did anything but make me dislike the character , when i finally realized how similar i was to the mc i decided i wanted to be more positive and get better at making friends . while now i don ' t have a lot friends , i do have more than i used to and am a generally happy person . i think that if i never watched that show i would be much less happy with who i am now . tl  dr  oregairu made me realize the reason i wasn ' t happy is that i hated the kind of person i was .
