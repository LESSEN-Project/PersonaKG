1. kills me , it was sad as a kid , but that was more or less over ' how sad  mean it was ' listening to it once you can understand it properly is just heartbreaking .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

2. the story does take you to annesburg . as for the focus , i have no idea what chapter it was .
   (ID: 23394798067974e95a922a95c6609d16ca1b11dd)

3. in a way , it contradicts the message they ' re trying to put out because there will always be someone who will read and go " fuck you , now i ' m gonna spoil it for you "
   (ID: 95f6209d0c49920f0309625c4cec2ea88e4ae469)

4. no , not at all . also  professor hulk uses starks version of the infinity gauntlet to bring everyone back , captain america uses mjolnir to fight thanos , captain america finally says avengers assemble , and the combined avengers defeat thanos and his army . also , stark hugs peter when he sees him alive for the first time and peter says " huh , this is nice " . we even get a scene during the time travel sequence where the future captain america fights the past captain america . the captain america from the past says " i can do this all day " and the future captain america says " i know " .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

5. it ' s not really shepard anymore , the shepard ai has much bigger priorities than talking to an old crew now . everyone would think he just died during the crucible firing .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

6. steven was too distracted by his current dilemma of self identity , pretty sure we are going to get a tour of the place like we did with the armory .
   (ID: 9d6cadbef277b68098e82945a77678dbb2a079c6)

7. the way i look at it i thought that was a better idea is doing that would have served digit purposes .  shown shaw which the movie did already that her beliefs were based on a misunderstanding of what actually happened .  thereby showing how hard people to grasp on to an idea that is so completely false . i think it would have played a more centralistic role on attacking christianity ' s " soul . i think this is inevitably why it wasn ' t done in the film . edit wanted to fact check before adding that ridley scott is an atheist i don ' t think the way he portrays religion in his films are meant to be taken as correct somehow .

8. omg wow that was super helpful ! it raised a few questions though . when did we learn about the clown organization ? like i know there are clown themed ghouls but was " clown organization " ever specifically mentioned ? also when i google " iori tokyo ghoul " nothing comes up , so who ' s that ? also when was furuta introduced ? idr him at all . oh and during the rosewald invasion arc someone with black hair turned traitor i think and turned out to be a ghoul and stabbed someone i think ? that was one of the most confusing parts and i just didn ' t recognize anyone in that scene . i can find the specific chapter if you want , but i ' d like to learn their names . also , sorry but i have amazingly poor memory i think i was able to appreciate the original tg cause i read it all in one go , where as i started tg  re back when it was only digit chapters , so could you remind me if shuu died ? i think remember him being thrown out of the building and kanae saving him ? also if yoshimura isn ' t dead where is he ? do we know ? finally , what do we know about aogiri tree besides its members ? like , why does noro have ridiculous healing powers and won ' t attack anyone ? and what the heck is eto ' s deal ? oh and we still don ' t know how  why kaneki was brainwashed , right ? and why he ' s all serious and stuff now ? he was suppressing memories of his mom beating him or something right ? again thanks so much for this lol it ' s a lot more clear .

9. i read what you put at the beginning but if you believe they should ' ve been in the top digit , you could ' ve included them anyway . i just don ' t think there should ' ve been an honorable mention list for intros that are worthy of being in the actual list .
   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

10. i knew that background , but didn ' t realize it was marta ' s loss that inspired it . i wouldn ' t go so far as to say i hate it , but i would say i think it ' s the worst episode of the show . the frequency with which played it while i was in college didn ' t help either .
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

11. it still comes off as creepy . with the amount of sarcasm and various individual beliefs , i ' m not surprised by what anyone says these days .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

12. clearly it didn  t mean it . i  m assuming we all remember how the show ended .
   (ID: a23935a11b1de288af939de6809066afab50fe71)

13. i didn ' t take offense , i did find it to be laughable though , worst marketing move of the year . so far .
   (ID: 95f6209d0c49920f0309625c4cec2ea88e4ae469)

14. no . why would you ? would you read the last chapter of a book if you haven ' t read the rest ?
   (ID: 5147e830e7cfa538d6990a8699ad6462b57cfb52)

15. sending a message is definitely a possibility , i just doubt it will be through time . hopefully we ' ll get some more info on this soon . i don ' t want to discuss fan theories  i just wanted to talk about time travel in general .
   (ID: bb403667518ffc82f0508e3aee8741ea63cec050)

16. i may well give it a watch in that case . i ' d heard that the spoiler made or broke it ?
   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

17. i agree . i originally misread the intention of this post and upvoted it . rescinded that upvote when i understood the intention . granted , i ' m only an occasional watcher of episodes post  season digit , so i don ' t know anything about the lisa stories the user who replied to you before me mentions .
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

18. a lot of people complain about this episode because they think it  s specifically geared to appeal mmj fans . truth is , you don  t have to know about it at all to find the episode entertaining . i thought is was pretty damn funny
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

19. i think everybody should see it one time . one of those movies you wouldn ' t be able to guess the ending in a million years .
   (ID: 7bbefe3c73b49467552610b8dad9354ce8c09cde)

20. first of all , how would time travel " write out " those characters ? i ' m not sure i understand  just need some elaboration . second , " easy " writing usually isn ' t good writing  it ' s lazy and uncreative . the russos are better than that .
