1. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path

2. " riley " i ' m sorry your day turned to shit . the crappy thing about fear is that it isn ' t always rational and when caught off guard it is difficult to act rationally anyway . i had a similar experience a few years ago which helped me decide i was buying a car so i didn ' t have to wait at bus stops and i have the guy half of my land line number and the other half of my cell . to this day i wonder why i didn ' t just say no . or maybe i did and he insisted . i cast it as a lesson learned for the future . sadly he got on the same bus as me and i got got off and doubled back to another route .

3. no one is asking you to change anything other than the way that you look at things . stop blaming other people for your lack of whatever . go out and make it happen
   (ID: 2e747482ae2ee3fe66b8436d9138eb2bba4a7c4f)

4. that ' s ok . we are here for people like you . this is a safe place to be . yourself
   (ID: 237175707a16a7382ac8130de85ed85b63dc9442)

5. it isn  t wise to answer him if don  t know the answer yourself
   (ID: 1306973da0fba9f8c4b839b9163f3f01aacfe98a)

6. i hope you find the love you deserve . you ' re definitely more aware of the fact that fast moving relationships , are enticing at first but maybe not the most rewarding . here ' s to the opportunity for a better chance next time . everything happens for a reason
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

7. throughout my childhood and teenage life , my dad would bash on me and the me i ' m a nobody , i ' ll never amount to anything , to the point where i would believe him and think of myself as nothing , i tried real hard to make him like me , up untill i was digit when i stopped caring . figured it was a lost cause .
   (ID: 95f6209d0c49920f0309625c4cec2ea88e4ae469)

8. there is a whole group of kids who like to mess with me in school . i  m too shy to say anything back though .
   (ID: 54920691b1e05863de734f0444f66749700c4331)

9. perhaps he should prove his dedication to you by demonstrating his willingness to service another man . would an explicit video if him being used in every way by another man get your juices flowing ? maybe more than one man ? maybe he can recruit a male sub for you , and the two of them can perform on skype for your pleasure .
   (ID: 0d77404b10744947bcd2c91d8c926021d4b8650f)

10. m27 . in situations like these where your unsure if you  re potentially crossing a boundary of his morally , it  s important to be willing and open to his feedback . you could start slower and bring up that you  d like him to  punish you  more along the lines of rough sex versus using the sex manipulations you  re thinking about for example . it  s moving in that direction and you can both feel what you  re comfortable with in a more gradual manner . the sex may not end up how you envisioned it or you may realize you like something slightly different , but that  s the fun in experimenting and learning more about each other .
   (ID: e7516540d2045135f43a4a7c61f0bd88856c8ff4)

11. i would say slim . doesn ' t mean he would cheat on you , just that the guy probably doesn ' t believe in marriage as you do . maybe divorced parents ?
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

12. if he is not digit  with you then it is no good for the that you stay together . if he can be coerced into dumping you then it proves that he isn ' t the right guy . i know it seems like a jump into the unknown and it is really scary but for the good of your child and the sake of your sanity you need to move on . it will be hard but it will be better for you . it doesn ' t need to be permanentm he may realise what he has lost and commit to you but he may go to her . either way it ' s better that you aren ' t in the middle of what they have going on because he isn ' t being fair to you .
   (ID: 3f3a13bda2e98055fc23d20ace4e5f76118b56c5)

13. the same thing happened to me . i do believe that there are induviduals who misuse sm and take it too far crossing the line to rape . mine eased me into a light sm world . very light . made me trust him . told me all of these things . then when i was pulling away from him he went from digit  digit and choked me into a submissive state . when you fear for your life and that you won ' t wake back up the next time he chokes you until you pass out , you go into shock . or at least i did . i thought " i can ' t say no because if he doesn ' t get what he wants he will hurt me more " and that was a serious thing for me because i couldn ' t possibly have imagined that he wanted more . but he did . then he went right past sm and straight towards torture and humiliation . all without my consent . he knew exactly what he was doing . he knew from our previous discussions that i never would have allowed that to happen . he also knew me . so he choked me enough to make it happen for him . i ' m sorry you went through all that . sm can be really tricky , my personal experience aside . because i really don ' t have any . but i did do a lot of reading on it after my rape . to help me understand why . it takes a lot of trust . if someone goes against your comfort zones it is not a good sign . a sm shoukd always be respectful no matter what .

14. yeah but i know one that hates him . i was playing brawl , i was light spamming cause i chose orochi to piss people off and there was this kensei , let  s call him xxsaltycheeksxx . salty cheeks , after the first round , sent me a message .  trash  i didn  t really care and i kept light spamming and trying to gank . fast forward after the match . he messages me  y  all are actually trash  then i got on xbox app and started to ramble with him for digit minutes , then we settled a 1v1 . there he played shaolin . i owned him with jj and right after i killed him , he left . then we keep fighting . then at digit  digit , we stopped . yeah someone  s gonna be like tl  dr

15. you  re not an asshole . and , it  s important to note  neither is he . but this subject is a really big deal between couples and you need to keep that in mind . you are young and you don  t need to be in a hurry to make any decisions on this today . but what you do need to do is spend some time with your bf determining whether you are continuing on the same path in life . and it  s okay if the answer right now is ,  i don  t know , let  s keep going and see what happens ,  and it  s okay if it  s  we  re growing in different directions .

17. in texas it cost a couple of  digit to take him to small claims court , then if you want a constable to go seize their property it cost digit or digit more to get that rolling , when you find out they aren ' t there , the constable will tell you he can do nothing , so you want to hire a private investigator ? is a  digit , digit judgment worth paying more than you ' ve already paid to hire a professional ?
   (ID: 4d69affb6415148eda5d5103b282ce15476169d5)

18. this is tough . it changes . when i met my wife it was exciting . not like a roller coaster more like consistently looking forward to the next time we interacted . what would happen next , talking about the future and of course the sexual appeal . butterflies . i knew we would be married one day even though we were in our late teens . i just knew . i didn ' t have " what if " thoughts to dissuade me . it ' s been nearly digit years now married digit . it ' s not excitement now it ' s deep deep caring . what would she think , how does she feel , how can i make it better . how can i ease a burden . she is my best friend . that old question about if you could go back and do it over knowing what you know now always stumps me . could i make different choices and still end up in this relationship ? because if i couldn ' t i wouldn ' t . sorry for the novel .

20. i  m pretty sure my neighbor is into some hardcore drugs as the cops have stopped by quite a few times . weirdest thing is seeing home move next door and being this completely normal dude to now being a crazy drug addict . i remember the first time i met him he was really nice and we talked about music for a while while i was cleaning my car . fast forward to a year or so later , i got home from work late and he was walking by and he tried to shake my hand and wouldn  t let it go as he told me that he was a nymphomaniac .
