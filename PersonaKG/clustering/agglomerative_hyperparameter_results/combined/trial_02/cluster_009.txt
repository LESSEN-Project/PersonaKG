2. not a dad yet few months left ! , just reading through but  you can buy a little gadget that makes a heartbeat sound and put it in the crib  bassinet with them obviously be aware of placement for safety . it always knocked me out as an infant and after mentioning it to my cousin it ' s helped with both of her sons quite a bit . maybe keep an eye out for something similar . i think what i actually had was like this  but my folks just took out the noisemaker part and put that in with me so they didn ' t have any smothering concerns with a blanket . i know that ' s what my cousin did .

3. ask him if there ' s anything he wants you to help him with . i ' m sure his doctors have given him plenty of information . diet and exercise are part of the usual therapy prescribed so maybe you can partner with him on one or both of those . you can ' t force him to do anything and sometimes suggestions aren ' t that welcome but support usually is . if the idea is his .

4. absolutely . you could also create a personal grooming schedule where , for example , each friday morning you wax  shave to his specifications . in fact , a " standard work " schedule where each day of the week you have an assigned task might help you stay focused and occupied . for example , maybe each monday you wash your panties by hand naked of course , tuesday you practice skills naked , wednesday you study the sub culture online , thursday you practice skills again , friday you groom . you can identify whatever regular tasks you think appropriate and schedule them so that you have something to look forward to each day . if your husband likes you could even document your schedule and keep a journal . good luck !

8. the best thing to do is participate with your family throughout the entire process . that is what makes having a family meal together so enjoyable . yes , help set the table . you can serve the food or maybe someone else does that while you or another pours drinks  water . the entire idea is that it is a family gathering and all participate from start to finish . most families find that certain people do certain roles . my mom does the cooking and my dad cleans up , but just last night after the big meal , it was my mom and i cleaning up together while dad was getting an activity we had planned together . we had fun cleaning up together . enjoy being with your family throughout the entire meal and day .
