1. no , they are not flushable . if the box says so , they are lying to try to sell more tampons , though i ' ve ever seen that on a box . tampons are literally designed to plug and soak up liquids , so they do that in the pipes too . " flushable " wipes are not supposed to be flushed either , they do not break down .
   (ID: 32963b268f862205bfe0776470d7730e54b581ec)

2. i  ve been here ! it  s absolutely my favourite place in the entire world . when i found out about it i knew i had to visit . only took me a digit hour drive to get their but it was so worth it . i feel even deeper into my obsession with birds their .
   (ID: 77ab4860c32a7084ca81fd91302df6690ce56731)

3. but that ' s judging , for all you know , he  she couldve been the nicest person you ' ve ever met .
   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

4. i  ve seen this one before but no matter how many times i  d do the wtf factor only increases
   (ID: 6b1a5069121a216d43b11b6d5c61b018eb668aaa)

5. so i ' ve never played multiplayer . how does splitting loot work ? you meet up after you ' ve all done your bounties , then pop open your caches , then what ? do you take what you want from the pile and hope that whoever you ' re playing with doesn ' t hoover everything up ?
   (ID: 063122b93a40a719244d27587193e154f2fed59d)

6. how much of a parody of themselves they ' ve become .
   (ID: ecc98de1e575d7e863a2124b364b8ed586778ba5)

7. employers are required to give you the option to keep your heath insurance after you part ways  you agreed to this health insurance isn ' t like car insurance . you paid your premiums every month while working , it ' s the same after employment separation  monthly  digit for health insurance covering a digit month period is totally unrealistic unless you paid a lump sum to start up your insurance , which i ' ve never heard of you have been paying for insurance coverage you ' ve already received . unless you can provide proof that you were insured by another insurance company during that same previous time period that you paid for after the fact , no , they do not owe you anything . they insured you for that month , you paid for it after . nothing you can do
   (ID: 20ee46767f4f96df6795d9b93f6c4c7be9a56261)

8. people paid you money for a decision you made . no one forced you to make porn . so you do owe fans at least the content they paid and clicked to see . if this sub helps them find it , then that  s what you owe them . if a real actor quits , they don  t get to take down their movies or shut down fan sites that get in the way of them living a normal life or changing career paths . that said , it  s not a big deal to me . i understand you couldn  t hack it and would rather just give up . we  ve all been there with a job . if you ever make a come back , you  ll want the social media infrastructure in place eg this sub . i  ve seen girls quit and come back once they re  discover how hard it is in the real world to make this kinda cash . also , you should know that shutting down a sub is meaningless . another can pop up . and anyone can still google their way to your naked body . what you need to do is file with social security for a name change even if you didn  t use your real name , but especially if you used your real name .
   (ID: cb8cb80756996949fe8fa5c308bb091367a0c6ff)

9. i ' ve lost many a pair of glasses
   (ID: 2bb956084cb9bf79f58345d6cf6beca98e76bbb4)

10. i ' ve been thinking about this for a while and i see something that sticks out heavily . this dude knows about capitalization considering he capitalized after a period . but he starts the paragraph with it lowercase . bes should also be capital because it ' s a proper noun . here ' s what i ' m saying      remember the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog     many of those who fought the mighty god bes have climbed their way from the ground up , pushing their ways to the top of the skies above . they create  great names for themselves , strown across great distances . pushing shouldn ' t be capital either considering it ' s after a comma which does not capitalize words . what do you guys think ?
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)
