19. honestly the best thing for you to do is to tell your boyfriend straight up the entire situation . i don  t think the relationship will last sadly after that because he is straight and he can  t force himself to be attracted to you afterwards , but for your own personal happiness and mental health you need it tell him and transition . but who knows he might still retain attraction to you afterwards , it is a possibility . i know how bad dysphoria can be , my partner is trans and i  ve been with them before and after their transition and they  re much happier now than they were before . i hope you too can remain friends since all that would happen is that he loses attraction . best of luck to you , be brave and you can make it through . i hope all goes well red  heart
