1. here are some of mine  although not particularly scary , still pretty terrifying when you think about it . the " big bounce " theory what it states is that if the big bang occurred from nothing , then there will be no changing factor to make a difference in what is created when it happens . this means that when our universe ends and another is created , it will be created in the exact same way , with the exact same galaxies , planets , species and so on . if this is true , our entire universe is in an endless cycle of creating and destroying itself , and you will be born into every universe , endlessly . reminds me of this quote from the book the wheel of time   the wheel of time turns , and ages come and pass , leaving memories that become legend . legend fades to myth , and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again .  i ' ve read something about a " 4th dimension theory " a while back . ever played 2d games like terraria ? noticed how they cannot see anything besides fron what ' s front and behind of them ? well , it ' s basically the same thing with us . digit dimensional characters can ' t see us , but we can see them because we are digit dimensional . now , imagine if there ' s a 4th dimension . something so foreign to us , we cannot comprehend what it is . imagine if there are 4th dimensional beings who we cannot see or interact with , but they can see us . they ' re always there , watching us without our knowledge . and we can ' t do shit about it because we can ' t see them . and they ' re just sitting there observing and shit . i think that explains the goosebumbs we get when we feel someone is watching us despite being alone . all i ' m saying is , what if god is a 4th dimensional being ? not really a theory , but just thought that has been nagging me for a while . i don ' t know what ' s scarier . the thought that we ' re alone in this universe or not . the thought of a species foreign to us existing somewhere we don ' t know yet is unnerving . or maybe we are alone , floating in an empty vast of dead space . arthur clark once said " either we are alone in the universe or we are not . both are equally terrifying " and here ' s something i thought about while i was high . what if there are humans in other planets ? terrifying thought . i mean shit , the scariest thing that we could find in space would be humans because you ' re not expecting it . i mean , imagine this . you have built the world ' s first most powerful telescope in existence . you ' re alone in your lab and you ' re thinking of testing that shit out because you ' re proud of your accomplishment . you try lenses on and you look up into the sky . you see a planet at the edge of the galaxy and you notice a strange figure standing in a weird looking structure . curious , you adjust the lens and focus , and then bam . there is a human scientist using their own telescope identical to yours and they ' re looking back right at you . what are yours ?

2. he didn ' t make hell . hell is the absence of god . doctor who , of all things , gave a fairly good description .  the space between dimensions . there ' s all sorts of realities around us  different dimensions . billions of parallel universes all stacked up against each other . the void is in between , containing absolutely nothing . imagine that  no light , no dark , no up , no down . no life . no time . without end . my people called it the void , the eternals called it the howling . but some people call it hell .
   (ID: aac80ac9ebef70ab8fe6bc14a8fcccb472099b84)

3. if god dosent like to see us suffer then why does he let us suffer ? i was raised in church but once i got older i realized it wasn  t for me . i know the whole it  s part of god  s plan story but what about starving children or kids being molested ? how could that ever be part of a god  s plan ? i mean no disrespect i  m just voicing my thoughts .
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

4. heaven is everything you ever wanted , a feeling of contentment . hell is all your worst nightmares and fears replaying over and over again for eternity . essentially brazil with more lava and less palm trees .

5. the railroad . yes . after paying the game for the second time , i realize they are extremely isolationist and hates anyone who opposes their idealogy . saving synths does not mean you are the good guy when you hate humans you do not know . and they try so hard that they ignore their current status . standing in a crossfire
   (ID: 2731a84ac27fa3325bd3e2bf989471ffcb1456fe)

6. i hear you . but it ' s not kill you in an instant . that would be fine actually not to get too dark for you  it ' d suck for everyone who cared about you . but for you it ' d be fine . i used to tell myself that when i rode a motorcycle . i ' d either roll cool or get killed in an instant . neither happened . what happened is i got hit . and spent years in and out of the hospital in more pain than i ' d ever imagine so the lesson is  be careful and appreciate what you have . because you could be driving to a family thing and someone in an incoming lane could be texting and bam  heat , euphoria and lots of pain .
   (ID: ae0b5b35ef79984eec810d26abc05e9a757ae0ca)

7. um , sometimes they wake me up . there are times when i ' ll just go through the whole thing , even when it ' s bad . today , i woke up with a heaviness in my chest and shortness of breath from a nightmare that lasted days in dream . sometimes in my dream , i decide to fly . it ' s never super easy to do . i have to really try hard . a lot of times i will just jump really hard to start flying but it takes me a few minutes . i love flying in my dreams even if it takes a while to do . i also like to call my husband , almost like a companion . sometimes he ' s already there . i ' ve never been able to have a companion in a dream till recently and only my husband . now , we get to do a lot of fun and cool stuff . he looks like he does everyday , which is mostly flip  flops , not matter what the dream environment is like . it ' s really fun to watch him hunt off crazed post apocalyptic creatures while he ' s running around in flip flops .

8. cant remember what theyre called but i think you always see them , your brain just edits them out . it stops when on acid which contributes to visuals
   (ID: 37f1dd54cc7fbf9961db909e5dce33ca94dc5b82)

9. yes i can but you will probably make fun of me if i say it . i use my senses . it gets me through a lot of things in life and not just listening to the ' smart ' people that try to get me to believe something that they want me to believe in . when i look around the world i can see that it is flat . i have never ever seen anything with my own eyes that makes me think the earth is round . that ' s why i believe that the earth is flat .

10. nope . you do know the president can just declassify everything he deems fit . if you think mueller is going to pull a fast one on trump , well i ' ve got some magic beans to sell you
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)

11. yeah i agree with you . life is about balance . besides smoking and heavy drugs i do all those things . it ' s just objectively a bad idea .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

12. did you read what you just typed ? if something has low odds and it happens it is generally considered lucky . doesn ' t always have to be , for example , two digit stars to be lucky . edit  yes i ' m aware that you could also be unlucky in this same manner . but i would not consider this to be unlucky .
   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

13. unfortunately , i believe it  s only in fairy tales . i  m sure there are exceptions but not in my experience
   (ID: 47697a08dc01689d8119bf9bd578194eb66d157c)

14. i am inclined to agree with most of what you said , and i ' ll look at the studies , but i suppose it ' s partially what i was trying to say , no drugs are safe , legal or illegal , if done wrong . i tend to indiscriminately tell people not to do the illegal ones though , since they can destroy your life , in fact it can have nothing to do with the drug and everything to do with the social situations illegal drugs tend to put people in . though i ' m sure you know that much too .

15. being able to " always " predict the next digit minutes " accurately " means that an you ' d never be able to change anything , ever . those two terms create a paradox , in that if you do change something , your prediction was no longer accurate . just being able to predict the future would be enough . or adding in " with the ability to change the future " would make it work . otherwise you could predict the future , but you would feel like a slave to life with no control over it . it ' d be like everything is predetermined and you can ' t do anything about it .

16. don ' t do it dude ! i know what you ' re going through , and i know that it ' s horrible ! i ' ve been in the same place that you ' re in . look , you have digit choices in front of you right now , you could jump and fall down to end it , no more pain and suffering , nothing . or , and i know this sounds hard to believe , you could walk over to me and take a look around the corner to find out what else life has in store for you , i mean , it can only go up from here ! what do ya say ? are you willing to give life another chance , with a friend by your side ?

17. against  torture is a great way to get false information . inflict enough suffering on anyone and they ' ll tell you exactly what they think it is you want to here .

20. i had a similar face with lsd , where i just wanted to trip at every occasion . because i never had a single bad experience , only beneficial ones . thsi phase ended after digit or digit months , my mind needed a break and i didn ' t want to trip even when there was a great opportunity . for me the craving for acid feelt different than to any other drug , it wasn ' t like wanting to recreationaly better my mood like with any other drug . it feelt more like having discovered something new , where you can ' t wait for your next time doing it . it feelt like when i got a new video game for christmas as a kid and after an hour , when my parents made me go to bed , i couldn ' t wait to explore it more the next day . but after some time this always stoped , only to be rediscovered years later . the same feeling was attached to lsd after my first spiritual experience . and the same way it got more and more unexciting until i stopped using for a year or so . and this wasn ' t hard to do , it just felt right to stop now . when the spirit of adventure came back i started tripping again . even if lsd helped me a lot to learn about myself like nothing else could even come close . thinking about my usage in honesty is only possible during times of abstinence . your post sounded similar to my concern at times of frequent use and your concerns are important and nothing you should be avoiding , especially when using strong psychedelics . i could understand my frequent lsd use after it ' s ending and also be ok with having those phases because i never feelt my frequent use was damaging . i would even say such phases are welcomed by myself , when they feel right again . do not rely on what i wrote . this surely isn ' t the only reason for somebody using lsd so often . if you think your desire exists because lsd lets you be happy when you feel depressed , confident when you are shy or just lets you be the person you want to be , but aren ' t capable of otherweise . thats how damaging and addictive behaviors start . lsd may not be addictive in the ways other drugs are , but it surely will make you dependent , if used to escape your sober self . i can ' t tell you what ' s best for you , just go with what feels right for you . just be sure to honestly think about your consumption . when you understand your behavior better , it comes easier to stop or continue . since lsd does not have a physically addictive side , the reason for an addiction arises from your mind . stopping or continuing depends on the reason why you are consuming in the first place . but if you are in doubt , its better to take a break . you probably wouldn ' t have asked here if there isn ' t something worrying you about your usage . i can only tell you that i personally say that frequent lsd use , is one of the least damaging drugs , if not pushed beyond what feels good . just take some time to really organize your thoughts , minds and goals . be honest , follow what feels right for you . lsd is exhausting for your mind , some time to think may offer you what you hadn ' t capacity and time to find out during the time of constant tripping .
