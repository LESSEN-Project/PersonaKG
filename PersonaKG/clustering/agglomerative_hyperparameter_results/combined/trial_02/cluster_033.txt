1. are you sure you want leather ? something like the tourmaster is a way sensible . i have the black one , btw , it ' s about as anti  logoey as they get . it ' s a three season jacket all in one . the liners fit easily into a tank bag so i can head out early while it ' s still chilly , strip them out and stow ' em for the hot afternoon riding . there ' s three parts  the mesh outer jacket , a rain liner and a quilted liner . the liners can be used in any combination . i ' ve had more than a few tourmaster over my digit digit  digit decades of riding  this particular jacket is of typically good quality . lists for about  digit but i think i paid closer to  digit .

5. without being able to see your knives and what level of smithing you have achieved its difficult to tell you where to go . if you want to make your knives a bit more artistic you could try making and pop them on the end of your knives . the world is your oyster if you want to start making things like that because you could equally do , or if you are happy rocking out that then you could try and that gives you the chance to try out the many amazing that you can do .

   (ID: 05bc4f6f6f6bb573d85181292f88efbd50c59547)

9. fucking up happens . its okay  if you learn something from it . why not try drawing on yourself instead any time you feel like that ? keep drawing even if it takes up a whole leg or arm . i recommend crayola .
   (ID: 8285a776fd60b145ed2afc145cdf2b926b93ed8b)

13. hi , i hope i ' m not sounding too disdainful , here , but if you ' re only 13k , i guess you have not been playing that much like , not very seriously for several years . are you sure you are dedicated enough to the game to get a go  related tatoo and no regret it later ? that ' s more the kind of things i would expect from dan players . i also have my doubts on what black stones would look like as tatoo just big black dots . but anyway , that ' s none of my business , and i hope you find something that suits you .

14. i laid mine out in chunks like front left  front right , back bottom , back left  right , shoulders , etc . basically , as icreamboy said , plan ahead . also , with the enthusiasm of buying patches , you may end up with some patches from bands you enjoy . then realize you don ' t enjoy them enough to have them stitched to your back . so think about the patch before you put it on , and if it ' s something you will feel comfortable with for a while . sure , you could remove it later , but as said before planning makes a visual difference . i have maybe digit patches that i bought specifically for my vest that , upon laying them all out , i decided against using for one reason or another .
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

15. i have a big faux fur blanket across my bed , and it . is . wonderful . i highly suggest you get one ! and absolutely bring up your like of textures to your partner . it ' s not even remotely strange , easy to accommodate , and makes you happy ! no downside , and no reason to be embarrassed
   (ID: 603a231fe5a5d93e7d1121f6265baf1dcb11f624)

16. your post reminded me of one where a woman responded to someone saying that she really liked the idea of getting a sword , but didn ' t know what she ' d do with it . the responder said that whenever she got dressed up nice to go out , or had a job interview or whatever , she ' d take down the sword and just slowly walk round the house with it , and it gave her a sense of calm and power . you could rock the cape in the same way . sorry i can ' t find the link .
   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

17. do you make these or just post them ? if you make them , how hard is it to make these for the common man ? digit being incredibly hard and digit being not hard at all .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)

18. that sounds neat ! i  ll have to ask my hubby about this . side note  how do you get the tag in blue by your name ?
   (ID: 2ab410cb3dc233b072c65fa9acc3c6323d05914e)

19. can ' t really see the basket for all those flowers but i ' ll take your word for it . seriously though great pic beautiful colours .
   (ID: c9a98f7f4291c6c1eefeeaae838890408881f877)

20. i don ' t mind you asking in the slightest  but i ' m afraid i don ' t have much in the way of a logical reasoning for that particular like  kink  etc .   x200b  most of it probably stems from my own ideas of what driders would be like . i view them as powerful or cunning predators , so there ' s probably quite a bit of power play involved , if i had to make some kind of guess . sure you could get the same kind of power play with a human , but it can be enhanced wildly by a drider and whatever their abilities might entail .   x200b  i also like to think that weaving something out of silk and giving it as a gift would be something deeply personal and intimate for a drider . that doesn ' t really turn me on , mind you , but i find the idea incredibly romantic and something you can ' t really replicate with humans in the same manner .
