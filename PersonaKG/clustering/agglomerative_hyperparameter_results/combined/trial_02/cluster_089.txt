1. nick cage , for being in to many movies .
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

2. i lose a dozen brain cells for every fox news article i attempt to read . don lemon is right . the gop is so desperate for digit to do something positive that when he does the slightest thing that seems correct in the midst of all the bullshit he does  he gets praised like he turned water to wine . a bad person doing a decent thing doesn  t make them a good person . it makes them an opportunist .
   (ID: 60a31a4071ae4962f2a308822d53a634a3760fa1)

3. see the point i just made . what has he done that is so bad that he deserves that much hate ? he hasn ' t done anything other than have an ego and talk about other musicians in a non favorable light . the fact that people think he has apologists is ridiculous . apologists for what ? he hasn ' t done anything .
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

4. what ' s the old saying ignorance doesn ' t make you immune to the law ? that ' s the risk you take for playing in large tribes with people you don ' t know in the future i hope he thinks about it before joining cheaters . also how do you know he didn ' t know ? it ' s easy to feign ignorance so the most efficient way is to blanket ban all members and move on . so good on them .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

5. what  s the crime , 4chan could prove he  s innocent , they did solve a killing after all
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

6. you should see his previous speeches where he essentially generalized the population of mexico as a bunch of rapists , murderers , and thieves . i can ' t figure out the exact reason , but this has to be a smoke screen . someone , somewhere is doing something diabolical , but we ' re fixated on trump and what he will say next . tl  dr illuminaughty touched my body .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

7. just because it ' s his house doesn ' t mean he ' s not an asshole . he gave no mind to his future pil and their dept . he ' s being an irresponsible child . i ' d appreciate it if you gave a counter argument so you can ellaborate you ' re point an important meta you should readhttps
   (ID: 28e24cb71e2c0068fef35890d39022b686e4215d)

8. they say he ' s not really dead eh ? he ' s only got one foot in the grave
   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

9. that ' s true . i ' ve been killed while ducking as well so , you ' re right , he should ' ve been able to kill the gunner at some point even if he had been ducking .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

10. ok i have a query , because something isn ' t right here and before everyone gets all got under the collar , no , i am not a holocaust denier , so keep your poison to yourselves please  why did this guy decide in digit to break into auschwitz to report on events there , when killings didn ' t begin there to any meaningful extent until at least the following year , and the wannsee conference without which auschwitz wouldn ' t have become what it did wasn ' t until digit ? either the dates in the historical record need revisiting or someone is bullshitting us about something . edit  in case i haven ' t made myself clear  the title of this thread mentions " atrocities " but at the time this man is said to have decided to get admitted to auschwitz the atrocities for which the camp later became infamous were still quite some time in the future . so why would he feel the need to do what he did ?
   (ID: 59ebeb8d8fee755bce043a6482743bde8a2a0bb1)

11. this is one of those people new to tf2 who thought they would like to share a video with u , so lower those pitchforks , or just a kid who wants karma , in that case , shower him in downvotes
   (ID: 5a485308ca6e36eb17d7b0fc321fcf7695f3af53)

12. he didn ' t almost collapse a grooming gang trial and it utterly transparent that you only all of a sudden give a shit about the victims because you think it bolsters your point of ' football man bad ' . you didn ' t care about those girls before and you don ' t care about them now and that is precisely why someone like tommy robinson came to prominence .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

13. fuck that . if you actually read the article along with his response you he acknowledged it and apologized for it . not to mention he emphasized personal growth . it  s a joke and i applaud his response  we are in a social atmosphere that reflects witch trials at this point .
   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

14. you guys should have gave him a glass of milk . that stuff kills your high quick which sucks cause i love milk . it ' s his house man he isnt an asshole . i ' ve lived in the ghetto and seen people get sent to the hospital for much less so dont worry , listen to z ro hos an asshole by nature
   (ID: 917dfa16e92ce1db67ec3f88bc07b87b70a36c95)

15. i don ' t know why they even bother when everyone knows that in reality grant robertson is second in command .
   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

16. after reading a lot of mmo forums and seeing a lot of crazy things yes , i do believe he was serious . if you think people don ' t have that viewpoint , you should put aside your own bias .
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

17. xxxtentacion is a bad artist

   (ID: 2a3d0cc7409627207d71d58affd421983020efbe)

19. i ' m not surprised so many people are supporting him  the cognitive dissonance must be a total mindfuck for them . that ' s what religion does , turns people in to mindless sheep . the person i feel most sorry for is the pastor ' s daughter .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)
