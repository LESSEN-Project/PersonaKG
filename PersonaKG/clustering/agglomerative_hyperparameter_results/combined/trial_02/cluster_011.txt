1. when you see a no soliciting sign , that is the easiest sale of the day , the reason they put those signs there , they know that they are suckers and will buy anything . remember pma equals opm , it means positive mental attitude equals other people ' s money .
   (ID: 4d69affb6415148eda5d5103b282ce15476169d5)

   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

3. although apple has obviously found a way to legally enforce its will on the buying public , this is unfair . can you imagine the uproar , if say gm made it illegal to change the tires on a camaro , without their consent ? if i pay for the machine , i should have the right to modify it as i wish . this is another reason i will never buy apple .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

8. when i was a young child , i went to hang out with a rich kid . it was around halloween time and when he offered me some candy , he had the variety bag of candy . you actually got a choice in what you wanted instead of being stuck with one option .
   (ID: ea3b9395602c702397d514c6da7049b089458032)

9. employers are required to give you the option to keep your heath insurance after you part ways  you agreed to this health insurance isn ' t like car insurance . you paid your premiums every month while working , it ' s the same after employment separation  monthly  digit for health insurance covering a digit month period is totally unrealistic unless you paid a lump sum to start up your insurance , which i ' ve never heard of you have been paying for insurance coverage you ' ve already received . unless you can provide proof that you were insured by another insurance company during that same previous time period that you paid for after the fact , no , they do not owe you anything . they insured you for that month , you paid for it after . nothing you can do
   (ID: 20ee46767f4f96df6795d9b93f6c4c7be9a56261)

18. yeah . you work with money and we ' re never trained to spot a fake ? everything from  digit up has a security strip inside that says the denomination on it when you hold it up to the light .
   (ID: 8f7369c6ebb47df350fec663be46dfd8481ee2db)

19. how long until uber just decides to give the police real  time data on us instead of fiddling with our phones ? then , if they can ' t solve a crime they can just pin it on the closest driver at that time , case solved . now that i think about it , nsa and cia probably already have this . unconstitutional you say ? nah , they say ! it ' s for your protection ! it ' s to get the terrorists ! astonished  face
   (ID: 9789fadf3a050c71c64ca7e31c4857fc9094d643)

20. i took this question as what policy the manager should implement for themselves . i have noticed that management only does what the higher ups tell them . there is no leadership . what is lacking in most places are leadership . i ' m not in a good headspace on this topic bc of my current employer lacks leadership especially at the lower levels . our turn over rate is atrocious . i always think of the old army doctrine of " people first , mission always " if you can understand what that requires , then you are on the path to good leadership .
