20. a little bit of humor and sadness combined . my whole family , except my father due to a recent divorce , was sitting around my dog comforting him in his final moments . i was holding his head petting him when he threw up on me . i start saying " ewww " as i ' m balling my eyes out and my entire family just starts laughing and sobbing at the same time . i ' ll never forgot how my dog kept lifting his head up and looking around the room to see if everyone , including my father , was there . he wanted to make sure we were all with him before he passed away . unfortunately my father never showed up even as after we called  texted him to at least come say goodbye . it ' s sad how short their lifespans are . a saying i heard is that dogs have shorter lives because they come into the world know how to love , while people live longer so we can learn how to love . tl  dr  my dog threw up on me as he passed away and kept checking to see if everyone he loved was around .
