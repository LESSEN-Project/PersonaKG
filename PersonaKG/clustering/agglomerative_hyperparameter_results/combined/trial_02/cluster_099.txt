1. i agree . one of the things that i ' ve found is that the adult fiction i ' ve tried , such as lord of the rings and dune , is more about world building than a story . same with video games like skyrim and fallout . and i ' ve tried over and over again to get into world building stories and i just don ' t care for that kind of story . i don ' t care about every little detail of how everything little thing in the world came to be . for me personally that ' s just boring to read about . there are also a couple of mature topics that ruin stories for me because they are too close to issues i ' ve dealt with in real life . when a story gets too dark , it ' s just upsetting to me and not fun or even insightful anymore . so personally , i find when you subtract worldbuilding stories and too dark stories , everything that ' s left in the fantasy genre is " young adult "

2. software quality assurance . please stop blaming us for shitty releases . every bug you find and bitch about we found , hell we found probably ten to hundred more for every one you find . we tried like hell to get it fixed . we raised it as an issue we made sure every one knew about it . our devs probably backed us and asked for time to fix it . some where a product owner was pressured by a sales person , c level , or director to add more features and that bug that is making you angry got deprioratized probably for some feature you will never use or care about . so please be angry be heard let your wrath and rage out , but don ' t blame the qa and devs we are more mad about it then you will ever be and we where over ruled .

3. they aren ' t demanding anything of you . it ' s there for the taking , or you can leave it alone . you actually can choose to not bother with it , you know . it ' s like folks that hate poe that still constantly waste time in it . like , ya ' ll don ' t need to go into that crapfest .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

4. does this sub just steal questions from askreddit ? this is pitiful
   (ID: 80bb9445ee518d7503eeef1b2c418d38a6e936e9)

5. maybe  why the hell do we bother posting for likes etc if karma is just imaginary internet points that don ' t mean anything in the real world ?
   (ID: 3f3a13bda2e98055fc23d20ace4e5f76118b56c5)

6. earning likes can be something people strive for
   (ID: 6b89f03adeaf831281bcca46ec5a469e09e400c0)

7. it depends on the context . squirting a bottle of water on the floor is a waste .
   (ID: b42bcbaed0ea1f011b4d8c42d4ad9df732ecc5d5)

8. this is true i used to watch these videos and they are actually really addictive to watch . luckily i realised what i was getting into and stopped .

9. " if i add these digit emojis , the comic becomes mine even though i added nothing . people will subscribe to my page for more " funny content " , once i get enough ' eyeballs ' on the page , i can then sell the page for megabucks "
   (ID: 808718709a1de9360ade79304c59728079eae812)

10. i think humans are inquisitive by nature , once you get to know something it looses its mystery and you want something new to be facinated by .
   (ID: 37f1dd54cc7fbf9961db909e5dce33ca94dc5b82)

11. I am pre-empting stupid arguments.
   (ID: f7356e924b370675e942b29b9c2184dc895ea5b7)

12. even in this sub . last time some dude stole a pic with the oops tag on it the entire sub ripped on that dude so bad . all memes should have a mark somewhere imo just to give credit where credit is due .
   (ID: 97f042c151ad751b2811d75ae69fd7feae42ed77)

13. doesn ' t the poop emoji exist because the japanese word poop is similar to the word for luck ? like the emoji is for good luck ? it started out as a joke because people thought it was random to have an emoji for poop , but i think people have taken it too far . also , i hate how prevalent gross out humor is , it ' s honestly really annoying .
   (ID: 419b67e0e2cdcb7bd8ea9a89d34d0747a1f5f620)

14. i graduated digit years ago and they ' re still fucking emailing me
   (ID: 5147e830e7cfa538d6990a8699ad6462b57cfb52)

15. agreed , the idea that someone or something created all of this intentionally is kind of saddening . i like the idea that we just show up here do our thing and then we  re done way more than being put here by someone do do things , potentially under their control .
   (ID: c89ddae23e08cef80eb492a534ca8ddb441aa512)

16. look and acknowledge when this bs happens to you and you will understand how annoying it is
   (ID: 41fc1b2c09d5a16a25f120edde55b2a6e2e54e29)

17. critical thinking is the one thing you do not have .
   (ID: 41f8ac05c762907b27cbd358a42fe8a860c399ab)

18. yeah , you know , although i ' m not in their " list " , i feel like . unsafe , because these bastards exist in my country , they probably killed an activist and threatened some others , and the police is just doing nothing to stop them as usually , " you can come when you will be killed , we ' ll consider your report " this bad feeling when you realise so many good people may be killed just because some homophobic assholes decided it ' s funny to murder lgbtq  members
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

19. they were trying to get rid of child porn on their site , but doing a blind generic sweep of just nsfw content with a weak bot didn  t do them any good . porn bits are still around , countless nsfw blogs , and i  m sure there are still pedos lurking on that site . i heard if they had been deleted off tumblr that they migrated to twitter
   (ID: 44eba9a0cf089ec615a77db5d42a2c01b63cb259)

20. ah , i was just told that i was " being a stupid fucking idiot " and my " drunkass needs to pay attention " . i like your friends . they seem nice
