1. i get what you ' re saying . but if we are dealing with such potentially destructive tech , then we owe it to humanity to safeguard it , too . although not perfect , the way the military guards wmds comes to mind .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

2. i think you meant to say ,  would you be harder than dark souls if this were a game ?  . yes , yes i would be .
   (ID: e09cddf2452184c83537d2d4e8a36f0ba7c3fae9)

3. the thing is , i don ' t even mind the talking . what i mind is losing control of geralt during it . why not just let me walk around , stand still , jump or whatever i want to do while a character talks ? if done right , it works so much better
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

4. i agree , though bumblebee is a bit more frustrating due to how tough it can be to properly transform him .
   (ID: 718ff22055f41bd70e24ec98f0898a1526112965)

5. back in my day , ai didn ' t rule us  we were truly free .
   (ID: eca32d278abf2524af02edbb3cc3041ed8b0b880)

6. the first digit harry potter games for pc were good , but after that everything went to shame . can you imagine nintendo making a game about the triwizard tournament ?
   (ID: c378ee827fb7d26c7ea685ec1dc451bf264b0151)

7. i mean then just go solo run nightfall at max handicap or something if you need a bigger challenge . this is just mindless fun for everyone without some crazy grind for a new exotics and gear .
   (ID: a8b3c82ca36eb4e48fd6b6674a642f96d401743e)

8. nothing changed ? what are you talking about ? the defensive meta is gone after all the changes . it ' s not as reliable as before to stay on defense . for honor is in a digit times better place than it was when this year began and there was no way to do damage unless you picked a dlc character and everything was shadowed by timesnap and it felt clunky . sure , they need to optimize conq ' s bashes and some more character , but even if they leave it where it is , it ' s still a fuck ton better than year digit and a little bit into year digit .
   (ID: fc02053133b0aa8d444b95ed56c24999ae82879b)

9. yeah . i still remember doing a stint in a pvp guild and reaching the hall of heroes for the first time . ended up in a digit way tie on the mode where you run the relics , not bragging or anything but they had to spike me down digit times to prevent me from trapping the everloving shit out of the altar . edit  and remember ab ? the amount of bullshit builds i pulled off is amusing . ever seen an e  w with gladiator stance , digit swordsmanship , extra elemental damage to weapon and pbaoe spells ?
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

10. yeah that ' s fair enough , although players like t . brady and sydney crosby actually do do that , it ' s just more difficult for then to build super teams around them . lebron has only been able to carry a shit tier roster to the finals twice in his career , and in this year ' s case a lot has to do with the weak competition in the east . also the commercials , stoppages , and fouls are actually the biggest issue with the nba . the o my reason it seems like the " main theme " is because it ' s them only thing people are responding to . they have no answer for the terrible stoppages , fouls , and commercial breaks .
   (ID: 0264eec5f9f9a43d83f3a82c46341e90961fa3b8)

11. is it really that big a deal to ask to do that in a custom match or with a full party of digit ? i dont normally have much fun when we decided to all go one hero then proceed to get stomped . i don ' t think losing is all that fun and when a good digit  of my matches are that and i get penalized for leaving ? yeah it gets old .
   (ID: 45768598053a5b3cdf1e6e286b99114b7acf5f3c)

12. i came from dark souls and wow . so i guess i have the ability to feel unnaturally high levels of salt and have good team play ?
   (ID: 45768598053a5b3cdf1e6e286b99114b7acf5f3c)

13. having ts on in the back ground shouldn ' t affect the way you play . if it ' s too much trouble , then perhaps a different alliance  corp would be better for you ? fly safe .
   (ID: a911ed792d3b26b115aedaee6218a4a944c38521)

14. yeah , the first week of season digit the planes were just fine to everyone , i didn ' t see a single post about how op it is until the freaking sword was realest . now the sword is gone people want to attack the planes now ? excuse me , what the fuck . i just think people doesn ' t want anything added in season digit if this is the case . whats the point of playing fortnite if you can ' t have fun and keep bitching on how everything added is ' op ' . in conclusion , plz stop this , bring back the sword , and subscribe to pewdiepie .

15. you complaining about free rewards ? it  ll get better and more competitive as you grow within the game . i assume your still very new at swgoh and are clumped with people who are probably not that into it the same way you are .
   (ID: 480f3d8feb42f76cdfa6ea3a1dfffaf98bf91060)

16. your ' e not wrong . me and my friends started playing in season digit and now we basically win digit times out of digit with digit  kills . i can respect why your leaving and almost left as well the only reason i ' m still playing is carrying my friendsnot meaning to flex btw
   (ID: 84a0b9e5d9e0e37c98f992c96c029f6ec99fb1ca)

17. it ' s more than that , there are just so many things in the films that run counter to established in  universe fact and common sense . for example , in the first movie captain pike leaves kirk , a raw cadet who has been suspended because of behavior issues , in command when he leaves the ship to confront the romulans . literally , every other person on the ship  from the lowliest ensign on up  outranks this guy . that ' s not how military organizations work . wtf ? later , scotty transports them back onto the enterprise , and in the next move khan transports himself half way across the galaxy . has no one realized that the ability to transport yourself across the universe negates the need for starships ? they can rework the universe , but they can ' t rework common sense and they sure shouldn ' t tamper with the in  universe science . i am no super fan at all , but this sort of shit is sloppy and it makes me think the producers just don ' t care about their product . like we ' re all a bunch of mindless rubes who will repeatedly rush into the theaters because they hung " star trek " on the front of an otherwise lackluster film . i don ' t need to be pandered to , but i won ' t be disrespected either . if they can ' t get this shit right , maybe they should move on to something else .
   (ID: c3739aee1cfa0a286d1056b5d9225e9d6e4f6547)

18. in what way ? wanting to know what specific thing you think makes it shitty .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

19. leaves party gets gunned down by the rogue for leaving lmao but really , yeah they should have the feature to give someone like digit seconds to leave before also being marked . i enjoy going rogue but i know some of my friends are like you and dont so i won ' t go rogue if i ' m with them , but you never know when you squad up with a rando .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

20. i googled peekers advantage csgo on google , that video and that beginners guide were the only things that really suggeted peekers advantage . in a few other pages some casual people were discussing whether it was a thing . the only argument was latency and interp . there was nothing else . that youtuber whose video you shared only has 70k subscribers . he is not even famous or something . you clearly dont know csgo . there are waaay more famous and way better people . if you knew what you were talking about you would have given a more reliable source . there are numerous youtubers with hundreds of thousands of subscribers as well as many csgo pros . none of them i have watched ever mentioned peekers advantage . i havent even heard once in all those streams i have watched . i didnt even know the term before playing r6s , as a person who followed many of those youtubers and pros . sorry buddy . peekers advantage is a cancer of r6b . we dont have it in csgo . its only theoretical and practically inexistent with all those low latencies and high framerates . judging by the ratings of the comments in our conversation , this r6s community must be so pathetic . csgo is notoriously ct  sided , which means if you hold your angles properly , the defender wins most of the times . dont talk about things you have no idea about .
