12. lol , if you go to the airpods in settings themselves , the a2x models are always 2nd gen , a16x are the old generation . i was myself confused by this too until i checked apple  s website . here in asia , everyone is wearing them and talking to them all the time , not awkward to do likewise at all . did you try talking louder and in continuous voice without too much background noise ? that almost always works for me . if it still doesn  t work , make sure to try to retrain her voice or resetting the id . just by getting into the habit of offloading some of the repetitive tasks to her you  ll def prepare yourself for ios digit and shortcuts automations which i  m sure will become super handy . the user guide in apple books also has some useful tips . don  t give up and keep trying , hope it works out for you as for me it  s been great so far ! smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes
