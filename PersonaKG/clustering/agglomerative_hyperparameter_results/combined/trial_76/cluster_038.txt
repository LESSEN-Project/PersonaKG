Total from this dataset: 74

1. basic self care of hygiene , drinking water , and feeding myself . on a really bad day , just hopping in the shower and washing my face can help a lot . i also watch a lot of stand up comedy and cuddle with my dog . trying to get outside for a walk helps a lot , even if it ' s just to the mailbox and back . i also personally am anti  meds for myself , no criticism for others , but i do take vitamin d because that is the most gentle and natural antidepressant .
   (ID: 022767076c8e9ed224fa7eeaf7db901f4f85512b)

2. they don ' t like me for some reason . almost every single dog gets ready to attack me , barking and showing teeth then ever i go past it . confused owners keep apologising , that their dog never ever does that . so in my place , how can you ?
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

3. why are you always fuckin crying over something ? you ' re a grown ass dog .
   (ID: b4d61ff0c23f7ce5512ee9f64d1bea0f938f262a)

4. i was once dog sitting at a neighbors house the dog is the nicest and most affectionate black lab ever and i made the mistake of sitting in a lawn chair next to the very edge of the porch . the big sweety climbed up into my chair , wanting pets , and before i could get off the chair i was falling . i actually did a back flip in the process and thankfully landed without injury . as i got up the dog was just sitting there , making sure i was okay .
   (ID: 016485853897f1b9f422dd4da7d83e7e4a5261b0)

5. i would hate to be a dog . very limited communication , scary things you don ' t understand happen all the time , not much control over your own life . well , i guess that ' s me already . so why not .
   (ID: c978d968d1c4e9730afc6b7b09cbdd832546a06f)

6. " if you don ' t start taking care of the dog , i ' m going to take care of the dog . with my glock " i would never hurt the dog , but when the only reason he goes in the house is because he isn ' t taken outside , i get frustrated .
   (ID: 306fcce176e83db604dac17838eed1e669cd5a90)

7. this song imo is about descending into dark woods , down through its levels , trying to find your dog , but there are other dogs chasing you , so don ' t get too distracted by the fairy lights and the magic foliage , keep moving .
   (ID: a3c37892d1eb5776c9a4299ce29fc6200c20dd34)

8. this sounds exactly the same for me . it only seems to be other males that have problems with my dog . should i consider neutering him now even though he ' s digit months old ? we have no intention of breeding him , but i always thought that if there were no problems with him being boisterous or aggressive then there was no need to remove them .
   (ID: 03e00c6684f9fe5cb2996bc794372ee9a7a2aea8)

9. i bought one . my dog tends to chew on the handle but not the bristly part .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

10. if you use treat as rewards , try not to let other people just give treats for no reason . i can ' t use small treats with training anymore becuase my roommate was an idiot and would give them to my dog regardless of outcome . had to switch to a new reward system , which isnt fun with corgis because they tend to think they are smarter then us owners .
   (ID: 31d924f098e0871341a799d7a5777fb635f53b34)

11. i ' d shoot my dog , your dog and all of the other dogs in the face if it meant saving life of my partner . kids aren ' t the only thing you can love .
   (ID: 1cedb012c7702cdd6cf28839fd31ce2bb1eea04c)

12. a legitimate reason like that i can totally understand . i even understand the reason why some people have their dog ' s dew claws removed . but i know many people who do it " just because " or to make the dog look more intimidating . selfish reasons like that i don ' t agree with . if it ' s for the health and safety of the dog , i can be onboard with it .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

13. yo my dude , dog . i put you as the creator im supporting . you deserve it for putting so much effort into these things
   (ID: 99a0d4f894a702ab48ff625767398b641f92e3fc)

14. i dont remember where i saw it or how accurate it is but around digit  of dogs dreams are about his owner . so the one who owns a dog to them u mean the world .

   (ID: b7ca8beb99c98a46de3704213b38cdcc44dbb728)

18. i was going to make a comment about how at some point , maybe you should let the dog go , but i can  t believe how well he healed . i should have more faith .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

19. high 90s for dog shit is just pretty blatant , i mean at least some of the movies on the pirate bay have the courtesy to link to the imdb page . i hear netflix does market research there , maybe they could learn a thing or two .
   (ID: f67193f447733f4c17bdaf0f2eab02eb972eb0b4)

20. what do you call a dog with no legs ? it doesn ' t matter what you call it , it ' s not going to come to you anyway .
