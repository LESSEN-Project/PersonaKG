3. that is a deeply reductive line of thought . i don ' t deny the fact that sex is fun . but we live in an age where we no longer have to be slave to our primal impulses . have you read about maslow ' s hierarchy of needs ? you ' re stuck on the lowest level . your biological duty , as you put it , is to procreate , yes . then what ? what is the point of just fucking around if you have no other reason to live ? take it from me , living a shallow existence like that is incredibly unsatisfying .
