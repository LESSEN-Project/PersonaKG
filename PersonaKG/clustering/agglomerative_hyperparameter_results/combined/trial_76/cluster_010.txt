17. the hard candy digit hour wear glamoflauge foundation has definitely been my most favorite recently . i ' ve tried so many different foundations , but the dtay power of this  digit foundation is unbeatable . the only thing i dont like about it is how sticky it feels , but other than that it ' s my all time favorite . favored over  mac studio fx , too faced born this way , collab matte , fitme liquid matte foundation , and some others that i can ' t seem to remember . has anybody here ever heard or tried the hard candy foundation ? would love to hear !
   (ID: 448fa72755c2d77f67b820a9620d09e9d4573816)

18. i found it when i became independent . everyone has their own way of finding their self worth that correlates with their personality , soul , etc . i don  t usually like to think that way , i like to think more like   with all my flaws my ups and downs , it makes me who i am and i love myself for it .  some albums  love yourself  answer , love yourself  tear , and you never walk alone are some albums i highly recommend .

   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

20. star wars was the first sci  fi film i ever watched so i think it will always hold a special place in my heart . even though i adore and can speak about it for hours on end , i will admit it  s terribly flawed ahaha . i detest episode digit and hated rogue one but even in saying that , i still can  t take my eyes off the screen . maybe it  s the gross use of cgi in episodes digit  digit and jar jar binks  existence that ruined star wars for many , but i have such an admiration for george lucas and his space opera that i can  t help but love it . after having read a biography about george lucas , i think began to appreciate star wars even more after reading about the tremendous work that went into making it . i also just love the cast in general , i really think that mark hamill has such a sincerity in his character and princess leia and carrie fisher are both inspirations of mine so i think in that way i find the films endearing . so yeah , i could , as i said , go on for longer giving a more in depth reasoning as to what makes star wars something i could ramble on about , but hopefully this is a sufficient answer ahaha .
