   (ID: 726d5aaac9472ccdcb64345cd6d082bee4eae6fa)

2. there is a breech of trust when incest happens . family members are some of the only people in life who you should feel completely sure don ' t want to be around you just so they can fuck you . if you take that away , ultimately you will miss the feeling of being around people you know don ' t find you sexually compatible , but still like you anyway .
   (ID: d54a04c3eba52404f5dd7abb0e459a949dbc7f93)

3. do people count as objects ? cos i ' d have my gf turn invisible . naked all the time chilling round the house . you feel your way through the dark and whoops that ' s a tiddy . its perfection .
   (ID: f6b8978c4b660719e17dff38ba86c988b9bf86f5)

4. i don ' t understand the love for babies . they are such hard work and not at all fun or cute to me yes i ' m a mom and still feel this way . i get a icky feeling around people who have baby fever just oozing out of them . maybe this is super harsh to say , but i feel like there ' s something wrong with people like that who need to have this thing baby rely on them and need them to do everything for them . i love love love seeing my son get more independent every year and don ' t long for another baby whatsoever . buh  bye baby stage forever !
   (ID: e707e3b97faf5ee7a6bc4fac3f1e296e163b3c89)

   (ID: 841a375b464a5650f1c027d1c7ae73415228c6ab)

   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

   (ID: f7394472a82dca87877dd18a5a3cb4d3524a8623)

10. what ' s the worst that could happen ? someone yells at you ? you freeze up and don ' t know what to say or you stutter a bit ? it ' s just talking to someone on the phone about politics . you want a political revolution , you want democracy to return to america ? well talking about politics is where that begins . seriously , i suck at talking on the phone . i ' ve done the stuttering and saying something dumb loads of times and i feel like an idiot but it ' s really not that bad . you can do it !
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

11. yeah this is bad man . very bad . that ' s emotional cheating . it ' s legitimate cheating . you ' ve known for a while that your wife loves attention from men . this is problematic . i think the best solution is separation and possibly divorce . you said it yourself , you feel like the bond that you had with her has been broken . don ' t think twice about it because christmas is around the corner . your wife is a cheater . she requires validation from other men that aren ' t her husband . you were there every night after work for her when you were newlyweds . it ' s never good enough for her . you deserve better , op .
   (ID: 8f33db98a9fa29c8f9e44012d79de72291a29519)

12. why do we feel ? why do we see things the way we do ? is this all made up ? was it made up by me or by someone else bc they felt bad ?
   (ID: c50479206ad2428ecdc02592a82261c4f2ae30a5)

13. how tall are you eh ? you ' re probably gonna get some comments saying go work out and gain some muscle . if you wanna , you should but dont feel obligated to do so . being slender is good too .
   (ID: 89e76efb1868896fe46bffbc2c10d965b53857d1)

14. my time with my three older brothers . with two of them on opposite sides of the country and one in college , i just want those good old days of consequence  free video game binges , lego city projects , and k ' nex machine building . now i just feel alone sometimes because i get the feeling they don ' t miss it all as much as i do .
   (ID: 37aa751f14bbf132fc2f76d2c2c79142318c3e31)

15. at times it can be difficult , but i would say digit percent of your time is just getting people out having a good time . its not for everyone but most people would love it . i find my week is never the same doing all  sorts of different things , and you feel like your actually working for a reason not just to make money for someone else .
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

16. yeah . i feel as much , though my friends think i passed up a fairly likely opportunity .
   (ID: 75ca79d6c5cfc50533ff56cde25edfb593ae8568)

17. ah man i feel you . there would always be someone from my guild nagging to me about stuff . now i get you can take a game seriously , and i respect that . but by annoying me about it and being the little shit i am , i will do everything to just annoy the fuck out of you .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

18. let me rephrase . a good person is someone who does good things for other people without expecting those people to reward them . you can feel good all you want .
   (ID: 4bb0a21212688dbc67fe64d6f42fca297fed4f4f)

19. the second trailer was better than the first by far . i think many can agree . i didn ' t get a " cod clone " feel at all from it and still wasn ' t impressed . that ' s cool you ' re hyped for it .
   (ID: ed8c4bb1975edb0f627baa6dac44e74cbc7237c6)

20. it  s harder to find faithful guys than to find unfaithful guys . as a guy i see it all the time where the deepest secrets of my closest friends involve them cheating on their wives or girlfriends regardless of how deep in love they seem to be . i have a friend who loves his wife and daughter with his whole life , even a family man who you would never expect can have some dark dark secret that can only be told to digit or maybe digit of his bestest best friends over a beer and a campfire . every time , they try to justify it in their heads with some kind of nonsense like  were gonna die one day  or  i was drunk  or  how could i pass it up  it  s a scary world for women to try and find a man that they can even feel like they can trust
