1. whoa , am i ? i had no idea ! thanks for pointing that out ! so , what ' s your deal ? lonely and need some company , so you shit on my reply without knowing anything ? just saying i ' m a piece of shit and am self centered ? i can keep responding if you do . work is slow .
   (ID: a85910e837bd841373d8a7b2a84f1bff22807d9e)

2. the work they  re doing here is all hocus pocus ! they  re magicians ! it  s all a conspiracy ! they think their so smart with their degrees in chemistry , but it  s all bs ! believe me !
   (ID: f296ca909e75f5e7a28f054f4937f3c6eccb6a56)

3. if you are a kid getting out of school it is the greatest thing in the world . if you are an adult trying to get to work . not so much .
   (ID: 0f3da013abe745c83b2d4eb042abb7fd28f5e872)

4. i still have to work for another fucking digit hours . it ' s torture
   (ID: 9ee9d24ef531902c3436e80a94ec700625d655c6)

5. then they lied to you , mate . it is literally illegal to fire someone for an injury . in fact the employer is legally obligated to pay sick leave .   the only way they would be sent home would be if they were illegal immigrants and have no contract . lots of them are brought in as independent contractor and they are cut loose pretty much whenever .   and it does reward the hard working , but you also need to be smart and work with the proper papers . just look around you and see the massive number of people improving their living conditions . as i said again . if it rewards the hard  working then migrant farm workers should be rich as fuck . but it doesn ' t . it works the people who are working in the right industry with absolutely no correlation to how hard they work . especially relative to those outside of that industry who work hard .  can you name another structure with this rate of growth ? go ahead . what is growth have anything to do with it ? i have not said anything about growth . i am simply pointing out that it is a myth that capitalism rewards the hard  working .
   (ID: 080f9c13731c22b3fdaccc4ff9cd4e4e27810ae0)

6. manipulate the target by giving him cigarettes that were tampered with and then tell the target to quit smoking . it ' s hard work micromanaging a grown mans life for him but someone has to do it . especially when you already ruined him financially , he ' s your problem now i guess .
   (ID: 50043497a219924fd275a92e5dadb6e04bac5936)

7. i experience this even now . i think it ' s fine to think every now and then about your situation . it would be impossible to never think about it , but don ' t stay focused on it for a lengthy period , it ' s unhealthy . when i had a job in retail i caught the train home every night . friday and saturday nights were almost unbearable . watching groups of people your age socialize and have fun hurt bad because it would remind me how i ' ll never be able to experience it for myself . you can still find some people to hang around with , maybe from work or education . but i think we should agree that looking forward is the best thing to do
   (ID: 6f44a04a8b717b1f28e50b97f8c5e8608d598324)

8. next time you want to talk shit on me , remember my position in life and remember yours . i ' m not some druggy piece of shit mf , i ' m a fucking united states marine . a title you will never claim . i ' ve worked harder in the past digit weeks then you ever will in your life . i have matured , learned , and taught myself how to be independent while you ' re still living on your parents paychecks . i make my own money , i pay my own bills , i work on a fucking osprey while you can ' t even get a job at mcdonalds . don ' t ever try to talk down to me again because you were once above me because i will do nothing but strive to be on top and be better then the person i was yesterday . i ' ve worked to hard and felt too much pain in my life for you to try and say you ' re better than me . gtgo .
   (ID: ac16118040bd30364df28924a08320a2668f71ae)

9. i ' m guessing you mean romantic  sexually  because i hope it is apparent that rejecting anybody in social or professional situations where anybody else would be accepted because they ' re trans is transphobic . so intimately , it ' s not transphobic . as a transperson , i would not expect anybody to change how i make them feel about an intimate connection and intimate communication . if we ' re not on the same wavelength i would need to know , because it ' s not going to work at that level and that ' s okay .
   (ID: 03d15a94c7d0f2138a5e5c0cf7e503c341abbf78)

10. so how does the story work , do you discover it as you go ? also on a scale from one to ten how scary is iti like scary stuff .
   (ID: 44fcad24bd49ddab531e69f488ff2b51870c6274)

11. if you are trying to make witty comments , wear shirts that look nice , and make eye contact with other people at work , that is called socializing . if you are intimately touching , kissing , or attempting to see this person outside of work or work related functions then you are crossing a line . reassure your boyfriend about your attraction to him by telling and showing him . tell him gently and lovingly that he has no reason not to trust you , and you hope he can figure out a way to do that . then let him work on his trust issues . you are not in charge of his emotions . if he can ' t learn to trust you , a relationship evaluation is in order .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

12. that  s a lot of guys ! why did it take so long to work ?
   (ID: 472de55a2855849453179c0ccb5234c4ea9d1192)

13. i made a little clip . yes i know it ' s embarrassing . yes i am aware i have lots to work on .   x200b
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

14. may they never have properly working headphones . one side will never work , no matter how many they buy .
   (ID: f5639f88927d467b89189ab179bb30d8a5705552)

15. i had stitchfix for a few months . i have a short torso and long legs , so some of the proportions didn ' t really work out for me . my stylist rotated every month even if i requested the same one . i kept a few cute pieces , but i decided after a few months that i prefer to pick things out i know i ' ll love !
   (ID: f179711c18514780c1b0257643d893ef1cf5a081)

16. walt is now a man with nothing to lose . i can see him sending the family away using saul ' s vacuum " cleaner " salesman , putting the ol ' black pork pie hat back on , and grabbing his . digit snub and going to work .
   (ID: 8d969746b3d4e6e130957387edb6a2fef0ec54cf)

17. humiliating me and a select few others every day . god , i hated tuesday ' s because i had to spend an hour with him . he purposely did it , just have a conversation with us in front of the class , telling each of us how we will fail the course and laughing at us from time to time . it got to the point halfway through the year where one of the girls told us to meet and instructed us to work and get the assignments done before anyone else . we all did it , yet we got ridiculed for apparently not putting enough effort in and rushing the work . we didn ' t have the worst grades of the class either one of us did , which is understandable because the teacher ' s an ass . come parent ' s evening , he starts telling my parents about how gifted i am but it ' s not reflecting in my work . i specifically remember him using the word " gifted " . not nice of him at all . you want to call a student names and belittle him , fine . but keep up that energy when in front of my parents . asked the others if they had the same thing happen to them during parent ' s evening too . all he really did was give the other students ammunition to bully us even more . he knew it too . felt really bad . not a good teacher . yes , i did report him , but the outcome of that made me immediately regret reporting him .
   (ID: 6f44a04a8b717b1f28e50b97f8c5e8608d598324)

18. its all about about perceived status . people like believe if the pay someone for a service then it somehow places them in a position of authority over them . i work in the service industry and deal with this all the time . mostly from the housewife crowd .
   (ID: 79e5228419de270c01297915dbce56be0063c52b)

19. i have the opportunity to make people  s days every day i work , and i  ve done it so many times . a lot of them don  t tell my boss or anyone else i work with so i get the enjoyment from it . but it does happen
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

20. admitting there is a problem is hard . fixing it even harder . your kids are likely in school full time . perhaps there is a way that you can find an after school program instead of a daycare . or , a dayhome . an hour or two in the afternoons probably won ' t affect your children negatively as a they are more connected to you by this age and can identify right from wrong and tell you , and b an after school program is guided by professional people and c less costly than full time care . i am a mom to a half day kindergartener digit and a digit mornings a week preschooler digit . i would need to find evening or weekend work to save myself from childcare costs being enormous , so i choose to wait until they are schooled full time . do you have any flexibility with your job ? perhaps you could drop off and pick up and return to work if necessary when she returns home . i ' m getting off track . i can ' t think of anything you ' re doing that isn ' t gentle , kind or thoughtful and coming from a place of love . i know my husband works long hours for our benefit and i appreciate the hell out of him for it . you are a good person and it sounds like she does need help in the form of a doctor or counselling for ppd . just keep coming from a place of love when you tell her you miss your partner in crime and that you want her to be happy , and all that growing old together stuff . i would beg and plead with my husband to come to counselling with me if i thought he needed it , but if that ' s likely to make her angry i just don ' t know . maybe if you guys are close with her family you can discreetly discuss with a trusted family member that you are worried . maybe they are worried too .
