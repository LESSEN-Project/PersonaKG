2. it truly seems that all you can do is talk and listen and maybe give advice . if it gets worse , which from what you have said it may , try to get in touch with her mother just in case . another idea is if she has friends in her school , close friends , get in touch with them and if needed prepare for the worst case scenario . it will be easy for you to keep a close ish eye on her with how much you say the two of you talk and that will make it easier for you to assess her mental condition . and if the worst case scenario of another attempt does happen you need to make sure that a before then you should if you can find the phone number for their local police  ambulance . and if it helps i ' m pretty sure the crisis hotline number is digit  digit  digit  digit . i wish you luck in your endeavors my friend . pm me if you need any more help .

   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

12. not sure if you ' re being sarcastic or not , but it was just a question . i searched around and couldn ' t find much except what has already been mentioned . i figured i would ask the reddit community for their input . also i play on console , i don ' t think there are too many hacks out there to increase my magicka , but thank you for your suggestion .
   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

   (ID: abffa241a0eb33d4cf220980872adc9a148514b4)

17. not sure , honestly . although i ' m not sure it needs to be changed . a big theme on reddit is the idea that people should learn to recognize when they can just google something , instead of filling comment sections with those simple  answer questions . otherwise , there are subreddits like askscience that can take care of some of the more specific question types . i think askreddit could certainly benefit from linking to those alternate subreddits in the third rule though .

18. telemarketer . if they can sell well , it would be pretty simple to have a low level secretary scan the approved calls and type out the critical information . consulting , if they have extensive previous experience in a field , reviewing projects can be quite valuable . public speaking . people will hire him to talk about how he overcame is hardship even though he only overcame it because people are willing to pay to see him talk about overcoming it . kind of a self fulfilling prophecy all for the entertainment of others by capitalizing on his disability . basically a modern day freak show with better pay , to put it in less politically correct terms i am sure there are other jobs that can be handled depending on exactly his level of disability . does he have any slight motion in extremities ? has he learned any systems for people with his disability like eye tracking or other controls like head or breathing based or speech based computer controls ?
   (ID: b650c9c531ec58d468c7c1fc9b7083efc4cbca9c)

19. are you sure you ' re not jealous of the time they ' re spending together or something ? seems really weird to be all upset about this , obviously if the kid was upset she ' d say something .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

20. maybe he was checking that you have proof of sufficient amount of money to sustain yourself while staying in that country , aren ' t a lot of european countries pretty strict with that sort of thing ?
