1. no problem , and i hope this post is a troll since it  s crazy to think someone is out there with this big of an ego to think charging digit . 5k for something many people do for cheaper is a smart idea .
   (ID: 54e4be73496ef57ba1185fa38044d64a8e868ba8)

2. really fucking hope that brute  forcing through stuff like this doesn ' t make depression worse . because that ' s how i get things done these days .
   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

3. i mean if he thinks he deserves higher wages and can get it elsewhere he just might . plus we don  t know how well mahrez will play in our system . it  s in the realm of possibility . maybe unlikely at the moment , but i hope to have this set of attackers for years to come . barring when aguero goes back to independiente
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

4. never have i been affected by anyone wishing me a merry christmas  i actually feel happy and welcome . to be honest , i have grown up with many muslims around me , and i didn  t hear once that someone got offended from this . i wish you a merry christmas , and hope this season brings you happiness and love .
   (ID: 011a531fc3f706d76441a0f95cc8091fd4453dd8)

5. honestly i suffered from retroactive jealousy for a while myself , there ' s not much you can do except hope he comes to terms with his issues , try to do some research on how you can help him .
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

6. what an actual asshole . hope he  s not in your life anymore .
   (ID: 9d6763f3caa1ca2559f1a3c525c70ffea81a61c2)

7. it ' s cnn . i ' m not sure i trust it but i hope it ' s not real .
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

8. that ' s understandable , i ' m sure the pain and study are more than hard enough to deal with without him making matters worse for you . i hope you can see someone helpful soon !
   (ID: 8b7590cb8502d6abd38b320b842aa7642186b6d8)

9. killed someone over  digit . how stupid can a person be ? hope they don  t let this guy out
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

10. there ' s someone for everyone  they ' re out they ' re waiting you and all other shitty variations to give people false hope . to me it ' s better to think " if it happens , it happens "
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

11. i hope you ' ll one day be able to see past this and get through it , and that the non  suffering times get longer for you .
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

12. know what they learned ? to find a way and get a piece of their own in the event that it happens with someone else . hope they get these guys .
   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

13. i will ! the worst part about buying a new one would be making sure it isn ' t a bootleg . so i hope the current expac just needs a cleaning ! wow , i didn ' t know that about watermelon ! i had a pink room at the time so i think my parents just wanted it to match lol . definitely keeping a closer eye on it now . regarding the edit , i never thought about that ! if i really cant get the watermelon to work then i will be sure to ask for pictures . it ' s so hard to know what to trust online !
   (ID: 43a6fe9c16d7a48abeb6832518a650a445974a7e)

14. why so many shootings ? who is the shooter ? i hope you are safe . i have to be near usbc .
   (ID: 18cbf1c145fcc3d10b99255dd1de8fb616ecb38f)

15. hey vegans ! i have a question that i hope you can answer . can you hide a subreddit from ever showing up in your feed ever again ?
   (ID: 37aa751f14bbf132fc2f76d2c2c79142318c3e31)

16. oh my god   x200b  i hope james is in a better place now and that you are doing ok . this is so sad . who ' s with doggo now ? are you doing ok ?
   (ID: 18cbf1c145fcc3d10b99255dd1de8fb616ecb38f)

17. their goal is survival of the regime beyond all else , killing the us president and killing thousands of south koreans would not be useful for that purpose . it ' s likely that they would only use artillery  nuclear weapons when they feel there is no hope of survival for the regime .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

18. oh i can help with this , too !  the joke is that usually people say  until i reached the age of digit  or whatever . so george carlin is setting up the expectation of a simple statement i was catholic until this particular age but then changes it to suggest that reasonable people aren  t catholic . the surprising change of direction , combined with the implication about catholicism , make this a joke instead of a simple statement . i hope that  s helpful !
   (ID: 9414b9913220ebe2601862e3001aac74ebcffe33)

19. think of that child is came again with smiles on his faces to just be with you . don ' t be sad your lucky to have it now past is gone , future who knows it . live in present . i hope it will feel u better now .
   (ID: 2fa786bde9d7f9b2d3a93476f3298d77041fdb1e)

20. fuck me ! i really hope he was actually doing something else in the video to warrant this . either way it ' s definitely a political thing trying to look good to the muslim community . bet you after awhile they will drop charges while under the radar .
