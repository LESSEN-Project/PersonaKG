   (ID: de0709ad19c458ffff0b96aab8fcfa9c40b24603)

8. i would wish to instinctively know exactly what to do or say in any situation to achieve the exact outcome i desire . a bottomless wallet that would always contain the exact amount of money i would need to pay for whatever i am currently buying . i can ' t think of what a third wish would be , but i ' m sure i ' d come up with it after my first wish is granted .
   (ID: 4ce6edbd86b6936a31b902056e0708d563c2b4bb)

9. the reason the different categories exist is because some pets they don ' t have the time or interest in making the necessary animations for them to overrides , every pet that they don ' t make the animations for become followers instead . i do wish they ' d stop releasing new pets as followers because they ' re universally ignored if they can ' t be used for overrides , but hey they ' re a lot cheaper to produce and pad out the content so jagex likes them .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

10. i ' m pretty sure that living out of one room in your family home would be stressful for any couple . what may seem like lack of affection could be frustration at your situation . i wish you the best , and hope that your luck and relations improve .

12. exactly . i ' d never go through with it . i wish she would tell her mom or someone about what happened but her mom needs the child support she gets from him . it ' s just so fucked up she has to see him and he really wants to meet me but there ' s no way in hell i ' m getting close to the fucker .
   (ID: d3bac57ba3f5572800e9732b3d2159f8a3fcbfdc)

13. i thank you for you share , if you don  t mind , my opinion is that you hop off the medication . you did what you had to do for the greatest good . everything that happens has positive and negative outcomes and there  s always going to be someone that cause them , if it was you or anyone else it would  ve still happened . gladly here , the good heavily outweighed the bad . don  t blame yourself . things had to be done and time will pass , i wish you the best .
   (ID: a77a8bcaa391d8b6584d32e6ad243e71297d7258)

14. i wish a man would make eye contact with me and flirt with me to start a convo . fuck internet dating bullshit . however , i will always feel scared when walking in front of a man at night . guess i ' ve watched too much rape porn .
   (ID: 91dc65ba6eef536f17becface16989de7f988dce)

15. are we gonna get sane or not ? the wait is killing me . having said that , we need digit  digit more signings to be competitive and for squad depth . our squad as a whole is very poor in depth . we lost robbery , james , hummels , rafinha over the summer and have added just lucas and pavard so far . plus our backline is still not very convincing if you ask me , and roca would be ideal to shield the defence . i wish we had gotten idrissa gueye who is pl proven but it is too late now .
   (ID: 798fc9f22ec2a1c21f6d387916d4d56336b802ef)

   (ID: ca13e283de9a99b9eb1cf4f68eed33eccff74e35)

17. if your on console try not to focus on building the onyl way you will beat pc players is by outgunning them . just focus on improving your aim , that ' s your best bet . i know there was some console fortnite player in season digit that was clapping everybody because he would just get close to them and never miss a one pump i wish i could remember his youtube
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

20. i agree with all of that . i take every minute of comp time and vacation time . unfortunately my basic job description is physical presence . i wish i had the ability to take care of business as quick as i could and then be home but it ' s not in the cards for me right now . at least these raffles pass the time .
