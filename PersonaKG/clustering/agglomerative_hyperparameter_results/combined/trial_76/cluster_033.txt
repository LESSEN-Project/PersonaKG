8. with people i know it ' s behavior because i can see it . there ' s nothing that applies overall , it ' s been specific to each couple and the individuals involved . with celebrities it has to be intuition , maybe with a dash of " no duh " thrown for the more obvious ones . the one i felt awful about was chris pratt and anna faris . they were so cute as a couple to me and then one day i random thought they didn ' t seem right together any more . i felt so bad for thinking that . within a couple months they announced their separation . come to think of it i saw amy grant and her ex husband perform together once and knew immediately that they were doomed . that was before i knew to keep those thought to myself and got an earful from the one person i mentioned it to .

10. not a worker , but the lady behind me got upset about the bill she got over  digit and thought that she could refund it by puking it up back on to her plate . she got even more upset when they wouldn ' t accept it , and started to trash everything ! of course , they had to call security to get her out . by far the weirdest , but funniest thing i ' ve ever seen !
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

11. if someone is unaware that you speak their language , they might let slip important information in front of you that they thought you wouldn ' t understand . it ' s just him doing anything to have an edge .
   (ID: 81d70b67b241a70f23e355cf7b40f5e937ce7cb9)

12. true at the time i didn ' t connect it , but afterwards i thought the same thing . he sort of just disappeared . the only other person i could think of being " the american " would be brenner , but i have my doubts about that .

   (ID: 9057da1059e9ffba54ce02d4a15e2aac2b3ceabb)

16. as he stated it ' s a timeloop but would mean its like ground hog day except its in years i thought thst with time if you left your spot you ended thst line and then creates a new parallel universe
   (ID: da770212ea31887c4be30925213eff0dc5d8687b)

17. more people would do it if more people thought about buying and hanging mistletoe . but we don ' t have time for that because we would prefer to waste away , eat , and watch charlie brown .
   (ID: 6cb8904cf2faf74f712ddb1c620007fe43bf46df)

18. this is a guy who woke up that morning and thought   what is the most pointlessly dangerous thing i can do today ? yep , i will carry a heavy , sharp object , balanced precariously on one arm through the town centre . and yes , i will angle the corners to maximise soft tissue damage .  fucking retard .
   (ID: ed9fd9ff218602605c7fbdf8f02f658604680c61)

19. it was my first rda too but i now have several more . it is really the best though , i only use the other ones when i want to do flavor comparisons without having to re  wick . i never thought i would be a cloud chaser but it sure is fun to get some dense fog going with the mxv4 , and the flavor is really great as well .
   (ID: 6778aa4e3cf401044823c475db231fc0b1d0ff4b)

20. while i will admit it is pointless , no one spawned anything . i simply have digit weeks left on a server rental and thought i would share . my apologies for the behavior of anyone online .
