1. please find a candy cane to put with it . you  ll have the shaft and balls . a pepperdick
   (ID: 18e18998471794de2ee0ded08a5f57a45a336e24)

2. google  . we know what you are looking for but we ' ll show you what we want you to see instead
   (ID: d06e7949138d7c04b968c15f3dd6f37d07c5a670)

3. because if you ' re older it ' ll determine how pointless this whole argument is . older people are more likely to argue vehemently than younger people .
   (ID: 718ff22055f41bd70e24ec98f0898a1526112965)

4. anywhere . i don  t like being touched at all . i  ll do a hug if i  m close enough with you but unless you are dating me , do not touch me
   (ID: 4e784da799782c45d8883de53e87a533129a3b8e)

5. when i saw her appear on the news i instantly thought " fucking useless " . i honestly don ' t have any animosity to her , barely knew she existed before all this , but now she ' ll always be " fucking useless " to me .
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

6. thank you i ' ll look it up ! and i suppose you ' re right , the only way of really finding out is by trying it out myself .
   (ID: 2971f819c4d7400b9fa7806434e9037b6af4dfae)

7. nah i ' ll blend it and drink it
   (ID: 4dbd3fd527caa93836f895d72dfef9276ea4809f)

8. thanks for taking the blow for us , i ' ll never forget the hero that saved me from spoilers . i ' m going to tell these heroic story in front of everyone . i salute you sir
   (ID: 6b8a83db666de3b1a44e69862b384efc9e8eaad7)

9. i mentioned star wars and disney in another comment in this thread 6hours ago , i didn ' t ' go ' from anything . it ' s always been a part of my point . marvel ' s going because of disney  . disney  has star wars and disney films . which means netflix won ' t have any of that . that ' s a serious dent in their offering . marvel is a part of that , and it is still a big draw . many people thought of netflix as the home of good superhero shows and now they ' ll have none . you don ' t think that will have any effect ?
   (ID: fbb82e5b963aa1cda25276df6c0968b4b03a3aa0)

10. i ' ll let you know when it happens .
   (ID: 920ba0628cbea5588ecca4c8ba7f80b411ff70ef)

11. that is just too random . i mean , the caves themselves seem huge , no matter how far , i still see areas of darkness . so i ' ll try and fully explore the area , i guess . i don ' t want to die and respawn , since i mined up lots of ore .
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

12. you complaining about free rewards ? it  ll get better and more competitive as you grow within the game . i assume your still very new at swgoh and are clumped with people who are probably not that into it the same way you are .
   (ID: 480f3d8feb42f76cdfa6ea3a1dfffaf98bf91060)

13. i ' ll just grab a full plate and take it to my room everytime we ' re having dinner
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

14. in my experience , it usually means that their friends are just the type to do that sort of thing and it has very little to do with attractiveness , and they usually do it because they know the other person will do it back . some people just won  t do it because they think it  ll make you uncomfortable . it just depends on you and your friends personality , really .
   (ID: fa9acab3fbd86b1f64e6380ef31b49912dae0c74)

15. i ' ll bet you anything that they don ' t do twitchcon with this patch . if for none of the major flaws it will be because the extra character models in the zombies make the game super laggy . i ' ve been watching some streamers doing scrims tonight and that ' s their biggest complaint
   (ID: b30983a02e6c6ad80a50a521eee441b9f454a5e9)

16. ok i ' ll search for it . if i ' m wrong i ' ll admit it . my first impression is skeptical because of the history the us has as far a regime change wars go .
   (ID: b6f013c0bdbca04282e87d0e013063517d33e93b)

17. all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be  so i guess what i  m saying is breathe . enjoy each breath and take it for what it is . you  re not in the past and if you keep looking back you  ll never enjoy today . and life is a beautiful thing that you don  t want to let pass by . i don  t know if that will help but it  s the advice i can give . best of luck
   (ID: 6eb8259d7d6b7ae101dda44ceaaf3b9edaab4fad)

18. i  ll use that in restaurants from now on .
   (ID: ba2acd290c3398c0dd8519d1c54f2c733f05fb31)

19. people that make fun of foreign accents . it ' s probably not their first language , give the guy some slack . also people that write down " voltage " and " amperage " instead of " tension " and " current . in my mother language it ' s wrong , and as an engineering student , it kinda grinds my gears . as i ' m writing this i realized i ' m a hypocrite , i ' ll go rethink my life decisions in the shower , if you ' ll excuse me .
   (ID: ad95cb68c3ea444630fedc23f3d4596fafc60464)

20. well i suppose that ' s probably how a lot of the great stand  up comedians and voice actors started . i ' ll admit , doing it in front of strangers is probably going to be more nerve  wracking . i do some voices and crack jokes around people i know but i already know where i stand with them . doing it to get strangers to like me or to put food on the table would make me more nervous .
