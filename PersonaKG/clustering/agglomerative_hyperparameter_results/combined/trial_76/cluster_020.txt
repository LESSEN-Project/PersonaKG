1. sorry , what exactly is this unpardonable sin ? and why do you think you committed it ? and what would be the very worst thing to happen to you if you did ? and how likely do you think that very worst thing is realistically going to happen ? are you maybe experiencing some cognitive distortions about your guilt here ? if you  re concerned your god is going to send you to hell for some sin , you probably need to speak to a christian counselor or pastor . they  ll have the answers you  re looking for . and side note , i  m not a christian but a lot of family are . i don  t know what sin could possibly be unpardonable .

   (ID: c863a7172df41853f354be7adff4b3f9a0cb9736)

5. i was at my grandmas house for the weekend and went exploring in her attic i found some junk and this old doll with pitch black eyes in a box labeled  broken  it was the only thing in the box besides an old piece of pottery . i took the doll and showed my grandma cause i thought it would make her happy to see an old play thing . it didn  t make her happy instead she became terrified at the sight of the doll and asked where i got it from . i told her it was in a old box . she asked what did the box look like i told her it said  broken  she said put it back and never take it out again . i listened to her and did what i was told to do she never brought it up to me ever again either so i could only assume what history she had with the doll

9. i was trolling some goth chick and she started yelling at me her boyfriend a friend of mine had to hold her back but thats not the scary the scary part is every once and a while she would legit try to scope me out whenever she did find me she would tell me to leave her friend alone long story but yeah i would always think she would falcon punch my ass
   (ID: bfb28ccea698c3dc12ee1909c3188e266edbbb84)

10. well you seem to be correct about the cities there and i realize i failed to account for population growth earlier however the industrial revolution happened and that likely led to a large decline however the brits did do a lot of harm however india might have not developed as quickly . oh and btw the british raj was not a collony untill the 1850s so yeah that kinda changes the argument by a lot . now i have to make it clear tho i don ' t think what the brits did was moral meerely that it may have had possitive consequences .
   (ID: d7f47de640bd3d8659ad150b77fea8f843c60c26)

11. i can ' t see how it couldn ' t be . the jacket was  digit ? i saw it reported as digit sterling from a high street shop zara i think . how many  digit jackets does she get papped in ? how did it even get in her wardrobe ? would she even set foot in a ' zara ' ? wouldn ' t her personal shopper be practically shot on the spot for suggesting it ? then there ' s the timing . if you want to make a cynical statement about journalism , maybe wear the jacket on one of the fairly frequent occasions when you ' re dead  batting journalist ' s questions in the wake of some new presidential gaffe  perceived gaffe . wearing it when she did and in that context cannot have been a mistake . don ' t forget , these people and their staff positively choose clothing that is appropriate to an event . they don ' t just get dressed and then look at their diaries . ' oh  it ' s a holocaust survivor ' s dinner  better go with a sombre suit and dark tie ' etc . ' oh it ' s a youth event  something jazzy . ' you get the idea .

18. i don ' t see the correlation between your title and the post honestly . very bottom left corner .  but i do know that if your not from the south you should mind your business says who ? or what ?  recognize it ' s part of southern culture " tradition " isn ' t an argument  excuse for anything .  and cry about something else . only one " crying " seems to be you .  the japanese enslaved koreans from digit  digit , you think their flag is racist ? they did that while flying the imperial japanese flag , which was discontinued postwar .
