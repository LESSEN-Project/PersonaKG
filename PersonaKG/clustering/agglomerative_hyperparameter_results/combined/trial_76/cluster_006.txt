8. as someone who is bisexual and hasn  t told her parents , i don  t think it  s relevant unless you start seeing someone . i know it  s a huge part of a person  s identity , but i don  t see any reason to damage your relationship with your parents unless it  s going to benefit another relationship . does that make sense ? in my case , my friends know , my fiance knows , but i  ve never sat down with my parents and talked to them about it .

10. i think it ' s normal that he should be the last one to leave the ship because the other are under his responsable si obviously he has a big big risk to go down with the ship . but the tradition of going down with it just for the principle just by honor or symbolism or whatever is really weird and stupid to my opinion but yes the valors in our time are very different than the ones at the time of the tradition so .
   (ID: a74790331386859adbbd886bd045a7391e95948c)

11. the photos are photos of my kid and the boyfriend eg my kid going down a slide on his lap etc . i can see why she values the photos  but i think it is unnecessary to share them in this context as the only people in this group chat who these photos are of any relevance to is herself . nobody else in the group chat even knows the bloke except my in laws who have met him once or twice .
   (ID: c0cbd0e097375f98ad98ec291f836a39d55e02c1)

12. how do we really know this happened , not like anyone is going to check .
   (ID: bef3bdf131cc9dbe9d33343a3b9988680236cf9d)

13. i couldn ' t tell from your post if you had tried this or not , but spanking is a good way to start . start slowly and get him aroused , then increase the intensity . it ' s a good way to learn together the proper balance between pain and arousal . it takes practice . start with your bare hand , then introduce a brush , etc as your comfort level increases . done properly it can be incredibly erotic . when you ' re comfortable , introduce verbal dominance as well  tell him he ' s been a bad boy and you ' re going to punish him , that sort of thing . i ' ve found it most effective when my wife whispers these things  it sets a very intense mood .

14. i was here to say sushi , now i have to think of something else . its definitely not going to be brussel sprouts . i still hate those

15. if he say to his brother " i wanted to sleep with your girl " he will get mad obviously . so you can either say nothing and after some time things will be normal again or you can say everything and hope that you won ' t make them angry . but whatever you do , do not go with " little moves " like wanting to apologising or something like that because you are going to make them confused and maybe angry .

16. one of my friends is going to nationals , so i am having him pick up a machamp for me , how much would you be willing to pay ?

17. digit yr olds walk to school alone in a inner city . i seen a 7yr old get hit by a car going full speed .
   (ID: c50abefedeeb0c19f834b1ebb28634054bccee26)

18. it ' s not wrong , but it ' s sad . you should strive to have more self control and let people have less power over you . is it wrong to call someone a racial slur ? of course . do people do it anyway ? of course . should a car hit you when you ' re crossing the street ? no . do you look both ways before your cross anyway ? hopefully . you know there are going to be people who will say things to intentionally upset you . the best weapon you have against that is not letting it bother you .
