5. i understand both of your perspectives . for you , seeing ryan get angry , aggressive and violent is likely triggering your emergency response that you felt when you were on the receiving end with walter . it  s awful . for him , he clearly loves you so much that seeing the piece of shit that hurt you , after a few drinks i assume too , he couldn  t stand to see walter out and having fun , escaping any form of justice for his actions . your argument is concerning . the way he views domestic violence survivors is extremely concerning , especially for a nurse . my advice is to have a rational , calm discussion . explain how his actions made you feel , particularly if they did trigger anything to do with your abuse . also try and understand from his perspective why he lashed out . you know him . but the most concerning thing is how he talked about your abuse . ask him if he honestly sees you as you , not as the dv survivor . he needs to understand that that abuse happened to you but you are not your abuse . at the end of the day , the best advice i  ve ever been given is to apply your situation to someone you love and care deeply about . what advice would you give that person ? you deserve safety , security and happiness . i hope it works out for you sparkling  heart
