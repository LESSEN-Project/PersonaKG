1. ellen degeneres . i do t think hate is the right word . but the woman is super condescending and way too sarcastic to her guests . the more it  s pointed out the more it annoys the shit out of me and makes me not like her .
   (ID: 777e86703ab013526ea933a9a9fcc97d1fbd6a78)

2. first i would text the guy she slept with " i might be pregnant . i can ' t have a baby right now . can you bring me some money to help afford an abortion ? can we meet at digit  30pm tonight " i would then give him the address to a shady motel which i would have purchase one night stay in advance and " accidentally " drop her phone in toilet . next i would leave a note on my future ex ' s car from her new lover saying " hey babe . let ' s do something special tonight . meet me at this motel at digit  00pm . wear something sexy " and i would leave the key to the motel . then i would tell my future ex that i am staying at my brother ' s tonight to help him set up his new place so she feels safe to go to the motel . my next step i would be to call her parents and tell them to meet me at the same motel for a surprise party at digit  45pm for my brother ' s birthday after i see both my ex and her lover show up to the hotel around digit  digit , i would call digit from a nearby payphone and say " there is a prostitute at this motel right outside my room . they sound extremely violent " if i timed everything correctly , her parents should show up in time to watch their daughter being questioned for prostitution with a random stranger at a seedy motel . i would then leave a simple message to her facebook saying , " it ' s over "
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

3. i always thought it would be great to dump a woman with a fake proposal . take her out to a nice restaurant , make it super romantic , and at the end of the night , get down on one knee and hand her a ring box . and in the box is a note that says " i ' m leaving you forever you cheating whore .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

4. what kind of ultimatum did you give your girl ? also , you can ' t say that you ' re willing to have no strings attached sex but then also say that you want something more . i have the impression that you ' d prefer something more . you seem like a nice guy and i can empathize with you . sure , sex is good but you want something more . what else can you do to convey to your girl how you really feel so that she understands and takes what you ' re saying seriously ?
   (ID: ddd770a31dc9c8fa4ad153c94b4c0debc20cf026)

5. can you imagine trump screaming " you are fired " in her face ?
   (ID: 943cc5e526975c71d69ca1804666ab2f83b06a27)

6. dude , if you have an attractive so , let her show that shit off . you should take it as a compliment when other people want to fuck your girlfriend . if you really can ' t handle her style , then maybe she ' s not for you .
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

7. i mean , i  ll knock her out for you if you need me too if she tries something .
   (ID: 90b50e663fbfbffb619130a50a448969ee40f547)

8. the unfortunate thing with being human is that despite our radical free will , we can only choose for ourselves  not others . i ' ve been through young love and know its inexplicable potency . however , first love won ' t necessarily be your best love . in situations like this , the more you try to force things , the worse they will become . a few words of encouragement about your sexuality  gay and lesbian relationships occur among many species of animals in the wild . there ' s nothing wrong with what you ' re feeling or who you ' re attracted to . i think what makes people uncomfortable about it is that it inherently presents a challenge to the privilege heterosexuals have and are generally unwilling to reflect critically about . although you don ' t want to break up , try to stay strong . the best thing you can do is let her know that you love her and are there for her if she needs you . i wish you both the best .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

9. guys don ' t worry , it ' s fake ! the blonde doesn ' t have a beak , it ' s not dee !

10. this is a good life lesson for us all . women remember every slight or negative comment for eternity and will bring them up forever in an argument .
   (ID: 7e155e58dbfbdb78d094711d4ddb65ae5ef94fba)

11. basically at the end of this year it is as if the whole world shattered for me and i had the possibility to start again . during the summer i got the chance to create some new great friendships , i joined the scouts and most of my current friends all come from that group and i finally built memories i want to remember . it is something i never felt because i ' ve always been classified as weird and i rarely met people really interested in me . so when i met this girl circa four years ago and she made me believe we were friends , she became my world if it makes sense . she manipulated me very easily and then she left me roughly once i started questioning her ways . now i can see through her crap and the only reason i don ' t want to see her anymore is that i feel like everything has changed and i don ' t want to get back to that world of rumors and fake friendships .
   (ID: 9b7ab2ecf50a1f0d1a04c43a5112617f13aebfb4)

12. let me guess , she didn ' t ask what you got ?
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

13. info depends on how your relationship with your friend is like if this happend with me and my friends , i wouldn ' t feel guilt . it ' d be hilarious because that ' s the kind of relationship me have . we fuck with each other . it ' s playful but if you ' re having doubts , you probably don ' t have that kind of relationship with her and might be the asshole
   (ID: 28e24cb71e2c0068fef35890d39022b686e4215d)

14. yes because i ' m currently delaying the inevitable till i can tell her in person

17. i searched random duos in fortnite , i teamed up with a girl not real name linasomething . we reached like 5th place which is pretty good . she then added me and we proceeded to play . and we played and played . eventually i got bored with her , i wanted to play with other friends me  hey i wanna play with some friends okay ? her  no me  what ? her  please stay i played with her one more match and then i just left . i don ' t know if she means it or not but she has been saying i love you for some reason . digit days later i wanted to stop playing with her , so i wrote her a short polite message " dear lina . bitch i ' m tired of yo clingy hoe ass , i ' m tryna play with friends but you fucking just want me to play with you ! sincerely kal . " she started saying some bullshit then i asked her how old is she her  i ' m digit me  no you ' re not her  yes i am me  look , i don ' t care how old you are but if you ' re underage i can ' t be speaking with you probs bs her  it ' s okay we can play me  don ' t lie , how old are you ? her  digit me  it ' s illegal for me to play or speak with you her  byeeeeeee me  finally . her  byeeeeeee i blocked her .

18. you only live once . i say ignore these folks and do what makes you happy . time is precious . if you  re unhappy , try a  trial separation  after explaining to your wife why you need it . date the other girl then weight the pros and cons of each option . at least you  ve aired what your wife is doing that makes you unhappy and are giving her a chance as well .
   (ID: 757e143549620faa46043c6954071c7a8dd6b484)

19. this is great advice . i might just go see hr and have a conversation about what are my choices . she is an amazing employee , and works really hard . i don ' t want to add any more stress to her . i may also have a conversation with her . thanks
   (ID: 011a531fc3f706d76441a0f95cc8091fd4453dd8)

20. i know it ' s cliche but there will be other girls . take time to focus on building a relationship with yourself , find things that make you happy , and the right girl will find you . if it could happen to me it can happen for you !
