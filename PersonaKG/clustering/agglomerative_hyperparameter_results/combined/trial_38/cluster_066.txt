17. what world do you live in ? and first of all , i don  t think relationships should be based on how much money someone makes or if they make any at all . i believe you should be with someone you love and that it shouldn  t matter if they are rich or poor . this shit you  re saying here is really disgusting and i feel really offended by it , you should probably reevaluate your life decisions and just think a little bit before you say this type of stuff .
   (ID: d10c10d39129e1768465d09c5c492657be31ef47)

18. i think i would be happy for a bit but turn sad as time went by . the thing is , knowing you have all the money in the world then you go buy something , just isn ' t the same feeling as working towards making money and then buying something . knowing you can get anything you want , you start losing interest in things . you won ' t even know who your true friends are . if you live a normal life and make money and then you buy a really nice car , you feel proud of yourself , you worked towards that car . but when you have all the money in the world and you buy a car , you have little to no satisfaction . i feel if i had all the money in the world , i would live a miserable life . unless you worked towards the amount of money you have , it just doesn ' t feel right .
   (ID: 20fef7b83cf9ae51924e5491cac2f90901d833e0)

19. no the post says  you have no choice but to accept it .  so you have to accept it . maybe in real life , sure . but you have to play within the parameters given !
   (ID: 0adc203530167f27a334f03a3d44b3c302d91f2a)

20. i think you ' d save yourself a lot of grief by accepting that this weapon isn ' t for you . you aren ' t gonna get it , i ' m not gonna get it , it ' s purposed specifically for a group of players that we are not , and never will be , apart of . it ' s tough but i ' m pretty sure we can buck up and accept the fact that we aren ' t pretty princesses that get the whole world .
