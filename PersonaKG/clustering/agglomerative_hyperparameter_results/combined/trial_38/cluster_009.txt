1. no  one really knows for certain . you can speculate all you like but no  one definitively knows .
   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

2. you know that means that they are green with slight hints of yellow or blue , or do you not know how words work .
   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

3. no , you are thinking of how shady multi level marketing companies are setup . a traditional pyramid scheme involves taking in large investments from people and paying them large amounts of interest under the false premise that there is some actual business behind it all that makes this possible , when in fact the interest is just being paid directly from other investors . so , the starter asks friends to give him  digit , digit and offers a digit  interest rate . seems too good to be true , but the starter takes a loss by paying out anyway to build trust . now those people who think they have a sure bet get other people to invest . now the higher up people can be paid there interest from the newest buy ins . as long as new people keep getting added to the bottom of the pyramid , their money is funneled up to pay interest to the others and everyone thinks all is well , but the bottom of the pyramid will always get screwed and the bottom of the pyramid just keeps getting bigger until growth slows down and the lowest people realize there is no money for them to be paid back . the reason this is illegal is that by definition it is unsustainable , so anyone running one of these knows the lowest people will eventually lose their money . multilevel marketing gets around this by actually selling a product or service or such , so theoretically at least , the business can be sustainable and the whole entity can actually turn a profit .
   (ID: b650c9c531ec58d468c7c1fc9b7083efc4cbca9c)

4. i never knew that . i thought the deworming was more of preventing it , but obviously what you just said makes a lot more sense . til .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

5. violence , corruption , bad infrastructure , broken economy . i could go on forever

   (ID: ad6e2a4253e2d855d34a09445a12e49327ba824e)

   (ID: 6ab15493c00b6b6223b3fca29e367366c44d8578)

10. some woman supposedly .  i  m not saying this didn  t happen but fuck me . you won  t listen to the fucking fbi but this is a credible source for you ? at what point will you realize that you just hear what you want to hear .
   (ID: 488bde170f2c1483481aa38d08906ea10be03ff1)

11. i can ' t say for certain , but i guess it ' s because that ' s what they know
   (ID: 03cf8378bcb94745c52eb716a381f55774f3b358)

12. digit is the legal drinking age for most provinces of canada . digit is the celebrated milestone , but so is digit because the states is right below us . for me , kissing draws the big distinction on what would transpire between myself and my . er . partner . take white . i had major major feelings for him and i told him so after kissing him . his response ? word for word  " don ' t say that " . i ' m trying to understand how some people can just walk into a club  bawhatever purely for the intent of sex and they don ' t care who with . maybe i ' m just super picky , i dunno .
   (ID: 9d1e879011bb23fa9a0cff4c99a536feb2705b86)

13. perhaps a better word is to love in a holy way . it  s like . when you love someone , but they are diabetic . they really want and love sugar . they crave it . it  s totally normal for most people to eat sugar , so why not them ? because it will kill them ie their soul is in danger . so if you love them , in a holy way , you don  t feed them sugar . you stay with them but abstain from going to the bakery , you work out together and live an active life .
   (ID: 392895b8f4f938fb4e2bfae6551b901dccf33ac2)

14. exactly what i thought when i found this . if it were that tasteless to let non  asians wear traditional asian hats , why stock them in your store for non  asian people to buy ?
   (ID: 6cb8904cf2faf74f712ddb1c620007fe43bf46df)

15. i ' m not going to downvote anything you say because i ' m open to anything you have to say . the question wasn ' t asking for evidence . the question was asking about what makes each individual believe in god . and you don ' t , so you kinda wasted your time by coming in here and generally just trying to start an argument . when you say there is no evidence , you are only approaching reality through what you see and feel from your own perspective , which is all any of us can really do . thing is , everyone has a different view of reality . that in itself is mind boggling . we are a collective consciousness trying to make sense of this whole thing . even me and you right now are like synapses firing in a huge brain right now trying to imagine two sides of this coin . but yeah whatever man , blow jobs and garbage , everything is nothing , and we may as well just fuck the earth to death because it ' s gonna happen eventually , right ?
   (ID: cb830ff94bb369e5db655e15ee074f392a52c14f)

16. i don ' t know why , but i read that as " what lasagna do deaf people think in "   x200b  to answer your question , i have no idea  but i would guess the language of whatever region they grew up in , with the pronunciation of words left to their imagination . like you know when you are reading a book and you come across a name you have never heard before so you subconsciously decide how it is pronounced without really knowing
   (ID: 1fb7025aaa0b620e024c8abbaecd72d34f8418b0)

17. it ' s hilarious to see americans take guesses , like the rest of the world didn ' t fucking exist lol just look at what happens where it already is legal , dummies .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

   (ID: 392895b8f4f938fb4e2bfae6551b901dccf33ac2)

19. i don ' t worship god because he does not exist .
   (ID: 94ab13260f2b345a7ddb68c03b6fbc2a70424b41)

20. ' god ' already has a meaning . do you want me to start calling keyboards ' christmas ' and my car ' the virgin mary ' ? you ' re not saying anything with any meaning whatsoever . the scientific method isn ' t about ' fitting in ' baseless preconceptions . i ' m sorry if you ' ve heard my response before ? i ' m not sure what you mean by it being a ' standard ' response . it ' s how i think , not how i was told to think .
