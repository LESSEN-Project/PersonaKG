11. hardik pandya did some ads for boat . is that why you came up with this ? i lost my precious iphone headphones . i had to leave the city and i bought in desperation . it  s cheap . sound quality is normal . the earphones are uncomfortable but it  s cheap and durable . popularity and sales are the work of reviews on amazon , flipkart and answers on quora . google search takes you to these places if you are looking for good earphones . other good earphones are mentioned in digit the magazine sometimes but i don  t follow digit much now . so , google , amazon , flipkart , quora and hardik pandya is the answer .
   (ID: 5186a4f234c22a2668969b75a1a54616526c2ee4)

12. I'm interested in tattoos.
   (ID: c502154cdae9232a9351bdc0e55d2030d75a8094)

13. honestly , i feel like the fits are more " solid " if i can put it in a word . when i use your traditional flight they always seen a bit flimsy and inconsistent . i know a lot of it is mental , but it ' s just what i have come to know and trust . also , fit flights spin , and i have noticed that it really helps when you are grouping your darts close together . less chance for one dart to prevent another from hitting your target . an additional benefit is they seem to last much longer for me . they are more expensive , but i think the value is there , especially for the shafts . i use the same shafts for almost digit months . i have never broken one and only change mine when they get too dirty i use white always . as for flights , i would say you have about a month or two months before you require changing . when i used regular flights , they were getting torn to bits every week .
   (ID: 5452c32db6928ce9b53e7ed5109c3b875648debd)

14. I'm interested in makeup.
   (ID: 8d5aac58a9c3a7e883f9e90df39dc5ab7c36de53)

15. this is how my b  w knights deck started . i needed a lower power deck for when i end up in those awkward super  casual pods . it ' s been interesting to have to tell myself ' no ' when i come across cards that would be great it in it . that ' s a whole new realm and i ' m sometimes proud of my restraint .
   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

16. sorry i didn ' t mean rarely activated . i meant it ' s rare to have digit or more negative effects on at once . especially with vero cleansing . but yeah i do see the benefit to her 2nd skill . but i ' m also interested in getting my dragons team to auto . i don ' t think changing the lead will result in an auto ready team . is there a monster i have that would really help me out . su perhaps ? or maybe throwing verad into the line  up .
   (ID: bd951a475ac46323d867ac35ccf0cb4b3e756f83)

17. gauze ? dengar ! i think your height would make you a good ig  digit if you could come up with something from those components . maybe a taller than normal bib fortuna ?
   (ID: 664b365f80ff1d51db95866fada8009f14d8e9b1)

18. raw , deep and fire infusions remove scaling for flat damage , they are good fir builds that dont want to invest the required stats . if you want dark or fire damages but with scaling use chaos and dark gemsthey scale with both faith and int and are really good for max level builds . lightning gems buff weapons with lightning damagewho would ' ve thought and add a faith scaling that only affects the lightning damage . good for pure faith builds but bad if you mix faith with str or dex bc buffs work way better . crystal gems are the same thing but for int and magic damage . blessed gems adds the faith scaling but only buffs damage already on the weapon , but makes you recover hp over time . really good to put on a shield to gain passive healing . simple gems are the same but for int and passively recover fp over time . a thing to note is that you cannot buff weapons infused with these gems so they are only good in certain cases , like a fire  chaos dagger for parries .
   (ID: e9829c29404a911421b2b39c7ea7309cbcf3329e)

19. i know we use a bananna for sale but which one do i believe in ?
   (ID: 54073428e1afecd7ce44872ad5cd42619b1da6ed)

20. i play on ps4 aswell . i ' d say considering there is new building sensitivity , id put that higher and lower my actual sensitivy . it would probably be easier for you to aim then . also , you want to really change your ads sensitivity to the right spot , it will help you a lot . ads means aiming down sights
