1. server for digit years here , this is what i tell everyone i  ve ever trained at my job . also i know this is a day late , but advice is helpful i  d think  never be afraid to ask for help , little things can really help get you out of the weeds . even a refill or someones extra dressing is one less trip .  figure out the best way to maneuver around your section i call these laps this will come with time and being comfortable with your restaurant and each section you could be in , so take your time with this one .  make the most of every lap around your section , and understand what each table needs .  always check on your kitchen staff and see if they need water , plates , or anything from the fridge that doesn  t require extra prep or knowledge from you like sauce or sliced veggies  be yourself at tables . even if where you work has a strict script most chains and commercial places will that you have to stick to , be yourself . tables like confidence and personality .  don  t lie about mistakes , but don  t place blame if you have to mention it to customers .  there was a miscommunication but we  re getting your calamari out right now .  sounds more professional and comforting than  the kitchen lost your ticket and they are redoing it .   milk your tables that you  re new , some will give you better tips , some will forgive the smaller mistakes and slips , most will congratulate you on being solo .  find comfy shoes and get some insoles . most importantly  although you  re here for advice and genuinely seem excited about this job , so i don  t doubt this will be an issue  have pride in every facet of your job . from side work to bottle service to talking about the food to how you present yourself at your restaurant . and welcome to the server family . we  re a bunch of bastards cause we have to be nice to everyone else all damn day haha .

2. upon parking my car , my co  worker chimed in with " watching you pull in makes me wish your dad pulled out " my parking job was fine , btw . we just roast eachother at every opportunity .
   (ID: 191aa96179821ac46f9548541f04899c2adacec9)

3. my experiences have largely been with specialists , and that delay has to do with weekends . i ' m aware that ' s not how it ' s done in general . and my experiences are also largely diagnostic situations because if i know what ' s fucking me up i usually don ' t go to the hospital , which i ' m well aware isn ' t the brightest thing to do , but i ' d live there otherwise , which are the situations that really benefit from your doctor not having a hardcore brainfart because they ' ve been not only awake but at work for the last digit hours . i ' m not saying i know a way to fix this . but i ' m saying it needs fixing .
   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

4. I use design.
   (ID: d1e6050d6d7638f6662249831925c3a9185f210b)

5. i ' ve been lucky enough to snag a position as digital media director at the radio station . have my own staff and stuff , but i guess i don ' t know what proper internships to look for because i ' m in the journalism field . i don ' t know where to start lol to even find something i could be interested in that i even have the skill for .
   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

7. I own a coworkers.
   (ID: 597db748e9e223db2b7d3a7e2d79893e3cc7cd0a)

8. do all the volunteering  internships you can , i suggest thesca . org in the us totally worth their one  time application fee , it ' s super easy to apply for things once you have your profile . be willing to travel wherever you get offered a position . alaska doesn ' t get too many applicants , so it ' s a good starting point  just be willing to go without internet or cell service for a long time . it can get lonely .

   (ID: 46a39b1131e50f9cc061bbaf88e15686e5c9359d)

12. opinions may change on this , but working from home . a friend told me how lucky i am to have an extremely high paying job where i just sit behind a laptop , scrolling through reddit digit  of the time . that means i can work from anywhere . from home , on the train , on holiday , anywhere . i imagine other people would love it . i never tell my friend this , but it ' s awful . the money is great , i love that part  but i cant enjoy it . at any given time , digit  digit , i get a message and i have to get behind a laptop to work immediately for about digit minutes . sometimes it ' s in the night and it ' s so stressful . the worst part is the social aspect of it . i ' d much rather be out an enjoying with friends , but my work doesn ' t allow it unless i bring my laptop out with me on a night out . no chance . this means that although i can chill at home and earn a disgustingly high amount of money doing so , that ' s all my life is . sitting behind a computer using social media while occasionally working . if it wasn ' t for my deathly anxiety , i ' d be much happier with a job at walmart .

13. digit , part time .
   (ID: 618e7c681a628e6c6c5521926bf4d17deb5ed5d6)

14. i worked like this for a while digit years or so , and liked it . bosses understood we had to have breaks every now and then and we did when we wanted to . i do not think it ' s too bad , each brick  thing moved being less than digit kg and you can do the work how you like , it was more freedom than in most of my it work most bosses didn ' t know what they were talking about . so basically , i didn ' t see negatives  you got   from bosses for doing " hard work and not complaining " is good in any later work you like  apply . if you don ' t get decent wages then that ' s a different issue altogether .

15. i work as a bike messenger for a company that shares a name with a " country  wide " insurance company . almost every time i go somewhere new someone sings that goddamned jingle to me " you  know  what  company  i ' m  talking  about is on your side " . really fucking done with that
