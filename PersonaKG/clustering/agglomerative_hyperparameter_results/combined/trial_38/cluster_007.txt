1. what convinced you to play minecraft , and how did you start ?
   (ID: 9c91f42953bc8f6d2f718503a1924734b9da6acc)

2. i am a longtime fan and i just finished uc4 a few hours ago . i had a lot of thoughts while i was playing but i wasn ' t sure if it was worth posting . then i saw this post and thought it would be a good spot . i have to say , in terms of gameplay , uc4 is clearly the best game in the series . i love all the callbacks to previous installments and the relationships and the scenery is just gorgeous . i am a fan of the rope swinging and wish there was more of it . there definitely felt like less gun fighting and more traversal which will make replay value a little less if only because it gets boring swinging from edge to edge over and over again . one thing i ' ve always loved about the uc series is that the physics are very forgiving . i first picked up the series thinking it would be a male tomb raider or indiana jones and all previous games have had a good mix of shooting , puzzles and traversal . i really love the mp and i will definitely enjoy the hell out of that for a long time to come . the only negatives are that i felt that the story was too short , i didn ' t think rafe was a particularly well  drawn of interesting villain and as much as they make it feel like it ' s trying to be a little more open world , you always have to get back to the rail . one thing that really annoyed me was nolan north doing the voice of young sam in the flashbacks . for some reason , his fake accent was really jarring . it also felt like they shoehorned in the marina guy just to give the story an ending . it ' s definitely better than every other game i ' ve gotten this year and it advances the console but i have to say that some of the set pieces from previous installments blew me away . this one had a few great moments but nothing where i was like , " holy crap . " oh , and whoever they got to replace the voice of flynn in mp is awful . the original had such a great voice and so many hilarious taunts .
   (ID: a18adc4ad3b28b34dfa3063a1c77566b8681a79d)

3. I own a eb playthrough.

4. warranties for the most part are not voided unless the repair or modification you do can be proven to have caused the breakdown . that said , unless you ' re planning on really modifying your car for something specific like off  roading , track , etc , then most modifications are likely to be extremely minor and should be fine . the best thing you can do is check youtube when you come across an issue or repair , you ' ll likely find a resource to tell you how to do it . if that fails , check car specific forums , they can be a huge resource for almost everything about your car . i ' ve used them more times than i can count and they have saved me a fortune . learn as much as you can but don ' t be worried about not understanding something or feeling like a job is too big to tackle . some people are comfortable rebuilding an engine while others don ' t want to handle anything harder than changing an air filter .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

5. hahaha nah your good bro . you just signed the incident report . it most likely just said the events that took place . one thing to remember , never admit guilt ! " i dunno why that dog sat , maybe he ' s broken ? " humor goes along way in all confrontations .
   (ID: 0176230ef7bd36e243dc81e1792c2941b82ea97c)

6. if your on console try not to focus on building the onyl way you will beat pc players is by outgunning them . just focus on improving your aim , that ' s your best bet . i know there was some console fortnite player in season digit that was clapping everybody because he would just get close to them and never miss a one pump i wish i could remember his youtube
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

7. you know you don  t have to follow a guide right ? one thing about majority of the players playing this game is that they don  t bother to adapt , they just mindlessly play and when something kills them , they think it  s bullshit or the build is trash .
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

8. I own a game.

9. if you ask about the lack of action on my character was because i was too busy banging my head to dragon force . seriously , can we get rocksteady nerfed already ?
   (ID: f2ddf323cbf1466909e7e09f048b5e781f523d4a)

10. tbh you have a very good class for pvp right now . i just leveled my stamblade up to digit this past weekend and jumped into cyrodil on him . lots of success . i have played a mageblade and i have cp cap so i have a slight advantage over you , but with the gear setup there are plenty of good combinations and the right skills slotted you shouldn ' t struggle too much . just avoid jumping the 531s all buffed up , pick off the 100s and 200s cp guys riding their mounts or oblivious on siege . once you get a good rotation picking on the little guys , then move to the big boys . if you are running 2hand always keep rally up ! it will save you !
   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

11. i feel like you put more thought into this than i did but i definitely agree with everything you said except how it was turn two , a lot of ads these days don  t actually have atk bar boosters a lot still do too but my josephine would get turn digit fairly often and strip  provoke whatever threat was thanks for taking the time to analyze my strats !
   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

12. that ' s true . it ' s like having strange gru or razorback . just means you ' re doing it wrong .
   (ID: ac618aeb476ed052ed284ebbdeb432dde55c6931)

13. i feel like ever since digit took over everything halo has severely dropped in quality apparently that includes text on a box which would be so easy to spot and cheap to fix that they just really must not give a shit anymore
   (ID: 6b1a5069121a216d43b11b6d5c61b018eb668aaa)

14. if you take longer than digit hours to respond to a text after we ' ve been replying at a half hour or so reply rate , you should by courtesy , apologize somehow or mention something you were doing that distracted you that long instead of going back to the conversation like nothing fucking happened . i hate that so much
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

15. all of the games are great in their own way but if you cried from  digit , you should go all the way back to the beginning and see how it all came together . i really hope  digit is not the last one , i would be very happy to see them do a full  on prequel about his first adventure .
   (ID: a18adc4ad3b28b34dfa3063a1c77566b8681a79d)

16. guy didn ' t know what he had , i picked it up and said " how much " he looked at me and said "  digit if you survive going down the hill " i ' ve skated for almost a decade so needless to say i got it for  digit
   (ID: 207223d61d741a9dd298aa4dd1f8b3c219c05cb7)

17. you did the only right thing  you sent it back .
   (ID: d8333858181db719e67785c4ac2aa01282861e93)

18. you ' re gonna get camped one every dozen , dozen and a half or so games during the start of the season , it ' s just people hungry for their old rank . it is a trade off because if he literally facecamps you and you do the right thing draw it out as long as possible then the rest of the team will basically secure a victory in the meantime , but that ' s not a huge relief for the guy getting facecamped . just incentive to learn how to evade better ! as for the rank reset , it happens every month so this isn ' t exactly the moon and sun aligning to screw you personally over . there ' s just a couple days of weird ranking while stuff gets figured out , not a big deal . it ' s gonna happen again in october and november and december and so on so it ' s not really worth complaining about
   (ID: 8df56ee782672f11aeb0f19bf7978b1b1c04e678)

19. I am minecraft enthusiast.
   (ID: ac53f9ce173965984299f3686335a39bc2a5810f)

20. wow is a game that i know i will always be interested in playing . even when it ' s bad , i can still find joy somewhere in the world of azeroth .
