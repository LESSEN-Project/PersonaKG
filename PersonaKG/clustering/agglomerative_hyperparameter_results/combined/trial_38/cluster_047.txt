" genjo didn ' t like violence , but he wasn ' t going to let the boss harm roro . this situation had become a choice to the monk . a choice to leave the boss unharmed , but risk the harm of roro and others  or to harm the boss , but save many many others . for now , neither choice needed to be done immediately . the third choice was for genjo to be harmed in order to protect everyone , this , was the best choice for the monk . using his jet systems and swift movement , the monk vaulted up the ramp , over the boss , where he stopped in the doorway . his arms spread outward , genjo blocked the door so that the boss couldn ' t pass . it was clear that he wasn ' t so simply going to let the boss go , but it was also clear he had no intention of harming the boss , at least not yet .  " if bringing harm to someone is what you need , then you may harm me . but once you ' re done , i ask that you leave the girl and forget your plans to extort the medicine from lina . "

16. it ' s not just that . this used to be a major spoiler , but since the recent update had a comic depicting it , i guess it ' s safe to just talk about it . during the process of creating a cephalon out of an individual , the orokin had a way of " leaving out " certain emotions or traits . usually this missing piece imbalances the cephalon ' s personality , resulting in the flaws we see now .

20. yes , i do . i absolutely do , and i say that as someone who is waiting to get a teacher job . you are not their parent and they are students rather than " kids " , but your duty is to defend them against dangers , even if the danger is their own parent . and she is just looking at the other side . while he beats the kid , not giving a slap , but beat in sadistic manner , without control of his actions . he could have broken her nose or teeth . what if that was a gunman , rapist or similar ? she would have just looked at her computer ? this is cowardice , unless she knew there is a video tape and let him do thar so there is an evidence .
