2. if you try and eat a little something at meal times even if you  re not that hungry then that might prevent you going all out after you  ve gone a long time without food . you  re probably a lot more hungry that you realise
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

   (ID: 441f42a774bfb13dc694fc8515be8a2da22decb1)

4. to the hypos reading this , understand that these ridiculous stories of people going from a common cold to dead are extremely rare instances . it is highly more likely what you eat is slowly killing you , so if you ' re so worried about dying a slow painful death you should take action now .
   (ID: f14ea91df683dc236b3ffe5956871b69581e71d3)

5. do you have a powermeter or hrm ? if you do , u should add some intervals into your training , plenty of them around the internet to try

   (ID: fe374743dd856c29f2117723cef01c1fdc3b3b5b)

   (ID: 4167b7bc7d40ac86ca6b492ac0bbaefa992711f6)

10. wouldn ' t being around fit people give you a goal of what you ' d wanna look like , and more than likely motivate you . if everyone else was overweight you ' d rationalize staying overweight .
   (ID: 2e30252ab6ce4c1807bb315c6103be324b841909)

12. congrats on your progress . i should do more sports myself , but i absolutely dislike jogging , i imagine people staring at me and judging me , how did you get yourself to actually do it ? also why do you dislike jewish velociraptors ?
   (ID: e6c4a2b8e8c999b54ade342babc3d7b48868cc6d)

13. you can do it . mind over matter . don ' t like that evil plant control your life . everytime you get a craving ? light up a j . that ' s exactly why i never started smoking , just trees for me .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

14. yes , what i mean is , how many days in a row were you planning ? till you get to your goal weight ? well , i would suggest three things  ramp it up at your own pace from digit  digit to omad to digit hours etc . do a cheat day once a week and maybe do two meals ? maintain muscle  endurance with some cardio  lifting .
   (ID: 25b8235c988cb167d94968ee893707e9c358cde8)

15. yeah maybe but power lifters and yogis dont carry themselves as crossfitters do . and they don ' t bother you with health advice or what to eat , or what to wear , or how to lift properly should i go on ? maybe they are worse where i live .
   (ID: 14bd1366b004b74cfd8c9cb269849740d12cff80)

16. i don  t believe in god . in the scenario god was a chicken , i probably would . i  m not trying to turn this into a religion discussion but in that scenario you  re probably right . i am in no way saying i am equal in care for animals as a vegan . what i mean is that i believe meat eaters can still care for animals . thank you for your point of view though
   (ID: 137d64f4a858b21d0854639ebc037d0bd1dc557f)

17. granted . but when you can have a conversation with something , you don ' t really want to eat it anymore , and now you can have a conversation with anything , so you starve to death
   (ID: c6cc92fb6dee5f65446e9383372864b9e25f1d60)

18. like seriously when you ' re older you will regret it wasting your teenage life on things like that . you should be worrying about your weight when you get older . instead of taking things into your own hands i know it is obviously hard but tryyyy to tell somebody about the bullying if you haven ' t already and get help to demand that something serious is done about it . i ' m sorry if i ' m being ignorant towords you if you get what i mean .
   (ID: 8b409a812bfe5e21e6e8924b5c822fc50d0d2c9a)

19. maybe school stress has added a little to it but i think it is mainly stuff that has been building up over the course of my life , i don ' t know what else it could be .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

20. so now i can tell all crossfitters at my gym to stop give other people advice . what is up with that ! everytime even my boss who is a crossfit guru or something like that tells me what to eat , that i need to join him and hog all the playground equipment from children . i said kindly no sir !
