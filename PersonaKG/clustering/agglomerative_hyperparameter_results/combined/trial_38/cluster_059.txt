1. same boat here , buddy . i ' m the " go to guy " in my social circle and sometimes get lost in other people ' s worlds and lives . but when it settles down , i go back to my barren wasteland of a life and crush myself over the smallest things . i ' ve recently got back into music and playing my drums . something that i can feel in control of . sometimes we have to let the world fix itself , while we fix ourselves . because if we can ' t help ourselves , we can ' t help anyone else . hope that helps , bud . keep up the good fight .
   (ID: f35d74d4d36905b144a4851bae7ac6c2014ebdbd)

2. what do you mean " how do you deal with it ? it ' s not a bad thing
   (ID: 1921dc07cd609c210cb71a0176afa3dfa4fa3772)

3. do extreme steps to stop yourself from gambling . that ' s the only way now . if you really have the mindset to change , go way way extreme . ban yourself from casinos , websites , or anything . cut your internet . find a therapist . call addiction hotlines . ask a friend , family for help . this will only get better if you make moves . i suggest do it now while your in the ' zone ' of making a change in your life .
   (ID: a3bc874aed8bb8421b25930723a7210bcd9b2aec)

4. let me tell you one thing . if you feel unloved , you are telling that to yourself , you are loved by everyone . depression is hard to pass and i am depressed for no reason it seems . my youth pastor has said that i  m telling myself that i  m a burden , that i  m bad and you probably are too .
   (ID: 29f3e9a3f8c02fc1b9aa346cffb8edec6caac89f)

5. i haven ' t been in your spot , but i ' ve been similarly low in different ways . i know what it ' s like to feel as if you have no way of ever being anything close to " normal " your low point becomes all you know , all you can imagine , and all you can accept . i assure you , though , there are always ways out . do you have any family or friends who can help you ? are there any mental health facilities near you that you could go to possibly inpatient ? it may not be significant , but i should note that foot fetishism is not your fault in any way . it ' s how you ' re wired . you just have a case of actual fetishism , not just a kink . i won ' t tell you to not be hard on yourself . i know it ' s not that simple  i ' ve been there . i want you to be aware that you ' ve made much more progress than you realize in even asking how you can change , though . the best advice i can give you as a nonprofessional , but as someone who has also been at " rock bottom " as you described yourself elsewhere , is to start small . if you try to tackle it all at once , you ' ll continue to be overwhelmed .
   (ID: 372e357e1e3acd2a4dea24aa56a5900a539a9e59)

6. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .
   (ID: a3b2823250cd4b5927129512a5ab9061e10ebaf2)

7. i felt like i didn ' t deserve how well my life was going , so i fucked it all the up . little by little , and now i ' m hanging on by a thread .
   (ID: 472084017072e7ced5fed0827bae57ba801d9b7d)

8. have you tried and i know that this isn ' t the most popular if even permitted thing here but maybe prayer or any thing religious ? i ' ve felt with this type of thing before and it ended up helping me , although i do understand if it ' s not for you . also maybe telling someone about this like someone in your life maybe if you do either you ' ll end up finding something worth living for
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

9. sometimes you just have to ask  who hurt you ?
   (ID: 90b50e663fbfbffb619130a50a448969ee40f547)

10. you ' re not messed up . you ' re just empathetic , because it ' s something that you went through in the past . you can relate to that . and you understand and share the feelings of others who are going through the same thing as you did .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

11. you do need to take steps to improve your life , but a big part of cbt is just thinking positively . recognizing the way you ' re thinking now is irrational , that your problems aren ' t insurmountable , and that you have reason to be hopeful for the future . it ' s annoying that people expect you to be better instantly , but thinking positively is the cure .
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

12. i can only tell you i would have preferred for it to be done privately . maybe send him a text , invite him over and let him know that you have some pretty rough news that you would prefer to talk about face to face . then just make sure he is sitting down and explain what has happened . there ' s no real need to rush it , there ' s also no right or wrong way . there is the facts and your feelings and you have to navigate both . i don ' t know this guy from a bar of soap but general rule of thumb is that guys are pretty simple . give him time to process what you say . he will probably have questions . work through them together . at the end of the day this has happened and if you feel the right thing to do is tell him then you ' ll make it work and he can choose to either take it well and be supportive or take it badly and run through a glass door in a panic . i hope it goes well .
   (ID: 06080b0d1273cc2321b21dde5865b5c1c5180e56)

13. you  re still a child . you  re depressed we all are . depression is a game of whit  strategy . think about it with what i will tell you . every human being that has ever been born , never had the ability to walk out of the womb . the fuck do we all do ? we learn we drag we crawl we wobble we walk and then we run . don  t be another statistic to depression , but instead be an example of you making it out .
   (ID: b2a2cd889183833ca9a753b2d28f6d89d867e1f9)

14. cry it out , put on something dumb but happy for noise in the background my go  to is brooklyn digit , get in bed , look at pictures of kittens  puppies online , call someone , try and sleep , google places you  d like to visit one day , do some laundry , eat some cheese , stay on reddit and talk to strangers . keep holding on x
   (ID: ac2c03aee57c4505cf414c55446ec313e1307ee1)

15. i mean that seems like the best way to do it and not want to kill yourself by the end , but i ' m glad it turned out this well and i hope that you have a good day
   (ID: feb4a6aeed8e7e14b0592329bd91d7933a93217e)

16. don ' t say that . the fact that you are afraid to lose your creativity is well enough a reason to continue this fight . you have to keep at it because you deserve to be happy and have every right to enjoy life . waking up every day is you winning this fight . seeking help is winning this fight . dont be afraid to quit something or start something , be it medication or not . if something doesn ' t suit you or brings you to a negative state of mind , change it , talk to someone about it , or eliminate it completely . keep up the fight .
   (ID: 51e06ea43809bd7f43c9c3b13a19193236a72570)

17. plan to fix it , and then put the plan into action when you see an opportunity . don ' t sit around moping . doing so will only prolong your suffering .
   (ID: 53c827dc263721b97d54bc4c972350c3a1b57856)

18. this seems pretty sad but don ' t worry man . it will eventually get better . life has bigger and better things planned for you . hang in there , buddy .
   (ID: 96e6613dc4315740eddd6b52a132531aa939f603)

19. one day at a time . mourn the lost love , bud . you ' re gonna keep crying because acceptance is often accompanied by guilt , especially if it ' s your fault , but you ' ll learn from those mistakes . but acceptance is where you ' ll really start to make headway in moving on . it ' s like addiction  you have to first realize that there ' s a problem , and then you can address the problem knowing it ' s there and needs attention to be fixed . you ' ll make it thru , but definitely not unscathed .
   (ID: f35d74d4d36905b144a4851bae7ac6c2014ebdbd)

20. i feel like it ' s just hormones . i get this way too . i ' m too hesitant to put any labels on it because i ' m so young and so are you so this could totally just be a normal thing . for instance , i haven ' t cried in months and i ' ve cried more times than i can count today .
