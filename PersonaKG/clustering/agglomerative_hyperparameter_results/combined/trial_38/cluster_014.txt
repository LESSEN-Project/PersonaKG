20. yeah people get so weird about it . when i came back after living a few years abroad and be asking my friends how much their casofa  etc cost i  d be greeted by utter awkwardness . i think it  s because in france there is a general hate towards rich people so people don  t want to come across as  wealthy  if they spent a lot on an item .
