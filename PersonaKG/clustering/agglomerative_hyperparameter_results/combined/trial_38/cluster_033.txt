1. crazy that anyone doesn ' t think it the best movie of all time , but hey people all have different tastes , people like different things , that ' s fine i will enjoy watching it every month for the rest of my life
   (ID: 0def2b70456d7a000d0e2b3611ac80cd2990e21c)

2. i really don ' t know why people look so much into stories and anime . do you really care ?
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

3. it ' s on pc now i ' m pretty sure . i googled it like a month ago really wanting it and i think it ' s digit  for pc now .
   (ID: 064b68f55fd83de76c3cbc4f130670e6435e42a4)

4. i think you misunderstood what i said . i am all for atheism . if the picture was supposed to be related to atheism is shouldn ' t be a picture of nothing , there should be no picture at all . that is what my sarcastic little remark was all about . but i suppose you are too dense to understand that .
   (ID: 7ebdc00c75f6f836557e13d39a9efb279ed2ef7a)

5. its normal to stick with what you know . but all the fun is in something different .
   (ID: 2fd27f1218d4f8b9cf90988522a560a50a304dfc)

6. fine in moderation , but anything that encourages escapism may hinder motivation to find some real life action . i heard kids don ' t care about getting their drivers license right away anymore and teen pregnancy is way down . i ' m sure glad i missed that sad ship by a decade .
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

7. it ' s more of how you aim the stream , not where you stand
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

8. for now let ' s just say not really .
   (ID: 94ab13260f2b345a7ddb68c03b6fbc2a70424b41)

9. i don ' t think that ' s what i said , getting a perfect on someone doesn ' t make them lose more points , it makes you lose less . so say you ' re ultra silver and get tap ' d by a bronze rog , and it kills you meaning he takes the game . you ' d lose digit  digit points for that . but if you perfected him once then you ' d only lose like digit or something . in terms of closer ranked matches like ultra silver vs silver , you ' d lose digit  digit or so . so if you perfect them once then you only lose digit  digit or something . in this game where one good hit can lead to a crazy snowball , i feel like there should be some point buffer for getting cheesed out . so , again . i was not saying if you land a perfect on someone that they lose more . you just lose less should they win and they still gain the same amount .
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)

10. ranks only show when the game is over . you can always just leave before the ranks show up . and if your friends ? for some reason shittalk lower ranks its heir fault for being horrible . i never shittalk anyone if he doesnt deserve it . the only thing i might do if he or she asks me where he would belong to my opinion i will answer honestly without beig rude .
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

11. the revision interested me a lot too . really sucked getting the same skin i didn ' t want digit times in a row .
   (ID: ed8c4bb1975edb0f627baa6dac44e74cbc7237c6)

12. just look at the flowers . that and fear have gone down such a shit hole it ' s beyond sad . gj ruining a good thing gimple and co .
   (ID: ed8c4bb1975edb0f627baa6dac44e74cbc7237c6)

13. i mentioned star wars and disney in another comment in this thread 6hours ago , i didn ' t ' go ' from anything . it ' s always been a part of my point . marvel ' s going because of disney  . disney  has star wars and disney films . which means netflix won ' t have any of that . that ' s a serious dent in their offering . marvel is a part of that , and it is still a big draw . many people thought of netflix as the home of good superhero shows and now they ' ll have none . you don ' t think that will have any effect ?
   (ID: fbb82e5b963aa1cda25276df6c0968b4b03a3aa0)

14. so true . i just can ' t really see how any of the other players can win , though !
   (ID: f179711c18514780c1b0257643d893ef1cf5a081)

15. no , in normal  raids you have a lot more personal responsibility . you can ' t just afk through the fights . it is a helluva lot more fun than lfr . you should try playing each of those specs through lfr a few times . get a feel for how you ' d perform in a large group setting . lfr might not be " real " raiding but it ' s close enough to give you an idea . tanaan , lfr and mythic dungeons can get you into normal raids easily , then from there you ' ll go to heroic and mythic raids , ofc . race only matters if you ' re going for extreme feats like world first . play what you want to stare at for hours on end .
   (ID: 2e464b2732570f16afced14ab79d30fa92622627)

16. because as stated above most of the kids have no idea about them and it stops creativity . the last thing to hit public domain was digit i think
   (ID: da770212ea31887c4be30925213eff0dc5d8687b)

17. because i work in this industry . because i see gambling games like some self serving machines where you enter money and all you get is endorphins  the promise of reward .
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

18. watching what is happening , while they reply to our comments on here and their forum . i can ' t help but think that the money activision is forcing their hand on a lot of this . its like getting mad at a f1 driver for letting his teammate pass him on the last lap . it seems ridiculous when you ' re watching , but we don ' t hear the owner of the race team in his ear saying " if you ever want to race again , let him pass " .
   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

19. i think we are safe now , maybe it  s best if it doesn  t blow up pleading  face
   (ID: 09ceeb62f2a165a9c38283d43984e8e6f6f5580e)

20. i could be wrong but i thought it was launching in september ?
