11. in all fairness , sometimes it works out for people to hire someone to assemble it , especially if they ' ve got multiple complicated pieces . it might take an inexperienced person with no tools a day or two of frustration and sore hands to finish , when they ' d rather take only half a day off work , and spend a day ' s wages paying someone else to put it together in a few hours . my dad assembles furniture for a living , he charges  digit   hr when it ' s just him digit  digit   hr if he takes one of his kids to help , though a lot of that is to cover expenses and taxes for running his own business . so i ' m glad there are lazy people .
