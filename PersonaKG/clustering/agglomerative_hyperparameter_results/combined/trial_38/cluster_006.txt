8. i think as a canadian this reflects how i feel accurately . it ' s not that i don ' t like america or americans , or that their ideals aren ' t the closest to ours . but if there is truly a superpower that is a threat to world peace , it is without a doubt america . i think just what transpired over the past year there , shows me that at some point an american civil war is a way greater threat to world peace than anything china or russia could do .
   (ID: ff39f069f8b23a1fe1a55ce497714a8d205eb0fa)

9. simply put , the united states produces a lot of these things . like , alot of them , and at high quality . i ' ll specifically talk about television since i ' m a student in that right now , but it applies to many industries . we ' re a capitalist country , and as a capitalist country we have companies desperate to produce things that people will buy . in many cases , this means producing high quality things , or things that people like . for example  in television , a recent thing that has been introduced is " complex television " . shows like breaking bad or the wire simply would not have existed a decade or two ago , but when the internet was introduced networks had to step up their game and start making shows of high quality so people would keep watching and the networks could keep making money . in my opinion then , it all comes down to the united states focus on creating things that people will buy . not only do people in the us like and buy these things , but people in other countries do as well . it ' s one of the best things that resulted from the introduction of the internet , and the new stress put on entertainment producers to create better content .
