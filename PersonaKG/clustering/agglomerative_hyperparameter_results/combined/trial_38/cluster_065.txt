2. i ' ve never cared for wog ball .
   (ID: b3a8447862df1e30a18d38c5c0ad1c8595c18d4c)

3. i don ' t mind a bit of rugby although i prefer league to union , but the thing annoys me about rugby fans is that they are incapable of not comparing everything that happens on the field to football . they love to talk about the superior moral code of rugby to football , but imagine if wayne rooney had been found guilty of eye  gouging , biting , punching , swearing at a referee , elbowing , headbutting and striking , and still not been sacked as england captain . it is absolutely not an exaggeration to say there would be questions in parliament and general moral outrage . but of course dylan hartley is a nice middle  class boy playing a nice middle  class sport , so it ' s all good .

5. how is there a game called prison architect ? i would have thought that something like that would cause some controversy .
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

6. when you manually save your game , i think it shows your playtime .
   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

7. it blows my mind that the first time is " riot " games . like of all the names .

14. I play madden nfl.
   (ID: d1e6050d6d7638f6662249831925c3a9185f210b)

15. look up ygopro  devpro online and download it . it is a virtual version of the game , and i believe the percy client has an ai mode that you can test decks against . then i would lurk around the sub a little to see what people are playing , pick something that piques your interest , and start from there . warning  cardboard crack is an expensive and addicting habit , and devpro has cost me a fair bit of sleep after discovering it
