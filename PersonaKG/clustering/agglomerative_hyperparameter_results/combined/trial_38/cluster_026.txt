   (ID: 5dc1e0203cb86a245c4ede5cb73923b295b1fdc8)

3. but you won ' t know you ' re not feeling it . your anxiety is all anticipatory , which in this case is just you completely screwing yourself because if your worst case scenario happens and there ' s nothing , then you ' ll never be aware of it . it reminds me of when people have a bad car accident and wake up and can ' t remember anything  i often wonder if it really happened . i mean , i know it really happened , but if you go through something horrible and can ' t remember it , does it count as going through it ? trees falling in woods , and all that . maybe too much pseudo  ephedrine too

   (ID: 8f17a8aa41d6f9ae6bf4690376763808f9363f80)

15. this is an interesting question . my parents were watching a show the other day that actually included this exact question as far as i can tell . in it , a catholic mother in this future time was discussing with her daughter how , based on the church ' s official dogma , it would have been wrong for the deceased husband  father to have had himself digitized , as it forfeits your soul ' s place in heaven , out something like that . i didn ' t watch much of the show , but it was an interesting point . i kind of agree with others here , that just because you can copy someone ' s speech and behavior into a complicated computer program didn ' t mean you ' ve truly captured them as a person in all their fullness , which religious people think of as soul and spirit and stuff . i mean , from an empirical perspective it would probably just be an assumption either way , to say that it captured everything about the person or that it did not , because science can ' t say much about things without empirical definitions , and religion doesn ' t usually claim to define souls empirically . so an argument on whether we can manipulate souls through scientific processes is probably not sensible . idk , those are my thoughts .

16. yes but how to take so clear screenshot of the home page without all the other things on the screen you don ' t want on your screenshot ?
