11. each state is a bit different but it  s really easy to setup if you just google it . just know , all money in a digit must be spent on qualified things such as tuition , books , etc . so you can save too much , especially if you  re starting now . say you save  20k and your kid goes to a community college with a small scholarship . you could have  10k stuck in there that is subject to absurd fees  taxes  digit  if it  s withdrawn for non  school related purchases .

17. hey , digit year old entrepreneur here  made over digit figures this year from my business . i understand what you mean completely , i basically traded my high school life to become and entrepreneur and learn to make money online . i left high school with only digit good friend like yourself it sounds like and that  s the only person i have stayed in contact with . it  s funny even the beginning of this year i had to stop communication with him just so i could focus before my parents made me sign up for college . so i made my first 20k and they agreed to not let me go , it  s been nothing but uphill from there , making more and more money . honestly i get kinda depressed sometimes about stuff but i  m just glad i  m not being molded into just another gear for the corporate machine . i have the ability to support my self and i can be independent in life . so this was my first year technically of being an entrepreneur and self employed and it  s definitely worth it , i wouldn  t even consider myself antisocial but more goal oriented than most people . hope this helps for anyone reading luv ya lol

18. if you have trouble keeping on top of things perhaps buy a calendar from a store mark out specific tasks like say for example put down dusting  vacuuming every two weeks , changing out your sheets  pillowcases once a week etc etc . hang it on the back of your closet where you keep your vacuum and cleaning supplies . after a while you ' ll form new habits and can get rid of the calendar .
