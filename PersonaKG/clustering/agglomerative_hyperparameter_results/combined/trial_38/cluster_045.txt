12. i started posting because i was lonely , horny and bored , i guess it ' s a mild exhibitionism as knowing people see my pictures and might get off to them is a huge turn on . no face in my pics yet though my eye is my profile picture , one person knows i post nsfw pics . i ' ve been contacted . by direct chat maybe digit times , mostly men complimenting me and flirting , and i thank them for their kind words as they ' re little boosters in self image for a short time . i have however been told by direct that that someone used my cock pics to kinda catfish girls on tinder which is why i started adding my username to pictures .

14. nice list though duplicating some of the requests earlier to the normal maps app . i  m sure if they bring them then they  ll bring it to both this one and the maps app . on another note , i recently submitted most of this feedback to not just the apple feedback site , but also to eddy cue as he  s the svp of maps among many other things . you might wanna do so too so it likely gets better prioritized as imho few from the teams read our postings here .
