   (ID: 7fcbabb8b5590a9f0879c20f0dc6ce0b503615d3)

   (ID: ed8c4bb1975edb0f627baa6dac44e74cbc7237c6)

4. i put this in vacuum to have an easier fight to determine . if the brits and norwegians intervene i could argue that the russian could launch far more than digit tu  22m ' s and digit mig  digit ' s , they could launch digit times that and launch even more kinds of aircraft . then i could launch all remaining submarines of the northern fleet along digit aging tu  digit bears armed with even more stand  off missiles . let ' s just say that if this fight is not in a vacuum this would be a total clusterfuck with hundred of aircraft on each side along dozens upon dozens of subs and surface combatants . little counter edit to yours  well , what would be the point of making this thread if no one knows where the enemy is ? if i didn ' t make the scenario this way the winner would obviously be the first one to know where the other is . this is  whowouldwin afterall . maybe switch the virginias for another sub ? i honestly picked random subs for each side since i don ' t know much about subs , i like surface vessels a lot more .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

5. more like why a queen ? how do you people still have kings and queens like it ' s the middle ages ? it ' s ridiculous .
   (ID: 54182f6e08cc212d89e66f7640449d6fa9717bd9)

6. yes that might work . what if there were objectives that needed to be accomplished on each platform , so people would need to dismount and do them .
   (ID: dccaef8a6226163d8d10afb2d04eb5a7babea832)

7. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

8. nope , i like being able to walk off whenever i feel like it and i appreciate the freedom it gives employers .
   (ID: f39e591889b6331bd255039773030c1b50c7e201)

9. because what  s the point in buying a phone most these days are based on looks that looks good just to cover it up and at the end of the day it  s a phone , i don  t give a shit about it after digit weeks
   (ID: abd2d3c15975e586b4b74794df81b7ac62b7f321)

10. i leave them on cause i like to carry people and when i put up posts on discord or the destiny app so people can message me so i can help in comp
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

11. i have the same question , they are useless
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

12. so if you go to a restaurant with shitty food and cry about it . remember it doesn ' t matter since they are a private business they have a right to serve shitty food .
   (ID: abf75f77636a74f3ad337cbd0a59bf507e662343)

13. i felt the same way in the past . but maybe the fact there is no objective point is a good think ! you can choose to do something or absolutely nothing .
   (ID: cae6d1fb1a818280e66de4a71148560d2d217d70)

14. what if someone  else wanted you dead ? is it okay if they put money aside ? what if we get it government funded by taxes ? what if all the killing makes a profitable business and we establish and industry based on it ? what if it then becomes the thing to do , the norm ? this is a great idea . thank you . i will find more people that want to kill meat eaters so we can set this up . would anyone be interested in investing in my business before the shares skyrocket ?
   (ID: 98df62eadd0a0c80a6084d5e352985209b46cce9)

15. maybe . it depends on the response of the members . what do you think ?
   (ID: ac53f9ce173965984299f3686335a39bc2a5810f)

16. i know it  s needed so i respect all the workers , without them i cant go get a maccas cheeseburger at 2am . it  s justs not for me working all my life , i want to do something else where i can work in my own time . i  m being picked up as brand ambassador , so things like that
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

17. what for if you don ' t mind ?
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

18. i wondered that myself . i can only think of it being a further stress relief .
   (ID: 1413da4d65544a15a55a7323945fa06ed3f67f4a)

19. why not just let them have the light on ?
   (ID: 8f7369c6ebb47df350fec663be46dfd8481ee2db)

20. so basically the only reason is so that people don ' t do the same to you later ? not that they have any individual value or right to a seat , just they are some sort of " karma points " for you .
