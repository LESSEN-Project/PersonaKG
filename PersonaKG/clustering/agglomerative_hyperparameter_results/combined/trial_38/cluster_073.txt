17. never asked for your pity fuck face nor did i ever suggest i was a good guy you did suggest however that i was a bad guy . blindly follow orders ? really guy are you for real ? there is a fucking huge difference between blindly following orders and doing a fucking job without bitching like a pampered millennial cum dumpster . i ' m sick of asshats like you making assumptions about the intentions of a fucking soldiers enlistment . my job pointless i ' m pretty sure quite a few families would be proud to know their lives are pointless . maybe we shouldn ' t be there but people are being killed but that doesn ' t matter to you because they are not americans right ? so me stopping tali from murdering husbands raping wives and kidnaping children and turning them into sex slaves is pointless ? irregardless of why i was sent there in the first place it ' s still pointless because it ' s not your family . ok thanks for the clarification .
