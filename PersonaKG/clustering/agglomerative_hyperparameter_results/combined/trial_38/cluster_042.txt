6. the good ones always have a particular , well  drawn mood . they push your entertainment tension and mind to somewhere it hasn  t been before , and hence they make you feel a way you haven  t felt before . to be a good horror movie director you have to possess very precise control of your craft . the timing has to be just right . there  s a careful balance of lingering on a shot juuussst too long just to give each scene that extra tension and to trigger the audiences  imagination . same goes for the type of shots . the beautiful thing about horror movies is that the scariest part is what you as a viewer imagines is about to happen , because your imagination knows exactly what you  re afraid of . the director makes you do your own scaring , and that requires massive levels of finesse . if you ask me
