   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

   (ID: 5d032deb25ff976c97c846d4d1073b0e71b447a3)

18. it feels like home . you have another person who makes you feel safe , calm , and like you have a purpose . sure , they can still piss you off and annoy you , but at the end of the day you know it ' s ride or die and that you two would still do anything for each other . even if you lose everything else , you ' ll still have that person , and that makes everything okay again .
   (ID: f0d30d31e879077978622dde48ddd9e0f254b33d)

19. okay , seriously , my direction sense is so bad i ' d be lost in my own city . also , i haven ' t been out , so i don ' t know much anyway .
   (ID: 2c5816cbbee60e3c348eb04900ea7453604cff82)

20. if you want good advice be willing to spend upwards of  digit each . depending on the size of your group that should be enough of get you a hotel on the strip , entry into a day club , entry into two night clubs with bottle service , and enough for some rippers after each night club night , and of course food and pre alcohol too for each day . some say bottle service is not worth it but it really depends how big your group is , if you got a group bigger than digit i think it ' s totally worth it . girls are way easier to meet at the clubs this way and they almost always will stick with your group when the party is over and you move to the rippers at the end of the day . rippers also are more reluctant to a push private dances on you when girls are in your group which is good cause you will get fleeced with private dances . having a hotel on the strip will save you money on transportation and also if a girl asks you what hotel you are staying at you will be judged if you say strat or the other cheap hotels away from the strip . stick with mgm , new york , ph , aria , even monte carlo . go for a range of clubs , xs has a pretty sweet day club , omnia is pretty upscale night club , and pic and go to a more washed out night club as well such as tao . this ensures you will meet a good range of girls to spend the night with .
