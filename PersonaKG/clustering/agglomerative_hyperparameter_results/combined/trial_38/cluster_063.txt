8. yeah , this makes a lot of sense . when it ' s some kind of leather armor , sure , you need to go kill an animal with magic skin or whatever . but if it ' s metal armor and they need a biological reagent to make it , maybe they use the reagent in a ritual , or maybe they put it in the fire that they heat the metal with , imbuing it with magical properties . i guess it never occurred to me when making daedric armor in skyrim and it asks for a daedra heart , that they were ever actually banging away on the heart itself with a hammer on an anvil .
