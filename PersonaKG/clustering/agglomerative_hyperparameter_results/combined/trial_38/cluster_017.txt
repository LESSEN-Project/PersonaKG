1. wanted to ask this to my best friend ' s girlfriend who is also my best friend what she likes and doesn ' t like about me . i have trouble talking with her anyway because i ' m an awkward person . i ' ve tried to gain confidence , but it just never works out
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

2. no not all of them . just the ones who suck and are losers . some people are a  ok they just like being alone and that ' s cool too .
   (ID: 840f5d9bddf24e024b9a70f13cdde62d41604e77)

3. the way i see it either everything matters or nothing does . it ' s up to you . life it ' s not about where you end up it ' s about getting there that ' s were the beauty is .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

4. love has a different meaning for everyone i suppose , because everyone thinks love is definable by certain words . not me tho , i think we can ' t define it . we can only feel its presence or absence . then again , just me blurting out some spiritually enlightening nonsense as always . love is so multiple meanings . love is so call  it  what  you  want . so free , you know ? such a wordless mess that has everything from suffering to healing .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

5. if you do raise a child i recommend coming out to them to normalize it . of course , everyone has different comfort levels , but it  s just a thought . also , the only people that should know your gender identity are the ones that you want to know . if that list is just your husband , then that  s perfectly fine !
   (ID: 12803a9aad224d0537b68ab83a6cdc6a45d3160f)

6. because they like to tell me i ' m not doing enough with myself , even though nobody asked them .
   (ID: 8b9c4341d896783998a7c3485fa949b3c63cbd73)

7. i think im going to try to introduce myself like " what ' s up im addison , my friends call me aj " because addison itself is a pretty feminine name but it ' s the only one i could get by with bc of my unsupportive parents
   (ID: 7e58269155b84bc057025d5066e661ba2eb934ba)

8. fuck yeah , i love my friends and family but there  s a whole universe out there
   (ID: f9e9b1e6c59393102159142841e750ea90023928)

9. hate to respond with a question , but why do you think a purpose in life , etc . , is necessary to keep going ? purposelessness is not the same as agony . i don ' t think there ' s much of a point to my existence or that my life will have a lasting impact on the world , let alone the universe in any way whatsoever , but that doesn ' t mean i can ' t get some enjoyment out of it regardless .
   (ID: 02373263cff49259e87b0a96214a8ea7f4fbfc93)

10. don ' t waste even a single weekend with doing nothing unless you ' re ill or in physical pain . don ' t end up only focusing on work , appreciate the time with your family and friends and do some workout regularly . some people tend to become lazy and eat a lot of fastfood . and always have one thing in mind  what would my future me think about my past decisions ? do something before it ' s too late .
   (ID: cf8f8a2557f2bf6694dda14a6d2664e1ea6e36b7)

11. my best advice  avoid the situation and be put to bed immediately to minimise your chance of slipping up . you can deny all you want , when you  re younger it  s called survival . just remember to always work towards being the best version of yourself and you  ll see how much sexuality really matters . the people you have yet to meet , the friends and family you  ll love . you  re the one that can open the door , when you  re ready . i say this cause i can relate to being there myself about digit years ago , living my best gay life as a digit y  o online .
   (ID: e5d0bb05742c6f7a9fca52d483dad13871b861d0)

12. this hits too close to home . i hope you ' ll find your peace with it . we all deserve the best we can get . more times than not what we want is the best we can get . why life takes exactly that , is a question that will remain unanswerd .
   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

13. i don ' t think the issue here is that you asked for his last name . maybe you should just take his words at face value  that it ' s taken so long to actually meet up , that he ' s lost interest . but to answer your question  i personally don ' t usually like to give out my full name to someone before meeting them because of social media stalking . i mean it ' d be pretty hard for anyone to stalk me anyways because i don ' t use my full name anywhere besides facebook and my setting for that is pretty restricted , but still . also why did you feel the need to know his full name anyways ?
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

14. start by not giving a shit about what other people think of you . do what you need to do for yourself . learn to say " no " more often without the repercussions of other people ' s feelings . the rest will come naturally .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

15. yeah . i feel as much , though my friends think i passed up a fairly likely opportunity .
   (ID: 75ca79d6c5cfc50533ff56cde25edfb593ae8568)

16. north korea ' s goal is state survival . they believe nuclear weapons ensure that no country will attempt to remove them . they will likely never use them under the current system , barring a direct attack from another nation potentially . even then it is questionable .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

17. being able to question our own existence
   (ID: 1497e82ba6e08f938dadf0885a6fd8051c0758d1)

18. if u say ur attractive i  ll take ur word for it . do guys ur age ever ask u out on a date or try to get ur number ? i  m not sure if this is actually true , but it seems that attractive girls don  t get approached very often because they are intimidating
   (ID: f8f6a1dd8b47dc3239c55ec87aa3bbd108a04a43)

19. i slowly walk up to him .  it  s like . digit in the morning , mom . what the fuck are you doing now ?
   (ID: 1e92f1e007a1c147f8200d50f473d5433028bffc)

20. all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be  so i guess what i  m saying is breathe . enjoy each breath and take it for what it is . you  re not in the past and if you keep looking back you  ll never enjoy today . and life is a beautiful thing that you don  t want to let pass by . i don  t know if that will help but it  s the advice i can give . best of luck
