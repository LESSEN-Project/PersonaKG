15. the outside of the house is great ! i noticed you had a chimney on the inside connecting to the furnace  it looks confusing to the eye , maybe try it out as a straight up and down chimney or change it to a different stone . i like the path on the outside . maybe add some hedging or flowers to the outside , clear out the natural landscape a tiny bit and add your own artificial one maybe . otherwise i like the style

   (ID: d12326d948c77fb593c0c928081304135cb79ed4)
