   (ID: e8fea87ced4a86b7ba9c50ae33cf5b3dda99af88)

2. yeah that ' s what i was also thinking about , like i understand it was declutter but she kept saying how much she loved it and how good it was , i thought it was a tad wasteful tbh and she wouldn ' t of been able to sell it or give it to a friend as it was so used . yeah i think if it ' s a tutorial you could just show the colour and i ' m sure unless it ' s the rarest colour ever majority of people would have the exact same colour or similar in their collection .
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

6. try to advertise as much but in a nice and respectful way on big trending channels where you ' ll most likely be noticed , i do the samei don ' t really ask ppl to sub to me but they do tho and i ' ve gotten almost digit subs already in a few months , also try to make content on what ' s popular right now and add as many tags in the desc of your videoif you add really many tags your video might even become the 1st shown for a specific search
   (ID: a443986595c715cd541cd3925619cb6f1e8ada83)

7. I am planning.
   (ID: db2795e3479f3abf3fd16c22a2bea9450ad82357)

8. i was waiting for this to come up . i knew there had to be a documentary about ny taxis and uber . do you remember or can find the name of the one you watched ? i ' m genuinely interested . i do not live inna place even remotely similar and i have taken precisely digit taxis in my entire life , so i am genuinely fascinated by this whole topic .

16. don ' t forget to post your results . there might be a wilkinson cameras or something near you too , and they sometimes have good varieties of film in stock . i ' d probably advise to shoot a few rolls normally like that before diving into home development , if for no other reason than it takes a big factor out of the process and it ' s one less thing to go wrong i . e . if the pics come out dodgy , you know it ' s going to be the camera rather than your development
   (ID: e2865528dd17e86320ca523d3db462efa29e7ca7)

17. try this one . hope you like it !

   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

19. sure , it ' s not too much work after all . i have dittos of all natures .
   (ID: 9b58219d8f43f5aa6e34770c7b9c7896c88c8fe7)

20. we welcome everyone to help with all our community projects ! i may type boldly at you if you deviate from the blueprints that are in my head thus only i can see them . but for now , this project is on hold . we are on a temporary map after the beta update . once we are on our permanent map , i ' ll get going again on it .
