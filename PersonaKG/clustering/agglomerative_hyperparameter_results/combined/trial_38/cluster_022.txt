9. so no debt from college and free healthcare , plus  42k a year net income ? that ' s not bad . my question would be is it even worth trying to excel in your job and get promoted and a raise because even if you got to  84k with the tax rate you ' d probably be making the same net income , right ?
   (ID: 73c241755308e15ea272f3060f9c0a430c541f1a)

10. the thieves guild found when me when i was a young child on the streets of taichan , the wide slums adjacent to the walled capital city samhai . at some point in those first few years they found that i didn ' t trip magical alarms and that made me much more valuable to them . i became a burglar as a child while the other children were pickpockets , ascending quickly to a middle ranking position by the time i was thirteen years old . however then things became a little strange . magic is typically an endeavor of the wealthy . magic books are expensive and complicated magic is usually learned in the academy in samhai . but nearly everyone of a certain age learns some piece of magic . there is an internal force that takes time to develop and usually begins to express itself with puberty . in strong magicians it finds ways to come out , like sparks from their fingertips or burping fire . if those magicians are found in taichan they are whisked off to samhai to be adopted by powerful families and trained in magic . even the thieves guild will make deals and surrender their talented magicians . this is why i began magic lessons at thirteen . most other burglars used magic constantly to evade magical defenses . i had never needed it , and just focused on quietly slipping through the house and identifying valuables . a part of me didn ' t believe my job was dangerous until i saw a veteran burglar ripped apart by magical wolves in a house in samhai . i wanted as much protection as possible after that and sought magic instruction immediately . the problem was , i couldn ' t do magic . everyone laughed when they heard and joked that it was good i was a talented thief because i wouldn ' t get anywhere in high society . over time however , and through my own small experiments , i learned that not only was i incapable of preforming magic , i seemed immune to it . i put my finger into a magical flame , had the best con artist in the guild try an illusion on me , didn ' t even feel the attacks from our best combat magician . at this point everyone was amazed and sort of unsure of how to treat me . even our leader was perplexed . " see , i ' m sure the academy wants you , but for what ? i ' m just as sure you wouldn ' t want to be their lab rat . " oren said . he and i were alone in his office , part of the tunnel network underneath taichan . " they would pay me for you , but you make that much every digit months . i would be a fool to give you up . in fact , i think this means we can go bigger . " " what do you mean , bigger ? " the image of ghostly wolves ripping into theo ran through my head . " i mean what ' s the one target we have never hit before ? " oren said . " there are two , " i frown , " the academy and the king . either one would be a terrible idea . " " i meant the academy . the king ' s guard has swords and spears , i ' m pretty sure you aren ' t immune to those . " " but you don ' t know if there ' s magic in the academy we ' ve never seen before . i don ' t really want to push my luck . besides , what ' s to stop them from destroying all of taichan and our tunnels if they wanted to ? " " only one thing . the thing you ' d be going there to steal . ruan ' s stone . " great prompt ! i might write a part digit if there ' s interest .

11. you pretty much get forced to use itunes if you want to download things
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

12. i hate streaming movies , the quality no matter how good your internet is almost always is worse than the physical copy . another reason i don  t use it is because there have been times at my friends house that we want to watch a movie but he only streams so if his internet is out and it happens pretty often , he  s pretty cheap we can  t watch anything .

15. watching documentaries , listening to lectures , and researching topics that are of interest to me . the same things i spend my time doing now but i ' d have an expensive apartment , wear expensive clothes , etc .
   (ID: 22f14b68675078048f36403bb14291f2d10864a3)

16. i guess it just depends on how strong the wish is and somebody would consider a song . if someone considers the song the same even if it is slightly different , it still might be erased . on the other hand , if it was considered a completely different song , every different recording of that song would save but one , not even allowing someone to profit off of the song , as it is already famous .

17. it ' s designed to make you smart enough to work for someone or start your own business , but keep you dumb enough not to question why the fuck you ' re there doing the shit , and why the fuck its get a job , get a house , fuck a bitch shoot out babies send them to daycare

20. yea once someone goes to the us they maybe realize its just like home in many ways . some ppl succed some fail , hard work and attitude goes a long way . as do network and contacts . my imageand i could be wrong is that your results  efforts  input will determine your position in us to a larger degree than in europe . here in europe if yoyour parents know the right person they can hook you up with a fairly good job . having said that , i dont know any country that would be easy to transfer too where competition is not hard . im sure ppl are working their ass of in poor countries aswell .
