1. online dating is a confusing beast . for one thing , people generally are slightly less attractive than their least flattering picture .    in terms of feeling comfortable around beautiful women , i think the only solution is lots of experience and feedback . meaning   after you spend enough time around beautiful women you should learn to to control the physiological cues that make us feel insecure like a job interview   hands sweaty , heart racing , etc .    you ' ll begin to realize they ' re just normal people looking to connect , and as you receive feedback , i ' d say it ' s important to recognize what does and doesn ' t work when you ' re the slightly less attractive one   in general you will be more attractive to these women when she can tell you are not " thirsty "   that is to say , you feel at ease with the idea that you might not be for her and you ' re also vetting her . this in itself should resolve a lot of the anxiety of rejection , because the essence of this attitude is that it ' s okay if the person doesn ' t work out . obviously , if the relationship moves into something more committed , this framework no longer applies . read this by mark manson . his book titled " models " also has some great insights into understanding attraction . p . m . me if you want a link for the book here ' s how one section of that book begins , which is true ! " show me someone who is successful at anything and i  ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know . show me a guy , any guy , who is good with women , and i  ll show you a guy who has been shut down by more women than you can possibly imagine "

   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

15. no . but being clean taking a shower helps . ladies like it when a fella listens to what they have to say , and treats them like a friend . smiling , saying nice things , and validating their feelings really helps . something that i think that most incels fail to realize is that ladies get lonely too . they get bullied even worse them fellas do . plus , when it comes to sex , they have to worry about being seriously hurt . i mean put in the hospital with injuries hurt . if you hope to one day achieve your wildest fantasy , you will first have to learn how to treat them . not frightening them is a good 1st step . incels that i  ve talked to prescribe to ideas that are frightening to ladies .
