15. christmas day with my family and my girlfriend . my sister insulted my girlfriend at the dinner table . i immediately experienced what i can only describe as pure rage .   x200b  i quite literally saw red . as in , everything became tinged red . i got up from my chair and made it around to the other side of the table where my sister was without any conscious thought of what i was doing .   x200b  when i got to her my sister i just sort of stopped and looked at here with a kind of angry bewilderment . i hadn ' t make any conscious decision to hurt her or yell at her or anything so i didn ' t know what to do . i ended up just going back to my chair and not saying anything .   x200b  i honestly don ' t know what other people at the table thought i was doing .   x200b  as an aside , i had always thought that " seeing red " was just an expression until it happened to me that one time .   x200b  in the many years since that happened , nothing has ever made me that angry .

16. the fact that he is threatening you is very worrisome . if it ' s your house , you need to get him out before he starts to act on those threats . even if it means having the police come escort him . if it ' s his house , you need to just leave . go stay with friends or family . at this point , your safety should be top priority . also , if he threatened you and then went immediately into sad pup mode , it sounds like he ' s trying to manipulate you . don ' t let him . manipulators will say or do anything to get their way . and when it stops working is when the violence starts . you might have to keep the pants on just a little longer to boss him out the door ! but i hope everything works out for you . good luck .

20. lol seriously ? " replace soon . devilsaur will have you set for at least digit months . at least . first off , you must be some sort of total noob if you think raid gear just falls into your lap when you start farming mc  bwl . you can go weeks without getting a piece off a raid boss . i think spending digit  500g on two pieces of gear that you ' ll use for several months is a solid deal and incredibly wise . in fact , i wouldn ' t even want to raid with someone who is so stupid to think digit  hit  digit  crit  74ap is only marginally better than windrunner legguards and pre  buff t1 gloves because simply put , devilsaur is far superior . this isn ' t exactly college level math we ' re dealing with here , you sound like a total moron .
