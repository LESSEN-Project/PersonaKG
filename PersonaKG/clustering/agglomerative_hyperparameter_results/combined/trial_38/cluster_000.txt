   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

7. " as intelligence goes up , happiness goes down "  lisa simpson and she ' s pretty fuckin ' smart . i ' m no expert but , it depends what you mean by intelligence . high iq doesn ' t necessarily mean someone is more intelligent has more general knowledge and vice versa . someone that knows everything there is to know about , say , history would obviously be very intelligent but who ' s to say they ' re more " intelligent " than someone that knows bits about lots of things . i did some brief research and apparently there ' s no correlation with suicide rates and higher intelligence but suicide and depression are different things . tl  dr it seems that way from my experience but i can ' t say for sure . you probably just notice it more in more intelligent people .
   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

8. it  s unclear what knowledge , or lack thereof , hannity is using to make his prediction . i hadn ' t listened to hannity in almost a decade , so i first asked the question " how the fuck does this putz know any damn thing about the inside of that administration "  phone calls between hannity and trump are frequent occurrences , discussing everything from hannity  s show to trump  s frustration with the mueller investigation and to what the president should tweet , according to more than a dozen friends , advisers and associates of trump and hannity who told the washington post in april . oh . you know , somehow this seems worse than trump being a fan of alex jones . at least he ' s widely known as a crackpot yelling from the fringe . hannity is still , somehow , mainstream .
   (ID: 73a501f273781aa2c0deb878ecb02dcab3a9d4d3)

9. you need to get on this ride . i have been on it for like digit years and every single day he makes me laugh . every single day he outdoes himself . it ' s like he ' s in a competition to be the stupidest person in history and he ' s miles ahead of everyone else .

   (ID: 77d0324af3e030bb9fb9365a16e870bd522fd275)

16. cause trump would think of funny names for them like " beto the creepo " and " bad touch biden , " steal their thunder at every turn and make it hard to take them seriously . p . s . i didnt bother thinking up a name for bernie because hes too old to make it to digit .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)
