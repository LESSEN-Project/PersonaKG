1. i only say oof to my closer friends and it  s because i don  t know what to say at the time , because i am in the same boat .
   (ID: 404d4f663681fcf738d043296148ae4de655b22b)

2. honestly , i ' ve thought about this too much , i would start work at the food  dessert place as a waitress they frequently visit and get to know all the familiar customers and if i hear a comment about someone doing something disastrous . i ' ll get the said person to refer them to the said shop and i ' ll poison them . it ' s doesn ' t ever link back to knowing the person personally or anything either .
   (ID: 3737c6c8726b12f17da2de38c32a6c19123f9a4a)

3. middle school , when it stopped being fun and became annoying .
   (ID: 24d2489761902de9148fe06d43ec8d7e34c8e35b)

4. this was at my old school and now i  m really regretting not posting it when it happened . as amazing as it is to see it on reddit , it was way more funny in person .
   (ID: 97a098bef8517b2080cad8aa73f738b95e795b18)

5. i once had to complete an assignment in like january and the due date was november . i started the assignment in november
   (ID: 84a0b9e5d9e0e37c98f992c96c029f6ec99fb1ca)

6. don ' t say " it ' s cool " to something you feel is not cool , better to say nothing , in my opinion . if i had been in your position i think i would have said something like " don ' t apologize to me , apologize to him . " and continued on my way . the time or two that i have seen a parent enter that electrified frustration zone i ' ve offered to help by saying " we ' ve all been there , are you okay , can i help ? " usually when the kid sees that someone else has noticed they ' ll stop the misbehavior and quiet down really fast . it also breaks the parent ' s tension . i think it ' s very cool that a digit year old would ask this question . i think your parents probably did a good job raising you and i think that someday you ' ll make a good parent too .
   (ID: 1293e72aa7301baf0ecb3a2509e46cdcca834cd9)

7. nah . old people are notorious for speaking their minds , as are iranians in my experience , and there ' s even a chance the neighbour was just venting frustrations on you about their own children they don ' t see . you work a lot and still made time to go see your parents who live a few hours away , your not a bad son by any means well , no means relevant to the story anyways . and had clearly reached a breaking point for strangers bullshit . the neighbour obviously shouldn ' t have said anything that confrontational but realistically probably had no idea that western culture frown upon chastising strangers .
   (ID: 4654e3a9a75835f9ff28170ddf31d5d3cf296ea2)

8. that  s a ridiculous statement based purely on your own experience . if you were bullied at both do you see a pattern ? don  t blame the schools
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

9. i ' d say lie about it , your idea of having to pick someone up at the airport is a really good viable excuse given that it ' s the holidays , people may be flying in at weird hours , etc . the one thing i would say about lying though is that if you guys post pictures or run into any coworker ' s or anything while out they could catch you in the lie . i don ' t know where you work so i may be totally off base in saying this but i work retail too and it ' s not ever , ever busy that late at night , even on weekends . if you ' re a good employee i imagine they wouldn ' t be too mad about letting you leave an hour early , you could always start by saying " oh can i leave an hour early i have a prior commitment " and then if they ask you could give the excuse , you never know what they ' ll say before you ask , really . you could even make sure to do extra work or make sure your work would be adequately covered by those already there before you ask .
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

10. so you ' re clearly letting it bother you and they notice that right ? people like that feed off of your response . you have to learn how to not let it bother you .

11. when my dad started to cook food , my mom stayed in a hospital for a month , and god bless him he cooked food for us , it was bad at the start but after it , he improved over the years .
   (ID: 09c182da66e9fb276d5bb24506e24997b2c988b0)

12. yes , i feel like people will think i am so gross if i go in the toilet and don ' t flush . i have no idea why i have the feeling that people care so much . lol
   (ID: 44f5ba2e2e79c07f77ae334e708119f166a6aca0)

13. exactly . once school ended i hung out with different people due to thankfully cut ties and am now actively included . it  s still taking a lot of getting used to digit . digit years later , but it  s good to feel wanted . honestly it they  re gonna be like that they can go f  ck themselves because that is not how you treat friends . the fact that you  re the  token girl  of the group makes that all the more inappropriate on their part . hope you find a really good close group of friends who fit the gap perfectly
   (ID: b4e4c05c47c7939661297c7f0b909e47f4ef628e)

14. it gives me anxiety because i feel like a presence , but i don ' t want to look like a office with what i have to say or share .
   (ID: 472084017072e7ced5fed0827bae57ba801d9b7d)

15. just started my second year and my old friends ditched me cause the thought i was weird , and they didn  t have a good rep so people think i  m a douche
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

16. i ' m pretty proud of my daughter . she ' s done more on her own than i could ever imagine myself doing . she never took the easy way out of anything .
   (ID: 74cc8b596c27cbe385709690baaf3b68f39b3915)

17. i disagree with this article . i think " thank you " and " i ' m sorry " are sometime necessary acknowledgements of the fact that someone else exists   a person who has their own thoughts and feelings and things to do . i don ' t expect my kid to feel some kind of heartfelt gratitude for me getting them a glass of milk but i do expect my actions to be acknowledged with a polite " thank you " . i ' m in favor of politeness as a social norm . by telling a kid that this is a situation requiring a polite action you help instill the fact that other people matter .
   (ID: 1293e72aa7301baf0ecb3a2509e46cdcca834cd9)

18. oh for sure , rote learning has its merits , but i think it ' s devalued when there is very little opportunity to experiment with and apply the " internalized " subject matter . being able to spew out chemical reaction calculations but never getting to see a condensate form in a beaker is pretty short  sighted . being able to recite the party  approved and mandated history of the world , word  for  word as written in the vetted text  book , and then think hitler was admirable , is also another troubling one . and the one that i see a lot   being able to write sentence after sentence of grammatically perfect , decontextualized " present perfect progressive " and then not being able to use it accurately where it would naturally occur in conversation or discourse .
   (ID: 5b02e2fd29e743c4c80de2b0919a03d95400c23a)

19. i  m sorry i don  t know you or your sister or the situation enough to give you advice that will fix everything . it sounds like you have some remorse over your actions but i have no idea if it  s too much or not enough . i can say a short letter might be the best solution if you think a direct confrontation might make things worse . understand you have no control over other people  s reactions only what you do . focusing on how you feel bad for your actions but also including why you  re angry in a way that focuses on your own feelings may be a good idea .

20. similar , my elder got diagnoses asd when digit . digit yrs old . i was digit months pregnant with smallest . smallest is digit and just been diagnosed adhd elder is non verbal but can communicate using a tablet and pecs picture exchange communication system software . while his autism is profound and he is unlikey to live fully independently he ' s still a bundle of joy and the most placid kid ever . smallest opposite i often worry how smallest is affected by the adjustments we have to make for his brother .
