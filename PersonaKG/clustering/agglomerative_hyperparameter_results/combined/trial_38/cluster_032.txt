11. holy sheets face  with  open  mouth this is the first time someone has responded intellectually and respectfully to me when i let it be known in a trump supporter . i have been in this politics arena since grade school , along with world history , from the time it was introduced to me as a child . i absolutely love these two topics . but i hate so much that we can no longer talk about these things . everyone loves to speak on the at  right extremism . but i become a racist or bigot when i point out left  wing extremist like karl marx and what his ideology brought about in places like russia less then digit years ago . i just want to point out to people that we are playing with fire with these semantics being thrown about on a whim . a intelligent person could never believe that the german population would support a fascist extremist who would murder perhaps digit million jews . but a seed of hate was planted a decade prior . during the depression . in the 30s the jews were made to be the villains because of their " wealth and privilege " so later when the gov started rounding these people up , nobody cared to help . this is what the seed of division brings us . history proves it hundreds of times over . we are americans , but when they divide us we are the nobody ' s they ' ve made us . skin color means nothing , wealth means nothing , sexual orientation means nothing , sex means nothing . they are all tools of division so we have to look to them for the solution . if the whites were gone perhaps the blacks could finally prosper . if the guns were gone perhaps the murders will stop . if everyone had health care perhaps nobody would get sick and die from silly shit . if we had open borders perhaps everyone could freely share in the american dream . but do you think that once the whites were gone the " elites " would stop telling the blacks they are victims ? i don ' t think so , then they would lose their control . if you belive they have some kind of control if we take away the guns , are we taking away the carnal desire to murder as well ? and will the government protect us and empower us , or would they stand on our necks ? i don ' t want to know . if we provide healthcare for all , who ' s in charge of that ? how much will it cost ? and why would it cost that ? they say digit trillion , but why ? why is a blood test digit  why is a x  ray digit , digit  ? if the government can force me to pay digit  income tax for healthcare for all . then why the hell can ' t the government force the doctors and hospitals to drop their prices to make universal healthcare affordable and not a pipe dream ? if we open the borders and let everyone enjoy the american dream . the simple fact is , the consequences of that are we will no longer be able to provide an " american dream " to anyone . this is the best place on earth because we have the best people on earth in between its borders . not everyone is good for you , not everyone belongs here with the best . plain and simple . regular life experiences proves this . the fact that we have prisons prove this . i ' m truly saddened . i ' m saddened my the left and the right . donald trump came in as a man who could turn things around for conservatives . an outsider with outside ideas , and outside money . democrats need someone to step up and take the reigns as well . that ' s the only way of beating trump in digit . a strong outsider , not influenced by nancy and chuck . there ' s is a vacuum that needs to be filled . i pray for the sake of the world it isn ' t someone like ocasio  cortez from ny .
   (ID: fa749ff7262da656e34f21f4b902bd5287bf224d)

12. i don ' t believe in a god that would allow a world like this . you can do what you want but i doubt itll change anything . if there is a god it ' s obvious he couldnt give two shits about me or millions of other people for that matter .
   (ID: f46d1bfdfed7fc05bbe39789c092019944471e9d)

13. well i mean its better to have a little anxiety and your shit taken away then to suffer your eyes and have them worsen as you get older . i say this as someone with anxiety
   (ID: 818422b560c80f37eedf14f771cd2fcd3657589a)

14. who makes that decision ? who determines what conditions or characteristics are fine and which are not ? disabled adults would be against this idea of yours . what makes you think you know better than they whether they have a right to live ? no , you ' re talking about babies , but babies don ' t get to be adults if you ' d have them euthanized first . this is a slippery slope that starts with ostensibly good intentions and ends with eugenics .
   (ID: 5146a89965a734a4d1ec9ec9145abae872a4569d)

15. so frustrating , we know all this , we know how the system works , how politics works , how nothing will change because those in a position to make a change get paid not to , and yet people won ' t rise up , we need to start a fucking revolt !
   (ID: 9e8a44f7c55ebce4785906436a033b33a1ccb949)

16. i suppose i could explain it to you like you are a digit year old . you can give people money but it doesn ' t change who they are . ever heard of a metaphor before ?
   (ID: 90492fed4b9d785ee43d655875f81a82e68a1263)

17. what the fuck ? i wonder if these kinds of people ever take a step back to question their insanity and then go ahead and do the crazy shit anyway . or if they do question themselves , what sort of stuff do they think is too crazy and don ' t follow through .
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

18. i would agree if that statement is true , however there is no war and the only reason they are getting in is because they are lying about it . i , and most others i assume , would support them coming here if there was something that was actually endangering them . plus they are coming here because they are not doing good in mexico which probably means they will not do well here and lead to more crime . letting them in would not help them it would just hurt them and us .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

19. well land plus seeds equals food , for fun and profit . what ' s the problem ?
   (ID: 85ac769b0cb349e567cb91e8109645bd1ac28b9f)

20. really ? we are going to punish people for making their bodies the best they can be ? where does this line stop ?
