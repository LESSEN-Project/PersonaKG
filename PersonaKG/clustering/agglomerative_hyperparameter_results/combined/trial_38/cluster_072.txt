1. the only really valuable mew card is mew gold star , and even then that ' s only around  digit . no idea what you ' re thinking of
   (ID: ad911088c8434d08c7a96c969a57a09b00f02e99)

2. i imagined it like this though . there is a camera following every single person on the planet , and they are the only ones making a movie about . it would have been a shit movie if it was one of the people who falls down the crumbly crack , so thats why they chose these guys . surely digit person out of 7billion would have a little luck
   (ID: 7d39153e3adadffd15e1638679c2e1cdc5c64fde)

3. that  s why i like youtube , at least kind of . i wish they would stop muting people for not being in the social norm
   (ID: 52e0e376c09b4862d8eea84ae547c3466a2aac4b)

4. i get why some people don ' t like the casting choices but why not give them a chance and at least watch some of their performances which by the way i can ' t find much for anya
   (ID: a5976f282a96c036f5e4d14957305323c9a5776d)

5. i like this . here is my take  professor hulk uses starks version of the infinity gauntlet to bring everyone back , captain america uses mjolnir to fight thanos , captain america finally says avengers assemble , and the combined avengers defeat thanos and his army . also , stark hugs peter when he sees him alive for the first time and peter says " huh , this is nice " . we even get a scene during the time travel sequence where the future captain america fights the past captain america . the captain america from the past says " i can do this all day " and the future captain america says " i know " . also , spoilers .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

6. it is . we even get a scene during the time travel sequence where the future captain america fights the past captain america . the captain america from the past says " i can do this all day " and the future captain america says " i know " .

7. your ' e not wrong . me and my friends started playing in season digit and now we basically win digit times out of digit with digit  kills . i can respect why your leaving and almost left as well the only reason i ' m still playing is carrying my friendsnot meaning to flex btw
   (ID: 84a0b9e5d9e0e37c98f992c96c029f6ec99fb1ca)

8. that feels like lazy writing to me . things on got are rarely black and white , so to have this mysterious storyline that ' s been developing for the entire series only to end abruptly with no explanation other than some stupid superhero movie villain arc destroy all of mankind mwahaha is a disservice to the entire show .
   (ID: 169c51cc138a4161080068ded4dcf87863ffee36)

9. what do you think elon  s been working on this whole time !
   (ID: 48327dfb7185a727925115986b0d0501d2999a36)

10. i would say that has some truth to it . shows and movies are getting more realistic and we realize that life doesn  t always have a happy ending but there  s still a story to be told . if look back to  50s   80s , almost every movie that depicts the future was very vibrant and colorful and everyone was happy . but in today  s cinema every time we see the future on screen it  s dark and dismal and destroyed . something to think about
   (ID: 18e18998471794de2ee0ded08a5f57a45a336e24)

11. exactly . anything that is voice activated has to " listen " and we all know about google searching turning into adverts on your device and tv television reddit isn ' t completely immune either i ' m starting to think , yesterday i commented on a sub talking about the royal british army  later that day an advert comes on my tv for the army  never seen it before and never seen it since .
   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

12. i ' m sure that ' s what they said about breaking bad
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

13. thanks for the clarification . so you ' re not too worried about the two friendly results this week ? how do you feel about your digit world cup group ?
   (ID: 3fb1292a0bd26711d797fe1a61e6229794c21b68)

14. expectations were also low for you in digit . you looked terrible in your friendlies , right before that world cup . we ' ll see what happens ! if you don ' t advance , i still think you ' ll do better than last time .
   (ID: 3fb1292a0bd26711d797fe1a61e6229794c21b68)

15. wow , not like you could do this if you pre downloaded destiny digit .
   (ID: aadf22a91ea1305681d9e9e51890c22ca2a37577)

16. this is literally what i ' ve been thinking this whole time . but this manga keeps throwing curve balls at me so it ' s probably wrong .
   (ID: 8764a223ca1af7d1792e76a58bf3b1209bf73ad3)

17. caillou . hands down . i know it ' s been said but consider this another vote for that annoying little shit . everyone i kno said the same thing as i do . kid watched a few episodes  started whining like caillou  that ' s it , no more caillou ! lol
   (ID: 445ba4596e4bcff0c96b23f038cf784185970198)

18. not close at all
   (ID: ba6e9b4e1f123022ebad3ecf22065f969929a346)

19. i think that  s the most you an get out of a single box . you can get up to digit in a big and digit in a mega if you  re super lucky , so hypothetically big boxes and mega boxes could pay for themselves .
   (ID: 26831d6557d17492ae3b0b54585b32e08055f834)

20. if you know anything about ceo ' s we have plenty of time to kill and this is more fun than playing golf . i don ' t care about helping your numbers . any complaints you get are your fault for hiding the merchandise while it devalues so you can buy it below cost and resell it on ebay . you are the reseller . i am just the advisor .
