" i ' m sorry . this is very upsetting . we have things in place so things like this don ' t happen . but you can see , mistakes can happen . thank you for bringing this to our attention . are you ok ? i can tell you ' re rightfully upset . here is a refund . i will alert my staff to take extra care in the future . i am so sorry this happened . i hope we can regain your trust " or something of the like . always say you ' re sorry , even if you ' re not the one who made the mistake . i have seen pharmacists that become completely defensive when they are told they have made a mistake . it always ends worse off than if they just said they were sorry and made the situation right . drives me bonkers .
