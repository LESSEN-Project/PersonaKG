1. after reading a lot of mmo forums and seeing a lot of crazy things yes , i do believe he was serious . if you think people don ' t have that viewpoint , you should put aside your own bias .
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

2. but isn ' t this the natural thing to do ? didn ' t evolution say the " hotter " girls are the ones to survive ? just as the more tough , brute force boys are to attract the girls ? denying this almost seems the same to me as trying to convince gay people they should be straight . i ' m all in favor of promoting intelligence , but then we end up with kids that sit behind computers or grow up and sit behind desks all day at work and slowly fatten and waste away . why can ' t we promote kids to be both good looking and smart ? self  esteem is important , both in your personal hygiene  grooming habits , and in your intelligence . i agree super  model only mentality is wrong , but we need a healthy balance , not a swing shift to the other extreme of how we talk to little girls . tell them they look good and they ' re smart .
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

5. how about you chop your hand off and do it yourself ?  nbsp  edit  i know how to run a joke into the ground when i see one .
   (ID: eab4b13c25e8e05018f7cb7159b0e36614341438)

6. well i suppose that ' s probably how a lot of the great stand  up comedians and voice actors started . i ' ll admit , doing it in front of strangers is probably going to be more nerve  wracking . i do some voices and crack jokes around people i know but i already know where i stand with them . doing it to get strangers to like me or to put food on the table would make me more nervous .
   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

   (ID: 5b59b30ecdf3a93e4634d1600b3020fd8e9dc7e2)

19. you kind of just do you own thing and not give a shit . you don ' t worry about developing a personality .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)
