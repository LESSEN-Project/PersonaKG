1. owo what ' s this
   (ID: 1b5b08f1246e450c7da09e40c81570fba378da84)

2. the thing is , lets say i buy your scc and you give me the info first , i log in and change the password , then send you the money , you could still take back the account super easily through epic support . you just have to give the email its on and it ' s old pass , then itll ask some questions that you ' d know ex  last digit digits of the cc used , rough estimate of when the acc was made , etc and say it was hacked . then you get it right back . i would have bought an account with every single exclusive skin purple skull , rr , ghoul , b . k . , etc by now if it was scam proof lol
   (ID: dd1a306ab5abb82ade20a2c7f74d928797a35a61)

3. just play the game and focus on those viewers who are chatting . the truth is , you will never know why people leave , they just do , for a wide variety of reasons . you will never retain digit  of the viewers who join your stream . focus on what you do well . watch your vods . improve on things you feel need improvement . growth will come .

20. you could just unfriend  delete the annoying people off of your feed , it leaves you with the people you actually give a shit about and means you can still at least have an active account should you need to use it in the future .
