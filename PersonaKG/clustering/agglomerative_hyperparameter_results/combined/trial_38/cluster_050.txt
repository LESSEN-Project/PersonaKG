1. so good you ' ll suck dick for it .   x200b  good rule of thumb when you think about trying something new , think about if people have sucked dick for it when they ran out . if the answer is yes then it ' s probably not a good idea .   x200b
   (ID: 258f707f4d4ef2a235c76e1a3f46df976a2e0270)

2. as long as you don  t tell anyone about the crush whatsoever , i  d say it  s not cheating . and i also don  t think you should have to completely cut off contact with the other person . you liked them for a reason so just stay good friends based on that friendship
   (ID: d53ad0bccb6d6f62bf1a4957708759d7b446498b)

5. it ' s a pretty niche fetish say unlike say piss play so the problem might be that if it ' s alright with him but he ' s not into it he ' ll just do it to please you and you probably won ' t enjoy the sexual aspects of it since you would want him to get off too on it . if it ' s just basic like diapers and goo goo gaga it ' s not too bad but if you want to go say umm full baby then that might be way too much for most people . plus who knows what his kinks are , he also might have something freaky too even if he seems totally vanilla . eventually you might ask do you have any fetishes and start with something lighter like says pits or underwear and see what he comes up with .
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

8. this is unsurprising since america ' s anti  abortion movement was largely kickstarted by a doctor who was upset that too many white women were choosing to abort in the late digit ' s  immigration , especially by catholics and nonwhites , was increasing , while birth rates among white native  born protestants were declining . unlike the typical abortion patient of today , that of the nineteenth century was a middle  or upper  class white married woman . would the west " be filled by our own children or by those of aliens " the physician and anti  abortion leader horatio r . storer asked in digit . " this is a question our women must answer  upon their loins depends the future destiny of the nation " source

9. dear lord , isn ' t this supposed to be the 21st century ? i have no problem with homosexuality and if either of my sons turn out to be gay , bi or whatever i would fully support them . i ' ve got gay colleagues , friends and relatives of both genders and you know what , they ' re just like any normal person . probably because they are . what people do in their bedroom is their business , no  one else ' s , and doesn ' t alter anything else about them . people need to stop being dicks .
   (ID: 2ac4d2cea574e655d7fdb1ab9b4886989929ca96)

10. abortion is a difficult topic . on the one hand nobody should be allowed to govern over the life of another . also , i guess adoption could be an option as well . on the other hand , it can be that someone was forcibly impregnated and isn  t ready for the extreme stress of carrying out a child . pregnancy can also interfere with jobs and get you suspended possibly . personally i can understand both sides and don  t really know what to think about this . but hey , these were just a few arguments i came up with on the fly so feel free to add your own . if anything i said is wrong , feel free to correct me . and also , sorry for the poor formatting . i  m on mobile .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

12. i like my women like i like my coffee . black , bitter , and leaves a lasting taste in my mouth .

15. doubt it . it  s hard to catch stocks at their bottom . and their track record seems to suggest they  ll keep making mistakes . if anthem takes off it could be a good bump for them though . there are better choices for undervalued stock out there , like baba
   (ID: faebbe18abd4d1c69e3bb9106178f797255444c5)

16. not been with a guy yet , how was it ?
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

17. how do you say you ' re pretty well sized and in the next sentence say how it has been problematic for you but my lizard brain still manages to ignore that and think  " damn , having a huge dong sounds great . " it ' s so ingrained .
   (ID: d7b75c00237dc445cdc3ebc380fbcb79a40b1a5f)

18. this is exactly what someone who has never gone down on a girl would say .
   (ID: a8b3c82ca36eb4e48fd6b6674a642f96d401743e)

19. for the same reason people don ' t call an apple a banana . or call a dog a cat . it ' s the wrong word and confusing . even if you do allow it where do you draw the line . people are already starting to want to identify with other animals , plants , inanimate objects , and fictional things . your biological sex kinda trumps your gender identity . with all that said , if you look the part i don ' t mind calling you whatever . if you wanna identify as a woman look like one . but don ' t get pissed when that one day you forget to shave that beard i refer to you as he or call you mister . same for women wanting to be a man . at the end of the day it ' s not really a big deal till someone makes it one . remember just because you want to be something or think you are something doesn ' t make it true . we usually refer to things like that as delusions or a mental disorder .
   (ID: 25ac51284c94eb6c58e189bbefc7f2bb9bb9e1b5)

20. if you want it , sure , i don ' t see why not .
