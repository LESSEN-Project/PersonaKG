1. personally , i ' d save experimenting with new forms of weed for when you don ' t have anything else going on . you ' re paying for the concert and you ' ll want to enjoy it , so why take the risk that you ' ll be too high to fully appreciate it ? there ' s also the risk that you ' ll underestimate your tolerance or the dose and you ' ll just be spending the whole time waiting for a high that never comes . if you do decide to try edibles , just follow the normal advice and take very small doses with plenty of time in between .
