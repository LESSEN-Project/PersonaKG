   (ID: e3a37ef234435ebde735894f98de2b3f90e3bbe9)

   (ID: fb5e95e954b3ee83c39276138f0fa3b854970db4)

6. my gram is digit and my grandpa died ten years ago . we ' re all individuals , but her biggest complaint is that she ' s lonely . i think you could ask her what she wants , does she want to talk , be in someone ' s company , or alone ? i do worry that sometimes even when someone says they want to be alone , it ' s not always for the best as they may be just wanting to hide and be in pain alone . if there are interests of hers where she is with other people , i ' d encourage that and offer to help get her to those outings if she is unable to get there herself . i think you could make it a routine of visiting her or doing one of those activities , eating a meal or a few meals a week with her as a routine . i ' m not sure how much time you have or whether your family members have time to do the same , but you could set up a bit of a schedule .
   (ID: 345fbf1e655edda9a5f8099ba480dfe0a7a0bd47)

7. i know you ' re going to get downvoted and are using hyperbole , but that may not be bad for them . not a " forced labor " kind of thing , but something designed to show them the value of work . maybe they could help build a park or something like that .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

8. go and be supportive . say nothing that would be upsetting to them . that ' s what friends do . a funeral is not the time or place for you to express your views . it ' s not about you in the least .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

9. they wanted to make money , but now that they are rich they can ' t be happy . seems like building a family takes priority , but that ' s just me .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

10. just tell me your underlying opinion . the ultimate goal is just to have as many animals as possible on this planet ? why ? well i guess asceticism , isn ' t necessarily religion , it ' s just that a lot of people who practice it do it because they don ' t want to go to hell . still , no one at all is obligated to do it .  digit . dogs eat animals .  digit . in a lifetime a dog will eat more than digit animal . my dog never killed a single animal in all of his twelve years of life . he was fed meat because he is a carnivorous animal . humans have a choice . most animals don ' t , they kill and eat meat to survive . should we kill lions so that wildebeest can survive ? cats so that mice can survive ? bears so that fish can survive ? regardless of how you look at it , not only is nature only taking its natural course , these animals are simply more intelligent than the ones you are fighting to keep alive . dogs are smarter than cows . dogs don ' t have a choice of whether or not to eat meat or plants . we do . they don ' t .

11. my mom once told me she didn ' t understand why god allowed me to live . little backstory . i was born nearly digit months premature . i technically died twice . the doctors told my parents not to get attached cause i wasn ' t going to make it . fast forward to the incident . my mom accused me of stealing her digital camera . she had just returned from a stay in maryland and couldn ' t find it . for hours she berated me and topped it off with the " god shouldn ' t have let you live " comment . the next day she found the camera in a box she had yet to unpack . she never told me she found it or apologized for her comment . she just pretended the entire situation never occurred . my dad apologized on her behalf .
   (ID: 6735159236fd8a4634f1974d6eba7f027dbd1aa7)

12. why people get all emotional over the death of some total stranger on the news or whatever . there are a lot of things about people that still confuse me .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

13. I'm interested in gifts and charity.
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)

14. i ' m actually curios about the events , if you don ' t mind could you briefly shared what happened ?
   (ID: 20e44d996799f8bb3fe89546818050bf021f4be9)

15. absolutely . how do you reconcile the love you feel for your family member and the knowledge that they ' re a total monster ? it ' s gotta be so heartbreaking .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

16. hahaha there was one time when i was hiking in the woods with my friends , and this one got raped by some savages living there haha guess that  s worse lol
   (ID: abffa241a0eb33d4cf220980872adc9a148514b4)

17. my parents . i never felt like they had my back when i was a child . my mother is an amazing mom now but when i was a kid , she wasn ' t around much and wasn ' t very loving when she was . my father has been absent a good deal of my life and was mentally abusive the rest of the time . most of my partners have commented that i have a giant wall up but i don ' t see it as a bad thing . people have to earn closeness to you , in my opinion . if you let them in too soon , they could hurt you and not be there for you when you need them . so for me , it ' s better to rely on me and if someone chooses to help , cool . and if not , that ' s fine cuz i planned to do it alone anyway .
   (ID: a9b07d3f94647dffebe730771c20ee3ca1af7ec4)

18. i ' ve seen it countless times , and every time it ' s " god , that ' s so sad . " it ' s this one in particular that gets me . likely because this happened when i was still young .
   (ID: 5ee4d4a98d2da62835d0e63abf8fe5bbfa95111b)

19. i think the idea of furries existing alongside domesticated animals is kind of the go to explanation that most fiction writers use . it ' s the one that seems to make the most sense . but yeah , when fiction writers diverge from the formula , it ' s often annoying when they don ' t fill in the new gaps they ' ve created in their world . although with a world full of anthropomorphic creatures , i suppose there ' s lots that just has to remain unexplained and assumed . using another example from a series  we still don ' t have any freakin ' idea how the hell pokeballs work .
   (ID: ecce6e894db30f245f1073ca0e270a3bb87eaa71)

20. sorry you had to see that . has it shaped you in any way ? or do you think or act differently because of what you witnessed ? sorry if the questions aren ' t posed appropriately . genuinely curious about your experience if you ' re cool with it .
