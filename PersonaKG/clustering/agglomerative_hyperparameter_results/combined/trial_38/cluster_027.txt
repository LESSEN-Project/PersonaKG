1. do what you like to do . even if you earn more  in the current position , it would be worth it to step down if you ' d enjoy it more . that would also mean less income which could make it harder to pay off loans so definitely consider the long term effect of that . if this company plans on going public let me know
   (ID: 89bda4e1242c8f5567558138509db8b02cf94cd6)

2. nah he just doesn  t know how much cologne to use . you could try looking for a cologne to replace it with in the same scent category . maybe a more grown  up scent at that , aeropostale i literally didn  t know anyone still shopped there . is for teens . that  s like an introductory cologne .
   (ID: 5b21cc135fb593212a5256d44f50dc5eda5d9947)

3. i say go for it ! change is good , and for your situation and everything you described moving is definitely going to be good for you . you don  t want to keep thinking about doing it for years and regret not going sooner .
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

4. that is disappointing . you did everything you could and he still treated you like that . you ' re right , you are much better off without that kind of shit in your life !
   (ID: 23d8dae7213e264b515a84a02f18e02f44dbe192)

5. if you ' re getting good vibes when you do see him , he probably likes you . trust your gut .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

6. they do this . honestly , nothing may be wrong at all . he may not need as much communication and affection as you do . my husband does a few of these things as well . however , he is on the spectrum , and i just know it is how he is comfortable . and i ' m ok with that . that being said , if it makes you uncomfortable or unhappy , you need to come to terms with that truth and decide what you need to do to make you happy .
   (ID: e1d1404c2d4f1c884debe976d40ee13df3959fcf)

7. how dare that motherfucker enjoy something different than the way you do ! you sure told him .
   (ID: a4eb94a9fe8ebabb780c319cc7d3f552eb79625e)

8. he didn ' t almost collapse a grooming gang trial and it utterly transparent that you only all of a sudden give a shit about the victims because you think it bolsters your point of ' football man bad ' . you didn ' t care about those girls before and you don ' t care about them now and that is precisely why someone like tommy robinson came to prominence .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

9. hon , you need to think about yourself here . i know that can be hard , especially if you ' re a giver by nature , but it ' s true . if you don ' t feel safe , comfortable , and respected in your relationship , you won ' t be truly happy . and that may not seem like the end of the world now , but it will in time . eventually , bitterness and resentment can start to grow and you ' ll find yourself hating the person you once loved . if you don ' t think you can be happy dealing with his bipolar disorder , it ' s ok to move on . it ' s better that both of you find partners you can truly be fulfilled and happy with , even if it means going through some pain first .
   (ID: 87dcb06b0e31b35730fe93ce7dcbef85e6078b40)

10. maybe you should just be an adult about it and talk to him about it . furthermore , why are you so affected anyway ? you ' re friend probably thought that it was safe to hook up with your ex since you are getting married anyway . you should probably close the book with your ex because it will affect a couple of things  your friend might be serious about having a relationship with your ex and you ' re in the way of making him happy just because you don ' t want him checking out your ex . your future with your soon to be wife . obviously you ' re not over your ex yet because you can ' t stand someone else dating your ex . anyway , good luck bro . i know you ' ll take the mature path
   (ID: 261413214c13676b8aee2ce20a47107c4ccfe6b8)

11. like any man , he saw it as " you want me to raise another man ' s kids while telling me i will not have mine . what ? pretty sure that isn ' t an " any man " attitude .
   (ID: 225291489bc1a4ddf3d197a3062fa9ff935f3029)

12. seems like he has a lot of baggage going on . he ' s sexuality interested in other people and is likely cheating , or going to cheat outside of the rules . if you have rules like you do , you shouldn ' t be together . it ' s gonna get ugly if you stay .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

13. agreed . learning how to manage relationship conflict in early relationships is one of the most important life skills to practice at that age . i usually start with asking questions to understand why exactly the teen is upset . i then rephrase that in a way that states what the teen wants to happen , " so , you wish he saved a seat for you next to him at football games " and then suggest they tell the person and ask for the thing they want , " i want to sit next to you at the next football game . will you save me a seat " teens relationship problems often stem from difficulty verbalizing what they want to happen and expressing that need . to be fair , most adults are not so good at this either .

14. ok i have a query , because something isn ' t right here and before everyone gets all got under the collar , no , i am not a holocaust denier , so keep your poison to yourselves please  why did this guy decide in digit to break into auschwitz to report on events there , when killings didn ' t begin there to any meaningful extent until at least the following year , and the wannsee conference without which auschwitz wouldn ' t have become what it did wasn ' t until digit ? either the dates in the historical record need revisiting or someone is bullshitting us about something . edit  in case i haven ' t made myself clear  the title of this thread mentions " atrocities " but at the time this man is said to have decided to get admitted to auschwitz the atrocities for which the camp later became infamous were still quite some time in the future . so why would he feel the need to do what he did ?
   (ID: 59ebeb8d8fee755bce043a6482743bde8a2a0bb1)

15. if you ' re getting angry , i would think that is a sign that you do not respect your partner ' s opinions and their desires .
   (ID: 66ee9442886cf2e0fff8240a72749b2d87a5282b)

16. why do you have to ? you ' re not going to change his mind about hating trans people .
   (ID: fbed02b3d7caf00e8d1533f452f8951cf390df73)

17. oh man what a prison scenerio , you got punked in front of everyone , now everyone will punk you . you gotta beat his ass down 5x harder than he hit you to get back with a little extra . even if you get beat up at least you dont look like a coward . or  its just highschool and no one will remember in a few days . he was obviously trying to impress someone so it has nothing to do with you personally so you can be the bigger man and walk away , dont give him the satisfaction of retaliating . if it occurs again i would ask him why he did that . if he has a reason , try to deescalate the situation and find common ground . if hes just a dick and doesnt stop , resort to the first plan .
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

18. can you stop feeding a troll ? there are so many inconsistencies and indicators that op is just some wannabe fiction writer that it  s becoming ridiculous for you to defend an obvious shitposter . i get it that you try to take it serious for the off chance it  s real , but i  m sure you can spend your time in a better way than feeding into attention  seeking from some douche with a made up sob  story . and following that argument you  d literally have to give advice to any random shitpost that you come across this relationship subreddits ? do you do that ? otherwise you  re just a hypocrite that cares for the stories that got you a good amount of attention  karma yourself .
   (ID: 93e9e943e9d5e6606a938961fd4d02312afb101b)

19. because when hes texting me and being too nice to me , i remind him how much i hate him . i also send him random hate messages . but i ' m getting better at not doing that .
   (ID: 91dc65ba6eef536f17becface16989de7f988dce)

20. it be like that sometimes . take this w for bravery and move on with all your pride king pensive  face
