1. i mean she takes it a step further , right ? she actually travels to cuba to meet with and talk to providers , health advocates and patients . she gives off the essence of a principled academic with scientific rigor to boot . she made a much greater effort than the three reactionary white dudes from a business school in texas did to support their thesis . but ultimately her paper was published by the university of miami , a hub for gold  toothed emigres with nothing but reactionary sentiment towards the cuban people . like most miami institutions they ' ve sought the demise of the cuban people and cuban project for a long time . i would avoid medical literature altogether and just use raw data to drawn your own conclusions and support the argument you want to make     x200b  i think the counter  argument to all of this is really simple  cuba is a poor  ass country with a shit gdp but still maintains excellent health parity and health outcomes . maternal mortality and infant mortality are both low when compared with the rest of the rich world . malnutrition and undernutrition are both also extremely low . life expectancy hangs out in the high 70s for men and low 80s for women . chronic illnesses are not prevalent unlike in the u . s . and this is all accomplished with only spending digit  of gdp on health expenditures .   x200b  the lesson to be learned here is that when you commit to economic nationalism , when you use the land , labor , markets , and resources of your country for the betterment of its people you get excellent health outcomes and health parity . when you do the opposite , when you privatize the healthcare industry and place the burden of costs onto your citizens , you not only get shit health outcomes and insurmountable health disparities but you also get financed assholes like benjamin powell who say that " sweatshops are actually good " while in the same breath say that healthcare is " repressive " in cuba .

2. digit of digit things i ' m thinking . like many other people nba players are likely to follow fashion trends , probably more so than your average person because they have so many eyes on them all the time , they want to look good . . or they ' re having a behind the scene bet seeing who can wear the most ridiculous glasses at postgame
   (ID: 7d39153e3adadffd15e1638679c2e1cdc5c64fde)

3. I am a male.
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

4. i suffer from anxiety mostly about germs , i have some chronic health conditions and in digit i was at my lowest , but have gradually taken back my life . however , i recently realized my issues with urinating while people are waiting this was at a doctor ' s office which i think stems from a self  esteem issue maybe yay . it ' s really nothing compared to what you ' re struggling with , but i thought i ' d mention that i can empathize . today i realized that the amount of anxiety i get from this issue adds too much anxiety to my already , at times , anxious life , so i ' m considering cognitive behavioral therapy . some questions to think about privately or publicly if you so choose  around when did this issue start for you ? is there an event that may have caused it to start ? maybe understanding how it all started can help you . i know you ' re seeing all of the things it has affected and you ' re probably unsure of where to start to actually take back some of what you used to have . i think it ' s important to have a good support system , so i ' d recommend finding a therapist you ' re comfortable with if you can afford it . it might not even need to be that they specialize in this condition , just professional therapist  counselor to talk to could be valuable . if you ' re unable to get a therapist right now , like you did by posting here , find a person or people to somehow make friendships with and possibly talk to about your issues . it ' s not fun to have to go it alone . i might suggest making " baby steps . " what if you could start working on this by finding either a very unfrequented private public restroom or an unfrequented public restroom with several stalls start with whichever sounds like the least uncomfortable to you . maybe a business where you can go when it ' s less crowded or maybe the college you went to , usually during break periods the schools are open and less students are there . i ' m wondering too if it might be helpful to use a public bathroom you used to be able to use . maybe you could you start off with using that one restroom and become comfortable going there often ? then could you move onto find another bathroom similar ? maybe eventually this would open the possibility of using less familiar , more frequented bathrooms . also , if you attempt something one day and feel it ' s too overwhelming , try again later or another day . don ' t see it as a failure , you tried . that ' s one more step than you might have done a different day . i was so sad when i read that you used alcohol as a way to try to help you through these situations , you shouldn ' t have to suffer like this . i hope you ' re able to get back your life !
