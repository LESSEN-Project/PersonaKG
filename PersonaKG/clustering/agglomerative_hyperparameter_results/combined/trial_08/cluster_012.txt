   (ID: 11e562551d8ce916c649db9948355e07c68fed96)

   (ID: 2a43fd1ba18ed201f563f660a853be569ebb3917)

3. the rest of the poem is what i would call poetic . i think the piece functions with a degree of uncertainty without the last line . i think it takes away from the awesome that is this poem . after a few more readings , i might suggest dropping the punctuation but that is sort of whatever .
   (ID: 109fa004cbb85f6a703624f8b4393d7d7d685509)

4. we must not be talking about the same deku . why does he like bakugo ? they are childhood friends . too unrealistic ? you can believe that a dude ' s sweat can cause explosion but having deku be too forgiving is unrealistic , yeah ok . risking his life to save other ' s ? bro did you not see episode digit , " my body just moved ? deku at his core puts others before himself , thats the reason why all might chose him .   x200b
   (ID: b5cc14fd703a97548093b4e06f7e3e92575b80b9)

   (ID: b7507045470edf901fe3b39ecbb382c66ea3405a)

8. yeah , i agree . but the point im raising is , if we can imagine a easier life like we think animals have regardless of the truth behind it , why can ' t we have it ? i mean we are really powerful and can practically have our world shaped anyway we like . why not a way that is easy to live ?
   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

10. i don ' t care if you have black friends . i think it ' s wrong to only care how a person looks and not take anything else into account .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

11. yes it is , but common sense dictates don  t drive the middle of fucking nowhere .
   (ID: abd2d3c15975e586b4b74794df81b7ac62b7f321)

   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

17. the way i look at it i thought that was a better idea is doing that would have served digit purposes .  shown shaw which the movie did already that her beliefs were based on a misunderstanding of what actually happened .  thereby showing how hard people to grasp on to an idea that is so completely false . i think it would have played a more centralistic role on attacking christianity ' s " soul . i think this is inevitably why it wasn ' t done in the film . edit wanted to fact check before adding that ridley scott is an atheist i don ' t think the way he portrays religion in his films are meant to be taken as correct somehow .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

18. i find the word crazy to be dismissive . " i dont understand this person so they must be crazy . "
