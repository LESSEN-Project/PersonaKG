   (ID: f179711c18514780c1b0257643d893ef1cf5a081)

   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

3. my wife and i met while i was separated , after a 14yr marriage . my wife and i met digit months after i moved out and into my own apartment . the divorce took digit months from the time i moved out . so my current wife stuck with me for digit months , of fairly low drama . my ex was dragging her feet so i finally forced her at the digit months mark , and it took an additional digit months for the courts and paperwork . i married my current wife a year and digit months after the divorce was settled and finalized . it does work sometimes . we didn ' t move in together until digit months after the divorce was finalized . it ' s been great . been married about a year and digit months . her crazy matches my crazy .
   (ID: 3cdafe3cd3631abf2cba2325474f55a67e9ce463)

4. how i wasn ' t smart enough to avoid the mistakes i made at work . how i shouldn ' t of asked so many dumb questions at work . my long lasting realization that i may in fact be a dipshit . my realization that i am not as good as i think i am .
   (ID: c11592c54f6061d979d11af92c6289790a5bec93)

5. move my stuff for little to no reason . i can ' t tell you how many times i ' ve scoured the house for something that i knew exactly where i put it . it tends to happen when she ' s at work and i ' m not so i can ' t get an answer from her either .

8. if the type of collaboration that you are missing is in her job description , and she ' s not putting in the effort , then this is a simple job performance issue and she needs to be reprimanded like any employee any where who ' s failing to do something he or she ' s supposed to . but something else might be going on which is cultural . if her department  role has never been clearly informed by a superior or by official company policy communications that collaboration with your department  role is a required or encouraged thing , she might not be likely to do so . having worked in a vietnamese company made up of expats and locals , everything is very compartmentalized and different departments have different line managers , and collaboration with other departments happens not as a general work culture , but when specifically assigned by the boss . and this is something i ' ve observed in my experience , but hesitate to apply to all vietnamese , but yes , as others have posted , there could definitely be a " why should i do your job " kind of lack of motivation going on , too . especially if you ' re based in vietnam and earning 3x your vn co  worker for doing a job that might not be that much more difficult or important than theirs .
   (ID: 5b02e2fd29e743c4c80de2b0919a03d95400c23a)
