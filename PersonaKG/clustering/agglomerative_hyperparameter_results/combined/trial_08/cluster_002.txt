   (ID: e57ef54aa6b4e23fcfbf5b034403be21a86f9700)

18. i disagree to start off , kids have to do pe without choice of what they do until their second year of middle school at least from what we had and even when they finally get that chance to pick what pe they have , their parents may force them to do the sport they want for them . it isn ' t until highschool though that they can finally free up that spot in the day to have what they feel would better suit their future , for me and others that would be jrotc , and for others it would be ag or welding . once you get to highschool , you are responsible for choosing your career path , which can lead to a long day full of classes that will help you succeed in your chosen path , but you still have to complete core classes that take up valuable periods . adding another required class like pe for all four highschool years would rob the smarter teens and young adults their chance to experiment with what they feel would help them or to just make the day go by smoother . imagine having only two or three choices on what your aloud to do during your school day , most students won ' t actually use or even remember some of the things that they learn in their core classes because they will never use them in their jobs  careers . most band members have to drop out of band because they don ' t have enough free spots to do the things they love , imagine in your case i ' m assuming you enjoy sports that you had to drop out of the sport you loved because you have to do something else that someone else though would be important to you . do i think people should get exercise every day ? yes i do , i believe it ' s very important to help you succeed in life , but it should be reserved for after school when you have done the thing nessisary for your future path .
