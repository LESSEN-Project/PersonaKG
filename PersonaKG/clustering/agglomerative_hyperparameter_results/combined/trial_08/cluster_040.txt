   (ID: 58e212a6c13e22a08d2941c582a79d5479d666fd)

2. i still did the mischevious thing of being a teen and smoked at the park  public places and such . i ' m pretty sure regardless of the privilege every teen who ' s smoked has gone through that phase at some point haha .
   (ID: 9e1be6964f5835f58b6cdaac71f8b557f0b4a42f)

3. mate is very popular in chile , and it ' s getting more popular in the states . in seattle you can get yerba minus the actual mate just like you can tea at coffee shops , you can even get a latte version . not sure if they put milk in it in uruguay , but in chile it is popular to drink with lots of sugar and milk .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

4. yes it is very well respected and has a nice built in compatibility function so if you drop in all your parts it will tell you it ' s good to go . they also offer multiple sources to purchase your parts from . good luck with your build
   (ID: ca6f75f7c2f9d1175fa6abae36369351bda1afb8)

5. we can ' t know how serious he is until we see him interact with other characters . all we know of his character as yet is that he gets really mad when you chain him to a wall for days on end . pretty sure old dante would show similar anger and defiance were he somehow imprisoned for a prolonged period of time .
   (ID: 4ef88292bcb63ee32b3f587610b610322cea098e)

6. if only . i ' m still not sure whether to sell it , take someone else , or just see if i can get any kind of money back .
   (ID: b42bcbaed0ea1f011b4d8c42d4ad9df732ecc5d5)

7. when we have guests at home i will literally stay inside my room and don  t leave which is especially bad if they stay for a few days because i will literally just starve myself until either i know for sure that i can avoid an interaction with them or i can  t hold out any longer .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

   (ID: faebbe18abd4d1c69e3bb9106178f797255444c5)

9. you should definitely consider a profession in this if you haven  t already . beautiful bag , and i  m sure with the right advertising you could make a fortune . i  d happily sink  digit  into a handmade lotr bag like that . beautiful work !
   (ID: c06f82a9d6f502a9c5707645e6b0bc869ff37975)

10. i ' m sure that poultry would wage jihad in a heartbeat . meat , foie gras , live feather plucking are the only things i know of off the top of my head . we don ' t seem to have so much respect for the source of our meat and we can be so shitty with how we treat them .
   (ID: cd7d2576afdbdebbe88d5b40a7b4f436af37c202)

11. i have way too much training and , unless the person is actively dying . i won ' t do more than make sure they have space and are on their side , just the basics . cruel ? fuck yes it is . but the last time i helped save some cunts life , they tried to sue me . so yeah . jaded . i ' d like to help , but people will sue for anything . no gratitude . just letters from lawyers .
   (ID: 5961595dfc87bf2297732de81d6f236102fb1790)

12. i ' m sure this is true , even though i think a lot . my gf will sometimes ask what i ' m thinking about and i honestly say " nothing " or " just abstract shit without any meaning " but she always has words to describe her thoughts .
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

13. i ' m using a phone without a number right now , i ' m not sure if it would work . i hate to ask , but would you mind doing it ? sorry , i ' m probably just really scared right now .
   (ID: 9f31985e70e208f2dc692e2c378f1707cedd3bc9)

14. that ' s why i decided to go into computer science . it ' s basically a sure thing . there are corporations out there who need programmers and the skill shortage isn ' t threatening to go away any time soon , so it ' s a good industry to go into . however , i ' ve always loved telling stories , which is why i love to write . i ' d probably write superhero stories and horror stories . they ' re my favorite genres as well as two things the public never seems to tire of . thanks for responding .
   (ID: 17d6f5fb6fdd1b0ceedb5ec118276bdbb72a462f)

15. im pretty sure everyones gay . by degree . do you like porn ? do you like your women ravaged by a flaccid penis ? or a hard one ? . see you just realized you ' re digit  more gay
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

16. don ' t get it if you ' re not sure you ' re going to like it . remember you can back out anytime . even when they put the stencil on and it ' s not what you really wanted , speak up .
   (ID: 292b765cb2e74ea6eb438a054f334da466dda75e)

17. not sure what to tell you then ? check the store again ?
   (ID: 6f291f3688a3a398f92cd165b10b1d3796d86840)

18. so why is nobody investigating conflict of interest ? im sure if there was a proof for such thing the fbi would be all over it ?
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

19. not american either , and sure , sanders would have been a better option than any other candidate . as far as unemployment , i will admit i have not seen data about it however , i seriously doubt it ' s been lowered significantly without useless spending from the government . i personally don ' t see a problem with oppressing people who have done bad things before or believe in white supremacy . not sure what is the other type of oppression you mean . why do you believe people should own firearms ? do you seriously not believe there is danger associated with that ? what is this islam problem you are talking about exactly ? if it ' s extremism , it ' s really not exclusive to crazy people with islamic beliefs . this problem is due to mentally unstable people misinterpreting their religion and brainwashing uneducated people . have you ever had a real conversation with a muslim ? what is your honest opinion about how sweden should be handling muslim immigrants ? last thing , do you not see any problem with blatant lying to the press and population ?
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

20. i ' m not sure how much it has to do with the time and how much it has to do with who your parents are . kids around me were doing plenty , i just had an overly controlling parental situation .
