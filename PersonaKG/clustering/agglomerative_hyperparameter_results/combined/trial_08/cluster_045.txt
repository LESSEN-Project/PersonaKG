   (ID: c23be0b501278176a288ed6b3ab6669ac6b9896a)

8. i don  t know if i can say that it was an  obvious lie  , but my parents always told me as a kid , that if i go outside without a jacket , i  m going to get sick for sure . even though i know that  s not digit  true now as an adult , i always get paranoid if i leave the house without a jacket during the fall or winter that i  m going to catch a cold .
   (ID: d95d3548a9506e48c5310c85f3b2994820405e0d)

   (ID: e9d73d2eb8490cec3e668bda1db9e716a061d73d)

11. actually , i think the answer may be no . think about this  the average muggle parent finds their kid with a letter about some crazy wizard school , delivered by an owl , and doesn ' t immediately go tell their friends , post pictures online , call local news ? of course , the kids themselves would likely do these things too . really , the manner in which these letters are delivered are a potential nightmare for the ministry of magic to clean up after , sending out memory  altering wizards constantly around when the letters are sent . why would the ministry allow this to continue ? there ' s got to be some magic going on behind the scenes we ' re unaware of . i can ' t see the letter forcing students to attend , as that would be tantamount to the imperius curse . but could be some other shenanigans going on . maybe the letters are charmed to only be readable by people inclined to accept , and keep the secret ? so if you receive and read a letter , ipso facto , you are a person who will go .
   (ID: 1b160a23109a802786ef06d0b2abff0841f4eb37)

12. i was going to make a comment about how at some point , maybe you should let the dog go , but i can  t believe how well he healed . i should have more faith .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

13. exact same thing with me , i tell her something , even something most parents would be proud of and a few hours later hear her and my older brother talking about me when they think i can ' t hear them . now unless she absolutely needs to know i don ' t tell her anything , even if it ' s something harmless like i ' m going cloths shopping i just always say i ' m going to the library and she doesn ' t question it .
   (ID: ced909c5cb6ff0568a08e4114fa46116da622fa1)

14. this made my blood boil . i ' ll try not to get angry here , but if my parents try to steal from me , bad things are going to happen . that goes for everyone .

15. and flashing a badge isn  t going to do anything . are you a leo ? if not , then it will only end in a legal nightmare as well .
   (ID: 3857340322f3015e4a24e7f6aa252884060f24ce)

16. i knew these kind of douchebags in college as well . tried my hardest not to associate with them . also , it doesn ' t surprise me in the slightest that he ' s going to med school . i commend you for your decision , why share your life with a malicious person ?
   (ID: 93e9e943e9d5e6606a938961fd4d02312afb101b)
