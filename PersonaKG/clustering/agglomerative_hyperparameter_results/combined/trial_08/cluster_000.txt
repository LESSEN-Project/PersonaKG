12. you ' re making this about you . it ' s very self centred and really , much the way you have been acting to those close to you for many years . if you want to truly give your family some peace and happiness , take their hints and leave them the fuck alone like they want . if really , this attempt at redemption and forgiveness if all about you and your own desires and ego , there ' s no point in saying anything really because you ' ve already made this all about you and are looking for people to back you up in your self centred ways . now you are wanting them to do yet another thing for you , make yet another allowance for your behaviour , by forgiving you . it is obvious all you care about in this situation is you , and your feelings . you ruined part of their lives and if you are truly sorry and want the best for them , do what they ask , for once . and leave them the hell alone .

   (ID: bb79791c3753a1fc8ece696b3835b0f59ddccc90)

17. this happened to me the first time i took the test . the only thing that helped me was to find something else to occupy your mind . whether it ' s a tv show you binge i rewatched the office , a new workout i started walking  stretching  and spinning more , or something else , just find something where you can kind of let your brain turn off for a bit . do that at least once a day . once i started that , i mostly stopped perseverating on something i couldn ' t change .
   (ID: f179711c18514780c1b0257643d893ef1cf5a081)

18. he could be , and i can see where you are coming from . or he could just be a lonely old man who wants to be friendly and you ' re the only one who ' s actually engaged him in conversation when he ' s tried . maybe he sits alone in front of the tv by himself every night , hoping his kids will call and they never do . eats lunch alone because he doesn ' t get along with the other professors , etc . maybe you ' re like the one person who has been actually friendly and not just professional with him and he looks forward to it each day , which leads him to go a little overboard . like a stay at home parent who talks nonstop the minute another adult is around not being there to see his interactions with other people , it ' s hard to tell . i like to give people the benefit of the doubt .
   (ID: c673eb9fda8629b3a86935092a2668010b581ab1)

19. plan . make sure you have enough money . be willing to take time off . be ready to not get much sleep .
   (ID: 718ff22055f41bd70e24ec98f0898a1526112965)

20. turning digit is really not bad at all . i hammed up the sadness because it ' s basically a social norm to loathe each new decade of your life , but it was fleeting . i had a much harder time hitting digit no longer a teenager and digit for some reason .
