1. it really depends on where you live . some places require behind the wheel experience prior to getting a license , and the amount varies . do you live in a city with public transportation ? do you have friends or access to uber to get around ? what about a bicycle ? i would recommend trying to calmly talk to your parents about these things . maybe let them know that you do not want to move out the day you turn digit , but you will need certain freedoms to agree to stay . please don ' t speak angrily or sound like a threat . just explain what you want and listen to their side . maybe you can get a compromise .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

2. thanks . i will be on my guard . i will try to work on myself too . i ' m actually away for digit weeks after he gets back with digit weeks here with him before i leave with a girl friend , so maybe some space will provide some clarity . maybe it will end us . the uncertainty is killing .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

3. look , i want to sleep . i don ' t understand why you and the other human need to bounce on the bed or whatever it is you do to make it shake .
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

4. long term junior high teacher . you ' re at a digit  and you need that extra digit  to pass . if you ' ve been a little back  talking shit . fuck you ! same situation but you ' ve made my life easy ? i have no problem returning a favor !
   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

5. i hate when people say bring incorrectly .  shall we bring our hammers to school tomorrow ?  it  s take face  with  rolling  eyes
   (ID: 5a01af4f9721facf5be110d8e134d4c4da020088)

6. now you just need to get past the doing shit behind my back thing .
   (ID: 9286ff57fb4290178a79b38d20f6a95da9d2267f)

7. i like it for this , ' cause you need a bit of skill to use it in pvp
   (ID: 5678e7d82af39057d98ff7906ce8fef81468ba06)

8. you need to have something interesting to say .
   (ID: 4bb0a21212688dbc67fe64d6f42fca297fed4f4f)

9. all these rappers that call him a snitch , need to look down the barrel of digit to life and see if they keep their mouths shut
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

10. how important it is to really pick the people you sleep with .
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

11. thanks for the help guys . one other question , since i attempted to catch already do i need to teleport to a new location and wait digit hours ? or can i stay where i was ?
   (ID: 7542c8a6be5a118bef67d9539deb69c131fb4fbc)

12. you have a big bang hypothesis . now you just need a career  s worth of mathematics to validate it .
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

13. agreed . we need a proper cdm , which thiago is not . someone with a style like xabi alonso . also need digit wingers i think since we cannot assume that two of gnabry , sane and coman will be fit in the cl knockouts . i think our defence is fine , although boateng is a liability
   (ID: 798fc9f22ec2a1c21f6d387916d4d56336b802ef)

14. that clips sort of reminds me of this clip i can imagine a future where it ' s laughable that a weed tour is even news . or laughable that they would need to explain what indica is .
   (ID: 737313878d4c0ea930e14b4d6569b91c8028c768)

15. if your not doing pvp , which is sort of slow tbh , you need to kill these for the covenant rewards . they give spells , miracles , and rings which are required for digit separate achievements . for the infusion achievement i got every single infusion in the game and bought digit daggers and infused each one with a different infusion . you have to have all digit on one character , but you dont need it at one time . you also need to infuse it yourself , no lothric deep axe for you .
   (ID: e9829c29404a911421b2b39c7ea7309cbcf3329e)

16. really ? you feel the need for personal attacks because i disagree with you ? well , how about you try understanding the sentence before you attack someone . let me help you " it ' s exactly why i oppose tax hikes right now "
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

17. to be fair that was a fucking fluke . wasn ' t skill , was luck i was amongst the top rated when the sub exploded 2k subs in digit day and the new guys upvoted the top stories by about digit points each . if i was digit  digit positions lower by now i ' d be somewhere around the 6th page .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

18. you  re not an asshole . and , it  s important to note  neither is he . but this subject is a really big deal between couples and you need to keep that in mind . you are young and you don  t need to be in a hurry to make any decisions on this today . but what you do need to do is spend some time with your bf determining whether you are continuing on the same path in life . and it  s okay if the answer right now is ,  i don  t know , let  s keep going and see what happens ,  and it  s okay if it  s  we  re growing in different directions .
   (ID: 3f4f5511095f668b3c84312b8bfeb87b30dd8f03)

19. it ' s not like you get to start over if you choose no . you don ' t really have a choice .
