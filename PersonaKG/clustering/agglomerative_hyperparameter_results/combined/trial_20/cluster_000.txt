1. uuhhh no . you ' re using that word , but i don ' t think you know what it means . let me guess  you ' ve seen that word thrown around in the news lately and you decided to give it a try ? here , let me spell this out for you . i ' m literally not supporting a pedophile protection agency , nor am i falling for a ridiculous myth of a magical sky wizard . soooooo nice try , dimwit . way to look like a fucking moron using words you ' re clueless about .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

2. how does the boredom level compare to with phones ? we ' re you more bored then with less things to do or more bored now with what is probably a shorter attention span ?
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

3. of course i don ' t fucking think that . i ' m just trying to point out that the whole " he could ' ve just got an illegal gun on the black  market " argument is bullshit . if in the future there is a gang driven black  market for semi  autos in nz the gangs will need to be very careful about who they sell them too , and a some neck beard 4chan weirdo would almost certainly be told to fuck off .
   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

4. One of my favorite things is rotmg.
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

5. we did acid with two other people , one of them had a fucked up bad trip and was eventually going to hurt himself or us he already tried to shoot us with a gun he hallucinated . before i called digit , the two other people including my former bff left . the other guy could have killed me and no one would know . it was then i realized that he didn ' t actually care about me and was toxic .
   (ID: e7d4349520d7fd2b6b8d8e41558874e7ce55f7c3)

6. that is a good choise of case

8. i was taking a shit in my alternative school bathroom stall , put my phone on the floor so it wouldn ' t fall out my pocket and break , some guys walked in and saw it on the floor , my teacher thought i was watching porn , my probation officer heard about it , i lost my phone to him for a week . that ' s my only story so far . and it wasn ' t even a porn watching story .

10. it adds to the mood
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

11. women can smell the stink of jealousy  insecurity a mile away . if you are a whiny baby about this , you aren ' t helping yourself . you are likely giving her something to complain about to other guys . be the guy she can ' t live without . be awesome and confident and she ' s be crazy to leave you for another guy . if you can ' t be that guy in her life , you ' ll always be worried about other guys . if she ' s the kind of woman who is easily distracted by other guys , then you both deserve something else . trust me . unless your life is a total shitshow , you absolutely find someone who will adore you and you ' ll never have a single worry . but don ' t stay in a relationship just to have one . better to be single with prospects than be trapped in this cloud of doubt .
   (ID: fcec87cb8b541d87ad0eb8b52c3541c8fc49132b)

14. happy cake day op ! but what is a cake day ? hey vsauce ! michael here . if you browse reddit often then that means you need to get a life . also it means you might be familiar with the phrase " cake day . what is it ? to know what it is we must go back all the way to when reddit was created . back in digit , reddit didn ' t exist . but you know what did ? my space . that ' s right . now if we take apart its name , it comes off as " my " , meaning the user ' s , and " space " , implying the particular space belongs to the user . now if you ' ve ever had a myspace account , if you ' ve ever stooped so low to actually make one , you will realise that while making an account , it asks for you dob . now dob could mean a lot of things , dicks of brian , death of bjork , and so on . but that ' s not what it means here . here , you see , dob stands for " date of birth " , meaning the date you were born . side note , some countries like china and japan prefer the yyyy  mm  dd format and some or perhaps only america uses mm  dd  yyyy which i think is really retarded . anyway back to the topic , the website asks for your date of birth to confirm whether you are old enough to use the website or not . granted , you could easily lie about your dob , like i did sorry mom and have some grumpy old redneck ask for you nude pictures , but for the of this video , we are going to assume you enter it correctly . okay . so now the site knows how old you are by subtracting your birth year from the current year . cool . but what does that have to do with cake days ? see , on birthdays , we tend to eat cakes . everybody likes cakes . if you don ' t then i don ' t know what ' s wrong with you but yeah everybody likes cakes . except brian . also brian has multiple dicks . anyway , on birthdays we tend to eat cake . that ' s right . now see , fast forward to digit when reddit is created . if you are here means you probably have a reddit account . i ' m not judging though , to each their own . but remember , when you were making your account , do you remember enetering your dicks of brian ? yeah . you don ' t . reddit only requires you to enter your email and username with password . see , future ! also it ' s good they are not cpoying myspace . now when you enter all these , what reddit does is that it saves the date you enter all these on . in my case it was digit feburby digit . reddit notes this date and saves it . so , by the next year , digit in my case , when feburby digit comes , i would ' ve completed one year on reddit . what comes once each year ? that ' s right , the 4th of july . oh say can you see  we ' ll sing it together later . but what else comes once every year ? that ' s right . your birthday . your reddit birthday . your " cake day " even though there are no cakes involved and all you get are fake internet points and probably a few wishes . still better than getting none on your actual birthday haha . that is all there is to cake days . a way to spread love , just for completing another year on an internet website . how lonely we people are . maybe sometime in future humanity will cease to exist . until then , let ' s celebrate all cake days we have left . and as always , thanks for watching .
