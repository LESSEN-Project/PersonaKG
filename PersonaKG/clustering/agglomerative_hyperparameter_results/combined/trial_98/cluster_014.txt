1. exactly ! and same for mrs . putnam ! the   wolves   wives that was a typo but it fit so well lol clearly aren ' t capable of actually treating  loving these children as their own . because no one can love you more than your actual parents !  exception for children of abusers . edit  apparently i need to clarify that i was not saying that adoptive parents aren ' t real parents ! i didn ' t think i needed to specify that adoptive parents are real parents . duh .
   (ID: d51e2f0207b67be3748f59fc0b78f82cd1e47a1c)

2. ehh no that  s not quite what i  m getting at , i know what you  re talking about . like someone looking off in the distance or distracted while talking , that  s not what i  m referring to . i  ve seen several people who talk with their eyes closed , like speak full sentences with their eyes closed . or they look up while their face is facing you . it sounds bizarre but if you know what i mean then i bet you agree it  s annoying . idk why people do it . some strange social phobia maybe
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

3. why ask why ? when how is so much more fun .
   (ID: 7ebdc00c75f6f836557e13d39a9efb279ed2ef7a)

4. why does it only apply to the 2nd amendment and not any other ? the founding fathers only knew printing press , do you think freedom of speech should apply to the internet ? i don ' t think so . there were also automatic weapons when the 2nd amendment was written .
   (ID: 0be93b714cd5f5999c7ff30ac3a245ba907b2d81)

5. idk but people seem to be boycotting my bed haven  t got anyone in there for a good couple of years
   (ID: 888fecec3c361bbe3db00f64ff7cf51950d332df)

6. i think the division is really individual . i believe in a social democratic society which benefits everyone with some laissez  faire social spheres where there  s a general decorum . if a thoroughly studied , evidence based concept can  t be discussed or legislated without fist fights in the street , it  s not worth discussing at all ! but there are tonnes of people who want more autocratic , paternalistic state interventions on both sides of the aisle . i think all of them are crazy as individuals . face  with  tears  of  joy unlike what either extreme believes , becoming insular and being the loudest person in the room doesn  t make them the smartest or the most right .
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)

7. maybe  why the hell do we bother posting for likes etc if karma is just imaginary internet points that don ' t mean anything in the real world ?
   (ID: 3f3a13bda2e98055fc23d20ace4e5f76118b56c5)

8. lmao , yeah i ' m not racist , but fuck africa . just get rid of it , it ' s not needed !
   (ID: e807b18e05d35f02282740d90e8c63546558b267)

9. it ' s not a choice at all . you can ' t opt  out even if you wanted to . that ' s not a thing .
   (ID: c978d968d1c4e9730afc6b7b09cbdd832546a06f)

10. i dunno . i see a decent amount of openmindedness in real life . the internet , of course , is another matter .
   (ID: 2bb956084cb9bf79f58345d6cf6beca98e76bbb4)

11. the sad thing is , if tht baby comes out with a disability , these people might not love them . and they migjt be too dumb to realize its their fault .
   (ID: 44eba9a0cf089ec615a77db5d42a2c01b63cb259)

12. that ' s not really what i mean . there are just way to many kids who grow up nearly alone because their parents don ' t care about them . so i ' m basically saying there should be some sort of test to make sure the parents actually take care of their kids .
   (ID: cf870aa7c8e0dd833ce984fd462b0f47ad7a6ace)

13. the only difference is you sound like your experience is from page digit while mine is from raising a daughter after many failed relationships as a teenager , hence my clumsy attempt at telling the young team how life works . i may not come across like it but i am the voice of experience . i  ve lived it
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

14. the alt  left are sjws , antifa , politics posters , etc . the left are the normies who don ' t care much about politics , and only hear from cnn and   fake news sites like that .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

15. no . it  s that you  re too fucking lazy to read through a comment thread and find links that have been posted digit different times . now post your proof you don  t suck little boy  s cocks or you  re a fucking lying pedophile .
   (ID: ef87eefe030bad98e7a1705beba0859fe1869cef)

16. and you ' re another common , two  bit fucking idiot . you literally believe a fucking board and a piece of plastic is all you need to talk to another dimension . how fucking stupid are you ? seriously ? you ' re a fucking moron for believing this shit . how stupid is your family ? they raised a moron , so that must be even worse .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

17. i ' m turning digit next week but right now i just want to not be an asshole
   (ID: 79fc72ea72532d39a039ecb4e47a630a601ff4a8)

18. i don ' t give a fuck about anyone except my friends and family , which is why i don ' t want to be paying for anyone else ' s shit through my tax money . if someone who was in need came asking for monetary help , i will gladly volunteer some cash over , i always do if i have cash . i don ' t like being forced to give charity . i think it ' s theft . but generally , i think it ' s rude to kill people , don ' t do it . it ' s rude to physically and sexually assault someone , don ' t do it . just because i don ' t care about most people doesn ' t mean i ' m not considerate enough to hold a door open .
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

19. i agree , in fact i consider this " company surveilance " policy is something that could be extended to other things . taxes to junk food so people don ' t munch on them like pigs . please , if people want to fucking kill themselves with food , is their problem .
   (ID: f388f39a9ea47e429d419a3a30153fba53fa1033)

20. once i asked a guy from ghana " how many languages are spoken in ghana ? he replied digit , arabic and english . then i asked him again what ' s the mother tongue of ghana ? when he said its english i was surprised and he said that what do you think ghana is ? why do you underestimate us , do you think we arab ? that conversation was awkward .
