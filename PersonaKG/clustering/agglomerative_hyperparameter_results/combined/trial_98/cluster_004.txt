9. is this sarcasm crusader kings , believe it or not , was at first all about catholic feudal rulers  all other groups that were " locked " simply never had content for them in first place . vanilla ck2 yup , without any dlc catholics have a level of depth that is absolutely unmatched by any group of nations in eu4 , and that ' s a fact . ck2 ' s model is " tall " , unlocking " areas " but each with its own self  contained avalanche of features  buy your favorite area ' s dlc and you ' re good to go . eu4 ' s model is " wide " , trying to add little random bits all over the map with each expansion  if you want a really decent experience , no matter where you play you will probably need several dlcs to make up for vanilla ' s bland arsenal of features . if i want to play other groups i can buy the corresponding dlc , knowing that i will be buying that stuff with the same level of high quality  which you can ' t say about certain eu4 dlcs , like mare nostrum or rule britannia . i am not saying it ' s the best model , or even that it ' s universally applicable , but you claiming that it ' s " anti  consumer " , especially compared to eu4 , is absurdly stupid . i mean , just go take a look at the ck2 community right now and see if there is any complaints about dlc policy . now please , go to the eu4 group and see what they think about the quality of the likes of golden century . lol  the lengths people will go to defend anti  consumer practices you are sounding like a douchebag , making random accusations , calling others " a cult " and ignoring we are simply exchanging ideas about dlc policy in a random post . no need to be agressive . though i see that you are quite activehttps    at conservative , which kinda explains your handwaving of others ' own opinions . as i have nothing to discuss with those who frequent hate speech  filled subs , i end my participation in the discussion here . you ' ll also get yourself blocked so i cannot see your further replies , but do know that i wish you a good day !
   (ID: 67ef96fb30756c49a9ffdff2579058eb2a3c1398)

10. I am support.
   (ID: 409a49cde6f1f65f92cac4d33c7c769f7ba9e965)

14. oh no . sorry about that . it used to be like that with my family too we celebrate evening of 24th and during the day on the 25th until i told them i have other people i wanna see during that time as well and now i can leave when i want
   (ID: 9721da66d978b8a2541ec60ba070b6fa9121482d)

15. this is an interesting question . my parents were watching a show the other day that actually included this exact question as far as i can tell . in it , a catholic mother in this future time was discussing with her daughter how , based on the church ' s official dogma , it would have been wrong for the deceased husband  father to have had himself digitized , as it forfeits your soul ' s place in heaven , out something like that . i didn ' t watch much of the show , but it was an interesting point . i kind of agree with others here , that just because you can copy someone ' s speech and behavior into a complicated computer program didn ' t mean you ' ve truly captured them as a person in all their fullness , which religious people think of as soul and spirit and stuff . i mean , from an empirical perspective it would probably just be an assumption either way , to say that it captured everything about the person or that it did not , because science can ' t say much about things without empirical definitions , and religion doesn ' t usually claim to define souls empirically . so an argument on whether we can manipulate souls through scientific processes is probably not sensible . idk , those are my thoughts .

16. can anyone explain ? how were they trying to scam him ?

18. i know this may sound ridiculous to many , but one of the most dominant memes in the wingnutsphere is that obama cannot function without a teleprompter . santorum is a poster  child for dunning  kruger . he would walk into that debate thinking " i ' m going to teach this boy something . " and that is exactly what his base dreams of .
   (ID: 338fc695adfaaf11a58feb723c7240c6700982d8)

19. is this about wanting to sniff my chair again ? for the last time , i ' m not giving up showers .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

20. i agree to a point , but shiny feebas shouldn  t be easy to get . in the games , feebas was one of the rarest and hardest to get pokemon , so i feel like it would defeat the purpose of feebas if everyone in pokemon go had the shiny version .
