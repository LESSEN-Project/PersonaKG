1. yes , it ' s a website ! if you want to find your purpose then that ' s the best site tbh .
   (ID: eca32d278abf2524af02edbb3cc3041ed8b0b880)

2. i don ' t disagree that it is not a perfect movie , but i enjoyed it . the frustration from my prior post is from all of the perceived butt hurt fanboys that legitimately make complaints that are boiled down to " the movie should have been this way , how dare they not do it this way . i know folks that weren ' t completely in love with the film or actually disliked it a lot , i am one of the former , but i have not heard from any sensible person that they want to petition to have the movie removed from canon or are running around screaming about some fictional " star wars rule book " that they feel was ignored . is this movie really a digit  digit ? doubtful . is it a digit  digit ? no way . do some casuals , and especially the hardcores , have too high of an affinity for star wars to where a movie is never going to satisfy them ? yes .
   (ID: bd40d7bc2310ec67eb22f820945fdb7d0f6a2550)

3. the last of the mohicans . an interesting thing about scores is , i know so many people who dislike classical music yet they watch a movie little realizing there is an orchestra in the background adding to the moment .
   (ID: 0f3da013abe745c83b2d4eb042abb7fd28f5e872)

4. same at the other movies with superheroes , nothing against it , just not my thing
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

5. " the most feared duet since me and elton played career russian roulette " for real , this is the best answer i can think of .
   (ID: 88c35221745da41b29ff5b9f921026de5ccbb6c0)

6. My television is psych.
   (ID: 11e562551d8ce916c649db9948355e07c68fed96)

7. maybe it is a little more on the web series side but it still is considered a web series . plus even if i am breaking the rules i still love it .
   (ID: b96c88b2d5cfdbde4b305fd9da23bc684edbb6a0)

8. i am completely satisfied . the three issues i run into when discussing the ending  general conclusion of lost with other people are thus  digit they don ' t realize what was already explained . such as , " we still don ' t know why there were polar bears there . yes , we do . digit they don ' t understand the ending . this i feel bad about , because i end up sounding like i think they are stupid for not getting it . but for some reason it requires a lot of explaining for some folks . digit they wanted a very simple , solid easy to digest ending . then i turn and say , " you were okay with the time traveling island , but the ending is too ' out there ' for you "
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

11. morgan wallen is pretty successful in the country world , but i guess that ' s not exactly " mainstream " so point stands . show sucks , but there have definitely been some talented folks make a career off of their time on the show , so it ' s not totally bullshit .
   (ID: ecc98de1e575d7e863a2124b364b8ed586778ba5)

   (ID: 2e421a43ff0a40b0f74bde81bde81db485fb136c)

18. that is just too random . i mean , the caves themselves seem huge , no matter how far , i still see areas of darkness . so i ' ll try and fully explore the area , i guess . i don ' t want to die and respawn , since i mined up lots of ore .
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)
