1. and when i say plans . i mean these plans would have been made way back when they were fuck buddies . as in . " hey man i really enjoy you and the sex is great . i know we will go our separate ways . but no matter what , or no matter who we ' re with . we will always fuck . deal " then some years later . boom here she is . " hey buddy , been thinking about you and how much i enjoy you . come visit me in amsterdam " are you ok with that ?
   (ID: fa749ff7262da656e34f21f4b902bd5287bf224d)

2. lmao seriously tho what did she think was gonna happen how could that possibly ever go good for her .
   (ID: 3e906e06d59fb5c2993270f0b4efed5b9ab122f7)

3. undoubtedly more time . mentally . something is off , maybe underlying issues that arise this action . one must ask , what could she possibly of done to set him off ? how does she even stay with him , even if she did love him ? he sounds more dangerous , possibly more harm to be caused in the future . further testing should be considered with cases as severe like this .
   (ID: 5b59b30ecdf3a93e4634d1600b3020fd8e9dc7e2)

4. this song reminds me of the skating rink . i just now thought how inappropriate it was for second graders to be singing about how she sure like the bone .
   (ID: ca01778748155fdbafe1e5147834524488f521c5)

5. wonder woman has been kind of an oddity in the recent dc film universe . as good as it was it was still far from perfect . the third act is one of the worst in any superhero films . aquaman made a shit ton of money , you ' re right ! but as for quality of film ? it ' s still not as good as even the lesser succesful marvel films . and still none of them have been nominated for best picture . say what you will , but the level of quality in the dc films is almost undeniable lower than the marvel films . it pains me to say that too , because when it comes to the comics i actually lean more towards dc . but they have next to no idea what they ' re doing when it comes to films these days .
   (ID: fbb82e5b963aa1cda25276df6c0968b4b03a3aa0)

6. bruh , why you do it right in front of your mom ? you from alabama or something ?
   (ID: de62a0a330b0a7ca76d55a6702dcae5baf1c3cae)

7. this episode was amazing . one of moffats best in my opinion . now i can ' t wait for the next one . but did my eyes deceive me or did missy do " the dab ?
   (ID: cf870aa7c8e0dd833ce984fd462b0f47ad7a6ace)

8. i would feel bad for them but also slightly jealous . then you have to realize that it doesn  t really matter that she couldn  t get number one because of course we don  t always get the love of our lives
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

9. hmmm . she might just be cold , what does her poop look like ?
   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)

10. no i think you raise a valid point which contributes to the discussion . people get raped and murdered every day , it ' s horrific , but just because of her status in life , this woman got a lot of media attention .
   (ID: d4912bd11a6aaa98c91794eda03e9fafdfcf5c43)

11. an interesting woman no doubt . can ' t really think of any good examples cos tbh i don ' t think i ' ve played many games with a character like this ?
   (ID: 8712de543372bc5f398d43ea5b918c85efc5dda7)

12. leaving cupboards and drawers open is a man thing . we ' re too busy to close them , i think .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

13. probably turn into one of those guys that want everyone to see it because they did and it was beautiful . it would just take a few years to start getting people to look unless shes ripping off blindfolds
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)

14. there are probably digit more relevant facts that i could still let you know about , i think today ' s interaction just set me off and it is all i thought about . i guess what i am getting at is , when there is no more respect for each other in a marriage is there any coming back from that ?
   (ID: 3b45915d58b20f0e2abb6b26d4534980a5d3aa68)

15. not exactly , trumpsuki heh represents in the game ' s second act , she just becomes a jerk . trump is also a jerk . i dont know what made me think of that .
   (ID: 420a86ecfb9d645349db591746d0cdeba4b68f37)

16. honestly , i think that ' s the first time i ' ve ever heard of a guy asking his girlfriend to wear more makeup . edit  til that some guys really want their girlfriends to wear makeup . i honestly don ' t get it .
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

17. naw , it ' s doubtful . his wife also works there , and she is both gorgeous , and keeps a close eye on those he hires as his secretaries . in fact i am pretty sure it did the hiring . besides , if he was going to cheat on her , why would he pick someone who looks so similar ? i just wonder how a guy who has digit kids doesn ' t know what it sounds like for the woman to give birth . like during the call for example , towards the end , he was amazed that she knew what she was doing , and she laughed and told him it wasn ' t her first time  he knows full well we have digit children at home . he ' s here for supper at least every few weeks so they can go over work while i take them out for some quality time .
   (ID: 720bf2762acb0f756492e6e40ae840126dae87ce)

18. well does she often hang out with him like go to his house or whatever
   (ID: bfb28ccea698c3dc12ee1909c3188e266edbbb84)

19. i mean , i suppose you haven ' t caught up with the anime ? but you ' re right . she ' s sort of a niecegoleon .
   (ID: 2c5816cbbee60e3c348eb04900ea7453604cff82)

20. there ' s no way on earth it ' s not being fueled . i can ' t fathom a person really being like him in real life . i ' ve seen my fair share of people infatuated with another person but never on the level like this with the other person saying no so many times . you would think the date would have been the deal breaker with him but then it ' s his best in digit years . whoa .
