1. maybe have your parents look into talkspace as a method of therapy . it  s text  based therapy , available digit days a week , and you don  t have to be face  to  face with anyone ! i  ve used it myself and it  s much easier for me to type it all out instead of talking . i clam up , too . maybe worth looking into
   (ID: 2997447dd39ca55e621bf2769e5d42b81622d35d)

2. shit . that ' s a terrible thing to happen to you so young . if it helps , you ' re getting internet bro hugs from me . you should know that you ' re an absolute hero for talking her out of it . even if she ended up doing it later , you still gave it your all to save her . most people go through their lives without ever saving someone else ' s . most adults wouldn ' t know how to do what you did . you are a legend .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

3. how you treat your partner during sex and how you treat the opposite sex in general in your everyday life are different . what is being a  fuckhole  for chad even suggest ? having sex with an attractive man ? what a wild thing to do ! says the guy who would probably fuck anything with a vagina .
   (ID: 1e6ea64fb15fb5b12b1d82a3a5bdced4e3a6559a)

4. does she feel even close to how i do ?
   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)

5. how about " omg your much cuter in person then your pic ' s . i ' m glad i came now i almost didn ' t bother . nice to know i am above the threshold of your lowest standard .
   (ID: 5078613a782f11088cff05f4503056b040cea999)

6. you can do whatever you want . when you ' re married , you and your partner get to make such decisions together .
   (ID: 5146a89965a734a4d1ec9ec9145abae872a4569d)

7. if someone  s tailgating you , just get out of the way if you can . stopping hard and flipping them off is only gonna make them angrier . if you can  t get out of the way , learn to properly brake check . you  re supposed to lightly tap on your brake , so that you don  t decelerate but your brake lights come on , letting them know they  re too close . if all else fails and they persist in riding your ass and possibly following you , then i  d say it  s okay to stop short . just brace yourself for a possible hit and a lot of yelling afterwards .
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

8. i dunno if i ' m really qualified to answer that because i don ' t really a definitive crush on someone . but i haven ' t told the person that i find the cutest , so . i guess no ?
   (ID: 3e1762624e55cdfb0929da3e1a1c438675e0c217)

9. yeah ! that ' s what he tell us me . and what hurts me even more is my older brother is so close minded that he cannot understand my concerns . yeah i guess that ' s the best thing i could do . he already told me that everyone should live their own life , but it hurt so much when he said it .
   (ID: 1634046145226dc01b1fa030132efd0574c38352)

10. i kinda like the idea of being a guy ' s first because they ' ll remember me forever . but sex with someone who ' s inexperienced can be a bit awkward . it ' s a turn on when a guy knows what he ' s doing . you ' re still young though , and you still have plenty of time to learn . i ' m sure lots of girls are fine with virgins .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

11. wow i know what you mean . it ' s hard for me to tell people no so i usually end up in situations that i don ' t wanna be in .
   (ID: b5942acb07bb8a74e4924ef75fa70edb4f626161)

12. pre  teen to teenage years , perhaps , but there ' s no harm in doing it earlier . you can ' t really know if you like something if you don ' t do it .
   (ID: 618e7c681a628e6c6c5521926bf4d17deb5ed5d6)

13. it ' s important to know yourself before you can really start to know others .
   (ID: aac8075b69856b11cb4307ac267b902010d66e3a)

14. i ' ve spent the last digit years as a full time pre med student trying to start a photography business . this weekend im a vendor in our city ' s semi annual bridal expo , i ' ve got digit  weddings on the calendar , and i ' m teaching workshops at parks and recreation on professional photography . i still feel like i have no idea what i ' m doing , but i am so proud of myself and i don ' t have anyone to share that with .
   (ID: 17496dcfdb38727f022d155f086be60541019391)

15. don ' t fuck him unless you trust him . cause once they cum you ' re trash . and they usually don ' t even text back . so if you ' re looking for more than a fuck , get to know the dude . also ? cum tastes like shit . i don ' t care what anyone says . it tastes like medicine or some salty thick mucus shit . but for whatever reason they love it when you swallow . go figure
   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

16. this sounds a lot like my story . i appreciate all the people trying to make you feel better , and they might be right . but here ' s my two cents . yeah , you might be a narcissist . you might just have narcissistic behaviors . you might not have any . in my experience and research , i found there are a lot of misconceptions about the concept of narcissism . i began my research after thinking an ex was a narcissist . low and behold i eventually saw clearly that these behaviors were in my own actions . i highly recommend emdr therapy . changed my life . i definitely think that zealous religious cultures like mormonism breed narcissistic traits and tendencies because people have stunted emotional growth  emotional intelligence . it also cultivates codependency . people miss out on a lot of experiences that are key to growing into a health functioning adult . hang in there . no matter the situation , you have the desire to be self aware which means you will keep growing and getting happier . bravo and hang in there !
   (ID: 445ba4596e4bcff0c96b23f038cf784185970198)

17. you can tell him that you appreciate that he wants to get you somehing he thinks is nicer but you like the one you already have . maybe say you ' d rather that extra money goes to something else you ' ve both wanted to fix or change instead .
   (ID: 7632dd7ebcb664bfada5fff420a436f42e3721d5)

18. i guess so . even though they gave me ptsd and were partly at fault for my depression , they might be goin through the exact same thing with guilt .
   (ID: e87275c4c3cfea671e40cbeff9a12d5fc1372f97)

19. ehh yes and no , from her point of view maybe , if she doesn ' t know how busy you are
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

20. i am so sorry to hear about her condition . i can understand that it is difficult right now with everything going on including your wedding , it  s okay  people can become anxious and may not want to face a difficult  sad situation . your being honest at least . it  s often good to just relax and pull back and think about your two events in life and reflect . be thankful . anyway , i hope everything goes okay for you and your family . this reminded me of something  please see coco pixar  i think that it may help you and give you a different perspective about life in general .
