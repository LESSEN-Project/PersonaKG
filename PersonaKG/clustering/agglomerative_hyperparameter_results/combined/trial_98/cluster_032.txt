10. i am also on day digit though i ' m young digit and have only smoked for 4ish years chronic use but i started a couple months before i turned digit . and i didn ' t start daily use til around digit . your story has inspired me a little more to never smoke it again . like you i had quit for a while in the past not two months , only digit days but i was sure i was never going back . then my buddy came over who i used to smoke with all the time and i decided i would do a one time sesh and we all know what happens . next day bought more and smoked all day daily until digit days ago minus the time i was camping and had no weed but the first thing i did when i got home was toke so i dont count it reading about older guys ' struggles is gonna keep me off of it cause i don ' t want to keep doing this into my digit ' s even i feel like i ' ve wasted digit years and thousands of dollars , i can ' t imagine smoking for digit years i actually can ' t . i wonder what that has been like for you . do you feel like you wasted those digit years ? i want to know what you think about it cause i can ' t picture it myself . and maybe your answer will add another reason for me to not pick it up again even once . thank you so much for sharing your story . i wish the best of luck to you on your journey i will look for your updates cause i wanna see how much you will grow !
