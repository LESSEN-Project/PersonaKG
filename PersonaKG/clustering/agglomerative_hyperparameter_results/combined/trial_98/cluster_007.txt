6. since what a fursona is has been explained to death here i ' ll just add to it first , you do not need a fursona to be a furry . in general " being furry " is a very loose term . the only thing in common between all of us is that we like anthropomorphic art . however if you do want to interact with the community outside of reddit having at least an oc as an avatar will help tremendously . second , hya reddit is the best place imo . stay here if you want amazing furry art regularly oand go to furry  irl some nsfw , not a lot for memes and shitposting .

   (ID: f7713e4cd0a5245097f9f45a1194222bda369b48)

16. as a furry myself i  ll say that the kind of people who end up on this subreddit are a small minority in the fandom . that being said i  m also going to say that unlike what some furries would say i  m going to estimate that like digit  of furries jack off to the characters . theres this study which i  m sure somebody could find and link in the comments that puts the number at like digit  but you have to realize that most people who watch normal porn wouldn  t admit to viewing it , so i bet a lot of the furries polled in that study straight up lied during the survey .
   (ID: 6b1a5069121a216d43b11b6d5c61b018eb668aaa)

17. amazing description . also i have discovered that sometimes the people that get labeled as " ugly " are some of the most beautiful people in the world . they aren ' t ruled by conceit or vanity , and their friends love them for who they are , not what they look like . that ' s been my experience , and they don ' t see the ugly outside , but the beauty within .
