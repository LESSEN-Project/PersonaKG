1. you could still have gone to the 3d show . as long as you ' re wearing the glasses you get a clear image same as anybody else . why take it away from him ?
   (ID: 4ef88292bcb63ee32b3f587610b610322cea098e)

2. jairo . many an hour was spent playing minecraft with that dude . miss him greatly .
   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

3. i mean he has a point  when kids are crying and stuff to their parents because they didn ' t make the playoffs they are being kinda spoiled . i just don ' t think that it is rooted directly from getting an end of the year trophy . there are probably other parenting issues there .
   (ID: 89c3606d2dfc5d2a2da97fb49ddc1894f8bf330f)

4. when someone is your advesary , you have seven choices  beat the crap out of him totally ignore him pretend to be nice to him and slam him behind his back get someone else to kick his ass and deny having anything to do with it kiss his ass in hopes he will come to like you totally surrender have a civil dialougue and see if things progress in a positive direction well . , obama was just sitting there and the man came up to him and offered a gift and a hand shake . unless obama wanted deck the guy right there , act like a spoiled teenage girl , or be a total pussy or a total dick , the only thing he could have done was accept the gift in a civil way and shake the man ' s hand . that ' s option  digit seven choices and he did the only one that any one could call correct . come on guys . , you ' re giving a new definition to the term sore  losers .
   (ID: f76420437c1e4fb2e8ba8a9e9b0e116c7fc513ab)

5. regardless of whether you agree with him , he ' s a fantastic speaker and debater .
   (ID: 0eb78cb406a9dd9e14938eca8822e3bb1e1ad60a)

6. i have heard him take the calls of a couple gay women . i remember one was due to a custody battle with their adopted son , but they were never married . ouch . i hear dave say ,  as an evangelical christian .  a lot , so i think we can fill in the lines on where he stands on the subject of gay marriage . however , i  m sure you can take the class together , it would depend on the coordinator and if the others in the class make you feel comfortable there or not . most of the time fpu is offered at churches , but sometimes you can find one at a community center or something if that  d make you more comfortable , if you  re worried about judgy church people .
   (ID: a154763d4a1c7d2d412ab13eeed4849772817d9a)

7. they say he ' s not really dead eh ? he ' s only got one foot in the grave
   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

   (ID: 888fecec3c361bbe3db00f64ff7cf51950d332df)

   (ID: ad911088c8434d08c7a96c969a57a09b00f02e99)

10. both times i saw manzarek live he went out of his way to basically say the movie is bs so i will stand by that . jim was definitely flawed but so is everyone else .
   (ID: 55510b17a4f0d7b5820e6f21287525ef6cd60994)

11. why did you make him look blind
   (ID: f3f34b7b903c833de2625265da4585abdc86ab7c)

12. there  s def been more funny , but tedy bruschi  s face on first take when stephen a had one of the biggest fuck ups i  ve ever seen killed me and is something i will never forget .
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

13. i was waiting for someone to call him a narcissist because that ' s more fitting . but you still want to use the coward name as well as if the correspondent dinner was so important that you find him in contempt for missing it . if you find missing a social function of no significance cowardly then you would probably have to believe everyone is a coward . everyone has missed something weather it was work or a party or some other social function simply because we didn ' t like it . everything he is doing most people do as well . avoid things they don ' t like and do things they do like . what i don ' t understand is why there is such a high value placed on the functions he avoids . if your favorite person was president and missed it would you think they are a coward as well ? or would you automatically justify their actions ? by all means if you like the word coward then use it but it seems childish when there are better words to use . again i don ' t support trump but he gives you guys such wonderful opportunities to look smart and be little him at the same time and so many throw them away to use childish name calling . i can ' t say exactly why you use that word but i can tell you through my digit years of life digit  of the time it ' s simply a insulting derogatory use rather than an actual character assessment .

14. pretty sure its cause hes rich and builds stuff she can shoot in for her ' naturalist aesthetic '
   (ID: dc1a6ca8b7ce3327dec097f0883d72c2689870fc)

15. yea it is almost like bosses are what you do after everyone is dead
   (ID: d048a45810866f7b853972f50c2c2746bc339a21)

16. i ' m not surprised so many people are supporting him  the cognitive dissonance must be a total mindfuck for them . that ' s what religion does , turns people in to mindless sheep . the person i feel most sorry for is the pastor ' s daughter .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

17. but why would he need just one ?
   (ID: 77a6bff8693a174b55d34fc32fdd8a87710fecb7)

18. why does anyone defend anything ? it all comes down to perspective . some people can  t see beyond the mistakes he has made and some can  t see beyond all of the good he has done . its beliefs and values . some defend him because they are more alike than they are different and same goes for the other way around . it  s really fascinating to see how much effort people put into making sure everyone knows how they feel about someone else .
   (ID: 059967fb197d86a39a50a6a3e2c4fb0aec8d10a2)

19. if you ask an average american to draw a school shooter , you ' ll get a collection of sketches of this guy right here . i ' m just kidding , bud . but seriously , stay away from my kids school . thanks .
   (ID: 191aa96179821ac46f9548541f04899c2adacec9)

20. no worries if he doesn ' t , but if he wants to be properly credited , i can do that !
