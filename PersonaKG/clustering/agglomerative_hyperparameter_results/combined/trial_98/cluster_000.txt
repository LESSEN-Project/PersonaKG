20. for me , my purpose is to be there for my partner and try to make the lives of others better . god knows i don  t give a fuck about myself , i was ready to clock out of life when i was digit , even tried to commit suicide multiple times , but you only have one life after all . so why not use that life to make the lives of others better , even if yours is absolutely terrible , and they may return the favor . now i  m in a great long term relationship , a steady career , a mortgage on my house , and a great relationship with my family . what you put your focus on determines your purpose and outlook on life , and that greatly determines what will happen in your life . i  m really glad that for one minute i decided to be selfless and try and lift others up , even though i thought the world would be better without me .
