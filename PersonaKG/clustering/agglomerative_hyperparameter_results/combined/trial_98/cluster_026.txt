1. it will look a bit daunting at first , start from the start of the tutorials , it will have you make a simple thing first . this is good as it teaches you the basics of what you need . whenever it feels like it is starting to swamp you a bit , stop , do something else for a couple of hours , do something physical . let your brain rest and then come back to it . it will be tempting to just try and power through it all right now , but you will struggle to even remember the first step if you do that . most importantly keep the scope of your project narrow . finish the first idea , see how it works , and get another perspective on it . ask someone that won ' t baby you to review it , and listen to what they have to say . then come back and see if you can improve the thing . small iterations with a review between them help you grow and learn .
   (ID: 8360c6d04ba11da7a727532482d78505e52a4150)

2. i  ve never had a job that pays like that . if that  s legal where op lives it sucks , but justified .
   (ID: aa10be53ada3d17528c17c60feb64d0669aed98f)

3. i sub at many local to me ones , it  s very challenging but rewarding . it is a tough situation because many of them are all over the spectrum , as far as reading level , basic math skills , etc . and of course most of my time is spent modifying behavior and teaching proper behavior . but there  s moments where we learn something together , or they are all participating in a discussion , where i am really happy . but it  s tough , i definitely couldn  t be a teacher there or do it for digit years , like some of them . but it is great experience .
   (ID: e8fea87ced4a86b7ba9c50ae33cf5b3dda99af88)

4. I am adult actress.
   (ID: 564c5b4efd54586fbf212727e2071f5ddadabb82)

5. why does what you do in your free time have any bearing on what you do at work ? in your mind , is it impossible for someone who likes to get high to refrain from doing so at work ? if you drink beer or alcohol , how is that any different ? should having a beer at home disqualify you from driving a forklift at work the next day ? these are genuine questions .
   (ID: 74058c90ada3aae7a59703064acbf3ced38f3681)

6. what vehicle to buy . when am i moving out of my parents house , where am i moving too , how much am i going to get back in taxes is it gonna be enough to put towards moving , is the girl i ' m talking to in to me as much as iam in to them .

   (ID: b6567f005c34603036e6119544386ff4f12ec3a9)

8. i think luck is more about creating an environment for good stuff to happen . for example , if you don ' t believe something is possible or that you ' re unlucky , how likely are you to try whole heartedly at something ? give it your all and believe it will happen and imagine it all the way through to the very end .
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

9. sleep ! i recommend atleast digit or digit hours ! off topic  girl in my orgo class always sort of let  it  be  known that she stayed up til about 4am " gettin shit done . then at a digit  hour long chemistry lecture that started at 8am she ' d say " i dont know why i have trouble staying awake for this class "   l    this my my reaction everytime
   (ID: f296ca909e75f5e7a28f054f4937f3c6eccb6a56)

10. yeah , i know . you still have to give a bs answer because if you really admit what your biggest weakness is , you won  t get hired . you give an actual weakness that isn  t too bad and explain how you  re improving on it . in other words , you give a bullshit answer .

   (ID: dc0783c6951122c6edfc85430901cf133c146b32)

   (ID: 063122b93a40a719244d27587193e154f2fed59d)

20. i took a year off after high school to decide what to do and make some money full time and i did , but i never properly took time to do enough research and i just jumped into a program that i  m not completely enjoying . im two years deep in this program now , and it  s a shame that now i know what i want to do and i wish i took the time during my break to find out that i should have done this other program instead of the one i  m doing now . if you  re gonna take a break , please pick wisely . i  m too deep in to turn back , and if i could go back i would do things different . you don  t want to be the guy who wishes he went another route
