1. if you already have a full canadian licence you can exchange it for a full british , no need to get a provisional and then take a test although if you ' re feeling uncertain about driving here perhaps some lessons with an instructor wouldn ' t be such a bad thing . i ' m in a car club since i can ' t afford to own my own car , so i don ' t drive every day more like digit times a month or so . for me , driving in london is fine except i don ' t like driving through central london , rush hour or big roundabouts although i still manage them okay . i took my first test in pinner which is easy compared to other test centres and failed due to one silly mistake . took my second test in wanstead which is notorious for being difficult and passed .
   (ID: 8260f82c24d2a4a134e92bf2fdcfc09a8eecf8fa)

2. i might be talking out my ass because i am not at all versed in employment or tax law , but i imagine it like you hired a contractor to do some work on your roof , but they instead make it worse and now it rains in your kitchen . i ' m not sure that applies here , but , where i live as long as you weren ' t maliciously incompetent , you will get paid for hours you have worked regardless of whether . can you imagine getting paid only if and only for hours where your code worked ? that ' s a crazy idea to me .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

3. but then you have to rely on somebody else and it would be fun being a pseudo pudge to make some cool play or smth
   (ID: 2dcd820eac167adf18c6706f1c0a26a39eb945be)

4. digit  digit in the video , there are no needles in these . you wouldn ' t need them , it ' s just pressure controlled .
   (ID: 6aca29520994a85891e32b7ad6030791dfa1cbe2)

5. except that you don ' t really know your limit until you reach it . and most people do that at least once .
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

6. i like these events too , a bit of challenge for the shards , and when you do get the characters to digit  you get some zetas as a reward . and i also agree with you , they should be farmed both there and elsewhere .
   (ID: a304d2b10646e73686547edafa852cc87a894eb5)

7. i believe that hacking is fine if you are say in a 1v1 trolling someone , basically if it  s not being used to pretend that your really good or something along those lines i  m fine with it . unless i  m the one getting cheated lol .
   (ID: 8cdbf7ed2ace2eeed8bd2b0e2e86001342f83a1f)

8. to me , a hobby is doing something you like and makes you happy . what others think of it is irrelevant  unless it happens to be illegal . gaming isn ' t my thing , but if you enjoy it , great ! just don ' t let it or anything else run  ruin your life .
   (ID: 9286ff57fb4290178a79b38d20f6a95da9d2267f)

9. though now i ' m really looking at the picture closely . i can ' t tell if thats really a mint error or just a damaged penny lol . i ' m gonna tell myself , just a damaged penny . that way i wont feel so bad about losing it . damn
   (ID: 67d52400bddd68c40eba2a37485eecb683846877)

10. " i don ' t understand how anyone can play game like that smash bros . for five hours straight . she said this to me the day after i went to the midnight launch , and after weeks of me telling her how excited i was for the game
   (ID: c378ee827fb7d26c7ea685ec1dc451bf264b0151)

11. currently off on a trip visiting family , if anyone noticed me being a bit less active then that ' s why . i recently started playing crusader kings digit , it ' s a lot of fun
   (ID: 0b52265db13bf8bc27ad36aad94e870706eb6689)

12. this describes my problems as well . i ' m on vial smasher partnered with kraum . lots of x spells , including my finishers like torment of hailfire or jay ' s immolating inferno , and nothing infinite . its a " curious control " deck until i ' ve built enough mana through rocks , urborg  cabal coffers , and  or the two creatures that double your black mana . i play guttersnipe and a couple others like him , so i have good targets for curiosity , ophidian eye and tandem lookout . it ' s actually a lot of fun , and i haven ' t been hated out , because it ' s not like i ' m blowing up the world by turn digit or anything and vial smasher ' s triggers are random which i think helps a lot with people ' s feelings about the deck . my win rate has got to be over digit  , probably higher , but i don ' t keep records . if cedh develops a little more locally , i ' ll switch kraum out for thrasios and go full tilt .
   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

13. probably one of my favorite game . the combat and movement are fluid , and the maps are very well designed . if you want to play stealthily , the maps offer many different ways to achieve your goal . if you want to don ' t want to play stealthily , you get a large array of weapons and powers . just watch stealthgamerbr on youtube to see what i ' m talking about . great replayability , and the dlc that comes with this bundle is excellent as well  they ' re not just short missions , but lengthy sets of missions which introduce you to new characters and powers . the only drawbacks i can think of are that some people may not like the artstyle , and that people complain about some powers being op . also , if you ' re a completionist , finding all gold in every stage is a pain . for  digit , it ' s a must buy imo
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

14. if it ' s staples requesting you to do so and not a subpoena from the courts you ' ve never been to court related to it ? , don ' t waste your time by going . once you show up to court the first time , you will need to show up every month until you are actually called and might be required to be there until a verdict comes out . fyi your current company would pay you the same way they pay jury duty .

   (ID: 7c0a90108389e898ab80f1c7af44e170b85c6d76)

18. so what ' s the change ?
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

19. worst case is still a digit mana digit  digit and if that happens u probably have bigger problems . its a digit mana digit  digit or digit  digit or digit  digit most of the time . it ' s just a better twilight drake since it can ' t be silenced . really bad design .
