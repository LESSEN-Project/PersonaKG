4. for me , a major reason aside from image quality and so on to jump from compact to dslr was response time . in this line of thought , a jump from dslr to mirrorless might make you feel that the camera is laggy , because , well , despite all the advantages the evf offers , it ' s still more laggy than an ovf . that ' s subject to change , of course , but that ' s it at least with today ' s technology . if viewfinder lag compared to a dslr is not an issue for you , then go on  sony ' s got some amazing stuff to offer . as for the d700 , i don ' t think it really has a true successor yet think what d700 is to d3  the digit with these digit mp is into another category but if you ' ve got the nerve and resources to cope with large files , why not ?  the df is a very much a niche model , moreover it ' s plastic  y and not that well built from what i ' ve read  the only nikon option left in the category of full  frame  and  not  so  high  resolution seems to be the d4  d4s , which i think is justifiable if you have the money , but then again  by far it ' s not affordable for everyone .
   (ID: 32520dc340c18ed101e3d5ea02b3a7bca25dcc29)

5. a fully fitted infinity gauntlet
   (ID: 20fef7b83cf9ae51924e5491cac2f90901d833e0)

6. yeah that ' s what i was also thinking about , like i understand it was declutter but she kept saying how much she loved it and how good it was , i thought it was a tad wasteful tbh and she wouldn ' t of been able to sell it or give it to a friend as it was so used . yeah i think if it ' s a tutorial you could just show the colour and i ' m sure unless it ' s the rarest colour ever majority of people would have the exact same colour or similar in their collection .
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

9. alex rider books or the cherub books .
   (ID: e78c9eb3b69138ff8337dd896bc5bb1e02fc6559)

10. yeah but that  s like saying you don  t want to build any other caliber but 9mm because the magazines won  t fit . i understand what you  re saying but from a practically stand point you  re talking about building something that doesn  t have any support other than a small niche . the glock platform has been gone over a billions times now and everyone knows how to use it . also you can get digit round mags for glock at around  digit all day .

   (ID: bfe383e709c2236b3ebe70cb079877dd420ac82b)

17. here you . keep this in mind when drawing . i also used to make the mistake of making the head too big . oh yeah use shapes . my biggest tip for you would be to draw something that you ' re not good at aka getting out of your comfort zone and also trying out new artstyles but this artstyle is cool too . also you should read some manga preferably one that has a more realistic artstyle such as fist of the northstar or kengan asura . that ' s how i learned proportions and anatomy . oh yeah and don ' t worry about failing with things such as perspective . art takes time .
   (ID: 22864f9484c3c6d7f8c8dac79c58ea32865eb794)

18. let me tell you what i realised over the past few years . the desktop is just the backend that let us run the stuff that we really use like firefox , vlc , gimp , libre office . the less the desktop get in the way the better it is for me and xfce sure does not get in the way . current xfce feel like a return to gnome digit . digit and that ain ' t bad in my book ! am tired of desktop project that try to reinvent the wheel every other year and force us to relearn or even in some case reinvent how to do the same shit we use to do but in a different way . i want my desktop lean , mean , stable and out of my way . i also don ' t want the project maintaining it to fuck with the product that i use just to scratch an itch ! if you want to scratch an itch fork it and experiment with that fork !
   (ID: 0791967485c3fd08f13af7d16f986ab94fa30bb3)

19. this just might do
   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)
