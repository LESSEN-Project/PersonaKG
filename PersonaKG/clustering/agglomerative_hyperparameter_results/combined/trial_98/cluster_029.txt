1. i  ve had many dogs in my digit year old life . it  s never easy to lose them . your dog has lived a great life and i  m sorry you have to put him down . make his last days the best they could be !
   (ID: 404d4f663681fcf738d043296148ae4de655b22b)

2. some dogs don  t like people with hats on . might just be something they aren  t used to . or a bad experience .
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

3. it ' s a snowball , where ' s the dog ffs ?
   (ID: 20048869822e20c72833a6810d618a70fe430016)

4. i think the idea of furries existing alongside domesticated animals is kind of the go to explanation that most fiction writers use . it ' s the one that seems to make the most sense . but yeah , when fiction writers diverge from the formula , it ' s often annoying when they don ' t fill in the new gaps they ' ve created in their world . although with a world full of anthropomorphic creatures , i suppose there ' s lots that just has to remain unexplained and assumed . using another example from a series  we still don ' t have any freakin ' idea how the hell pokeballs work .
   (ID: ecce6e894db30f245f1073ca0e270a3bb87eaa71)

5. well go in there with the approach that you are not digit  satisfied and want to return everything . the worst case scenario is  we can  t refund live animals but you are within the return policy for the accessories  cage etc .  if they say that , you let it go in the store after they refund you . make sure to bring it in a box . also , record it
   (ID: 237175707a16a7382ac8130de85ed85b63dc9442)

6. as man did you guys break up ? well if you did you and your cat friend will get through it together . the cat is very cute and i ' m sure you ' ll find love again .
   (ID: 990ad26ccc25b114c7f512fc1c83b02e54b79e2a)

7. I live in turkey cats.
   (ID: 2834b254700cedfb96641229b712899b4d697418)

8. i was going to make a comment about how at some point , maybe you should let the dog go , but i can  t believe how well he healed . i should have more faith .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

9. i died one of their feet blue , but now they have to be barefoot for me to tell them apart .
   (ID: 23a788cf7874353f54f4163f0e2c16e6043d04a1)

10. honestly that depends where you are in the world . i love gumtree , but if you ' re in the states you might want to try craigslist and  or facebook along with other more local advertising spots . second hand shops can also sometimes carry animal cages . i guess i can try craigslist . what is a " second hand shop ?  potentially . do you know how old they are ? boys tend to scrap a little as they hit a hormonal phase around digit months , and calm down somewhat after . however not all male rats will calm down and sometimes neutering is needed to get their hormones in check . have you used the cage calculator on their current set up ? obviously a new cage should be found but if it ' s tiny , it might be another reason to get a new one asap . they are about a year old . i got them for christmas last year , along with their aquarium . i just used the calculator , and it said it ' s too small . how big do i need , then ? it didn ' t say .  yes ! i would just switch to the complete mix . are they rat nuggets ? something similar ? they ' re generally much better for your rats . seed mixes contain things like alfalfa which rats don ' t need and won ' t eat and dried corn which can be dangerous for rats . they also tend to be much higher in protein , which is bad for rats . i ' ll switch to just that kind , then .  diarrhoea in rats is uncommon , do you feed fresh vegetables rats need this in their diet too ? the most often cause is overfeeding of something watery like cucumber and isn ' t usually a long term problem . no , the only thing i feed them is what i ' ve mentioned . i also give them treats little yogurt drops , i think banana flavored . i gave them carrots once but that ' s all they ' ve ever had . also , wow , after reading that , i really feel like a crappy owner .  i ' ve never had a cat , so i can ' t advise there . however it ' s useful to first get a litter tray , usually a corner unit , and fill it with a different type of bedding . i don ' t think anything would fit . i got them a wheel but it doesn ' t fit so they don ' t use it .  then it ' s merely a case of moving their poops to the tray and leaving them there . whenever you see them poop outside , move it to the tray . repeat for as long as it takes for them to get that it ' s their new ' poop ' spot . you can try treating them after they go there too if you catch them . be aware though this generally only works for poop . rats tend to urinate to scent mark their way around , this can ' t be trained away . however they  do  like to pick a spot to poo in , so it ' s a fairly simple task of encouraging them to do this where you want . so i should like , actually pick up their poops and move them ? i ' ve always just let it accumulate and then dump all of the bedding after a week and replace it with fresh bedding .  the only thing i can say here is try to make it a habit to get them out  after you come home from work or school , get them out on your bed for digit min . the same time every day , or in the morning as you ' re getting ready . i have an extremely irregular schedule . some days i ' m up at 4am and some days i ' m up at 4pm . does it need to be regular ?  but being kept in their cage for a week will get very boring for them .   if you truly don ' t think you can take care of them then there is also no shame in giving them up for adoption . i think i ' m going to do this , honestly . this sounds like too much for me right now .  just make sure that if you do that , you charge you do not want them going for snake food and you make sure their next owner is knowledgeable . what do you mean ' charge ' ? like ask them for money ? i feel like that ' s a bit odd , if i ' m trying to get rid of them .
   (ID: 6043d89c15dee029743b4ae46c3043e760e0fedb)

11. very understandable . it helps if you can sell eggs , grow some of what they eat , and use their litter productively , but those aren ' t realistic options for everyone .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

12. i remember as i kid i was reading a book with a certain quote in it , something along the lines of " if you try that again i will buy you the cutest kitten in the whole world , wait for you to fall in love with it , and then gouge its eyes out with a spoon while you watch " cant remember for the life of me what book it was .

14. sneak a cucumber behind cat . i never have . or in the case of my dogs buy a mirror and put it somewhere they can see . i made my dog bark at himself and i didn ' t try to do it . i gave him a treat as an apology
   (ID: 89169d635166bbc089338914b42d288ecb2593e9)

15. i adopted a cat no one told me that the cat was deaf and had some serious emotional issues . i bought it lots of little toys from the pet shop and one day when i came back from work i found the cat in a really bad shape , it kept throwing up . got her to the vet and he told me that she literally ate a rubber ball , chew it up and ate it  had digit big rubber pieces in the stomach and needed an emergency surgery . i did not have the money to pay for it and i knew my family wouldn ' t support that so i turned to my boyfriend we were at the beginning of the relationship . he gave me all he had and got the cat fixed . the recovery was quick but she still has a habit for plastic objects and bags . we are living together and we are always super careful with this kind of objects , no matter how hard were those times she ' s my little kitty
