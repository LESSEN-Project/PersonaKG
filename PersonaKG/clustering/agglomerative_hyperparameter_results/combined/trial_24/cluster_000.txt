1. just tell me your underlying opinion . the ultimate goal is just to have as many animals as possible on this planet ? why ? well i guess asceticism , isn ' t necessarily religion , it ' s just that a lot of people who practice it do it because they don ' t want to go to hell . still , no one at all is obligated to do it .  digit . dogs eat animals .  digit . in a lifetime a dog will eat more than digit animal . my dog never killed a single animal in all of his twelve years of life . he was fed meat because he is a carnivorous animal . humans have a choice . most animals don ' t , they kill and eat meat to survive . should we kill lions so that wildebeest can survive ? cats so that mice can survive ? bears so that fish can survive ? regardless of how you look at it , not only is nature only taking its natural course , these animals are simply more intelligent than the ones you are fighting to keep alive . dogs are smarter than cows . dogs don ' t have a choice of whether or not to eat meat or plants . we do . they don ' t .
