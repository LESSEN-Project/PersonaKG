1. wait . i thought everyone kept it ? it ' s an incredibly rare pokemon you get at the start , and it ' s your best friend ! how could you justify getting rid of it ?
   (ID: c6b2000b95ec54c8393c3ab07cc2c5acd2563345)

2. One of my favorite things is bed   idiots.
   (ID: c28c39847d1ec88851aadf063f6e8baf4594b35c)

3. i laid mine out in chunks like front left  front right , back bottom , back left  right , shoulders , etc . basically , as icreamboy said , plan ahead . also , with the enthusiasm of buying patches , you may end up with some patches from bands you enjoy . then realize you don ' t enjoy them enough to have them stitched to your back . so think about the patch before you put it on , and if it ' s something you will feel comfortable with for a while . sure , you could remove it later , but as said before planning makes a visual difference . i have maybe digit patches that i bought specifically for my vest that , upon laying them all out , i decided against using for one reason or another .
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

4. honestly , i ' ve not got anything amazing . perhaps i was naive and thought nobody would do that , but hey , they did .
   (ID: 75ca79d6c5cfc50533ff56cde25edfb593ae8568)

5. something that relates to a talent or a goal of theirs , especially if it ' s a little bit beyond them . for example , if they like drawing , get them some really nice pens or paper , so they feel both validated in their craft but also inspired to do more .
   (ID: df28c2a39b633ca418192316a199668289382292)

6. clothing from my relatives . i would take any other sort of gift and keep with pride but i do take pride in my wardrobe . i have the best family but i have my own style and i  m not wearing that t  shirt with a sassy quote on it that aunt jodie thought was so me . it  s not . not even close
   (ID: 18e18998471794de2ee0ded08a5f57a45a336e24)

7. just our silly gift exchange . we pick a theme for the year . it has been  something from a truck stop , something blue , something homemade , your favorite song on a cdhad to explain what those were to the kids and then a quiz to guess whose was whose . things like that . usually we all pick a gift , open them , then have a dice rolling game where everyone gets one chance to steal another ' s present ! we have a large family , so getting one present is way easier and just so much more fun and it takes the commercial aspect out of the holiday and makes it more about our family being together and doing the usual silly shit we do together .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

8. One of my favorite things is socks redistribution  wealth.

   (ID: 8487a8406f04273c554e2e578c3a667648916790)

13. probably nothing and i ' m so sad about it . last year we found this really amazing resturaunt that we really liked but it ' s kinda far . so i had hoped to make it our thing to continue going to it every year for valentine ' s day . i also made a clay mold of my hand giving the finger and did it up all nice . it ' s like an inside joke thing and i know he would have loved it so much . so now it ' s just sitting in my room waiting to never be received by the person it was made for . minda wanna destroy it and smash it to pieces because im so mad and upset .
   (ID: 9981a65782780477b53d712e936b6997a4092240)

14. it was made of white , red , and black concrete and is a diameter of digit ! let me know what you think ! not sure yet what to put on the inside but i put symmetric sea lanterns in so far so it  s not pitch black .

   (ID: b4b3c5b3797986d94531e12d74354970a19f91bc)

19. yta generally i wouldnt reccomend buying something for other peoples super invested hobbies unless you are equally invested and understand what they would like  want . you are likely to waste money , and in this case its money both of you share through marriage . you also come across as really selfabsorbed in all your replies , refusing to accept the fact that what you did was wrong , and it came from the fact that you have very little clue about what your wife does . im sure your heart was in the right place , but your actions and words speak for themselves
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

20. so how any dream houses did you design so far ?
