1. does foster actually exist ? i always thought it was just a joke we were playing on americans . kind of like asians selling feng shui to white people
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

2. i ' ve never had dutch brothers coffee . we just moved to the western part of usa . but the lines at literally every location we ' ve seen are enormous all day long . i don ' t know what they are putting in that stuff but folks sure love it .
   (ID: 74cc8b596c27cbe385709690baaf3b68f39b3915)

3. yeah , we got a ton here in seattle , and they ' re almost all great . one of the best ways to keep shops like that open , in my opinion . if you don ' t want to do a lot of food you can always do a coffee shop and allow outside food with a small cover i ' ve seen  digit or partner with a nearby shop to allow their food exclusively in return for a discount for your employees .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

4. hell yes ! that is the only thing i miss about living in california .
   (ID: 388a9b7cd52305ad65297c63f4c50272c2661e4c)

   (ID: 7a0302ed354e54bfa45e1de27055f29421f91f29)

   (ID: b5e15026c378d181e66e2b38bfc245705510a727)

7. hell yeah , especially the digit always has that vibe . but they overhauled the whole building it ' s not that dark and damp place people used to love haha . but sucks man if you still want to go you can always hook up with me so you have a place to stay with some friends or what not ! have a nice day man !
   (ID: 14bd1366b004b74cfd8c9cb269849740d12cff80)

8. i don ' t know enough about canada to know if this is stupid or not , so feel free to ignore me if it is . can you sign up with credit karma ? it ' s a free site that will show you your credit reports and they also will show you offers you might qualify for . check it out and see if they recommend any particular cards . discover cards are usually pretty easy to get , as are capital one cards . just be careful of things like annual fees and high interest rates .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

9. i lived there as a kid  looking at this meadow , i ' m like , " i think i ' ve actually been there ! "  then i get sad because i never appreciated being there as a kid  now that i ' m grown , i can ' t just pick up  move back .
   (ID: 649605988d72e34fdcf0c170b6b9fa959a7d483e)

10. you obviously don ' t really want to do it . stop worrying about everyone else and take the time to get yourself together
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

11. declining invites is i think a bit too far unless you have reason to expect an immediate disaster , such as a hurricane or snowstorm . here ' s what i would do . digit  keep some basics in your car , primarily water , food , meds and blankets . if you ' re travelling without a car , keep basics in your luggage if at all possible . digit  introduce others to prepping , but be diplomatic about it  start with the absolute basics , and mention for instance how you ' ve been reading about hurricanes  floods  any other fairly common disaster , and you think a few day ' s worth of supplies is a really great idea digit  don ' t start off by saying ' the end is nigh and i will not come stay unless you have guns , ammo and twelve years of mres ' sounds far  fetched but i ' ve met very intense preppers . they ' ll almost certainly just think you ' re both impolite and crazy , which is unhelpful . digit  you have an advantage now that it has happened once . next time you go stay with these friends , you can say ' remembering what happened last time , would it be helpful if i bring some spare water and things along ? no big deal , just though it might help keep all of our minds at rest , what with the kids and all ! ' they ' ll almost certainly take the hint and stock up on a few basic supplies if they can do so .
   (ID: 43758cbbc1bb7a8418a69b47911e24d1d2a082d3)

   (ID: 79e5228419de270c01297915dbce56be0063c52b)

16. we just kinda roll with it here , no on really talks about it . some people have whats called a  happy lamp  that gives off uv rays or something . i think digit  of the people that live here get sad , which is caused from the lack of sunlight . sad is a seasonal depression disorder btw i live in america , but alaska
   (ID: 13429813198f2aaef97e18644aa776da323f48a1)

17. very good point , didn ' t think about that aspect . but the fact that op started with " being in la " makes me think it ' s for social media purposes .
