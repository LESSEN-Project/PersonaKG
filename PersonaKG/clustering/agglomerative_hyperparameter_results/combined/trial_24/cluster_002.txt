15. i was raised hindu and was always interested in religion so i have a lot to speak of ! another one is that hindus in india will often put a lime and chilli peppers on a string  pin outside of a home or business . this is because lakshmi goddess of wealth and prosperity has an older sister alakshmi goddess of the opposite of those . lakshmi likes to eat sweets  milk  fruits , so if you keep them inside she ' ll come in and you ' ll have good luck . alakshmi likes to eat sour and spicy food , so keeping the lime and chili out there will keep her satisfied outside without coming into your life .   x200b  in a related story , when a sage was asked who is more beautiful between lakshmi and alakshmi , he said that lakshmi is more beautiful when walking towards you because you want good luck to come into your life and alakshmi is more beautiful when walking away from you because you want bad luck to leave your life .
