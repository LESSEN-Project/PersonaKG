6. i think that there is a trade off being a public persona and private persona off of camera . one ' s disguise has to be really good or the pressure to be constantly ' on ' can get to even the most seasoned celebrities . i think it would suck to be constantly hounded by people  but if done right then people would think you were cool no matter what for no reason . really it ' s a double  edged sword with trust and complicated social dynamics based  out of trust and exposure .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

18. context matters . being around your crush is different from being around your boss . crushing on someone means that you ' re in love with them by definition . he is so messed up that he doesn ' t even know when he ' s in love  has a crush . how do ypu know when you ' ve got a crush ?  when you notice butterflies around your crush that  s probably one way you can tell you like them . this is a tautology .  you can also pay attention to the thoughts you are having also an internal experience only you would know about unless you express it out loud to another individual thereby making op  s question valid around your crush . if you  re having the thought that  she  he is really beautiful  handsome  . . . in conjunction with experiencing butterflies in that setting . you mean like when her jealous boyfriend is coming towards me to knock the shit put of me ? or when this beautiful chick is serving me a warrant ?  or  i love being around so and so  how do i know that i love being around them ?  that will help you personally differentiate between the two  butterflies because you  re nervous  scared vs butterflies because you feel love . what does love feel like ?  also never become a psychologist . . . . you  d probably make no money and help no one . like the folks at psychology today ?  it  s not very difficult to tell you  re not a psychologist and don  t work in that field by your comments anyway . digit emotional intelligence . i ' m a psychologist . i ' m always helping people with their emotional problems , looking at new ideas , and experimenting .
   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

19. litterally just whatever i ' m thinking at the time , maybe it ' s just me but i always run scenarios through my head , decisions i ' ve made what ' s happening ect and so whenever i sit down been mostly writing in it while i eat lunch and just before bed  like right now i just write whatever i ' m thinking , my entry for today is digit pages already of a5 paper . part of it is just talking about a conversation i had at work and how i was being stupid , it might seem weird but writing down concerns about how i messed something up helps me realise it really wasn ' t a big deal , like at all . also just been keeping track of what im looking forward to , relationships with certain people stuff like that .
