2. went to their show in minneapolis and would agree , fanbase makeup is dominated by white men in their 20s  30s . very few poc and women , age distribution was also very alarming . my partner found them to be very off  putting when i play them in the car . she feels like they don ' t make an effort to make space for women and other voices and therefore can ' t relate to them in any meaningful sense . this coupled with the recurrent themes of misogyny makes them peak bro  socialism at best and reactionary at worst . conversely , when i play revleft in the car , my partner loves hearing brett ' s voice and whoever he has on . he makes an effort to have diverse voices on his pod and thereby practices what he preaches . brett seems to have evolved politically as well since the start of his show , but i can ' t say the same for cth albeit , except for matt . it ' s the same bro  socialist  libdem  socdem rhetoric today as when they started . they do admit though that digit they are dirtbags , and digit their entire shtick is to follow the antics and theater of the ruling elites and ruling institutions . i appreciate those combatting the liberalism within their sub and friends irl who won ' t shut up about cth .
