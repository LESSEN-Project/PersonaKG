   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

6. fuck that . if you actually read the article along with his response you he acknowledged it and apologized for it . not to mention he emphasized personal growth . it  s a joke and i applaud his response  we are in a social atmosphere that reflects witch trials at this point .
   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

7. remember that other one where he got the volunteer to murder stephen fry ? he also used the " anchor " and " color " concepts in that one . it think it is bullshit to suggest anyone can be persuaded in this way  as you mention , there are extensive screening and editing processes that db doesn ' t share with the audience . he just really knows how to pick em .
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

9. hey mr . paul ! digit what are your plans for the military if you become chief of state ? from what i ' m hearing , you take the isolationist approach , so will you be downsizing it or something ? for some reason , my sources are kind of vague . digit if so . will you be withdrawing major u . s . embassies and bases all over europe , asia , and the middle east ?
   (ID: d298609ba6b9516031b9d0b9bc9217d85ce28f05)

   (ID: ccc20fb024de820a5ad1bfc4117d69d6b7c3a6c9)

11. there are plenty of cases of people not recognizing it until much later . people in their 40s come out . a ww2 veteran recently came out , i ' ll see if i can find that article . show that to your dad . edit  article
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

12. he actually wants to change things for the better not for himself and is doing it
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

13. i have been playing the bass since . september ? but i am well aware of meme wizard davie . i do wonder if he is aware that he did a voice reveal a while back though .
   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

14. why wouldn ' t he change ? if people say something is annoying he ' s bound to stop

15. so guess his name is just rivers then ? despite not having any connection to the riverlands ? why are you so obsessed with this post ?
   (ID: e84ec39cf97c9609b6feb31cbaab5faf551f372d)

16. as messed up as it is to say , i hope it ' s jay . i want an ending of him on his deathbed saying nice things to each member and then he passes . i think this would be an interesting ending . something like how i met your mother screwed up by killing a character you spent digit years to meet , jay has been here since day one so it ' s gonna be a more emotional memorable ending . if it ' s anyone that ' s not one of the main characters then i don ' t care who dies . i don ' t care about the stella , dede , or pam . if frank died it ' d be a bit sad , but he wasn ' t on the show that much . plus phil already lost his mom so it ' d probably be about the same . even though we never met her .
   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

17. i also got a message from what i think is the same guy . the dude is probably on this sub , looking for people to harass . what a sad human being .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

18. nope . you do know the president can just declassify everything he deems fit . if you think mueller is going to pull a fast one on trump , well i ' ve got some magic beans to sell you
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)

19. i wish that that was how i found out santa wasn  t real . my mom  s christian but my dad  s jewish , so he made it clear by kindergarten that i should be thanking him for the presents . i honestly can  t think of a better way . otherwise he  ll hear it from kids in school or elsewhere . you should be the one to tell him and be there for him if he gets upset
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

20. wait . is this real ? i ' m not on about the trump thing
