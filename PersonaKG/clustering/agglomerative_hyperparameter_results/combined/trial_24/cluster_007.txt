1. sounds like you need to go on a journey to find yourself . if money is tight go to your local jazz cafe or something and do some poetry . remember , you are only human so let out what you are feeling
   (ID: 2dcd820eac167adf18c6706f1c0a26a39eb945be)

2. yikes , that  s disappointing to hear . if kids weren  t having fun in my classes i  d feel like i let them down . band was by far my favorite thing in school . teaching it and hearing the kids say it  s their favorite part of school is so gratifying .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

3. not at all . those are really great questions and oerfectly normal for you to he wondering about . mimd you , i ' m also not a professional so this is more a matter of opinion from personal experience . not those few things just makes a person a narc . there will be other signs for you to able to know . its true when they say , the similiarities between stories between people who have been abused by a narc are uncanny . there are so many signs that play into a narcissist that it will go so far back into your relationship you will feel like there has been a blindfold lifted from your eyes when you start putting it all together . and for me , i used to make up excuses for my nex . he used to ignore me to no end . if we were in an argument . he never once would apologize and admit he ' s wrong . he never once would say " i understand where you are coming from " . he would forcefully put me down in any way he could to get to me . so the majority of the time his tactic would be to ignore me , " avoid " and wait it out until i gave in and let thr matter fall under the table . when i didn ' t let up and never let thr matter go , i would withstand the horrible horrible things he would say to me and still stand tall defending myself . its then he would say something along the lines of " i ' m just not good at it " . and i was letting him use that lie for so long . it was just am excuse he made up to get him off the hook . and this is why . any person is capable of meeting you in the middle . someone who is on the narc spectrum usually is not . anyone is capabke of holding themselves accountable and acknowledging your feelings . a narc is not . but they can pretend when forced to if it comes down to it . i used to question it too and let that excuse be used . sure , there are plenty of partners out there who have a terribly hard time with confrontation . have a hard time dealing with issues snd stress . cant effectively communicate . but are those same guys gaslighting you to no end ? are thise same guys love bombing you ? using triangulation techniques to make you feel smaller and crazier than what you are ? are those same guys manipulating you to make you believe that you are the wrong one always ? that ' s not normal . that kind of thing doesnt happen in a proper relationship . not one person is always wrong . is that same person using the hot and cold technique to make you feel as if you need to over compensate i ' m order to earn their love back ? to make you put a part of yourself aside so that you can be more acceptable for them ? those types of things do not happen in a happily functioning relationship . so my answer is , no not those one thing will make a person a narc . but the accumulation of manipulative techniques does . and it can only be confirmed by a real professional , which i am not . but i do feel pretty educated seeing as i have been putting a lot of research and evaluation into my own personal situation . and my nex is bot the first narc in my life either . what really confirmed it for me is a pretty recent event . he threw a giant surprise party for our mutual friend and didnt invite me . when i called him out on it he then started gaslighting me by turning the situation around on me and saying i never come around . my argumemt is how could i come around if in not invited . he then started saying horrible things to me about how no one likes me and i am not good enough and i would have made the entire party about myself projection and ruoned the entire thing . so i blocked him on all forms . except i forgot to block email . i brought it to a level i never would have done in the past . a couple of days later i received a huge apology for everything he knows that bothered me . he should have treated me right . treated me for the gem that i am . he should have apologized more . he should have been there more . been more involved with my family . been more supportive if my goals and future . i taught him what love really is . he should have treated me better . well , two emails later he turned around and started saying how horrible i am . gas lighting i am lying and manipulative projection . i am not responsible more sensible enough of a person to know when i ' m right or wrong and i can ' t tell the difference . i don ' t deserve to be in a relationship because i am not good enough to hold someone else ' s heart in my hands . he feels sorry for me . and i have a long road ahead of me . digit  of the memories he has of me in the last digit years i made him miserable . oh , he also said that my therapist doesn ' t know the real me . only the me that they ' re being paid to know ajd they ' re only being nice to me because they are being paid too . so you see , he love bombed me basically and then turned around and threw it in my face . it makes the original apology void . in the past , i would not have blocked him . i would not have stood my ground snd gone no contact . in the past i would have accepted that maybe i wasnt good enough to be at that party and i really would have ruined it . that no one would want me there . i would have let him ignore me . i would hsve accepted the excuse that he ' s just not good at communicating . well , thats all bullshit because i ' ve been dealing with it for digit years . and there ' s always a lie . and always an excuse . and it was always followed by being ignored . and i would let him do it . and then he would wait it out without saying a word and then come back to me like nothing ever happened . but since i didn ' t this time it resulted in a major love bombing and gas lighting that hit the nail on the head for me . i hope that offers you some insight . i ' m sorry its a lot to read but i really wanted to give you a lot so you can develop your own opinion on it since i can ' t quite answer that question from you in a professional manner .
   (ID: 9981a65782780477b53d712e936b6997a4092240)

4. ' why i feel useless ' in that case is i guess something to do with not being able to do anything or contribute to society . but idk it ' s something to do with not being useful to myself too . but i think you have a point so thanks .
   (ID: 6ea82786a74ccdc85dc1fddd809a575aa4e4efcf)

5. you can try . but engineering is hard , it can be really frustrating when you don ' t understand something . i ' d tell you to get a teacher , but you can certainly try to do that on your own . who knows , it might work . you ' re doing something really challenging . be prepared to be frustrated , but be patient and persistent .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

6. and then cry rape the next day . you said that . not me . women do go to bars , drink , meet men and have sex . i doubt their intention is to accuse someone of rape after such an event , but it does happen . if you say it doesn ' t then you ' re not being honest .  edit  you also said  i have never heard of a woman needing to get drunk to have sex with someone . again , i dont think this is an honest statement either . i would almost be willing to bet you that more than half first time sex between couples involve some alcohol . its going to be hard for me to find anything statistically on that because every time i try to google it all that comes up are alcohol related rapes .
   (ID: 35eb47890f8874bbb988ec8308ba762f8377b3b8)

7. it  s people like you who make me realize the world isn  t completely full of assholes lol thanks for the advice .

9. having my underarms touched . i don  t know why , but whenever i think someone is going to touch them or come close to them i freak out and hyperventilate .

11. i feel like you need to elaborate a bit . are you unsure because you ' re worried she might cheat or has cheated on you ?

   (ID: 79fc72ea72532d39a039ecb4e47a630a601ff4a8)

14. hum , talk to him and tell him how you feel , your fears , what you want and what you expect of the future with him , that you live him if you do . and ask him if he ' s willing to be there and take the compromise with you to make it work . depending on the answer just do what it ' s best for you and the baby . it ' s better to leave on time than stay and get more hurt . good luck !

15. it does take a while for your legs to get used to shaving . however it ' s not as simple as grabbing a razor with your shaving gel , there is a greater amount of skin care needed . it will be difficult at first because your skin is rough the most important bit is moisturize , make sure do it several times a week , as the skin becomes softer the shaving becomes less painfull and you get better result . exfoliate  shave  moisturize

16. because most dudes myself included are clueless on how to be romantic .
   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

17. the real question here is , what does dick mean ? a variety of terms may circulate when constructed in a conversation such as here . perhaps it meant your friendly next door rapists who ' s name is coincidentally named dick . short for richard . could it be , the moderately growing business dicks sporting goods ? good lads really , gave me all the balls i could ask for . or is it , finally , a tool used by men to inject seamen into a women ' s ovaries to travel to the womb to make a child which by definition making it blatant that we must pass on our current knowledge to the next generation in hopes they do the same . its a marvelous idea developed my mother  nature but alas , it thus means that no human can live forever . reproduction is the pinnacle of mortality which no human has yet to discover a way to break it . this concludes todays lecture on how to make people think you are a intellectual when you are just some guy ranting on something that doesn ' t even make since . next class , memes !
   (ID: 93e92e6a7d8e94b12bcd450fad136ec14436f359)

18. well my friend you sound like a worthy gentleman . is this fair lass of yours isn ' t ready for the snorlax then it ' s her loss . sloth is the enemy of greatness and if she continues to drag it along , you certainly deserve better . apologies , i ' m so drunk that my atheist  heathen ass may have just quoted the bible . nonetheless , the point is the same . if she keep stringin ' ya along , you deserve better mate .
   (ID: 50e37e2011f73f739f76098c3c746e27b8422fd7)

19. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)
