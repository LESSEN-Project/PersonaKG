1. brecci was good though , this isn ' t . i wasn ' t saying it was the remington , it ' s the only comparable in one shot kill type of way . it ' s bad when i ' d rather use fists in half the gun fights tbh . and the sg12 isn ' t garbage unless you can ' t click the trigger more than two times . any average player can use the gun like any other , sure it ' s no saug , but it ' s still way better than the mog12 . it ' s just depressing .

2. lol , tldr . jk in reality the series went longer than he intended but i thought he addressed the issues he had ideas of where the story was going to go when he started working on naruto ' s teen years . yeah there are issues people arent going to agree with due to the fact most other manga artists outside of big series like dbz , one piece , bleach , etc . will have side stories or spin offs to cover small story holes , like how we dont know much about the other clans , or other ninja ' s development . the bs called itachi died choking on his own blood then slamming full face into the wall seriously we still dont know what killed him i ' m assuming its to escape a secret marriage . so no no series needs a reboot the artists decided this is the path i want , and if he wants to deal with any plot holes or missing information or lack of its up to the creator . like chpter digit . digit the special comic he drew for a convention to show kakashi ' s face cause he got tired of people asking about it . another thing i want to address is fan envy or fan dissapointment , its not the ending was bad its that the story was great , its very difficult to make a ending for something epic . i mean write a great digit page paper the whole body is awsome sauce , but your conclusion paragraph , your closing statement is the hardest one . no one is ever satisfied with a conclusion of a series , and almost digit  of the endings of manga i have read are not satisfying because the manga was so good . hitman reborn is a example i liked the manga , the whole time thing and the build up of the final arc was iffy , but the ending was everyones happy yipee the end , there was no satisfying hey his dreams came true , no the author leaves the ending to be open for fans maybe , to leave it to your imagination . my tldr if you want to skip to this  so shut up and enjoy naruto for what it is because this guy worked digit years on this on top of other shit and manga he has to work on . so appreciate the fact that people like the manga and he appreciates the love to give back the best he can do .

3. so what do you think about it do you like it ? i mean sans in one of the best video game characters and fortnite is one of the epicest games so it ' s a good combo . what do you think ?
   (ID: 409a49cde6f1f65f92cac4d33c7c769f7ba9e965)

4. One of my favorite things is full games.
   (ID: 870d9d198f856764296262192823c935f1daf781)

5. just play the game and focus on those viewers who are chatting . the truth is , you will never know why people leave , they just do , for a wide variety of reasons . you will never retain digit  of the viewers who join your stream . focus on what you do well . watch your vods . improve on things you feel need improvement . growth will come .
   (ID: a4cf7bd5112d789bb0b45477a071f936cf9b4ba7)

6. so the fuck what if i don ' t have more time to dedicate to something that didn ' t grab my attention ? why do you feel the need to defend a game or convert people to be fans of it ? that kind of attitude is just annoying . if you want to convince me it ' s good , tell me what is so amazing about it oh and why are you talking about the witcher ? that game was okay , nothing special . .
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

7. it ' s pretty much an instant win for you no matter what because the king has to move before you do anyway . so you kill the knight regardless
   (ID: 1885b01dd0970230fea2a9c9ae9c4eaeaceb59a3)

8. what convinced you to play minecraft , and how did you start ?
   (ID: 9c91f42953bc8f6d2f718503a1924734b9da6acc)

9. agreed . i think this is good idea but i would go one step further and still have a qualification process . maybe instead of having to win digit games you only need to win digit and players already in the " real " wl cannot compete once qualified . love the idea of lesser rewards . kinda like the ncaa tournament vs the nit .
   (ID: 9284af9896fed617d56596c55fb3ff4e8a4c8dde)

10. just forget it man , how much do you use it anyway , except forced windoze updatesss
   (ID: dd50b301fbfd713e92cffecd0a18fa135e6d75d3)

11. can anyone tell me if its possible to change the region thing ? becuz brazilian comunity on warframe isnt that helpful and i cant find what i need on google . plus even when i have the platinum to buy the nyx prime diagram i need someone just asks  can i have the platinum plz im new . or some shit like that .
   (ID: de0709ad19c458ffff0b96aab8fcfa9c40b24603)

12. wow a company going a safer route to make money . look man the thing they did with star wars was scummy , and how they fucked over respawn and vis . but at this point the memes have become stale now and we ' re betting a dead horse .
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

13. who said you had to be half screen away ? how about adjusting to the situation ? why not use reave instead of double strike for this particular encounter ? use your head . realize that after monster level digit of delve , things are going to hit harder and harder and you have to switch your playstyle around a little . why is this a hard concept for people to grasp ?
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

14. so it upsets you that other people get excited for things you don ' t like ? i guess you only like what people tell you is popular .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

15. sorry but i would give her a talking to . you do fucking not hold a lit cigarette over a pool table . ask anyone who knows anything about the game .
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

16. idk , i  m able to relate to nearly every message and character in the book . halliday  s created the most immersive  video game  in the universe and yet it  s so much more than that . people get lost in it .  the missing millions .  all just because he wanted people to like what he liked . and that somebody like wade who had quite literally nothing but passion and skill for the same things was able to beat his game . i think cline wrote every character perfectly , being able to understand their plights , i mean even sorrentos character was compelling , somebody you really wanted to hate . the references were insane . i didn  t even grow up with the old school games but the attention to detail was incredible . in an era where aaa titles don  t even come with enough content for digit month , cline was able to imagine up a place where everything was under digit platform , the whole world shared halliday  s creation , gunter or not . free learning , unlimited content , whatever your hobby was , it was in the oasis . i  ve never wanted something to be as real as i do the oasis . but the themes hit home too . the problems with being overly connected , letting the real world pass you by . the want and need to not let corporations rule the world . i just think it  s amazing start to finish . i understand liking something and later feeling differently but man , this book , i don  t think i  ll ever get tired of .

17. tornado of souls  by megadeth don ' t know what it could do , probably something with souls having the physical form of a tornado
   (ID: 4cd63391f1644eb1dde02717bf6a72fc6c22acc7)

18. man , i feel you , i prefer watching the anime too . i ' ve found out the hard way . if you search anything up about naruto , you are guaranteed to get spoilers . generally avoid discussion videos bc they dip into manga territory . this subreddit ' s rules are pretty good with spoilers , just avoid anything tagged with spoilers .
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

19. I am past level.
