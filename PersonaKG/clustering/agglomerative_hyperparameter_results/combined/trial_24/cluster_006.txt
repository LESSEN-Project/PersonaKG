1. why are you getting so mad , the suicide rates are high because people like you don  t give them the help that they need and i don  t harass them i feel bad that people commit suicide and i don  t make them feel  unwanted and worthless  the facts are there i can definitely say that i care more about them
   (ID: 23df46bdba3eb265d08b02c9ec5f365cf45ae5fd)

2. it ' s funny that you have this ego centric idea that everyone that disagrees with you is a whiny snowflake baby , and you , the one that supports a reality tv star known for being a whiny baby , are somehow the superior man . i seem to remember a whole eight years of crying when obama was in office . the media did to him much worse than what ' s happening with trump . trump is literally just giving fuel for the fire . and honestly , i think of him as a distraction from actual governing . he acts out more when important things happening . i ' m crying not from dispair , but from laughter . you think he ' ll get a second term . now i ' m gonna sit back and wait for the ' beta cuck ' insults to start rolling in
   (ID: 92705d87eaa503c0c39e0bda00f6d49fe27c65ef)

3. i strongly disagree . mace is awesome . here is why  digit it ' s non  lethal  digit it ' s cheap  digit it ' s very good at blinding and disorienting an opponent  digit it can be carried almost anywhere . ccw is better than mace . however , if for some reason you cannot concealed carry , mace is a thing to use . not a knife lethal , bad stopping power , requires a lot of skill to use effectively , not a taser too easy to miss , dense clothing can defeat  mace . because mace is non  lethal and cheap , it can be used in a situation where deadly force is excessive . when in doubt , spray opponent with mace and run away . also , you really should be aware how mace works before using mace . if you decide to carry it , watch some tests on youtube . read advice . buy two cans of mace , spend one on target practice to get a hang of it and carry second one . or , better , carry more than one can . tl  dr mace is better than knife , baseball bat or other improvised weapons . edit  i just remembered one very important thing . mace is not scary . do not threaten people with mace . do not even hint you have mace . when in doubt , spray and run immediately . threatening people with mace does not work .
   (ID: fae28587bce17296589bf92d656ad68ee32601d6)

4. probably current patch apart from very minor changes . they rightfully so don ' t want to change the meta a lot right before such a big tourny .

8. good god , stop watching red dawn . as much as you gun nuts want this dystopian fantasy to happen , it newer will . keep masturbating about how you intend to march on washington as the rest of the world looks back at you with pity and disgust . when the biggest worry in your life is finding the best parking spot at work then shut the fuck up . you are not oppressed . there are folks around the world with real reasons to pick up arms , you do not . as you read my post from your ipad or smart phone , look in the mirror and attempt to convince yourself otherwise . you can ' t . i live in the real world with real worries . no fucking hypotheticals . wife and kids , shitty job , bills , ailing parents and asshole coworkers . where the fuck do you people find the time to worry about the fucking apocalypse ? an apocalypse that will never happen . jesus .

   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

13. we did acid with two other people , one of them had a fucked up bad trip and was eventually going to hurt himself or us he already tried to shoot us with a gun he hallucinated . before i called digit , the two other people including my former bff left . the other guy could have killed me and no one would know . it was then i realized that he didn ' t actually care about me and was toxic .
   (ID: e7d4349520d7fd2b6b8d8e41558874e7ce55f7c3)

14. by the time time traveling was invented people might not care enough to change it , it would probably be ancient history to them and not worth rewriting history as they know it .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

15. people that hate others for the way they are , are just sad individuals , and nothing else .

   (ID: f3a490ceb976e7adf0cbeb213371795128597226)

19. no . i don  t hate gays . or promote hate . just realize some people are don  t believe the same things i do . why not just go on and live your happy life . and not waste your energy on hating them . don  t give it power .
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)
