1. as a guy , i ' ve learned that finding something attractive about another person isn ' t permission to say a damn thing  unless they solicit my opinion . commenting on body features is not cool . i limit myself to things like " that ' s a great color on you " or " your new haircut is awesome " if someone is looking particularly dazzling .
   (ID: fcec87cb8b541d87ad0eb8b52c3541c8fc49132b)

2. you can ' t remember because you ' re supposed to be focusing on your life now and growing spiritually . a different life teaches you a different lesson . like you can ' t go into the future if you ' re stuck in the past , if you get my drift . past lives good to learn from so you can see where you ' ve been and what you ' ve learned thus far , but you don ' t need to remember them . it isn ' t vital to your life now . little kids can remember them because they still have some of their memories from the other side , but they gradually lose them over time . that said , it ' s entirely possible to remember your past lives , and pretty easy with the right instruction . it took me a while to figure it out , but if i can do it , someone else definitely can . it might be your first incarnation , but if you ' re curious about a past life , ask yourself these questions  is there a time period that really interests you ? perhaps a specific culture or food ? or maybe a odd passion you ' ve had since childhood that you weren ' t really exposed to ? from what i understand , we don ' t have to reincarnate . we ' re pretty much free to stop at any point .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

3. i think honestly you ' re probably in the middle . your hairs not really that fine but its not like very thick either . a good compromise lmao . i ' ve tried the nivea actually , i liked it but the hold wasnt the best . id recommend trying american crew fiber or hanz de fuko claymation . both pretty good products but ultimately everyones hair responds differently to different products . id say try a few ones out you like and stick to one you get the best results .
   (ID: 89e76efb1868896fe46bffbc2c10d965b53857d1)

4. i  ve heard tales that those yield signs are for semi  s only . don  t think that  s how it works though .
   (ID: ccc20fb024de820a5ad1bfc4117d69d6b7c3a6c9)

5. yes , the players i like watching dont have good stats for ut . martial and vardy obviously have great stats , that ' s why i ' ve been using them for digit  games
   (ID: 230ce64c825c9de0874b588b6d715819e39e5610)

6. well you  ve made it this far ! it doesn  t matter the reason you  re still moving forward , as long as there  s a reason .
   (ID: 404d4f663681fcf738d043296148ae4de655b22b)

7. i have a ps4 also , does it crash a lot for you ? i ' ve heard that it crashes a lot for people and want to know if it ' s true .
   (ID: 114e3678c6af9d322985bb4656e33b19c03a0479)

8. no . but being clean taking a shower helps . ladies like it when a fella listens to what they have to say , and treats them like a friend . smiling , saying nice things , and validating their feelings really helps . something that i think that most incels fail to realize is that ladies get lonely too . they get bullied even worse them fellas do . plus , when it comes to sex , they have to worry about being seriously hurt . i mean put in the hospital with injuries hurt . if you hope to one day achieve your wildest fantasy , you will first have to learn how to treat them . not frightening them is a good 1st step . incels that i  ve talked to prescribe to ideas that are frightening to ladies .

10. " not unconventional " doesn ' t make sense , and no it ' s not strange to wear plain clothes but it ' s just hard to believe that every single item of clothing you have ever bought is digit never had a logo , brand name or been designer of some sort and digit you ' ve never been asked by anyone you ' ve ever come in contact with where you have bought your clothes from .
   (ID: d45001f1fdd37cda488cfddffabec23e83ee7b7e)

11. it depends on if your area has a shopkeeper ' s law or not . if it does they may be legally allowed to detain you long enough to determine whether you ' ve stolen anything .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

12. agreed ! how  s the performance on other browsers ? is the api flexible enough to  recreate  apple maps but in the browser or is it restricted to being the backend ? i know with duckduckgo i provided some feedback including poor search results and lack of mouse scrolling , the latter of which they  ve added . also , do you have to pay the annual  digit fee to get access to the api key ? hopefully wwdc will provide more answers .
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

13. i don ' t think that you have never seen a razor in your life , and certainly not any light source that wasn ' t your computer screen
   (ID: 4e2fa6f27a1d1e593b4d7f007fea784cb7cbfc65)

14. you don ' t think that ' s ever worked before ? i ' ve done it myself in an apartment unit and that worked , and i ' ve seen growing up these guys across from where i lived they were blasting their music at night , my neighbour yelled at them and told them to turn their fucken music off and bam the music went off
   (ID: 564c5b4efd54586fbf212727e2071f5ddadabb82)

15. i don ' t think someone ' s sexual orientation affects how they relate with their parents . i ' ve always been super close with my dad before and after coming out . i don ' t think i have a different relationship than either of my straight siblings .
   (ID: 183a5eea32f2c73a87c734920d3188862433e411)

16. i don ' t see a problem with it . as far as fetishes go , it seems like one of the more tame ones . i ' ve never been with a person who had a foot fetish but i think it would be interesting to see how that was implemented into the relationship .
   (ID: e16a0d174adc309bd63cefcfaac2428d7ebba9e9)

17. i can ' t watch the films due to the fact that i ' ve not read the books . i know that ' s weird

19. as someone who has lived in utah my whole life , i can attest that there are some stunning vistas within a short drive of salt lake city . if you spend any amount of time here , you can venture a little further out , and see things like the mirror lake highway , the nebo loop , the alpine loop , and boulder mountain . i can ' t even compile list all the places i ' ve seen in my digit  years here .
   (ID: a4cf7bd5112d789bb0b45477a071f936cf9b4ba7)

20. i  ve made so many enemies , i used to be so cool and popular but you know one little thing leads to this and then another leads to that and the next thing you know you  re the most hated person in school . lmao i want to kill myself so bad
