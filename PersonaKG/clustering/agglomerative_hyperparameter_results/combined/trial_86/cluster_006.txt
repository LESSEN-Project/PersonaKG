2. ooh , i remember this " ordinary genius " kind of moment from my senior year of high school . some gal was trying to edit a sentence on her laptop , she had hit insert . i knew right away what had happened as i ' ve done it a million times because i ' m a dumbass , so when she asked , i just tapped insert . she actually thought i was a genius . was funny as hell retrospectively .

3. yta you ' re such an asshole it makes me angry . firstly you are absolutely invading his privacy by going through his computer , how would you like it if someone kept going through your computephone you ' d think it was an invasion of your privacy . secondly you need to talk to your children about sending them to see counsellors and such . also you are the one who needs help please dear god for the love of your son take a parenting course with your husband because the counsellor would probably agree with your son .
   (ID: 1df1bd07e28c0df73bd865f8cb447d7c8f1bd4d3)

   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

5. because religion is destroying it . i grew up going to a church that was just crazy . the youth group had a bonfires and the kids threw their secular cd  s in the flames . they swore off  bad music .  i was no older than digit when a sunday school instructor turned off the lights and told us hell would be ten times as dark and so , so hot , so we better not sin . ask for forgiveness for every little thing . i spent years trying to measure up and be the very best i could so jesus would love me . i was so confused . after dedicating years to that place , we got pretty hurt there and we moved on to a different church . they taught me the real gospel and my faith has transformed since we started going there digit years ago . if you believe and you  re confused like i was , trying to be perfect so he  ll love you . please know he already does love you beyond our comprehension and there  s nothing you could do to ever separate yourself from it . you aren  t going to burn in hell for being human .

7. there was a mom in michigan whos kids starved to death because she said they wouldnt eat what she made for them . the old adage " they ' ll eat when they ' re hungry " isn ' t true for all kids . it doesn ' t mean they jave autism , either . doesnt mean you have to give into junk , but they should at least have milk or vitamin shake . kids usually like those . sustenance is important for kids especially .

9. perhaps because he signed up for this job , or was kind of pressured into it . perhaps patriotism and duty and tradition and freedom didn ' t have as much to do with it as vague hopes of escaping a shitty situation . perhaps it was just family pressure , or a few mistakes as a kid , or a fucked up economy , and the service looked like the only option . maybe it was just a means to the gi bill , or a way to do right by a pregnant digit year old girlfriend . not everyone joins up to be a hero .

10. my vote for actress would be andrea . prison relationship is true . mormon affiliation appears quite recent  those women at her shower saying they  d always wanted a black friend . you wouldn  t say that about someone you had fellowshipped and worshipped with for years . but she  s been on reality tv before , she obviously is a black hole of attention needs . i can see her , and people like her scouring the reality tv adverts looking for one they might qualify for . with her , the mormonism would have been further bait for the producers . she  d have a good sense of what is needed to catch their interest . i think the more of these reality shows we see , the more manipulation we will see by participants . god help their friends , family or partners who are no longer useful . gives new meaning to  collateral damage  .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

13. i don ' t really feel like he holds me back , but my life isn ' t the way i want it to be living with him . i ' m gonna say the same shit everyone else says , i do love him and i enjoy being with him . but lately it doesn ' t feel the same . he ' s a good person but i feel like i don ' t really like him anymore . maybe it ' s my mindset but i feel like we don ' t have fun or enjoy each other ' s company . but if i leave i know i ' ll miss him and be sad . i ' m not going to go jump on another guys dick .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

14. i ' m sorry to see you in this sad situation . unfortunately you have some hard decisions ahead of you . i don ' t envy your journey . from your description , i believe you have two choices . you can go negative contact cut all contact with family or continue with your current situation . there may be some more choices that others may see that i do not . both choices are not easy . you must decide on your priorities and make the decision that bests fits you . good luck .

18. mosquitoes . they cause the most human deaths compared to any other living thing . seriously , whenever i see one flying around , whether it ' s minding its own business or looking for a midnight snack , i get my zapper and dart to the other side of the room . i ' m literally fine with a spider , i even held a jumping spider to put it outside , with my bare hands ! but i can ' t even look at a mosquito without trying to reach for my zapper . i just realized that i made this a confession . sorry to those who didn ' t want to hear that .
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)
