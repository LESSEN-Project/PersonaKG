1. i hope stark and the captain survive the end game .
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

2. i feel for you . but i hope my words make you chuckle . if you ever have a child it ' s worse . the bathroom door can be locked from the inside and little hands reach under trying to get attention . it shouldn ' t be the end of the world or end of the relationship . take it as a learning moment , and a chance to communicate with each other . let him know why it embarrassed you too . knowing why things feel a certain way can go a long way .
   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

3. you ' re not a bum ! the fact that you came here to post this means you still have hope ! honestly , i was feeling down like you too , but then i stumbled upon guide to purposeful success and it really helped me find a purpose in life , which i am pursuing every single day now , and it ' s been great ! hopefully it can help you too .
   (ID: eca32d278abf2524af02edbb3cc3041ed8b0b880)

4. there ' s someone for everyone  they ' re out they ' re waiting you and all other shitty variations to give people false hope . to me it ' s better to think " if it happens , it happens "
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

5. here ' s a picture of your dad when he ' s naked . hope you like it .
   (ID: 22864f9484c3c6d7f8c8dac79c58ea32865eb794)

6. obviously , this argument doesn ' t hold and it  s simply a case of people being irked that non  whites are finally being represented in a larger way . i surely hope you aren ' t assuming that just because somebody is unhappy with one specific historically  incorrect aspect that they do not care about the others . just because somebody isn ' t actively advocating against every historical inaccuracy at any given point doesn ' t mean they ' re using it as a front to deny non  white involvement  most people do acknowledge the participation of smaller groups in the war , but simply find the representation to be statistically inaccurate . i would ask these individuals what they consider of other historical inaccuracies in the game before framing them with what is implied to be a racist undertone .
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

7. killed someone over  digit . how stupid can a person be ? hope they don  t let this guy out
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

8. i sincerely hope it works . i know everyone has their things they have to deal with . sometimes having someone there makes it easier . if it was me , i  d like to think someone would take a chance .
   (ID: 256407c5e6c8d9342d8aabf5c9c392fc179ba9f3)

9. oh i can help with this , too !  the joke is that usually people say  until i reached the age of digit  or whatever . so george carlin is setting up the expectation of a simple statement i was catholic until this particular age but then changes it to suggest that reasonable people aren  t catholic . the surprising change of direction , combined with the implication about catholicism , make this a joke instead of a simple statement . i hope that  s helpful !
   (ID: 9414b9913220ebe2601862e3001aac74ebcffe33)

10. i know what it is . it aligns with that by which i put my hope and faith into , humanity . that and i hold no reservation for superstition or a " higher " power .
   (ID: b5153b16e61f6bc5e4bf4d8db479b7093df1ae26)

11. truly i feel you , not that i suffer from herpes but i lack the ability mysepf to truly put myself in your shoes but i feel as though it wouldnt hinder progress in a relationship , for me . granted it may very well limit my sexual desires for a long time . there must be websites like pof for those with herpies ? i would advise you to be honest with any partner . but i would hope and pray you do not see it as tue end of the world . if anything having intercorse with someone may very well create a false sence of intimacy as thus it may be practical to claim you wish to remain abstinant until you feel you can tell your potential partner that you have herpies . no need to lay it on the line on the first date . im here for you if you need support of any capacity . just know i am a mape if that helps you determine any sense of bias i may have .
   (ID: a2ca7f9e05e83928ce894848f01290dbcd0f654e)

12. not relying on buying more stuff with the hope to increase my happiness , something that ' s so common in canada . not everyone of course but so many .
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

13. i  m digit so i  ve seen some great usc and some rougher usc so i can agree with you there . however , i can  t say that my falcons allegiance has built more character than it has broken and hope of ever holding a lead in any sport ever .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

14. fuck me ! i really hope he was actually doing something else in the video to warrant this . either way it ' s definitely a political thing trying to look good to the muslim community . bet you after awhile they will drop charges while under the radar .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

15. honestly the best thing for you to do is to tell your boyfriend straight up the entire situation . i don  t think the relationship will last sadly after that because he is straight and he can  t force himself to be attracted to you afterwards , but for your own personal happiness and mental health you need it tell him and transition . but who knows he might still retain attraction to you afterwards , it is a possibility . i know how bad dysphoria can be , my partner is trans and i  ve been with them before and after their transition and they  re much happier now than they were before . i hope you too can remain friends since all that would happen is that he loses attraction . best of luck to you , be brave and you can make it through . i hope all goes well red  heart
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

16. yeah . it added up . it ' s hard , and unfortunately will probably happen multiple times in the next decade or two . by all means i hope you can find the right one early on . just basing that off the " typical " run .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

17. it was on reddit and someone said to some innocuous comment i wrote ,  i hope you die .  i could not see anything offensive or rude or even that opinionated in my comment . so i didn  t care . if anything it helped me . that comment reminded me that i shouldn  t take anything online to heart . if i offended or upset someone i would not like that  and i would apologise but if someone just wants to be a rude little fucker it has no impact on me .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

18. hi , i hope i ' m not sounding too disdainful , here , but if you ' re only 13k , i guess you have not been playing that much like , not very seriously for several years . are you sure you are dedicated enough to the game to get a go  related tatoo and no regret it later ? that ' s more the kind of things i would expect from dan players . i also have my doubts on what black stones would look like as tatoo just big black dots . but anyway , that ' s none of my business , and i hope you find something that suits you .
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

19. hey vegans ! i have a question that i hope you can answer . can you hide a subreddit from ever showing up in your feed ever again ?
   (ID: 37aa751f14bbf132fc2f76d2c2c79142318c3e31)

20. i would hope that nothing would happen , because that doesn ' t really matter .
