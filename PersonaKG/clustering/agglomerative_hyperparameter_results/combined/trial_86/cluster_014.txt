1. dear lord , isn ' t this supposed to be the 21st century ? i have no problem with homosexuality and if either of my sons turn out to be gay , bi or whatever i would fully support them . i ' ve got gay colleagues , friends and relatives of both genders and you know what , they ' re just like any normal person . probably because they are . what people do in their bedroom is their business , no  one else ' s , and doesn ' t alter anything else about them . people need to stop being dicks .
   (ID: 2ac4d2cea574e655d7fdb1ab9b4886989929ca96)

   (ID: 1afb7597077681179430af152997f04fd73ba0ee)

5. should not be a problem even if you get by yourself , just be confident . you do know how to ride and drive then it shouldn ' t be problem passing the test . as for not having a bike , i suggest you borrow a bike from any friend or relative because they don ' t provide the bike . last resort would be asking one of the people who have got their bikes for the test . for car lisence test they gave me the rto car maruti digit which was horrible but manageable to pass if you know your driving . go through an agency only if you don ' t want to fill applications and are very unsure about the procedure . i got mine done through an agency because i learnt driving through their school . if you know driving and riding i see no problem for you to get it done yourself .
   (ID: f37c6d73f88ae9488245dcae1da46589d182fa9b)

10. this is what happens sometimes when guys marry without doing a lot of dating  casual sex . you have been with your wife a long time and never got to be a single guy . you didn ' t have an opportunity to date a lot so you really weren ' t used to hot digit  somethings showing interest . oveunder on the wife making him sell the truck ?

11. i gotchu bro . you may be asking yourself , oh no what do i talk about ? when approaching a girl . no worries ! as another user mentioned , get on board day is a great opportunity to meet a girl that has a similar interest as you . you dont have to tell a joke or have some jaw dropping awesome first line , you can literally just ask  how long have you been into topic ?   what is your favorite thing about topic  keep in mind that not everyone will click and if it doesnt , dont tell yourself that youre bad with girls . i promise you that there are guys you could try to be friends with and it wouldnt go so well either . why ? because not everyone is going to click , i promise you that i wouldnt click or be friends with almost digit  of the guys in my classes if we tried to be friends . it  s just because people are different . so don  t get down , go out there , be confident , be yourself , and if you fail , get back up , dust yourself off , and try again ! you got this ! p . s . none of the bad interactions will matter in digit years when you  re as happy as can be with your s  o good luck bro

12. for me , a major reason aside from image quality and so on to jump from compact to dslr was response time . in this line of thought , a jump from dslr to mirrorless might make you feel that the camera is laggy , because , well , despite all the advantages the evf offers , it ' s still more laggy than an ovf . that ' s subject to change , of course , but that ' s it at least with today ' s technology . if viewfinder lag compared to a dslr is not an issue for you , then go on  sony ' s got some amazing stuff to offer . as for the d700 , i don ' t think it really has a true successor yet think what d700 is to d3  the digit with these digit mp is into another category but if you ' ve got the nerve and resources to cope with large files , why not ?  the df is a very much a niche model , moreover it ' s plastic  y and not that well built from what i ' ve read  the only nikon option left in the category of full  frame  and  not  so  high  resolution seems to be the d4  d4s , which i think is justifiable if you have the money , but then again  by far it ' s not affordable for everyone .

13. nta , rsvps are there for you to know how much you need to buy . ans if people are showing up with other kids and said nothing about , they shouldn ' t be surprised that they got nothing . things like this make me mad and the guests get pissed like its your fault they bought uninvited people with them .
   (ID: 2e369dc21156ed2b443bc09084e27c8acb516093)

14. i ' ve got the same opinion really but the truth is your ' never know until the split happens . just out of interest , how to you know it ' s the chinese that are splitting the blockchain to create bcc ?
   (ID: d45001f1fdd37cda488cfddffabec23e83ee7b7e)

15. never ever pay first for challenge services . if they refuse , find another person . i think this is the only way i got scammedwasn  t much , like digit chaos , but the act of being scammed leaves a bad taste in my mouth . item trades are much easier to avoid
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

16. i got kidnapped by a serial killer and tortured also there ' s another dream i had but it wasnt scary so much as memorable , i dreamt i had sleep paralysis and dat boi was riding towards me while suspenseful music played
   (ID: b5e15026c378d181e66e2b38bfc245705510a727)

17. nope , never wondered . my dad installed a pair which i think he acquired when working for ge , designing train engines . i don ' t kinow whether he put them in earlier cars but i know he put them in his digit new yorker , soon as he got it . i was digit at the time so i don ' t know too many details . until he got around to getting a compressor and building an engine mount for it , he just had a good size air tank under the hood . oh , the horns were also mounted in the engine bay  those old chryslers were huge . it was fun to stop for gas on vacation trips and dad would ask for air . after giving the " what is this screwball doing " look as dad lifted the hood , the attendant invariably said " holy shit " then , of course , had to hear them .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

18. i reckon you ' ve got a chance . just keep doing all you can and let the relationship grow
   (ID: 920ba0628cbea5588ecca4c8ba7f80b411ff70ef)

19. i was nearly going to leave my comment as " other than that " but i added " one event " to try and stop this sort of response coming . in no way am i saying that winning a major isn ' t much to do in a year all i ' m saying is to say he didn ' t have the best digit isn ' t wrong just because he got that event win .
   (ID: a69486a9dd78d1ba9533599ba57eac9079ca3c8d)

20. nope . you do know the president can just declassify everything he deems fit . if you think mueller is going to pull a fast one on trump , well i ' ve got some magic beans to sell you
