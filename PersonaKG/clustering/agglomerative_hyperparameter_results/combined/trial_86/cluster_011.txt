Total from this dataset: 200

1. yes ! having it go right to the back and then swallowing immediately is definitely the best method because you don ' t have to really taste it that much . however , funny story , once it was shooting straight to the back of my throat and a drop hit me straight in my gag reflex . i nearly vomitted up a mouthful of man butter .
   (ID: e16a0d174adc309bd63cefcfaac2428d7ebba9e9)

2. yeah exactly that kind . then for the rest , whether you value your virginity and how you lose it or not is really nobody ' s business .
   (ID: a80b8bc356414690d849369456d68876c95d5518)

3. it really makes customer support queries much faster . i find it way more useful than some of the banking apps i use , because all the text and information is automatically saved . you don  t have to go back and forth with different systems and phone numbers and juggle all the information as it  s all there .
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

4. do i really have to be the guy that asks the question ?
   (ID: 7c7d6a809e77ab08fc65ee63a1ab44c11bd6ab7f)

5. agreed . i ' d rather watch it and listen to it in my own language . i admit some of the dubbing can sound really bad the show golden boy is the first to come to mind but i ' m not picky about a lot of it .
   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

6. neither do i , but you need him
   (ID: b29114e3d39ee1086f5eb2abbe6cbec33bc7749f)

7. that ' s really interesting thank you ! in my mind i always believe that businesses would seek vc but it ' s really interesting that they proactively seek you out , which kind of makes sense because if i had a shed load of cash to invest i wouldn ' t be sat around waiting for the golden goose . good luck in your business , it ' s a fantastic idea !
   (ID: d45001f1fdd37cda488cfddffabec23e83ee7b7e)

8. thanks for the help guys . one other question , since i attempted to catch already do i need to teleport to a new location and wait digit hours ? or can i stay where i was ?
   (ID: 7542c8a6be5a118bef67d9539deb69c131fb4fbc)

9. for me , my purpose is to be there for my partner and try to make the lives of others better . god knows i don  t give a fuck about myself , i was ready to clock out of life when i was digit , even tried to commit suicide multiple times , but you only have one life after all . so why not use that life to make the lives of others better , even if yours is absolutely terrible , and they may return the favor . now i  m in a great long term relationship , a steady career , a mortgage on my house , and a great relationship with my family . what you put your focus on determines your purpose and outlook on life , and that greatly determines what will happen in your life . i  m really glad that for one minute i decided to be selfless and try and lift others up , even though i thought the world would be better without me .

10. why do you need that , dude ?
   (ID: 7e67f2109db2f138225338a090de78cfd116cfca)

11. you made me curious as to how bad they really are though .
   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

12. hey pat , bwl from cheeseburgervacation here , what do you need help with ?
   (ID: ddbcd7b957a26c37891ce72069afaf688ba19977)

13. what ' s a really good song in your opinion ?
   (ID: 8712de543372bc5f398d43ea5b918c85efc5dda7)

14. look for the fabric percentages . generally speaking a designer peacoat with roughly digit  wool or more will cost between digit  digit . thats a pretty good budget target . schott nyc is considered the flagship in this range . a really good deal right now is actually abercrombie which has a digit   naval peacoat at  digit . great deal bang for the buck in my opinion . as usually anything under digit will get you a digit  wool blend or less . in fact lands end ' s peacoat is digit  wool and its selling for about  digit . which shows that a  f has a pretty good bang for the buck deal right now .
   (ID: 4721143ecfe877298792b1d44e635051f5f2c84e)

15. hmm really ? i was told a different version of the story i guess .
   (ID: 943cc5e526975c71d69ca1804666ab2f83b06a27)

16. we ' re all entitled to our opinion . i doubt you ' re an artist so you really don ' t have a say in the matter .
   (ID: 5a15ed606a86674cb48abaf9fee4375ff6bbff09)

17. not really . you have no say in the matter so why worry about it .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

18. it ' s a beautiful museum , and you should all visit it . it ' s the home of howard hughes spruce goose as well . the museum ' s future has been in doubt due to tax debt in recent years . the immediate danger seems to have passed , but the museum could really use increased visitation . when i was there a couple years ago it was nearly empty , and i could stand inside the spruce goose all by myself .
   (ID: 22a043d8284bd8c7c31748b5cc8c8b8efc757df6)

19. yes , really , really . shaun t  paper isn ' t all that . try cottonelle you can get a money off cupon here .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)
