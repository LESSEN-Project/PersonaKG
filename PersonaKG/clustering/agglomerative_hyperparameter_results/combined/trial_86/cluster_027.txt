1. i will say this i have low efficacy , but unless your the next mlk or etc that won  t be possible i bet . i don  t think it  s possible in our life time . i say in a few more hundreds of years this government will fall apart for the better in some way . imho in my book you would be wasting your life . don  t let this deter you tho we need someone to be a leader and be the role model . i  m not your boss or etc you do what you wish with your life so long as your happy and think it  s worth it . digit , if you were my kid i would tell you exactly what i did above and then ask you what do you wanna be in your life ? and then support whatever you say and make a difference and start a movement . let it be nonviolent or violent ones whatever makes the biggest impact and change .
   (ID: 4422c1db26c9be5bec35694a448a490c2761d985)

2. i ' m really sorry to hear that . as someone who suddenly lost his dad , aged digit , digit years ago whilst he was working abroad i can understand your frustration and know how this uncertainty gnaws on you . repatriation was a bitch and everything took a lot longer than it should have . everything worked out eventually , but it was a bad time for us all . i wish i could donate to your campaign , but unfortunately my financial situation won ' t allow it at the moment . i hope you and your family stay strong and i wish you all the best .

3. that ' s very true . however , in order to make an accurate judgement you need to gather information from both sides   if you limit what you know about latter  day saints to what those who left tell you , you ' re invalidating your judgement . find out what makes a latter  day saint click . you can ask people why they left , but ask people why they stay , too . ditto  i wish you the best . stay curious !
   (ID: bb403667518ffc82f0508e3aee8741ea63cec050)

4. i wish you well . i hate to say it because it ' s a stupid cliche , but it can get better .
   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

5. i wish i had someone like you for a relative . it sounds like you know what ' s up .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

6. has any figure made you wish you could have it ? like even though you don ' t buy transformers , it looks cool enough that you considered buying it .
   (ID: 718ff22055f41bd70e24ec98f0898a1526112965)

7. that is a real problem , and it is one thing i ' ve really struggled with reading posts on this subreddit . commentors are naturally quick to suggest a break  up  it ' s easy for them to say , they are not emotionally involved in the relationship . but that ' s the thing , if you love someone , if you ' re in a relationship , you will have fights once in a while , there is conflict , you won ' t always agree and you will be frustrated by things your partner says or does . for a stranger it is easy to say to just walk away from the situation when reality is not what they want it to be . but this is not how you will be able to grow a strong , sustainable relationship with a partner that you ' re deeply emotionally connected with . i wish people would be a bit more sensitive in this thread , rather than just see it as a quick opinion release for entertainment purposes .
   (ID: 93e9e943e9d5e6606a938961fd4d02312afb101b)

8. i cut myself today for the first time in awhile but only had a serrated knife which hurt a lot more so i didnt really get that into it . also made plans for my next suicide attempt . i haven ' t had any money in a really long time though so i ' m pretty much just window shopping for ways to make a charcoal grill with as little money as possible . i fall between screaming in my head to please let me die and begging for some kind of purpose . then i start to think of what being an actual person would look like and all i can think of is all the gross horrible shit i ' ve done . i really wish i could fall asleep in some happy dream and never wake up . i wish i could die and my body could live on and fix the world . i want good things to happen to everyone around me i just so desperately dont want to have to exist anymore .
   (ID: f46d1bfdfed7fc05bbe39789c092019944471e9d)

9. i don ' t mean balance as in the character meta , but in the community sense . more people are on equal footing . and yeah i agree the prices are ridiculous but unfortunately i don ' t think it ' ll change to much . i wish they would do a system like injustice where you could buy most characters for the farmable currency , but some would be event based

   (ID: 7e155e58dbfbdb78d094711d4ddb65ae5ef94fba)

12. just keep in mind that ghosts are totally weak and our spirits can totally overwhelm them . my approach to ghosts now is i ' m sad that they failed to reincarnate , so i want to help them move on that ' s kinda what i was told all the time too while growing up . sometimes i wish one of them would just come talk to me without appearing scary .

   (ID: 80d504f68f5028edc4d8e5926e3a2a93b0c84d8f)

17. i get that . there ' s something strange about the feeling of non existence since you are here now and it ' s the " black sailed unfamiliar . i suppose a lot of it is a fear of the unknown as well . what i find strange is that i was speaking to my neighbour last week . he is in his 90s and he was doing his gardening . i was asking him about his hearing as he has just got a new hearing aid and he said " i tell you what , i wish i would just hurry up and die already . i mean , it ' s depressing but it seems to show how thoughts change as we get older as wel . i got over these thoughts nearing my late 20s . obviously i don ' t want to ask how old you are but it will get better !

   (ID: e57ef54aa6b4e23fcfbf5b034403be21a86f9700)

20. i ' m not well  versed in trek , as i was always more of a wars fan . but spock was my main interest whenever i heard or read about the franchise . it ' s my understanding that he ' s only half  vulcan , but that he still has the option to flip his emotions like a switch , right ? it would seem feelings are internal and emotions are a physical counterpart to that , so either they have feelings all the time , or they can activate both whenever they wish . i think the whole concept is interesting . everyone should opt to be more like spock , because emotions are important for healthy living , but sometimes get in the way when making important decisions .
