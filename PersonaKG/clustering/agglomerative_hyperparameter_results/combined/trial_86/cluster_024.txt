1. i ' m anxious too and that would bring me super down . are those guys average looking or extra attractive ? it seems like a lot of work to have someone come over for sex and do an oh hell no rather than just getting off . not that that ' s a good thing per se but at least you wouldn ' t know . i ' d try and give you my honest opinion but i might be too nice to do so .
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

2. i dunno . i don ' t want anyone getting fined or what not . i have no idea how customs work . so all good . but i ' ll try find an australian one thanks
   (ID: 063ff05b3364c41fa72065634c0e90854c7272a4)

3. when they become old enough to be free labor in the house . they believe everything you say . more enjoyable food in the house who the hell doesnt like chicken nuggets and macncheese . with a digit  digit job you only have to seem them during dinner and rush to your man cave , cough i mean study  office for solitary man time , cough work time . if they are really good at something like super smart you can make fun of other peoples kids . you can learn current pop culture from your kids . if a kid in the neighborhood is a dick , you only hope your kid beats the shit out of them . no jail time . best of all the " i told you so " or " wait til you have kids " or spoil the shit out of your grandkid when they stay over cause the end of the visit that kid isnt staying its your kids problem .
   (ID: 9d6cadbef277b68098e82945a77678dbb2a079c6)

4. it sound that those people in your life are holding you back and that isn  t good for mental health . i  m not saying you should get rid of them but certainly make them aware that your life is more than chores or work and everyone needs a hobby and shouldn  t have to hide it .
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

5. me . i only started taking meds a few months ago , and can only imagine what an extra year of " me work " would have done for me . a year seems so far off now .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

6. yeah i agree , i kinda expected more of a  hows the internets work  kinda stuff , not  let  s laugh at conservatives who were laughing at liberals .  i get it  in the us a lot of grandmas are proper , god fearing conservatives and their email forwards and facebook tags would reflect that . but my grandma still sends me  satan thinks you won  t forward this to three people you love , jesus has faith folded  hands in you  type shit .
   (ID: 4654e3a9a75835f9ff28170ddf31d5d3cf296ea2)

7. i think this is only relevant because thursdays don  t mean anything to us . every other day of the week has some subconscious meaning to us e . g . mondays start our work week , wednesday is the pivot in our work week , friday ends the week and saturday is our free day and sunday obviously is a religious day . only tuesday can really challenge this notion but i think we still treat tuesday as a second monday . things are still important to us on this day of the week because we subconsciously give ourselves deadlines for the week after we fail on monday . thursday  s are the only days i truly don  t give a shit about  it could rain diarrhea and hemorrhoids and i  d be to concentrated on the weekend to notice . the rapture could happen on a thursday and most of us would be so fucked that come friday we  ll be sitting at the bar wondering why everyone isn  t responding to our texts
   (ID: 18e18998471794de2ee0ded08a5f57a45a336e24)

8. knock that shit off . stop putting your self down . the women who you talk to don  t know that right away so use that to your advantage . not everything you say has to be funny . shit just say something , see how they respond . like i said be patient . it will happen . go down to applebee  s and start a convo with the hotness . they get paid to talk to you while they seat you . then say what  s up to the waitress . waitress  s love chit chatting about everything if it  s a slow night . just start somewhere and go from there . who knows maybe after a few days you can work up the courage to talk a girl who  s not paid to be nice to you and see how it goes
   (ID: 2e747482ae2ee3fe66b8436d9138eb2bba4a7c4f)

9. yeah there  s hidden stars in the blockbuster photos and you need to work it out and if you go to said location then it  s there .

   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

11. do you work on an australian mine site ? it sounds just like working there . if you come across a piece of paper on the floor you can ' t just pick it up , you have to fill in a form first . " what is the hazard ? why is it a hazard ? can it be removed ? what are the dangers of removing it ? what will happen if i attempt to move it ? considering your answers what is the best course of action " once you submit your form to a supervisor they will read it and get back to you on what they believe the best course of action is .

   (ID: fe4ddb52a6f20437e3f3c6003b775cb72c3d048f)

14. maybe try to subtly come off that you really want this job , but not like you just want the money , more like it ' s your dream to work there and that you ' re willing to do almost anything to work there .
   (ID: 661cbd631caa9db4ab702976879371243802e35e)

15. a voting system would work really well , actually . how many downvotes will it take for a post to get removed though ?

16. i ' ve been told i never smile , and i do not do well with people . looks like it ' s something to work on .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

17. that  s a good article ! everything we  ve discussed ! i , too have trouble when i  m asking all the questions and i get brief answer with no question back . i literally unmatch after the third question i ask . it  s maddening and feels like more work than it should . why is good conversation so hard to find ?
   (ID: 256407c5e6c8d9342d8aabf5c9c392fc179ba9f3)

18. relevant work experience . you are digit now , no one cares that you were on student council in high school
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

19. there are geneartions of people who have known nothing but to depend on public assistance for survival . this is not becouse the opportunity to work hard and leave it behind them is not there its because they have learned this behavior from their parents and community . its social sickness and an addiction that creates secondary class of citizens . i would also add that having children when you are on welfare is a force multiplier that will keep you on welfare as your chances of furthering your education and employment get much lower . there is nothing wrong with the belief that you should not have kids if you do not have the ability or the means to take care of them .
   (ID: 79e5228419de270c01297915dbce56be0063c52b)

20. it ' s probably what ever mod you have that makes you see your feet in first person . generally what i do for issues like this is i disable all mods in my mod manager or game launcher and than i slowly work enable them again one by one till i find the mod that ' s the issue .
