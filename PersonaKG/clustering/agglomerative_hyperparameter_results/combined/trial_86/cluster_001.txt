1. ah yes , the worldwide  feared british nukes would totally scare russia into submission , it ' s not like russia has c  300s that are proven to be capable of stopping nato ' s balistic missiles or anything like that . also , if russia were to produce just one more tsar bomba  class nuke and drop it on top of the british isles , the uk is gone and so is ireland , the northern part of france , the benelux and possibly parts of nothwestern germany .
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

9. we saw a definite and dramatic shift in behavior in our first child just after a vaccination day , starting with 105f fever . what we have done with our kids since then is not to stop vaccinating , but to attenuate the schedule so that they are not getting many vaccines in one day and shocking their system . also when vaccines can be obtained individually as opposed to a combination shot , we go that route . our pediatrician is one of the best in the area and is totally on board . we didn ' t have the same occurrence since that first event , but obviously that doesn ' t prove causality .
   (ID: 5ab7eb494e48f5dccac549a3e018fb911f19527e)

13. for the most part . the problem as i see is that the investgation was long and publicised . its been at the forefront of the news cycle for almost two years . people are burnt out on it and tired of the far left and far right . its like listening to two children argue and fight with each other . at some point everyone just wants the politicians and judiciary to shut up and run the country .
   (ID: 79e5228419de270c01297915dbce56be0063c52b)
