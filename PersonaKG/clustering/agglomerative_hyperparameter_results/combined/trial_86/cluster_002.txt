1. then cumma cumma cumma cumma come on a chameleeeoooon . pretty sure those are the words .
   (ID: eb338cca8f5e87e4b6e5d369997ab6dbebf241c5)

2. ive only had sleep paralysis once , and it had a really creepily over  detailed frog on a bicycle that im almost sure i ' d never seen before
   (ID: b5e15026c378d181e66e2b38bfc245705510a727)

3. pretty sure it  s the caliber of person . for example , you have couples like evelin and justin who have just a tiny bit of drama but really get along with each other well and seem low key . the producers don  t have to make these people seem like drama obsessed idiots , they come prepackaged that way lol .
   (ID: b40d1d3ae1e77bcbdcb98e62deea24396d4b4d40)

4. yeah , this makes a lot of sense . when it ' s some kind of leather armor , sure , you need to go kill an animal with magic skin or whatever . but if it ' s metal armor and they need a biological reagent to make it , maybe they use the reagent in a ritual , or maybe they put it in the fire that they heat the metal with , imbuing it with magical properties . i guess it never occurred to me when making daedric armor in skyrim and it asks for a daedra heart , that they were ever actually banging away on the heart itself with a hammer on an anvil .
   (ID: 0f8bca5cd80e9429ae58bb976857e3c5ab057290)

5. that may be true but aren ' t we talking about cycles that peak and trough over the course of hundreds of years ? can we look at a period of ten years and say these sorts of claims are important ? i ' m being honest , i don ' t know . but i also know better than to believe the green  types have all the answers or are going to be entirely forthcoming about their own ignorances , and i don ' t like how being sceptical on climate issues has been conflated with being a climate change denier . i don ' t fully understand the scope of the problem , but i ' m willing to bet a lot of people that claim to , don ' t either  and i ' m damn sure they ' ll sure it as an excuse for their political machinations as well . all i ' m saying is that it ' s going to take some serious convincing if the eco  types really want everyone else to give up their standard of living .

6. i  m pretty sure my neighbor is into some hardcore drugs as the cops have stopped by quite a few times . weirdest thing is seeing home move next door and being this completely normal dude to now being a crazy drug addict . i remember the first time i met him he was really nice and we talked about music for a while while i was cleaning my car . fast forward to a year or so later , i got home from work late and he was walking by and he tried to shake my hand and wouldn  t let it go as he told me that he was a nymphomaniac .

7. solid answer but not sure if it should be at the top
   (ID: fada832baa55975057f6409e8926deefae094f1f)

8. nothing currently , but i want to give her dc and then i  m not sure what else
   (ID: 6f88a57b804dffb05f07ee78e02223947d9055aa)

9. it sure looks like it to me . what makes you think he doesn ' t like you , because everything you have put here is very much in the yes category or am i missing something obvious like usual ?
   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

10. understand you pretty much , especially about talking about it . in my decade  long fight with more or less severe depression and fa  at this point i am really not sure which one is older and causing the other one  i have tried to talk or suggest it just maybe three times , with the two persons i trust the most  my mom and my best friend . my mom , who loves me and cares about me , accepted it with strange hostility , so i closed it immediately . my best friend , with whom i had issues but he truly cares for me as well , reacted as if he is not sure what i am talking about and i am overreacting though he knows or assumes i can ' t get myself together and i desperately need some help or a lift . so i am not turning up this to anyone anymore . excluding reddit strangers .

11. old movies . sure they were good back in the day but really they aren ' t very good now . the storytelling is infantile and the acting is abysmal .
   (ID: 76442d997e7f64c10223aeac0f4ff8af70ff9dde)

12. are you sure you just weren ' t hoping it would ? i doubt it , but just in case .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

13. you know how you can turn this into something valuable rather than a tifu , op ? make sure it never happens again . make sure that next time you are in that situation , you remember how you felt today , how you were so annoyed at yourself you had to come vent at reddit . remember how much of a fool you feel right now , and be sure that even the most brutal rejection will be easier to deal with than this . because at least you will have tried . faint heart never won fair maid , and fortune favours the bold . so be bold . don ' t ever again be the guy who posts his failure on reddit .

14. " well , ted is a werewolf , william is a vampire , eris ? a witch . " michael says straight  faced . " me ? i ' m an angel . well , half  angel . this is a school for the supernatural . " i stare at him . i had known that the school was strange when i first heard about it . i received a letter in the mail inviting me to hargrove , including a pamphlet that showed the large colonial manor . my mom had read through it and exclaimed , " you got a full scholarship ! " although i had never applied for one . so there i was on the bus from the airport , riding alongside a handsome , tall guy who introduced himself as michael . the bus was travelling through deep , dark woods . " no , it isn ' t " i replied to him . " are you crazy ? werewolves and vampires ? they don ' t exist . i ' m just a regular person . " michael looked at me with a half  smile . " i guess you have to see for yourself . " the rest of the ride i stared out the window until we arrived at the school , which was much more spooky than it had seemed on the flyer . the bus stopped and a man stepped on . " alright everybody , if you don ' t know me , my name is mr scott . we ' re coming off the bus alphabetically to make sure everyone ' s here . bill ? " bill stood up . he was a huge person and nodded at mr scott . he rose , crouching to avoid the top of the bus , shaking it as he descended . " those half  giants , am i right ? " mr scott smiled then quickly moved on , reading more names down the list . i stared and squinted at him , wondering if i heard him right . " michael ! good to see you again , i hope you had a nice summer . say hi to your dad for me ! " he clapped michael on the shoulder as he walked off the bus . " alright , let ' s see . nicholas ? you here ? " i stood up . " just nick is fine , thanks . " " great , good to meet you nick . i ' m so glad you ' re joining us as hargrove . " as i walk up to the front i notice mr scott ' s legs seem strange , as if his knees bend in the wrong direction . i look quickly up at his face to avoid staring and see tiny horns poking through his hair . in shock , i quickly step off the bus . michael is there waiting for me . " believe me yet ? " he asks . " i ' m starting to , " i shake my head in disbelief , " but if everyone here is a supernatural creature , what does that make me ? " " i ' m not sure . but i know how to find out . " michael replies . he leads me into the school and across a beautiful , expansive foyer and into an office . " mr ripley ? " michael says , poking his head through a door . " there ' s a new student here who doesn ' t know what class he ' s in . " mr ripley had strange , smooth skin like a burn victim . he was also tinted a light green and had yellow , vertically slitted eyes . he smiled , revealing two rows of small sharp teeth . " hey michael ! who ' s your new friend ? " " uhh . nick greenwood , " i answer , stepping forward . " yes alright nick , let ' s see here . " he runs a clawed finger down a list . " ok , right here  wizard class , druid subclass . does that help ? " " perfect , thanks mr ripley ! " michael smiles with perfect glowing teeth . " so you ' re a druid ! that ' ll be a fun course ! the angel course is full of ethics classes . " i think back to the way animals seem to treat me differently than other people , how i always seem to know what they ' re thinking and how our garden always has a much better crop than our neighbors , always completely untouched by pests . " yeah , i guess that makes sense . i ' ve always liked being in the woods . " " well you ' ll certainly be doing a lot of that . settle in , man ! i ' ll see you around ! " michael walks away and i ' m left alone in the foyer , wondering what i ' m supposed to do from here and what i ' ve gotten myself into . i hear a voice behind me . " nick ! our newest wizard ! let me show you where you ' ll be staying . "

15. sure it would be creepy if the guys were random strangers . but op hasn ' t specified that . it could just be people she knows . in view that , i think it ' s alright . quick to jump to conclusions aren ' t we !

16. this is a very smart looking app . a few things that stood out to me as a software architect  i ' m not sure whether the iap unlocks this but it would be quite nice to be able to swipe back from full screen images like you swipe from everything else . it ' s especially a speed bump when using a phone with the right hand and not being able to reach the top left x one  handed . i ' m quite sure you have a bug in your comment folding . some comments fold gracefully but some fold the ops name too and then make it reappear below the fold which is a bit disorientating .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

17. okay i  m sure this isn  t a normal thing now , but have you heard if this before ?
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

18. quora is where i got this i ' m pretty sure scott would be incredibly disturbed by the proposed strategy of size  changing to burst out of someone ' s body . i mean  by odin i thought it being okay for heroes to engage in casual mutilation was questionable but this ? from scott lang ? and you imagine him being okay with climbing up someone ' s butt ? as for messing someone up from the inside , i recall hank pym in the comics has punched a guy ' s brain up when in tiny form but he assured the thug ' s hostage when he emerged that he ' s a doctor . although probably worth noting hank is ever  so  slightly bonkers . to sum up . theoretically it ' s possible , but if you imagine scott ever doing it then you don ' t know him very well .

19. i ' m not entirely sure what happened all i know i someone broke the law and there is absolutely nothing we can do because my whole damn filthy town is courrpetd
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

20. after reading some of the comments ive come to realise people find some of the magic eyes difficult . i assumed you could either see them or you couldn ' t . although this image is quite shallow in depth it resolves itself just as easily as any other . not entirely sure what point i ' m trying to make only that it was an eye opener so to speak
