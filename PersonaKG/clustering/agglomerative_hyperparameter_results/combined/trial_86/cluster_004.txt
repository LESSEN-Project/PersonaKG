1. all i see here is a good pilot communicating with a good gunner . if that team they were destroying had a single squad in it that dedicated a minute to shooting that bomber , it ' d be dead . hell , a single fighter or attack plane running the correct loadout would shred that bomber in a half  second . a single tank that ' s half  decent at leading projectiles could smash it instantly during a bombing run . vehicles are supposed to destroy uncoordinated infantry easily , but a coordinated effort easily destroys any vehicle . behemoths are far from broken . if a team has to fight a behemoth , they likely control most of the map . if they control most of the map , they have more than enough stationary weapons lying around to destroy it in less than a couple minutes . which is unfortunate , because behemoths are supposed to be overpowered  they ' re designed to allow a team to easily catch up to the winning team , but rarely succeed at doing so . the " oversights " you ' ve mentioned are much different than the ones i did . yours are perceived as overpowered because the average player does not use teamwork to properly counter them . mine are perceived as overpowered because zero effort was put into fine  tuning them to a balanced state . a flat damage bonus to all weapons will always result in clear  cut best choices . they never learn from this in every title they make . if they actually put time into giving every weapon different damage stats in hardcore , issues like these wouldn ' t exist .

4. did you read what you just typed ? if something has low odds and it happens it is generally considered lucky . doesn ' t always have to be , for example , two digit stars to be lucky . edit  yes i ' m aware that you could also be unlucky in this same manner . but i would not consider this to be unlucky .

5. . so you ' re saying it would become too popular ? honestly , me , i don ' t care . about it being legal or not . i ' m going to get stoned either way . and if it was legal , and everyone did it . shit . that would be awesome . imagine the scene , you walk into your local grocery store and everyone is slowly pushing the carts piled with microwaveable tv dinners , snack foods , and pineapple i say that because it ' s the best damn stoner food around . each passing glance to a stranger , you are greeted by half massed , red eyes with that stupid stoner grin . you know that they know , and they know that you know . everyone will be blitzed all the time .

11. i played an asoiaf campaign using gurps once unfortunately unfinished and one of the things that the gm did was making the combat very lethal . i don  t remember all the rules or homebrews used , but i remember we used the optional bleeding rules . in our game , set still in the targaryen ruling , we were all members of a minor northern house and were caught in the middle of the rising tensions between the bolton and the karstark . technically we were pledged to the karstark , but our lands were closer to dreadfort and the boltons decided to obligate us to serve them . as you can see our game was more political with very few adventuring , but maybe you could start with an episodic campaign , that behind the curtains is growing to became a conflict between houses and only too late the party will notice that they were dragged to the conflict too . like , they start doing random oddjobs for some house and later discover these tasks were actually pivotal to a coup or weakening another house  s economy or whatever .
