1. even in this sub . last time some dude stole a pic with the oops tag on it the entire sub ripped on that dude so bad . all memes should have a mark somewhere imo just to give credit where credit is due .
   (ID: 97f042c151ad751b2811d75ae69fd7feae42ed77)

2. it is and it isn  t . virginity for women varies from person to person , is it only full penetration with a penis ? or what about a dildo ? being fingered ? inserting a tampon ? or is it if the hymen is still intact ? which can be broken without intercourse or even remain intact afterwards ? the general societal consensus is a woman is less pure after this very vague construct is  taken  . imagine how destructive this concept is when as a young girl you  re told that a huge factor of your worth is based on this notion . the current societal implications of losing your virginity , which originated from men determining how much a woman is worth for sale , dowry , sacrifice etc . read  patriarchy are damaging , where as the other examples you listed are not . if there are similar examples though i  d like to hear ! having sex for the first time should be celebrated as a mark into adult relationships , and nothing else . it matters to some and to others it doesn  t . but if you sit here and equate disregarding the importance of having a penis inside me for the first time to disregarding the death of a mother then that is fucked and is part of this issue . for me it didn  t matter so much , but i saw how negatively it affected my friends  especially those that were religious . i like discussing this because everyone has their own view .
   (ID: d4912bd11a6aaa98c91794eda03e9fafdfcf5c43)

3. i actually think is perfect . here ' s a videohttps    on why the ending pretty good . if you have the time to watch it i recommend you do . ofcourse spoilers tl  dr  the ending wasnt a asspull .
   (ID: 622ae5e8e0ffe2c066a3d94dcee004b5696643bb)

4. life would be a lot shorter , therefore you would have less time to do things . you mayaswell make the most of the time you have and do the things you ' ve always wanted to do , no matter how risky they can be . e . g bungee jumping
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

5. i think you mean more openly discussed . murder and violence should be discussed while at the same time nobody needs to know the details of someone ' s sex life .
   (ID: 8e2981abd669b044bf2b787c04095c3ebe52e273)

6. maybe because of the new redditors that see those questions for the first time ? e . g me
   (ID: fd112b0116b574aa5911af63529dca9683e5f6eb)

7. yes ! i feel exactly the same way . skiba is a wonderful person and i was super excited when i heard that he would fill in for tomstill miss him but yeah , i think there downfall was bring in a producer , i think that honestly hurt them in a way . i still give it a listen from time to time . " she ' s out of her mind " is my favorite song off the album

   (ID: 0217046a1ad9b1e567109f7f7a4bb8b9f4b4fc05)

9. digit months ago heck , even digit months ago is a long time to remember content from test . i absolutely think it ' s representative . the odds of you remembering more than digit random question are very slim . when i retook the tests , i think i remembered digit question total not per exam . i just retook fl digit the last time i took it was in late march  1st week of april , and i seriously didn ' t remember anything from the test . 3rd party exams tend to be deflated , so i wouldn ' t worry about those too much . if anything , they ' ll help you hone in on areas you need work on . you ' re doing great !

10. sounds like duty sex to me . what i have learned is to expect nothing , don ' t get your hopes up . because most of the time when i do , disappointment is the only thing that follows .
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

11. from your post i ' m guessing your australian ? are you casual or part time ? i have one of those managers too but luckily he doesn ' t do rosters and i ' m pretty close with our rostering manager so he normally puts me on shifts where he is working and i don ' t have to deal with the bitchy guy , or if he ' s there as well the rm just tells him to piss off nicely of course only real advice i can give you is if they tell you off for doing something wrong , ask they how to do it right and try get them to show you . firstly if your not actually doing it wrong they get completely defeated . even during rush or whatever just ask them . i know a girl who the bitchy guy at my store was doing this to , she just annoyed him so much he stopped telling her they she was doing stuff " wrong " she wasn ' t because every time he did she made him waste digit minutes showing her how to do it the way she was already doing it .
   (ID: ced909c5cb6ff0568a08e4114fa46116da622fa1)

12. sometimes when i type " just a sec " i mistyped and write " just a sex " awkward answers when there ' s time that passes until i realize what i said .
   (ID: 767dc546311237345e846f55cd4d6b549fa0cb71)

13. how do people manage to get to level digit ? i mean unless you ' re a full time fortnite streamer it just seems unreal to have the time available for it .
   (ID: 1306973da0fba9f8c4b839b9163f3f01aacfe98a)

14. i was an idiotic teenager who would chase after guys that didn  t give two shits about me . the whole time i was oblivious to my best friends massive crush on me . that boy was there for me through all of my problems and it  s safe to say that he  d give me the world if he could .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

15. seriously look it up it was a way to mark slaves , then jews and other religions then jump to the 1900s american doctors claimed it would reduce masterbation . when in reality all it does is remove pleasure along with climax control and lubrication . i will never do it to a baby boy . no one should . if they dont like how it looks by the time they start using it you can do it later in life .
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)

16. lol ! i liked it a lot , especially the sense of isolation and vulnerability you had playing as a regular soldier rather than a spartan . it also reminded me a bit of metroid prime , which is one of my all  time favorite games .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

17. One of my favorite things is photography time  ireland freedom electric toothbrush.
   (ID: 87173aaf55980a77c94bd30c851c39fb0b52ff2e)

18. social comparison will be the death of you . don ' t do it . all you can do is focus on your life and how to find happiness . some people find it through hobbies , travel even within their own state , physical activity like bicycle meetups with other local folks in the snow with " fat bikes "   apparently , that ' s a thing . i have an acquaintance that ' s digit and in a bowling league , i think that sounds awful but he loves it . what would make you happy ? more time with your son ? can you surprise him with lunch at his school ? he would probably love that . maybe dip out of the office for an extended lunch break so you can take a breath from your day to day norm .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

19. yeah like op said there are two other people here possibly one who are shadow banned so check that out . anyway i ordered some 350s off ali about a week ago and the tracking number begins with ls . they just got processed through the sorting facility , and they haven ' t done anything else . it just takes a really long time for it to get out of the country . give it some time .
   (ID: 89c3606d2dfc5d2a2da97fb49ddc1894f8bf330f)

20. depends on whether it ' s a good marriage or a bad one . a good marriage is like living with your best friend , but you also get to have sex with them all the time .
