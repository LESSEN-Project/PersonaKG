1. i adopted a cat no one told me that the cat was deaf and had some serious emotional issues . i bought it lots of little toys from the pet shop and one day when i came back from work i found the cat in a really bad shape , it kept throwing up . got her to the vet and he told me that she literally ate a rubber ball , chew it up and ate it  had digit big rubber pieces in the stomach and needed an emergency surgery . i did not have the money to pay for it and i knew my family wouldn ' t support that so i turned to my boyfriend we were at the beginning of the relationship . he gave me all he had and got the cat fixed . the recovery was quick but she still has a habit for plastic objects and bags . we are living together and we are always super careful with this kind of objects , no matter how hard were those times she ' s my little kitty

15. i see many people who have self harmed . ranging from self mutilation in the form of cutting , burning , tearing . i could tragically go on . treating suicide is like walking on glass in todays society . from religions sentencing those who commit it as being devilish to those who look down on these people as if they are not worthy of life . it is important to remember that when a person is suicidal , there is nothing on their mind but death . it is important to remind them that living does has its tragedies death in the family and what not but it is important to equally see the beautiful things whether it is a cat video or falling in love . have you ever read batman  hush ? there is a line in it i use with many of the patients i see , and it speaks to me as much as it speaks to them . and maybe it will help one of you . " when you commit sucide you not only kill the person you were , but the person you could have been "
