4. i know that . i was just saying that for an eli5  level explanation , x  x " equals " digit at digit . meaning that the limit of the function exists . of course , as others have pointed out , you can define other limits that are still indeterminate that come out to other values . or no values at all . at x  digit , ln1  x  sinx  digit  cos  digit x evaluates to digit  digit . but , as any mean girls fan knows , the limit does not exist ! but the limit of literally taking x  x to digit does , in fact , equal digit .

7. definitely don ' t shoot . the effect is much bigger , it is kinda tough to get the technique right in the beginning , and bigger health risks . if you wanna snort or smoke bth , ecp ,  digit ? , start with an amount that is no bigger than a matchstick head . wait digit minutes , see how you feel then you could take a very small amount more , and repeat til you are where you wanna be at . edit  and it ' s never safe . you are taking pills . with pills you know to some degree how safe they are because pressed pills are indentifiable . you know what to look for to know that they are legit . with heroin you never know what you get . it might be shit , it might be better than what you expecxted . and if you live in america and out of luck it has fentynal in it . it ' s a gamble .
