16. not sure if this counts but i was out walking my dog in the when i come across one of my classmates tied to a tree , unconscious and severely dehydrated , apparently some other class mates mugged him , beat the hell out of him and dragged him into the woods , naturally i untied him and explained what i knew to the police and i know very little after that , the two thugs and the victim did not come back to school and the teachers did explained the circumstances , i was never called as a witness , my guess is they plead guilty to whatever charges or because they were minors got a slap on the wrist with a new identity , apparently the victim did recover physically but lord knows what going through that really does to you .
