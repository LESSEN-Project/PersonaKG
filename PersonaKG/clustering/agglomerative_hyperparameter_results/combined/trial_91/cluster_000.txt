3. just hear me out ! taking time to really think about what you ' re eating is connected to whether or not you ' re living a happy life . that ' s why i think it ' s really important . so , there are animals that are carnivores , right ? you know , like lions , cats , and vultures . you won ' t find meat from carnivores like that at a restaurant . why is that ? because its too smelly to eat ! it ' s disgusting ! listen up , guys ! cats are too disgusting to eat . are we on the same page so far ? on the other hand , have you heard of a fish called " sweetfish " ? sweetfish don ' t eat bugs . they only eat algae . they ' re vegetarian . usually fish guts are too bitter to eat , but sweetfish guts are delicious . it ' s because they ' re not carnivores . so with that logic in mind , all the meat we consider delicious is from herbivorous animals ! cows , pigs , and chickens ! the better their food , the better they taste ! which leads us to this conclusion . humans would taste gross because they eat meat ! well ? how do you like the conclusion i came up with ?

10. you ' re already beginning to explain everything my comment was meant for . neurons that fire together wire together . i wish i could spend up the process of building new neurological channels in my brain so that i could get into the habit of remembering more good times , but this sometimes can be a painstaking process . i personally have had to go out of my way to create new associations , new experiences , relationships , events , feeling states , interpretations and behaviors in order to allow my brain to have a different default mode . the first step to get over trauma is to distance yourself from all malignant narcissist in your family and social circle that overtly or covertly are physically and or psychologically traumatizing you . as long as you have sociopathic , sadistic entities retriggering cortisol spikes , your amygdala will be inflated , and your sympathetic nervous system will be overactive , leaving you an a perpetual fight or flight response which is the default mode of post traumatic stress disorder . the feeling of guilt in shame is a projection that toxic people around you have tossed to you like a hot coal . they knew it would hurt if they held on to it , so in their own sick and strategic way they left it in your hands and said , " here , you have it . breaking you down psychologically is facilitated because you permit yourself to be easily discouraged . they feel more secure when they have a compliant subordinate , and since you are acquiring these feelings of shame so openly , you make a good victim to target and blow steam off of . the problem is this identity is not yours , it ' s not serving you , and you need to let it go , create a new experience , and become one of the thousand better versions of you that are possible to embody . narcissists employ sadism through psychological torture and the carrot and stick method is commonly used . as long as the standards keep moving , you will labor to satisfy , like a mouse on a wheel , even though the very nature of the person you are dealing with is pathologically insatiable . through statements like , " has made it impossible for me to move on " in the fucking garbage . don ' t say shit like that . sit down , admit and accept that hundreds of different forms of evolution , healing and enjoying are possible . you simply have to concede that those options and opportunities exist . they do exist , don ' t say they aren ' t possible because you ' re wrong . while i ' ve written so much , here is the meat of my point  you have the almost psychic power of empathy , but you have been continuously hurt by people , who granted , are in pain themselves , but don ' t have empathy and furthermore go out of their way to hurt you so that you suffer more than you know you do not deserve . what you have to do is refuse to gift your empathy to all entities as many individuals are not deserving of your kindness and compassion . i have had to cut of friends and the closest family members who frankly are suffering , but that doesn ' t make what they do to me any less cruel . you must become acquainted with your dark side and realize that it is in your best interest to completely abandon those you have betrayed you . if you respect yourself , you will slowly but surely begin to adhere to boundaries and only tolerate persons that do so with you . if you seem heartless , mean or cold it doesn ' t matter . these people know you are a good person and they are taking advantage of that very quality . because you derive your own validation from how you give , these people will suck energy out of you indefinitely until you stop them once and for all . because you ' re loving , you won ' t want to leave them behind but it is the first step in your healing . go full no contact with your abusers
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

11. but that ' s not actually what ' s happening , you are writing hypothetical fiction at this point . suppose in your hatred of trump supporters you become a murdering psuedo  vigilante who kills trump supporters . you should be banned from reddit you murderer ! you should be in prison ! see , anyone can do it . and my point with that example is that you are really going to say that a good father and successful mechanical engineer is " piece of garbage " just because of who he voted for ? give me a break . to be fair , though , washington dc is just a corrupt city in general , it ' s not just trump , although he is probably among the worse . nonetheless , the whole city is owned by corporate donors , e . g . the koch brothers . at least it ' s not as corrupt as it used to be in the gilded age , boss tweed era .
