   (ID: 071de8843a9f6c2baf4f1a9eccd0700b9c6589a6)

2. i took a year off after high school to decide what to do and make some money full time and i did , but i never properly took time to do enough research and i just jumped into a program that i  m not completely enjoying . im two years deep in this program now , and it  s a shame that now i know what i want to do and i wish i took the time during my break to find out that i should have done this other program instead of the one i  m doing now . if you  re gonna take a break , please pick wisely . i  m too deep in to turn back , and if i could go back i would do things different . you don  t want to be the guy who wishes he went another route
   (ID: cdfe8425c4239c926bbc69037b1e955de45be4ba)

   (ID: 272bbd1e0746915faf3405ae9c33485b5967ca9f)

4. it  s funny you think millionaires and billionaires actively are working against you . if you show even a slight bit of wanting to become a success and they will help you because not many people do . most people sit back in a shitty job and blame the people that made it
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

5. when they become old enough to be free labor in the house . they believe everything you say . more enjoyable food in the house who the hell doesnt like chicken nuggets and macncheese . with a digit  digit job you only have to seem them during dinner and rush to your man cave , cough i mean study  office for solitary man time , cough work time . if they are really good at something like super smart you can make fun of other peoples kids . you can learn current pop culture from your kids . if a kid in the neighborhood is a dick , you only hope your kid beats the shit out of them . no jail time . best of all the " i told you so " or " wait til you have kids " or spoil the shit out of your grandkid when they stay over cause the end of the visit that kid isnt staying its your kids problem .
   (ID: 9d6cadbef277b68098e82945a77678dbb2a079c6)

6. if you go to h  r block , you ' ll be paying taxes , that ' s for sure . and it will be commensurate with how much time you have and how much you can afford to pay in order to save on taxes . if you have an army of accountants , they will do the work for you digit  digit and make sure no stone is unturned to keep you from paying taxes . big difference my friend .
   (ID: 25b8235c988cb167d94968ee893707e9c358cde8)

7. i pretend to work as long as company pretend to pay a decent salary . i think we are on the same page there .
   (ID: 3c4a38138d39bd51556bd7f8a05ba48bf283c7e6)

8. just like any other job interview , the right answer to ' why do you want to work in this new position ' is always what does this particular position offer you ? what do you have to gain from it ? what can you do to help the company when working at this new position ? the only time that you talk about your boss and your challenges with him is if your interviewers bring the topic up since this is an internal interview and the reports you have on file may be up fair game for discussion . even then , you still have to be professional about it and don ' t just spend time trashing the guy .
   (ID: 1ebb4643f7e1e4d41ee2503d9b5d94ed0224c96b)

9. if you ' re good at it or have an interest . i found a job where i laugh every day and love what i do . could have made a lot more elsewhere but that is my measure for success .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

10. this reminded me so much of a situation i had while i was a college student . i had some money , but spent almost everything , expecting my dad will get his pay on friday . well , he didn ' t , he had to wait until monday . my parents informed me and asked if i had enough to make it through weekend , and i said i do , because i did not want them to think i am irresponsible parasite and i did not know if they had enough money for the weekend , since they were expecting it as well . i mean , they always have someone to borrow from , it is never a problem in a small community , but i did not want to ask . well , tldr , i was hungry at the weekend . had money for just a loaf of breed , split in half for two days , and exactly digit eggs . that is all i have eaten for two days plus a jam put on slices of bread , leaving just enough money for the cheapest bakery product for monday morning at college . hunger sounds silly until you face it . never let yourself staying without any money if you are not poor and can save it just enough for a package of groceries .

11. tbh if you came to a point in a relationship where you choose who is going to pay for anything , i don ' t think you ' ll last long . you too should make a couple but by separating money like that you will never have a family with him if you even want him to be father of you children , if not then ignore me .
   (ID: dcb1bc1d0feb2af72f09ec35633379706e2b36f0)

12. we have ' core hours ' when everyone is supposed to be there . i think they ' re from digit am to digit pm . outside that , they prefer you to work a regular schedule , but you can basically work whatever hours you arrange with your boss . mine is pretty cool about it . i usually show up at work the same time every day , but if i shoot him an e  mail and tell him i ' m going to be half an hour late for some reason , i ' ve never gotten any shit about it .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

13. it ' s designed to make you smart enough to work for someone or start your own business , but keep you dumb enough not to question why the fuck you ' re there doing the shit , and why the fuck its get a job , get a house , fuck a bitch shoot out babies send them to daycare
   (ID: 258f707f4d4ef2a235c76e1a3f46df976a2e0270)

14. it depends with how much experience you have or what company you  re working for and location . if you were to go through the union , starting out as a  helper  you  ll be making  digit an hour and every year you  ll get a dollar raise until your digit  5th year . after that you  ll be considered a journeyman and be making anywhere from  digit   digit , then i believe after your 8th year you  re eligible to take a test to be a master electrician and be making  digit  digit an hour . like i said it depends on the company and location . i know a master electrician that makes digit  180k a year . it  s a really good trade to do . you can start your own company , do side jobs for extra money on the weekends , but not really suppose to do that when you work for the union , and if you plan on building your own house , it  ll save you quite a bit of money being able to do the electrical stuff yourself .

15. you ' re not an asshole but he totally is . he looks like a spoiled child . he should understand your situation and help you rather than asking you a ton of gifts . does he have a job ?
   (ID: 862cb85d93fa9b931c3c64cf2fd17ef592d48c50)

16. i ' ve always been poor and i fucked my gs ' ing program in the ass hard by being crazy as fuck but also controlling that crazy . you gusy say " dont go crazy , violent , etc " thats cuz its assumed if a target does that its over . they dont want someone who can keep it in control . they dunno wtf to do anymore so they " default " on a lot of things . dumb ass mother fuckers .
   (ID: b315186ce8337ceb3b156267ade8222ced5499ef)

17. no formal training related to this kind of stuff and i feel like they did tell me that everyone was getting a raise .
   (ID: a2ca7f9e05e83928ce894848f01290dbcd0f654e)

18. i really wanted to upvote this comment  if you choose to go into a field that you love , you ' ll never have to work a day in your life . because there are probably no jobs in that field .
   (ID: 1f61921525978b0c5bcae6c0ab9c184a4d4c86a6)

19. so no debt from college and free healthcare , plus  42k a year net income ? that ' s not bad . my question would be is it even worth trying to excel in your job and get promoted and a raise because even if you got to  84k with the tax rate you ' d probably be making the same net income , right ?
   (ID: 73c241755308e15ea272f3060f9c0a430c541f1a)

20. no but i still keep my stance if the money is there . pay me . everybody is different , they have their own thoughts and ideas . if i don ' t do it somebody else will . why shouldn ' t i make that money if i ' m perfectly able to ? it ' s a job . that ' s all . now if it ' s universally immoral then we may have an issue . i ' m not gonna be the spokesperson for human trafficking . with that same thought process though if your thoughts and ideas don ' t allow you to think like that then that particular job isn ' t for you .
