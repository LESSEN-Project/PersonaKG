1. either way the answer is no since you don ' t get wizard spells , which is what you need for the wands . the flavor is definitely up to you .

3. honestly after talking to allot of people . i main her and i basically use the sweep as a mental tool . people will almost always dodge the sweep on reaction bc it  s so rewarding , if you delay the sweep it turns into a gb . the only buff she needs is a damage boost .
