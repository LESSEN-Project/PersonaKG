   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

10. i ' ve had plenty , but don ' t remember them . you feel like you ' ve went on a crazy adventure and when you wake up , it ' s just your shitty boring life again .
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

11. yes . what ' s it like ?
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

12. i had some truly surreal experiences on them , but you need to be careful because they are serious . if this is your first time , only take half of an eighth . you will get an incredible body and mental high , but not the trippy visuals when taking a full eighth . that might be a bit much for a newbie and lead to a bad trip . do not do them alone , do not wander off alone , and whoever you are doing them with , make sure you are comfortable with them . don ' t invite anyone that isn ' t going to be shrooming with you , you will feel really weird with them around and it might trigger a bad trip . if you feel like you ' re freaking out and having a bad experience , change your surroundings immediately . if you ' re inside , go outside , and vice versa . again do not go alone . when you eat them , remember they grow on shit or from shit ? , so trust me when i tell you that they taste like shit . i found them easier to take as a topping on a slice of pizza or sandwiched between candy bars . all this being said , be prepared for an amazing experience . there is no way to accurately describe the feeling when you ' re tripping on shrooms . you have no sense of time . hours are minutes and minutes are hours . you are not in reality , but somewhere else . you will likely have an epiphany , or multiple . some of the best nights of my life were spent tripping on shrooms with my best friends . some nights out in nature , another in a confined bedroom with bright red walls and a disco ball that pulsed to the bass of the music . ahh yes ! listen to music ! you hear all the layers of the song like never before , i recommend led zeppelin . amazing ! be careful , listen to what i said and enjoy !
