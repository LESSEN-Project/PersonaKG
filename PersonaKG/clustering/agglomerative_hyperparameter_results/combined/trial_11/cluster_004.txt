9. as a furry myself i  ll say that the kind of people who end up on this subreddit are a small minority in the fandom . that being said i  m also going to say that unlike what some furries would say i  m going to estimate that like digit  of furries jack off to the characters . theres this study which i  m sure somebody could find and link in the comments that puts the number at like digit  but you have to realize that most people who watch normal porn wouldn  t admit to viewing it , so i bet a lot of the furries polled in that study straight up lied during the survey .

10. i used to be a hardcore minecraft fan back in , i dunno , digit or something . spent hours on that game . i remember playing the demo version of mcpe from my cousin ' s ipad . i fell in love instantly . i ' m a huge nerd for books , so after i found out about this website called " wattpad " , i decided to combine my two favorite things and read minecraft fanfics . looking back now , most of them were pretty bad , but for a digit year old , it was the shit . everyday i got off from school , i would log in and read till i grow bored . then , i met this guy named " radishologist " who wrote minecraft books , and surprisingly , his story wasn ' t terrible . so yeah , i decided to give it a shot and before i knew it , i couldn ' t stop reading . he made three books in total , and i read them all . on his third book , he asked his followers if any of them would like to be part of it . i was thrilled , and i quickly pm ' d him and gave him my character . it was pretty terrible . cliche name , cliche backstory , etc etc . but for a kid , it was the best thing ever . he agreed , and i became part of the book . i remember smiling like a doofus everytime i would read chapters with my character ' s pov . made me a little a proud about myself . after a few months , he posted another chapter . he said he was making a kik group chat for people to discuss about minecraft and stuff about his books . i didn ' t know what kik was at that time , but i found out . told him i wanted to join and he added me to the gc after that . we called it the " radish community " there , i met a lot of people . many of them were from america i live in the philippines , so it was pretty hard to fit in . eventually , the community grew and grew , and i started to feel more comfortable around people . i remember bragging to some of my classmates how i got " friends from all over the globe " and shit . they never really believed me though hahaha . i became close friends with a bunch of them . especially that radish guy . it was in that community where i had my first online gf . it didn ' t worked out , of course . had digit more online relationships after that , but ye they ended up badly . but we had fun . we talked a lot everyday . i also remember him hosting a bunch of " kik comps " where we do challenges and shit and the winner gets a follow from him on wattpad . i was a moron , so i usually just goofed around and never really won anything , but we didn ' t care . we were having fun . that was digit years ago . our chat ' s still alive , but a lot of guys left . radish dude and me still talk , but not as much . he doesn ' t write books anymore too . his wattpad account ' s still functioning , but barely . he stills logs in from to time , usually to give announcements , and the occasional updates , but that ' s about it . i follow him on insta though , and he ' s pretty busy with life . he ' s gonna go to college in a couple of years so he ' s trying to enjoy his senior years . we used to be huge . like digit  people gathering around and talking about minecraft and shit . now , we only have like digit people left . i left the chat once or twice , but i kept returning . couldn ' t left them behind . ya ' ll could argue that " online friends aren ' t real friends " , but this guys , i grew up with them . well , not technically , but they ' re a huge part of my childhood . i just hope that we can actually see each other in real life someday . haha , actually , one of us suggested that we should do that after we graduated college . ironic since she ghosted away after that and never really showed up anymore . i still talk to her on instagram , but it wasn ' t the same . todd , ana , salix , jazzy , glitch , leo , rebel , thomas , karim , aj , collin , andrew , basically anyone who were part of this , especially todd aka radish guy , if any of you are reading this , i just wanted to say thanks . thanks for everything . i know , i say that a lot but i really mean it . yeah , i act like a douche sometimes , and you guys probably think i ' m nothing but a heartless memer who shit on other people , but deep inside , i ' m really thankful . those comps , those memories we made , it was awesome . i really hope we ' ll still keep in touch , even if there are only like digit or digit of us left . wherever life takes us , i hope we ' ll still remember each other . thanks for being part of my life . i will really cherish our friendship forever . your pal , the  blue  droid

11. also , you have to a be good at what you do , like real good and  or b be very lucky and fall into the right opportunity . i ' m guessing there ' s probably many attorneys out there who are as good or better than your grandpa and yet somehow didn ' t make the big time .

12. I am small youtuber.
   (ID: ac53f9ce173965984299f3686335a39bc2a5810f)

13. well , i have studied but am not proficient with japanese candlestick patterns , chart patterns , i am starting with tape reading , i am trying to learn market cycles , applying the news , correlation between forex  stocks , i would like to learn options and the mathematics behind it . ah , i know what you mean . so , i actually don ' t really know all of that other stuff either . i know the basics , not the terminology . once you understand what the candles actually " mean " then the names and specific " patterns " mean very little . i feel just a basic knowledge of the candles will suffice  but i know concepts nothing i can actual trade with on my own . i really work hard and i put forth the effort  work . i am doing this full time and have some savings to weather the storm while i learn to trade on my own . i would start by finding a basic strategy and then working to improve it . i would say half the battle is just getting " into the zone " or as close to it as possible . there ' s a great book ironically named trading in the zone , by mark douglas . if you ' ve been working this for a bit it would probably be a perfect read ! a lot of the topics went over my head the very first time i read it , after re  reading it though it was completely different to me !  i am willing to switch to one software like e  signal which will do both . i would love some help ! i also want to continue onto python  algo trading afterwards . that ' s the direction i took , i really enjoy it ! i ' m currently trying to focus on scalping , having a go at bitcoin ! this is my progress for the past few months . feel free to dig through the twitter if you want to verify those trades , digit  of them i try to post on twitter to avoid appearing fake lol . cause that was the other thing i was going to say . i would say digit  of " classes " out there are useless . the most important things i ' ve learned are probably things i ' ve picked up from the more legitimate books out there and just digging around online , doing my own research . fooled by randomness is another great book , also algorithms to live by . more concerned with algos i ' m also trying to get a discord going that focuses on productive discussion , not just useless news and fluff . if you want a link just lemme know ! i love to help answer questions , i love all ideas , you never know where good ones can come from ! if you asked me where to start , i would say start with a digit ma , see if you can trade off just using that . then find out where and " why " some trades are good and bad , just build up from there

19. in toronto theres a company called fix it females that higher mostly women but they want ppl who are ' ' experienced ' ' even though a lot of them aren ' t , but apply anyway say you have painting experience . best way honestly is to be a helpelabor at sites , sweeping , passing tools , moving what you can etc . and you gain experience through that . tbh like digit  of construction crews your ganna experience peverted guys cause most of them are rough around the edges high school drop out type guys so you gotta find the right crew
   (ID: 564c5b4efd54586fbf212727e2071f5ddadabb82)

20. mentorship programs are the way to go . experience is the valued currency , not institutional learning . videos are a great supplement but they can ' t help you apply advanced concepts to your source material your audio . it ' s the application that ' s tricky and always changing . bottom line , if your shit is fire , people will take a chance on you professionally . but if what you ' re producing is lacking , work with people that have been doing it longer . whether that ' s by a phone call to someone you look up to , or a mentor  protege program depends on access .
