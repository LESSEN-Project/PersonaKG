   (ID: f6b8978c4b660719e17dff38ba86c988b9bf86f5)

6. a girl i went to high school with is now a fairly famous pornstar , and one of my buddies even slept with her a couple times before she became a pornstar . as you could expect it  s pretty weird . being able to find videos of someone you know having sex with one google search .
   (ID: 11e562551d8ce916c649db9948355e07c68fed96)

   (ID: 903829fb4aefc18f9ba3e0dc7d2f3267adf2bcc8)

8. i don ' t know how much of a dick this guy had been prior to the start of the video , so maybe she was riled up for a good reason , but in all honesty , if any store clerk or manager would ever talk about handing out my personal details , even if jokingly , i would lose my shit as well . this is something i have zero tolerance for . it ' s pretty much the most unprofessional thing you can do in such a position .
   (ID: 02373263cff49259e87b0a96214a8ea7f4fbfc93)

9. there was a family from near where i live who was renowned for having really bad personal hygiene . like you ' d say their surname and everyone would wince a little . one time i went to the shop and in walks one of them . never met them before then so i wasn ' t sure if it was true , but it was . it took a lot of self control not to gag . never before or since have i met somebody with the capability to stink out a whole shop . i felt unclean taking the bottle of juice that was in there out with me , like the smell would have leaked through the bottle and into the juice somehow . as soon as i got home i took a shower . i ' m not sure if there was something wrong with them , or how they smelled so bad but holy fuck . i have full empathy for any health problems that may have caused that complete and utter stank but please , stay the fuck away from me .
   (ID: f9f34c53011c38bf18b297061e7ed0a73cfc6eb5)

10. it was my birthday and i took some of my friends to dinner at a restaurant , we were having fun , being a little loud not gonna lie , i looked over my friends shoulder and saw an elderly couple being served a cupcake with a candle in it , which is what the restaurant gives you for your birthday . i went to the front where the manager is , and told him i  d like to pay for the couple . we left before they were done eating and i never told anyone about it . i don  t know what it is but elderly people strike differently in my heart
   (ID: 0e6a43754a1dcb5e74789d829e04eccdbba7129f)

11. yeah fuck them ! i don  t know how it can even be legal to pay somebody as low as fucking  digit . digit to deliver ! i drive all the way across town to go to mcdonald  s in the middle of the night and wait in the drive  thru line for fucking ever and then kindly and quickly deliver the food with a smile on my face just to make fucking digit dollars and some change ! i feel robbed ! i feel insulted ! i  m seriously done !

13. anywhere except where op works . i didn ' t even get a reprimand . the guy didn ' t ask to see any sort of supervisor . sounds like i was being rude , i know , but in my line of work , you can give as well as you get . its sort of the best version of customer service ever .

   (ID: c0cbd0e097375f98ad98ec291f836a39d55e02c1)

15. stories like this infuriate me . i don ' t know what gets into these entitled , self  righteous people ' s minds that makes them treat wait staff like subhumans ? it ' s as though they don ' t understand that wait staff are not only fellow humans but also not responsible for pricing , food preparation , plating , store policies , or most of the things that happen in a restaurant . they ' re simply the middleman for every other department in the facility . they work their asses off trying to make a living and your experience pleasurable ! i have much respect for those servers that can maintain their composure when faced with people like this . tl  dr . fuck that bitch !
   (ID: 0e56d8a3bf928d2e85ff5b7a5a98f913d2826b00)

16. it sucks . we have created a sick system where it is inappropriate to have personal relationships in places where we spend most of our time and are most likely to meet new people . you could just take a chance . worst case scenario is a scandal and you quit . best case scenario you live happy ever after .
   (ID: 2266c34274940e2ea1a22a3dee5a3cbcdad25f53)

17. i got asked when applying for a job at direct line " so why do you want to work with direct line . i gave back an answer along the lines of them being the best in the market etc etc etc . then the interviewer said " yes yes yes . but why direct line . every time i tried to answer it differently she just asked the same question . she looked disgusted when i told her " i have no idea what you expect me to say just now "
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)
