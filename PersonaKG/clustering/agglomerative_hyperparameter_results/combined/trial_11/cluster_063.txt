2. i don ' t mean to woosh you or anything , but that was a joke , i thought you would be able to understand , sorry about that , but in my opinion being a man is knowing what to do in the toughest situations , getting your loved ones out of bad situations no matter the circumstances , always being a guiding hand for your children and someone your entire family can look up to .

3. good explanation , thanks . i agree . manhood can  t be measured , as that plays into the concept toxic masculinity . then the belief of manhood being measured should instead be just considered how macho someone is ? not in a negative sense for example , if you see a strong , burly man with a beard and place him next to george constanza , considered the former with higher manhood is wrong , but instead maybe more macho  stereotypically masculine characteristics ?

4. damm right . he  s the most manly man to exist , have you not seen the hold he has on the tennis racket , he could kill you with half a thought

5. what ' s embarrassing about having the very act of removing your jacket whilst looking a woman directly in the eyes literally radiate enough raw sexual power to blow her hair back ? all things considered , it ' s probably his greatest accomplishment .

6. like any man , he saw it as " you want me to raise another man ' s kids while telling me i will not have mine . what ? pretty sure that isn ' t an " any man " attitude .
