1. I am contact with a male stranger.
   (ID: 44544d02ee07c96b8d593f9252059c899c993d61)

2. romantic relationahips and marriage
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

3. tell him you love him . of course , not in the homosexual way unless you swing that way but make sure that he knows you care about him , considering you seem to be the only person he has .
   (ID: d8492ac2e05f869f3bd79bafc9f32c603a615e59)

4. depends how fresh . if it just happened , you say sorry and then might wanna give them space to process whatever it is you did .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

5. i  ve wanted marriage and kids my whole life , he wants neither . that ' s enough right there .  i was hoping that as we grew older he would change his mind . that hasn  t happened . sorry , you can ' t change people and you have no right to expect you can . go find an awesome guy who you think the world needs more copies of , with your awesomeness combined with this . you deserve a partner who is as excited about kids as you are . you are way too young to settle . you don ' t need to make any excuses , leave now . if he begs you to stay and says you two can have kids to keep you to stay , that ' s a recipe for disaster . he ' ll most likely go back to not wanting kids and ten you ' re really fucked .
   (ID: fcec87cb8b541d87ad0eb8b52c3541c8fc49132b)

6. i feel like you don  t really have a right to be angry at her in that regard since as you even said you cheated on her digit times due to bad friends so why would she not be concerned about you going out doing certain things ? in this case i think it  d be healthier to break up so that you can use the lessons you learned in a new relationship where there  s not so much trauma to undo . you  re a better man now , you won  t do the shitty things you did in this relationship again , but getting your gf to trust you completely again will be at best a monumental task , at worst impossible . if you don  t wanna go through with all that entails , then i  d really recommend breaking up .
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

7. try to think of some flaws that you think the person might have and if that doesn  t work well then fuck .
   (ID: 1ab03d054f341c1ede82c7eb9f871db0a696e44d)

8. that sometimes we ' re not in the mood to talk , and it has absolutely nothing to do with you .
   (ID: 4ce6edbd86b6936a31b902056e0708d563c2b4bb)

9. if she ' s insisting but let you pay the other times , let her this time . i dated a guy for awhile who paid for every single thing , which is super flattering , but when i told my mom she was like " you need to pay too ! just make him let you pay " so i felt weird about it . we are told we need to take care of ourselves first , to be independent , that we can ' t be " bought " etc . i think it ' s actually a good sign on her feelings towards you . while i ' m not dating that guy anymore , i offered a lot to pay because i didn ' t want him to think i was taking advantage of his kindness . i did finally end up paying for a few things here and there , which worked out because he never carried cash and i ' m a cash girl . i doubt this will be the new " rule " where she will always pay for herself .
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

10. some people are raised in a fashion that they never developed the want to have kids . instead they see it as any other decision in life and look upon its downsides . usually they end up turning away from it
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

11. you have to let your children resent you at some point or they will never strive to be better than you
   (ID: 4d1c53b18fd4290c31e857fc9f9572542fef4fd5)

12. you don ' t need them . i know it hurts but focus on the happy and loving aspects of your new marriage . you ' re incredibly strong , i wish you two the best . show your parents just how happy you are . if that ' s not enough then too bad , their loss .
   (ID: 4f350b59a80efc55c353f9527b99d8b6f4fc403d)

13. nice guys aren  t really nice , they are almost always trying to create a reciprocal relationship . i do nice things for you  you do nice things for me .
   (ID: 32de5e90f9b453daab13fd1b4cff20b995cc5120)

14. if you are an average dude you are fucked online because you will be turned down because of your looks long before you could even show how charming you can be . in person the average dude can get a chance by talking to a woman directly .
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

15. dude . you  re kinda the one that got her pregnant . at least have some sympathy . i mean , when the baby comes are you going to be asking ,  should i stop sleeping because my wife isn  t getting any sleep ?  you  re in this situation together . sacrifice together .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

16. i avoid a lot of people because i think they are boring and tend to have meaningless conversations where they complain about their pathetic lives which they deserve anyway due to the lack of determination
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

17. you have to know me to realize it but i stay too calm . everyone who knows me well knows that i will f ' n lose my mind if i ' m falsely accused of something , but if i ' m lying about it i ' m relatively calm .
   (ID: dc639446b154d74c8655191b5a755643abd00c2d)

18. i would try harder at the kink  fantasy with the soul mate . dress up ? blind fold ? role play ? porn ? i could fool myself into thinking i was fucking someone i wasn ' t i think . if she thinks as highly of you as you say you think of her . she should be open to ideas of some fantasy type things so you can get the next best thing to some " strange " . which is still her but you get to pretend on some things . i wouldn ' t give her up . compatibility like you describe is super rare in my experience . plus maybe a few years down the road her mind might change again and she could get more willing to a threesome or something
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

19. you sound like my grandma when she says  gay is such a nice word ! it  s too bad it means homosexual now .
   (ID: 280643182527d573e119c7952a08fea10d62edd8)

20. never used siri . i find it really awkward speaking to your phone , especially if other people can hear you
