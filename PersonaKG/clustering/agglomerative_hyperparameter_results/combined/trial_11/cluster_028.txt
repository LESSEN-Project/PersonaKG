1. wear the toughest full plate you can get your hands on and find a mudcrab . let it hit you over and over , casting healing spells to stay alive , or burning through low level health potions . save frequently , as this can sometimes cause issues with crashes though this has been very rare for me and because you may occasionally get attacked by something more formidable when you ' re not expecting it far more common . there ' s a good spot downriver , east of whiterun that i have used several times for this . you may also want to have a shield with you , as this is a good way to level block as well .

2. just hide the entire game collecting mats and maybe find a treasure chest then sit in a baller and wait for all the other players to kill eachother . if you get lucky , they might die in the storm . gliders are nice to stay above someone without the worry for dying from falling . an rpg from above would be good . make sure you are rotating into the new safe area quickly and get established there . tldr  just camp lol
