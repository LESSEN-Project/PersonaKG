1. i get it , honestly i do because i ' m the same way . this might sting but it ' s the truth . you ' re lazy . you want instant gratification . i get it , i do too ! i ' m lazy as well , but i don ' t like that about me and so i grab that feeling with both hands and i squeeze it down and say " fuck you quitter , i ' m going to learn how to play  do this " . my dad used to tell me this and i hold it close to this day , " toughen up buttercup " . you have to fight for what you want , even against yourself .

2. so i can see the other people that are happy besides me . to look at fun questions on this
   (ID: b0e3f9865fac8af53cbb23ab9bb715640cab13f0)

3. i just keep track . i just love to take the time to really know the people i care about to notice the things that make them happy and the things they prefer .
   (ID: 91dc65ba6eef536f17becface16989de7f988dce)

4. entertainment is pretty much the same for anyone . it helps you forget your life to focus on other people ' s lives . sometimes you need a break from the daily stress . sometimes when things don ' t seem to go anywhere , it helps for that too . but one thing to keep in mind is that just like anything , shows should be watched in moderation .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

5. it  s true that it is kinda a waste of time anyway , the problem is that instead of having fun wasting my time i just get depressed
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

6. fine in moderation , but anything that encourages escapism may hinder motivation to find some real life action . i heard kids don ' t care about getting their drivers license right away anymore and teen pregnancy is way down . i ' m sure glad i missed that sad ship by a decade .
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

7. a absolutley agree on this one . i ' ve noticed recently that people have been accepting " the greatness " of minecraft compared to how it was frowned upon before .
   (ID: a46a927d1c00d0b3c6ef6c26916584373e7bc5d8)

8. because you ' re a laid back person who cannot understand why someone would want to be the best they can be ? you tell us . edit  that sounded bitchy . not intended
   (ID: cd0b72d117bf74908c3edaaf3947b089a9dafc0c)

9. i have many hobbies . if you are inferring arguing with you is a hobby of mine , i can assure you it is not . i just think you ' re wrong , and you clearly are unable to handle people disagreeing with you , as evidenced by you telling me to get a new hobby .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

10. maybe you can join a new sport or some other fun activities , to spend the eveningsi joined mma . don ' t go for gaming though , it just makes you feel empty once done . hope that helps .
   (ID: a168763c82b90dc18ccbbd57533eec2e49d17dc7)

11. i know i know , but don ' t make excuses . someone can do it and so can you edit  " skate better " is just a joke my friends and i make at each when we can ' t land a trick
   (ID: b721d508c3e10f143c9836626787b26136faa266)

12. really ? then why are you carrying a handgun best suited for hunting . are you hunting people . not my belief , but just showing how fast things can turn on you .
   (ID: 05dea10a374f0f09c767062f0a3d0b51b6d20b9d)

13. tv show for sure . i spend more time on the computer than watching tv nowadays . also , my favorite show is the kardashians . my pregnant wife loves to watch it all day when she isn ' t doing stuff around the house .
   (ID: d8b92be4e0b1e639cde4ac3fc3f079b296813fc5)

14. i do this as well . here if you wanna chat .
   (ID: 32b13ea4ca437349e9a1e08776a6ff36cef70328)

   (ID: 533870e07f5d5bb315a9e1e8278df4d123d8a887)

16. you ' re free to enjoy whatever game you like . just don ' t see why you would post it here .
   (ID: 2f03a8d589defb9434044b9ef9bfffc676e2b49a)

17. i stockpiled a bunch of memes for my cake day to post to maximize people seeing them and also looked up peak reddit hours . this makes it sound like i care too much but it ' s not like i fear that no one will see them . i ' m not over here making masterpiece artworks or anything .
   (ID: 618e7c681a628e6c6c5521926bf4d17deb5ed5d6)

18. hmm . so you  re bad at the game and you like something cause it  s an easy way out ? maybe you should quit .
   (ID: 870d9d198f856764296262192823c935f1daf781)

19. this is a very unpopular opinion and for good reason . people do play video games to escape reality , like you might eat tasty foods because they taste good , and because you don ' t want a plain , boring meal . there is one gamer who gets paid 500k annually and is digit y  o .
   (ID: 818422b560c80f37eedf14f771cd2fcd3657589a)

20. do you still have a way to play games , if you ' re on console practically the only games we can play together are fortnite , sea of thieves and maybe some others i don ' t know or don ' t have . if you ' d want to give it a try even fortnite is fun if you ' ve got someone to play with trust me . plz give it a try or a different game .
