1. i have the same issue . i guess it is bc as long as we are not the ones in that situation we can think clearly and see things in perspective whereas if we are the ones who are affected , it blows out of proportion as we cannot look at it from a factual side anymore
   (ID: 9721da66d978b8a2541ec60ba070b6fa9121482d)

2. yeah thats the one i am really on the fence about . might trade the rest in and pay abit more for the rest . maybe them private for abit more or something , then keep the digit and keep ocarina of time , cos super smash bro  s looks 1000x better on switch !
   (ID: c06f82a9d6f502a9c5707645e6b0bc869ff37975)

3. how is any of that in any way a problem ? ever ?
   (ID: 9414b9913220ebe2601862e3001aac74ebcffe33)

4. its okay if you haven  t played ds , as long as you acknowledge that piece of information . the idea that the reality of bloodborne and the reality of ds are one is pretty . stupid i must say . therefore its important that we establish a common ground of understanding , you know ? to put things into perspective , you wouldn  t start a race facing the wrong way would you now ?
   (ID: 05b66d977b603757baf68e2315ea2e5970865864)

10. you might consider a short story or anecdote collection . i don ' t know what you like , so here are several possibilities  louis l ' amour , westerns r . a . lafferty , usually described as an sf writer because most of his stories appeared in sf magazines , but his stories are more tall  tale folktales . dr . oliver sacks , british  born neurologist who has written a number of books about unusual cases he ' s encountered  " the man who mistook his wife for a hat " is a good start . if you ' re into alternate history check out some of peter tsouras ' s essay collections . the most recent one i ' ve read is " rising sun victorious " , about ww ii in the pacific turning out differently .
   (ID: f024c8cde5b36a880df271cca31792d32264df2c)

   (ID: e84ec39cf97c9609b6feb31cbaab5faf551f372d)

16. sounds like gerd or lpr silent reflux . all your symptoms make sense , i recommend keeping a food diary and trying to nail down if anything in particular is a trigger . should help you determine if it is indeed diet related .

   (ID: 129ef8c0c15772442f28ff253ba4d16a19caef46)

20. this thread is a fucking mess . seems like an interesting idea , op  i kind of wish i could start back from the beginning of my game to see what the profit scaling is like , but i won ' t delete my digit years of gameplay
