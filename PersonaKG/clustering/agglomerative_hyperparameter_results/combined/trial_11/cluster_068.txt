1. if your not comfortable with the idea then it sounds like you already know what you do and don  t want . on the other hand waiting a few months won  t make much of a difference so see how you feel then .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

2. i think you should . you never know , it may bring you closer together .
   (ID: 920ba0628cbea5588ecca4c8ba7f80b411ff70ef)

3. you ' re quite literally missing out on half of your potential friends , i ' m serious , having female friends as well as male is amazing and won ' t be weird unless someone makes it weird .
   (ID: ef9684680c857510e817ec197ee0615d70b29022)

4. yes that  s ok . you can do and like whatever you want and not be made to feel guilty for that
   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

5. of course , you can do whatever you want in life , whatever is fun to you .
   (ID: 74e54884f2ac673f7fe8a5cc7e07cb76d27b4804)

6. ok so this is the first year i  ve told my self no goals just go with the flow . every year i have high expectations of myself and end up disappointing myself , not this year . i  m not gonna take life so seriously and just see what happens .
   (ID: 5763816fca04febe03a678f8e19c39daaa876bd4)

7. just remember your friend would want you to keep on progressing
   (ID: c7b03500469d01fff7d63dc804418c265ca4c838)

8. you can certainly do amdram style acting for years and it ' ll scratch the itch but if you want to pursue acting as a full time career , you kinda need to put all your energies into that , from my own experience . as i say to folks , and as people like matt damon have said succinctly too , if you can do something else instead , go do that . that ' s not trying to discourage people but it is basically saying that if acting isn ' t in every fibre of your being , don ' t do it .
   (ID: dccaef8a6226163d8d10afb2d04eb5a7babea832)

9. thank you , i just find it to be quite logical honestly . checking yourself in the best way you know will work to see if it ' s worth the wait , if your results were different emotionally you would know not to waste your and your so ' s time , which is better than starting the official relationship just for you to find out you don ' t really love her , now that ' s fucked up . goodluck with whatever you decide !
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

10. you can be whatever you want to be when you grow up .
   (ID: aac8075b69856b11cb4307ac267b902010d66e3a)

11. you should do that . and until then you could maybe try writing in slovak ? might help as well , even if you don ' t understand everything . at least you will get a grasp of some vocabulary and some grammar .
   (ID: cf870aa7c8e0dd833ce984fd462b0f47ad7a6ace)

12. its normal to stick with what you know . but all the fun is in something different .
   (ID: 2fd27f1218d4f8b9cf90988522a560a50a304dfc)

13. i guess all i have to say is it ' s one thing to know how to do something , and another to know why what you ' re doing works .
   (ID: 3994e1d32967dee02bf170d70c0ccc2d7dbd99d5)

14. of course . just remember that no one can push you into anything . and if they do criticize you about it , then just remember that you are your own person living your own life .
   (ID: bd005ac438966eb1f8d6de10fcb1bb6fd4565782)

15. if you think it will make you happy then do it . it ' ll probably lead to better oppurtunities in the future .
   (ID: cbed067932829315de162cb512843a4f6b1083b7)

16. and that  s ok , you should like what you want , i just wouldn  t recommend it based on personal experience . but i respect people  s choices
   (ID: ba6e9b4e1f123022ebad3ecf22065f969929a346)

17. why do you even want input for this question ? thats a personal decision that shouldn ' t be influenced by anybody but yourself .
   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

18. i mean if that  s what you want to do .
   (ID: eb0cdac3cc0d373669b221df2a54b8040cfa1dde)

19. you should do the thing you want to do . otherwise you ' ll just give the wrong impression and just have dead end conversations with people you don ' t care about and waste all your free time for the rest of your life .
   (ID: aac8075b69856b11cb4307ac267b902010d66e3a)

20. i mean you could try to have a long distance relationship even if you think it won ' work . and if it does work out , you ' ll be happy that you tried it .
