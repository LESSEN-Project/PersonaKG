1. yeah , i would just do that because i know that i ' d have one maybe two slices of that pizza and my friends would take the rest . to my friend group i ' m essentially the cool grandma . i feed them , make sure they ' re ok and fed well , scold them but tell them that ultimately that it ' s there life so they can do what they want , give them presentsmostly in food form etc .

3. just our silly gift exchange . we pick a theme for the year . it has been  something from a truck stop , something blue , something homemade , your favorite song on a cdhad to explain what those were to the kids and then a quiz to guess whose was whose . things like that . usually we all pick a gift , open them , then have a dice rolling game where everyone gets one chance to steal another ' s present ! we have a large family , so getting one present is way easier and just so much more fun and it takes the commercial aspect out of the holiday and makes it more about our family being together and doing the usual silly shit we do together .

5. it ' s the hostess gift bs that really bugs me ! it ' s like your friend is having this trendy party because they know damn well they can ' t afford anything digit sells , but if you all would just spend more than you can afford so they can get that one pretty thing . i ' ve gone to digit parties in my life , i believe . never again .

7. i asked my mom to get me monopoly star wars edition when it was brand new and my mom said ' you don ' t have enough friends to play and we ' re too busy to play with you ' . it still hurts

8. i ' ve always been a big fan of " the shopping game " for kids . it goes like this  i went to the grocery store and i bought . and the first person names something you could buy at a grocery store that starts with a . the second person repeats the thing that starts with a and adds something that starts with b and you keep it going as long as they can . good luck , and have fun !

9. nta , rsvps are there for you to know how much you need to buy . ans if people are showing up with other kids and said nothing about , they shouldn ' t be surprised that they got nothing . things like this make me mad and the guests get pissed like its your fault they bought uninvited people with them .
