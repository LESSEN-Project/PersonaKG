5. they were all gifts i received , and not as part of a set . even if it ' s from a different set , the same basic concept is there , as is the fact that it has the same stories as the other set ' s volume digit and also , it ' s still mildly infuriating , as i got them when i was like digit  digit , individually ordered , as gifts , because i found out about it from another kid at a summer camp i went to , and he gave me his copy of volume digit or something .
