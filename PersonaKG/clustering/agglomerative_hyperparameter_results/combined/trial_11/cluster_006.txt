   (ID: 000804102a722a64dab51502693ae73a9773ff5c)

2. don ' t over think it . be in the moment and let yourself go with your partner . don ' t expect that its going to be mind blowing and don ' t worry about being a dynamo at first it gets way better .

3. proposals in front of a whole crowd would be terrible . i have always thought a nice one would be very intimate and just in a really nice location at a nice time of our lives . i think if a genuine man puts in effort and real thought that ' s what matters . my sister still lives at home underneath my mother ' s house . she got proposed to by him getting on one knee under the house . worked for her but i would be underwhelmed lol . nothing hard about going somewhere beautiful and secluded . but hey , marriage isn ' t about much of this anyway . it ' s a promise to someone to love them entirely as a human for as long as that person is alive . to be the other half of that human through all of life ' s journeys . choose wisely .

4. i ' m not doing one for the same reasons . i ' ve had to go to wedding showers and always thought what ' s the point ? besides just showering the bride with more attention , which is something i never wanted . if you do end up having one , keep in mind that couples showers are becoming a big thing , so it doesn ' t have to be gender specific .
   (ID: 169c51cc138a4161080068ded4dcf87863ffee36)

5. threesome . a lot of people i ' ve known make it seem like it ' s going to be this amazing experience . they can be fun but you see how dealing with three different people ' s chemistry and bodies all work together . it can be awkward , jealousy can happen , and sometimes it was too hyped up in your mind . once you have one , you see that a truly good threesome can ' t just be thrown together and expected to be awesome .
   (ID: d785eda10245445843c3355a0710d262b0d65bb9)

6. i think that ' s the idea . if so , i ' m excited for when i go to sd in a few weeks . lots of matches !
   (ID: 3790e844e04694d48c253f7aee4d3b61f116d4d6)

7. what  s your idea of soon ? in the range of one year ? sure , they both will be there for you !
   (ID: abffa241a0eb33d4cf220980872adc9a148514b4)

8. i did , it was alright . your mileage will definitely vary with how into your partner you are and  or how much you like big parties . if you ' re just going with friends , then i hope you like fancy parties , else you won ' t get much out of it . if you ' re really into the digit  digit  howevermany people you ' re taking as dates though and enjoy romance then yeah it ' s pretty romantic . it ' s not cheap , though , so consider how much a formal dance setting and a fancy dinnerdate appeals to you , because that ' s about all there is to it .

9. yeaa that ' s what i heard , which is too bad . would be one heck of an experience going there tho
   (ID: a04ffec23ab9c2af8d4ac433e06db2b5d1b4bf9b)

10. no shame in going alone ! i  d probably prefer it honestly . the important thing is having a great time and celebrating the bride and groom  s wedding day

11. those little things are the exact things i don ' t want to forget while currently living with my so . we don ' t do much . but when we do , it ' s really nice . i certainly am scared i will miss the nights we just get high , eat , and watch tv then go look out at the stars . it happens more than the date night things , but i don ' t wanna forget !

12. it feels like home . you have another person who makes you feel safe , calm , and like you have a purpose . sure , they can still piss you off and annoy you , but at the end of the day you know it ' s ride or die and that you two would still do anything for each other . even if you lose everything else , you ' ll still have that person , and that makes everything okay again .
