1. yeah but who actually does that ? save for 17years ? only rich guys . for average people , its almost impossible to save for years and not touch that money over those years . just take that guy as a person who smoke cigarettes for years . at least his chance with his money is become a millionaire and not cancer .

9. he found out by listening to conversations in dale . ' that is a sample of his talk . i don ' t suppose you want any more . i had weary days of it . but from hints dropped among the snarls i even gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to esgaroth , and even to the streets of dale , listening secretly and peering . well , the news of the great events went far and wide in wilderland , and many had heard bilbo ' s name and knew where he came from . we had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the west . gollum ' s sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted .
