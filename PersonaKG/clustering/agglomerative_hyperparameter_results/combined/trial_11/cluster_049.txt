2. you can get the back embroidered to say " proud dad " or " best father " or something like that to avoid anyone getting butthurt on him having it . the nex can do it or a shop in town . if you know any prs they may be okay with doing the embroidery for you .

3. funny you should mention that because i ' ve just came across his instagram account . i quite liked it the idea because , as a player myself , i got it where as my mrs , who doesn ' t know a spade from a club , wouldn ' t have a clue what that meant . however , my vision is more about targeting poker first and scaling up to a designer brand which has a subtle poker reference which everyone could potentially relate to it ' s simple . i ' ll do some more research but thanks for your comments i appreciate it !

4. wow . just wow . lol , just based on what he has , i don ' t think you could sell it even . get the feeling he might be younger based on some of the comments . good for you for being respectable tho !
