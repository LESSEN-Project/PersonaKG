   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

8. your personal smartphone . i don ' t give a damn if you are digit years old , and live under a rock . if it ' s going to handle your personal business , your credit cards , your ssn , your contacts , your health information , and your bank accounts , it should be high quality and secure .   x200b  when you buy that  digit phone , sometimes the only person you fuck , is yourself . i immediately upgrade to a " decent " phone once mine is outdated . would you rather lose your identity or a  digit phone ?
   (ID: 85ada8069a64aa3ed39736f565e8a9ceed369acd)

9. there are only digit ways to consistently win money gambling . play poker . you aren ' t playing against the house , so it ' s possible to win money doing this . make sure you ' re better than the other players that you ' re playing with . learn to count cards and play blackjack . if you ' re good at card counting , you can tilt the edge in your favor , but you ' ll need a pretty large bankroll  digit times what you ' re betting per hand to do it , making it difficult to make much money doing this . if you get caught , you ' ll be banned from the casinos too . cheat . you ' d better be pretty good at it though , or you ' re looking at prison time . honestly , gambling is best looked at as paying for entertainment . if you go to a casino and spend an hour losing  digit , you just paid  digit to be entertained for an hour . up to you to decide whether that ' s a good use of your money or not .

   (ID: 3de4b885645ecd39fdcb6a1daf410341eb118d2c)

11. i ' ve thought about it a lot and i can only think of a few situations where i could be totally sure i wouldn ' t get caught , and they ' re pretty far fetched , so i control myself because i don ' t want to risk it .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

12. personally i look at the type of town they are in . in my head its something like this  farm town shop  anything on adventuring gear list 10g and under minus implements , simple weapons under 5g , and armor up to hide . digit  roll chance to see if the shop has anything magical or interesting . town  anything on the adventuring gear list under 30g minus implements , all simple weapons , and armor up to chainmail . digit  roll chance to see if the shop has anything magical or interesting . large town  anything on the adventuring gear list under 50g , military weapons 15g and under , armor up to chainmail . digit  roll chance to see if the shop has anything magical or interesting . city  anything on the adventuring gear list , any weapons , any armor . digit  chance they have something magical or interesting . metropolis  you can find anything here . for the pc ' s it is less about what they want , and more about who in the city has the better selection and prices . i also keep in mind the kind of town it is and whats going on around it . ex  a fishing town probably doesn ' t have horses for sale , but more than likely would have boats and spears . if they are in a magical kingdom then magical items will probably be more readily available .
   (ID: c018255fd73fced873eb4897821cd82620ba8fe2)

13. i am with everyone else here , this is a bad idea bro . people get protective over their wheels man , it ' s an asset , most people rely on them . if you do this and crash it or something happens to it you think that you pay some bills is going to stop your mum from caving your head in with a brick ? why don ' t you ask her to borrow it for the night and bring it back with a full tank of gas for her . if she says no there is probably a reason . if someone ever did this to me i ' d have a shovel , a bag of lime and some black plastic waiting for them when they got home .
   (ID: 06080b0d1273cc2321b21dde5865b5c1c5180e56)

14. i don ' t consider it a waste . at the risk of sounding ignorant , budget has no impact on how i grow . my personal grow is my hobby and stuff i want to do like plant manipulation or literal pet projects . if i get the right seed combo , i could make potential f1s that yield ungodly amounts per ft2 . if i get the wrong seed combo , i just made a new genetic that none of my friends have . so to me , that sounds like a win  win and not the loss  loss you want to present it as .
   (ID: e978c4c5dd931b8985b65369abe1ef855c833aa3)

15. i don ' t think stores should be so pushy when it comes to ihas , rather employees should only sign people up if they truly need it . the iha least in my area got sent out to someone ' s house just to answer someones questions about a roku stick f

16. well , you didn ' t add a " serious " tag , but i ' ll give you a serious answer anyway . i ' ve done a fair amount of research on this . all adults   the ones with the money   hate school fundraisers . the idea that gives you the absolutely best return is this  you send a note home at the beginning of the year explaining that you know everyone hates school fundraisers , and you are therefore going to dispense with that nonsense and instead request " direct giving " include an envelope . ask parents to donate the amount of money they would otherwise be wasting on wrapping paper , cookie dough , and other crap they only buy to placate their children . you will end up with substantially more money than if you actually sold the wrapping paper or cookie dough . if you ' re dead set on holding a fundraiser , try the " original art " one . find a company that prints original art on random things mousepads , t  shirts , coffee mugs and does school fundraisers . they will provide your school with all the materials . each kid draws a picture and then goes around to family  friends and tries to get them to buy a mousepad  t  shirt  coffee cup featuring their original art . it ' s still a terrible idea , but at least you get something your kid made instead of some awful cookie dough .

17. y  you probably don  t have any money ! loser ! goes and pouts on the edge of the playground
   (ID: 57566e418da3ba7bb3e33d1def44eaef175b88e9)

18. i don  t know about you but i  m not made of money . if i could keep an extra digit  of my income rather than giving it to the government so they can license people who put paint on other people that would be very beneficial for me .
   (ID: 8b20a772d1697ecc1b19f9f6451e7346e8b98987)

19. how ever much money you think you need , double it . there ' s always things you didn ' t count on . you may not need all the money but it ' s better safe than sorry .
   (ID: 03cf8378bcb94745c52eb716a381f55774f3b358)

20. if controllable , i ' d probably go out and do some dumb get  rich scheme . if not , nah , that ' d be annoying and i wouldn ' t gain much , probably . maybe if i could figure out a way to filter it for myself .
