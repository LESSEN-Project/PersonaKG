15. well , have you ever considered that your past experience and current lifestyle is what ' s shaping your outlook right now ? i won ' t claim to be an expert but perhaps the lack of " desperate " struggling has raised your level of contentment beyond what even you would consider " normal " perhaps ? my mother came from a 3rd world country we live in the west and my dad is british and i always felt like a piece of trash whenever i visited my relatives and the little nitpicks creep into my mind . but i noticed that despite their struggles , they seem infinitely happier and more comfortable with themselves than i can honestly admit .

17. i don ' t feel like my perception of reality is very off it is that i am way more critical of myself than i would be months ago and some weeks are worse than others to the point i don ' t want to get out of bed . i also don ' t feel like anything triggered it really it just sort of stuck it ' s head out of the blue , i don ' t really know how else to discribe it .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

18. i don ' t know how long ago you did it , but i still have some scars from around digit years ago . eventually they just become part of you , good or bad . they ' re not ugly   they ' re just you . by no means do you have to love your scars . i think it ' s an important part of the healing process to accept them , though . you struggled . you overcame . be proud of that and the shame and disgust associated with them will lessen . hope all is better with you now .
   (ID: 43a6fe9c16d7a48abeb6832518a650a445974a7e)
