   (ID: 787f4a3fe31691883105c973a6b8e3df9df1436e)

2. i used to do something similar . back when they had film camera , tourist would ask you to help them take group photos . i would line the photo up cutting off everyone  s heads the take the photo . man  shrugging  light  skin  tone
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

3. o shoot that sounds like an absolute blast . you can always make weird faces at kids , then pretend you weren ' t even looking that direction to pass the time ?
   (ID: 5f43a3019d69696064ac659bf6dd25b51f1e5bb6)

4. that ' s the hardest part for me as well , i usually perform for people i already know like classmates , family , friends , etc , so because they already know i do magic i just say what you wrote " let me show you something " . it ' s another thing when you want to perform for someone that doesn ' t know you do magic . depending on where you are , you could say the same " i ' m a magician , would you like to see something cool ? " or something like that . also aproaching groups is better than only one person , the chances of a group dismissing you are smaller because they feel safer .
   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

5. i have a friend who picks it up almost every time , and recites random fast food order lines . ex  welcome to mcdonald  s may i take your order ? one time he did the intro to dominos pizza , and the guy on the other end started ordering .
   (ID: 34784a4c9eca2e43db08bf9f548798a984337741)

6. damn . so sexy . i ' d love to give you a hand . no reason why you should be doing that all alone .
   (ID: f709eec52cd0c0cff5afc1f9f3e0caa4a2797782)

7. tracing words repetitively . if i get a series of words that sticks in my brain wether i am having a conversation or watching tv  i trace the words on my right leg , and can do it for hours just impulsively . it honestly feels so stupid when you see a mazda commercial and get the tag line ' zoom zoom ' stuck in your head for a period of time and you ' re just like , why ? it ' s funny , and since it ' s one of my harmless rituals i have , it ' s not a big deal in my everyday life lol .
   (ID: 9e1be6964f5835f58b6cdaac71f8b557f0b4a42f)

8. that sounds nice . no i haven  t but i may . i tend to get into my head a lot , and lemme tell ya . my brain fucken hates me . my head is an asshole to me and convinced me that everything i do is pointless and meaningless . no one gives a shit . etc . idk i feel like if i do volunteer the same will come of it . the main reason i like seeing movies with friends so much is because i can kinda forget myself ? if that makes sense . idk . i will probably look into it but i  m not expecting a ton

12. i have only done it a few times and i try to be discreet and watch it while filming . the last time was last year and i posted it to the fan group on fb and youtube . i try to enjoy a live show when i am there but sometimes you get a good seat with a great view and your favorite song comes on and everyone in the venue sings along and you are glad you taped it . i don ' t get those people who film the entire show , especially in portrait orientation .

13. my friends txt tone was ,  that  s a huge twinkie  from ghostbusters . it would go off randomly throughout the night while we were all chatting , and it was perfect timing almost every time .

15. learning shorthand could be an option . also  no idea where you are from , but in some european countries if not all , recording lectures or meetings isn ' t frowned upon . i ' m a teacher and when i demonstrate some technique my students are allowed to film me , just as long as they focus on my hands and promises not to share it online .
