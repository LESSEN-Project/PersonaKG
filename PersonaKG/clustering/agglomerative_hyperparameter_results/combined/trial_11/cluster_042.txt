1. r1d29 . i have no idea what i really want to have on d31 but i have noticed oddly that i have been generally craving various non  compliant foods more in the past few days than i did throughout the first digit days . weird . i would have thought that the cravings would have been very strong in the beginning and not the end . i still feel like i can maintain eating healthier though . this is huge for me as i had the diet of a digit year old before this . sugar , burgers and fries and then some sugar . i ' ve eaten foods that i " hated " or would never try during this round . after making the spinach frittata with added avacado on day digit for my wife , i girded myself for trying to just get through eating it and keeping it down . i kinda started crying halfway through it as the ingredients were the antithesis of what i would normally eat and yet it was delicious . i felt pretty foolish , but man , this has truly changed my perspective on food and i ' ve become so much more adventurous . i can ' t thank my friends enough who recommended we try whole digit . easily the best thing i ' ve ever done for my body and my health .

2. my only regret is that i didn ' t do it sooner . i had rny digit months ago . i have always been a food lover and i still am . the difference is the types of foods i eat now are much healthier for me and i know portion control . i ' ve learned to really love cooking and trying new recipes . knowing what i know now , buffets really gross me out . i remember loving going to them though .

3. force me to eat certain foods that caused me to gag . i had very sensitive sense of taste and many foods just had such a strong taste that was unbearable to me .

5. i was sitting on the kitchen floor with a half  empty box of sugar cubes , crying and complaining that i didn ' t want to eat any more . and my parents telling me i had to eat them all .

6. my kids never went hungry , i brought food for them to snack on . looking back though , i should have spoke up for them so they didn ' t feel burdened . this was also our last day and our last meal , so i just wanted to get out .

8. other family members watched all of it , so i ' d be in the room through most of it . i think early on i just decided it wasn ' t for me . i get why people like it but it was marmite to me .
