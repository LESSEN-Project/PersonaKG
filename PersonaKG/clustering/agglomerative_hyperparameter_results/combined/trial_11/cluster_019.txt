1. as long as you dont start talking in the middle of the movie , i don ' t care
   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

2. well i suppose that ' s probably how a lot of the great stand  up comedians and voice actors started . i ' ll admit , doing it in front of strangers is probably going to be more nerve  wracking . i do some voices and crack jokes around people i know but i already know where i stand with them . doing it to get strangers to like me or to put food on the table would make me more nervous .
   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

3. not if you ' re paid for it and your " friend " knows what ' s the next scene .
   (ID: be642743472cdef9445edc6dd55beb3c2a8a1258)

4. i have a friend who is kind of a reality tv star , not super famous but it doesn ' t really effect anyone in any way . i see people seeing mean things about her and none of them are all that true . she ' s actually a really nice person in real life .
   (ID: d2e08e506c32ac85c9dc9c537b36b64fbe497359)

5. i think that there is a trade off being a public persona and private persona off of camera . one ' s disguise has to be really good or the pressure to be constantly ' on ' can get to even the most seasoned celebrities . i think it would suck to be constantly hounded by people  but if done right then people would think you were cool no matter what for no reason . really it ' s a double  edged sword with trust and complicated social dynamics based  out of trust and exposure .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

6. depends on what kind of fame you ' re chasing after . i mean , you could become a famous serial killer . no good looks needed for that .
   (ID: 02373263cff49259e87b0a96214a8ea7f4fbfc93)

7. personally i get annoyed by some transformations where the actor looks better but it ' s nowhere near amazing compared to someone ' s digit year transformation , and the public looses their mind . i ' m here thinking like hey that ' s actually not that impressive
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

8. i love how this assumes there ' s a significantly large amount of people who want to dress up as prince . what happens if i want to go as michael jackson ? how does that work ?
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

9. then there ' s , " hey , i ' m famous and i might be able to get you a speaking part in the next star trek movie , let ' s do it . oh my "
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

10. that sounds like me , i have the will to do things but not enough charisma to pull it off .
   (ID: 0163212450bac6366408ac8e1e025d32048839ec)

11. fuck yes . being ugly as shit , no one would watch it anyways . so i get to annoy people while also being rich
   (ID: b5e15026c378d181e66e2b38bfc245705510a727)

12. i wouldn ' t want to watch it even without the scars tbh . i would just feel wrong . lewds are as far as this man goes .
   (ID: 411b23f3d2a1f254c1c92c17670bb02c191a1301)

13. so what you ' re saying is that your such a shitty person that having someone say a sentence or two , while you ' re watching a movie ruins the experience for you ?
   (ID: dc1a6ca8b7ce3327dec097f0883d72c2689870fc)

14. i wouldn ' t and wait for the show to begin .
   (ID: 31d924f098e0871341a799d7a5777fb635f53b34)

15. in nyc it ' s tough . pretty much the only way you ' re going to get a shot at going up at a club is through a bringer show drag digit to digit friends out on a weekday night for digit minutes of stage time . you need get an audition and do well to get passed at a club , and that ' s not easy . if you ' re really interested in stand  up , go to some local open mics , write jokes , perform regularly , learn  listen to other comics , and see if any of them book their own shows . most the comics i know in nyc start their own shows at bars  venues because stage time is so hard to come by , so getting booked on one of those is probably a good goal to aim for .
