6. hi ! yes , i did he ' s honestly an amazing surgeon . he ' s very respectful and straight to the point , i had a very positive experience with him . one of my most favorite things about him is , as he states about himself , he ' s a perfectionist . i ' m about a year  post op the original post was regarding something else and will be digit years in october and my results are pretty good imo . i do have scars from double incision that are noticeable which is obvious haha but my placement and everything looks very similar to a male chest . my nipples are perfectly aligned with my ears and all that .   x200b  congrats on your upcoming surgery btw you are in good hands , trust me . if you have any other more specific questions about dr . tuchleetc . , feel free to personally message me !
