   (ID: 29f3e9a3f8c02fc1b9aa346cffb8edec6caac89f)

6. start small , take your time , try to enjoy the process . this is what i did when i  d deep clean with roommates who aren  t wired like i am with cleanliness . food containers  scraps and beverages first so you reduce the risk of attracting bugs . then tackle excess papers and plastic things . recycle what you can , throw away what you can  t . personally i like doing laundry next , if it feels like too big of a step for you though , just put all your clothes in a hamper , or multiple bags for lights  whites , dark colors , etc . organization always feels cathartic to me , and this way when you  re ready to tackle it , you can do in chunks at a time . but at least try to run your sheets through , a clean bed feels wonderful . idk if you have knick  knacks or whatnot , but i heard a great piece of advice regarding tidying them up  put them together in categories on shelves or in storage containers using my own things as examples  video  game stuff , records , lego builds , dnd supplies , wine study materials , etc . as you reorganize things , wipe off table  counter tops with paper  towels and whatever spray you have . seriously , windex works fine , but finding one that is also a disinfectant is going to be better . once the floor is cleared , take a vacuum to that sucker . long smooth strokes . this is my favorite part of cleaning . i save it for last because nothings in your way now , and you can enjoy how clean everything else is around you . take the next few days or week and pick up and clean what little you have left like dusting  cleaning your light fixtures or any lamps in your room , organizing an end table or desk , fold  hang laundry , you get it . i can  t stress this one enough  buy yourself a little plant . succulents are great if you have a window that gets constant indirect light . i have a jade plant that i named theo . love that guy . last piece i  ll say , and it  s just as important as the rest . now that your room is clean , here  s are couple pieces of advice  open a window on nice days or on days it  s raining cause i love the smell  sound of rain buy a small , slow release incense that you enjoy so that your room will smell fresh daily . pick a day out of the week and assign a cleaning duty that day for me , sunday is laundry day , monday is vacuuming , tuesday i clean my bathroom doing things as they pop up . if it takes less than digit minutes , do it asap , it  ll weigh on your mind less , and you  ll start doing the little things habitually . last but not least  you got this , i believe in you .
   (ID: e9bd2e5a75b03c2a8d39168be58f6bed5ed6ff39)

7. " the future is now , old man . " comes from malcolm in the middle . favorite examples include , " when your grandfather says your generation is too reliant on technology , so you unplug his life support " and " when your grandfather throws a nokia at your head and knocks you out , but you throw a note digit and it explodes " .

10. the main flaw i see with many answers is threefold . negotiating will be difficult when you don  t know the language . even shakespearean english could be a rough adjustment . depending on whom you are negotiating with , they may just take it . and , if you bring back something that appears too shocking , threatening or evil , you might meet your maker rather quickly .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

11. i wouldn  t say it  s the developer but rather linking a game to a part of my life .
   (ID: bdf7e254fb732651bb0373067c57200731f7ca55)

12. if it  s really bad you should try to find a tutor or a study group to keep you motivated to complete your assignments on time . it  s easier when other people expect something from you rather than just yourself
   (ID: 238316960c030f561912bd63e9f572a4170f991b)

13. i involved a physical action , like a weird interpretive dance move , to help me remember some things . it ' s weird , but it worked for me .

   (ID: 50043497a219924fd275a92e5dadb6e04bac5936)

16. here you . keep this in mind when drawing . i also used to make the mistake of making the head too big . oh yeah use shapes . my biggest tip for you would be to draw something that you ' re not good at aka getting out of your comfort zone and also trying out new artstyles but this artstyle is cool too . also you should read some manga preferably one that has a more realistic artstyle such as fist of the northstar or kengan asura . that ' s how i learned proportions and anatomy . oh yeah and don ' t worry about failing with things such as perspective . art takes time .
   (ID: 22864f9484c3c6d7f8c8dac79c58ea32865eb794)

17. if your university has a printer through internet , set a bookmark for the digit minutes before class you have left . in fact , set up a bookmark for every site you use regularly . if you need to cite something is a good resource if you don ' t want to pay for it like on
