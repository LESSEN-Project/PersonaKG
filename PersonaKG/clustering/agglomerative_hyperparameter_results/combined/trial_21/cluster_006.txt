1. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

2. anyone answering this question seriously probably shouldn ' t be in that line of work .
   (ID: 59ebeb8d8fee755bce043a6482743bde8a2a0bb1)

3. let  s say you  re incredibly homeless . it may take years but if you do work hard enough you can turn your life around . it may require effort , but everything in life does . the people that get rich because of themselves are the ones who are willing to do what it may take . if you have enough willpower and motivation you can get what you want . people need to find theirs .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

4. would you , would you really ? or are you just small minded and don ' t understand how to deal with a broken game . working these people to death will get nowhere . they probably hate their managers for working them hard at the end of the project . they probably didn ' t agree with every decision . they probably just go to work and attempt to find solutions , work within the confines of company procedure , and do what they can . why should they be worked all weekend just so you can sit in your underwear alone and play digit . just get a different game and wait for them to do what they can .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

5. i ' m at work but i ' m not actually working .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

6. i work for gamestop , so that alone should tell you enough .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

7. balance . if you want a successful and healthy life then it needs to be balanced . worked digit hours this week ? work digit next week . had pizza for dinner tonight ? have salad and fish tomorrow . etc etc .
   (ID: 0b40e1731a58e377af57361e27d4264ac065a5b8)

8. yes , thank you for your work ! if you are willing to do more of those , they will really be appreciated .
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

9. the only way you ' ll really know is if you ask them . it could be because of doing work months food , it could be a green house , it could be a secret lab .
   (ID: 7632dd7ebcb664bfada5fff420a436f42e3721d5)

10. not everyone can just leave their job and work somewhere for twice the salary . a bit of an opinionated advice no ? how  s that even a realistic scenario .
   (ID: 93e9e943e9d5e6606a938961fd4d02312afb101b)

11. where is the thing made in blender ? i only see some real life video lmao . great work .
   (ID: 337350fc54133b327ce0d6d9f385f82a2a6738cf)

12. uhhh . what kind of work do you do ?
   (ID: d3491a90d756046acac8c3053e9e99c3e6c231f9)

13. not in the physics based definition of work , but in the common sense , yes . the value of someone ' s work is what people will pay them for it . sure , without construction workers , no one would have a house or office or such , but plenty of people can do construction and an agreed upon value has been placed on that work . a doctor might not sweat nearly as much as a construction worker , but their work has far more value because that is what society has valued it at . if you want to get a bunch of friends together and all become doctors and offer your services for minimum wage , you could disrupt this value , but that isn ' t going to happen .
   (ID: b650c9c531ec58d468c7c1fc9b7083efc4cbca9c)

14. so people who earn great wealth should not be able to pass that on to their kids ? isn ' t that one of the main reasons we work so hard , to make a better life for our kids ?
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

15. that  s a lot of guys ! why did it take so long to work ?
   (ID: 472de55a2855849453179c0ccb5234c4ea9d1192)

16. daily life is boring unfortunately lol if you want to be productive you gotta do the boring crap before it needs to be done
   (ID: 238316960c030f561912bd63e9f572a4170f991b)

17. damn . i took four days off once . it was supposed to be five but my boss made me work one of those days .
   (ID: 24d2489761902de9148fe06d43ec8d7e34c8e35b)

18. the majority of us are proud of you ! because a dream home is worth it . that ' s why you save up and work hard , to get the things you want . you ' d want to have a nice comfortable life outside of work hence the dream home lol .
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)
