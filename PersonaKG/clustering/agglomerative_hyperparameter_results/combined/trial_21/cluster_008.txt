7. that is what is going on here . big company wants to make sure each termination is bulletproof so nothing comes back . i am glad you understand my view that he is not a good cultural fit . he makes me cringe with every customer interaction and i don ' t have the time to stand by him constantly and go through what is right and wrong . it seems to go in one ear and out of other . i think the whole outfit would be much more credible if we didn ' t continue to have him on board .

12. that ' s good ! when i say as an avid moviegoer , i mean that the encroaching on space maneuver would annoy me even if it was an agreed upon date just because it can be distracting  if i go to the movies , i want to watch the movie . but i ' m glad he ' s found someone . he can ' t be faulted for explicitly being told it was a date . the virtue of it being valentine ' s day though isn ' t a defense i would hold up in court though . how did you end up liking deadpool ? did you see the second one ? do you have any thoughts about once upon a deadpool ?
