14. i agree with you on the de clawing . i don  t know where you live , but in most places in the us you can  t just let your cat outside . they can get struck by a car , or lost . perhaps if you lived in the countryside you can let it roam with less risk . why buy the cat if you  re just going to let it roam like a stray ?
