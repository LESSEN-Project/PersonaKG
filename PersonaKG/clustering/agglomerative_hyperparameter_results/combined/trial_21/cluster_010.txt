16. you  ve been  insanely in love with  a girl you  ve talked to once and have seen digit times in total ? no offense but i think you need a reality check . based on what you  ve said there  s really no evidence to suggest she likes you so i  m wondering why you  re so certain she does ? there  s no harm in approaching her , but you need to keep it at a casual level , perhaps ask her out to get to know each other . also try to realize that you aren  t in love with her because that  s honestly weird to say .

20. without being able to see your knives and what level of smithing you have achieved its difficult to tell you where to go . if you want to make your knives a bit more artistic you could try making and pop them on the end of your knives . the world is your oyster if you want to start making things like that because you could equally do , or if you are happy rocking out that then you could try and that gives you the chance to try out the many amazing that you can do .
