   (ID: 6710bef520e10a3963d2983d4b36ef411e442f22)

7. no , in normal  raids you have a lot more personal responsibility . you can ' t just afk through the fights . it is a helluva lot more fun than lfr . you should try playing each of those specs through lfr a few times . get a feel for how you ' d perform in a large group setting . lfr might not be " real " raiding but it ' s close enough to give you an idea . tanaan , lfr and mythic dungeons can get you into normal raids easily , then from there you ' ll go to heroic and mythic raids , ofc . race only matters if you ' re going for extreme feats like world first . play what you want to stare at for hours on end .

11. but what you dont understand is the reward that epic gives for you for the grind . were not selfish and clearly youre angry that you cant play as much . but youre not gonna play digit hrs a week to get omega after digit weeks . thats not how it works . you need to put time into the battle pass . say , you go to work , part time whatever . you dont enjoy the work you do , but at the end of the month you get a paycheck . its the same with fortnite .
   (ID: 41fc1b2c09d5a16a25f120edde55b2a6e2e54e29)
