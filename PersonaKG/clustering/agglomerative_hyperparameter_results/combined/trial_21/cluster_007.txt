12. maybe it ' s just because i have a bad sense of smell due to allergies and other stuff , but from experience i think the tournament smelle memes are a lot more joke than truth . any group of human beings being together for several hours will have a smell . but it isn ' t that bad or anything . i think how bad it is at tournaments is quite overblown . then again i don ' t think gyms smell that bad either . it ' s just not something that bothers me i guess .

18. wow , what assholes . " the people you love " don ' t sound very loving .   x200b  listen , it ' s much better to have a great personality than looks . any day of the week . i don ' t want to date a model , i want to date someone who makes my life fun . some people are severely shallow , and don ' t worry , it ' ll end up biting them in the ass one day . just because some awful people have told you that you are not attractive , doesn ' t actually mean shit  because attractiveness is basically opinion  everyone ' s got a different one .   x200b  if i was you , i ' d call out and cut out everyone who said anything negative about you or your appearance .
