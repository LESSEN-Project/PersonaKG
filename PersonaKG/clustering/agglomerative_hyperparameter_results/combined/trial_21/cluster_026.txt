4. clearly , i know what it is . even the origins of the freemasons . but here is my question . which was spawned by this being the first time i ' ve ever seen a manual to rituals of a freemason . why isn ' t religious literature like the bible , the koran , etc . kept in secret  in private like the freemason ' s manuel is ?

   (ID: 564c5b4efd54586fbf212727e2071f5ddadabb82)

19. in what way was it clear that he had assistants feeding him information ? i ' ve never seen his live show but i know he has been under intense media scrutiny for his entire career . if he was cheating in this way i can ' t help but feel he would have been publicly busted for it .
