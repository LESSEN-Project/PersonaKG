1. the catholics get more press time because they are the biggest , but you ' d have to agree that the most corrupt are those " god wants you all to buy me a private jet " types .
   (ID: d8e39e092041fc01f24bedce425d10f55bd2a764)

2. i agree we are all waluigi , but he would be better off if he didn  t have mario or luigi stealing his spotlight . waluigi is more than capable of being his own man , but he doesn  t . you see the key to his personality is that he stands out so much , and at the same time fits in so well

   (ID: b8a837337ecbafd4a4c170d8fad76bd3de102f09)

7. i agree with this . it is impossible to tell someone how they should feel about themselves . but for whatever it ' s worth let me say i imagine you make most men horny . i hope you get what you need from the labiaplasty .
   (ID: 05dea10a374f0f09c767062f0a3d0b51b6d20b9d)

12. i agree with you on the prevention , but what if it fails ? what if it  s a complete accident that could not have been prevented without having sex ? and about the life , i somewhat agree , but most people who do have an abortion do end up feeling awful afterwards and feeling like they did kill someone .
   (ID: d53ad0bccb6d6f62bf1a4957708759d7b446498b)
