   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

3. only slightly sarcastic . it annoys me when people use obscure acronyms without explanation and expects everyone else to know what they mean . this is reddit . you have a digit , digit character limit on your comment , and it ' s basic common courtesy to make your comments legible . if you ' re going to use an acronym , at the very least you should explain what it means . i honestly have no idea what those acronyms above mean . i don ' t have regular interactions with the police , i don ' t work for the police , and google is pretty shit at figuring these things out because acronyms can mean whatever you want them to mean without context .

   (ID: 109fa004cbb85f6a703624f8b4393d7d7d685509)

9. it can be frustrating when people use depression to excuse all their failings . as someone who myself is in constant battle with mental health , i know as soon as i use it as an excuse it  s game over for me . i  ll join the other failed victims . so many amazing people who succeed in spite of depression

   (ID: ab38d3f31156c0cca1babe826c83025e8694eca2)

12. shadow assault is unquestionably the least desirable . it ' s not a ' bad ' , heroic in reality , vp is just fantastic . most of the other less than desirable heroics i can think of niche use for , but that ' s the most difficult one . the other two that come to mind are rain of chaos which is decent for zoning during a push , and mind control can be used for picks in some cases . i wouldn ' t recommend picking them most of the time , but you can come up with situations where they are pretty decent . abby ' s construct blanking out on the name , is good and bad in so far that if not stopped it can do a lot of damage . it limits his team  fight potential though , so unless your team can compensate in some other ways it can be difficult to use properly . it has high potential though , and under the right circumstances is arguably superior .

   (ID: 4beccb79954eaf4ba6b69b6ac31b148b48f4f579)

   (ID: f8d48136e1ccbc739d4b7fb8db1e8f668422b145)

17. jerry ? is that some kind of slang for moon  sex or something ? can you use it in a sentence ? is it " i ' ll do you in the jerry " or " turn around and let ' s jerry " or what ?
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)
