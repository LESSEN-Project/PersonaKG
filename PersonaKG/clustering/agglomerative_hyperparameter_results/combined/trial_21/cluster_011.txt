--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 95

1. because when hes texting me and being too nice to me , i remind him how much i hate him . i also send him random hate messages . but i ' m getting better at not doing that .
   (ID: 91dc65ba6eef536f17becface16989de7f988dce)

2. i  m probably going to get downvoted to hell from this but i hate seeing these automod posts in some subs when they are at the top of every post . i mean i get it , trying to get the rules across , but i hate having to scroll down farther to see the next comments . especially ones like this that have no real meaning .
   (ID: 5042e4f4cf4f00f86836211d30b97922c92f0b46)

3. . let people do what they want to do unless they are not really harming others . i do not think most of the christians spread hate against the other people . what do you gain if you deny god ?
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

4. you wont get charged with a hate crime . that ' s something he cant dictate anyway , only the prosecutors office can and i doubt this will go that far at all as long as there was no damage .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

5. wellllll . i get their side . how many times have you told a christian that the phrase  hate the sin , love the sinner  is cruel and not showing of love or compassion ? what your suggesting is the same thing , we can  t say it  s wrong for them to do it but right for us . i  m not a christian hater . but if i find out you  re a christian  my view of you immediately changes and whether or not we can remain friends comes to mind .
   (ID: f18b19a52bbf1505af84d01563a51626d4ae363f)

6. well , i don ' t hate pugs , they are not responsible for it . but i do hate that humans made something like that .
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

7. i hate such mis direction . a movie should be like fight club with subtle clues all around place . maybe its just my preference .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

8. no way ! i grew up on the prequels so i have the nostalgia goggles going on . that being said , i rewatched them last year after years of not seeing them and view them differently now . i like the phantom menace , but still think jar jar and anakin significantly make the movie worse . i do hate that the actors suffered immensely after the film but that doesn  t change that their movie parts sucked .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

9. depends on how patriotic you are . for example , there ' s some people who live here who hate america , and are ashamed of it . on the other hand , there ' s people who would die for this country , and get happy  teary eyed when they hear the national anthem .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

10. i hate how people think that it ' s a woman ' s job to be the one who does housework . in a perfect relationship yes , i know there ' s no such thing both the man and woman do equal parts of the housework .
   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

11. i hate this baseball team sometimes not really i actually love them but they piss me off
   (ID: 3e906e06d59fb5c2993270f0b4efed5b9ab122f7)

12. being judgmental of others in basic ways , like what they are wearing or who they are in a relationship with . i hate it so much when other people do it but actively notice and stop myself doing it in my own head .
   (ID: e8fea87ced4a86b7ba9c50ae33cf5b3dda99af88)

13. thank you . i was a bit nervous that i would insult someone as these terms are so loaded . i would hate to demean anyone .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

14. well there are very few black people , and we use it to refer to our other brown friends . and yes , it id illegal , since we do have hate speech laws
   (ID: 8a0d7d262d95d9c10d914ff3b70f342e066aee23)

15. harassment is indeed illegal . just wanted to point out that we shouldn ' t hate on people who simply states their dislike of the lgbtq community , as that is what homophobes wants us to do so they can have an excuse to harass us .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

16. as much as i hate homophobia as a bi person , we have to remember that people are entitled to their own opinions through freedom of speech , even homophobes . it crosses the line however if there is threats of violence involved .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

17. as fucked up as a situation that is the only person suffering right now is you because of that hatred . find something to take your frustration out of course within the realms of the law . then let go of that anger and forget them . enjoy your life . it is far too short for hate . that  s just me though .
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

18. its selfish to pity or hate yourself , for people you maybe didn  t even met yet , you gotta be grateful for what you have since lots of people all over the world lacks it
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

19. because deep down we hate ourselves and we would rather suffer than enjoy the good stuff , so we ruin it ourselves for ourselves .
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

20. well , im sorry you feel that way . hate is a strong word reserved for people that truly earned it . i can dislike opinions , but regardless of what you think i dont hate anyone just based off of social status , ideals or looks . again , you can believe what you want , maybe im not as good at articulating my thoughts as well as some of you are , but i dont needlessly hate anyone . theres no reason to come in with so much hostility with every post you make .
