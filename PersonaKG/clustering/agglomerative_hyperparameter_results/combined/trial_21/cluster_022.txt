2. this is gonna sound crazy , but . what if winning this tournament is a bad thing for germany ? because it doesn ' t show them where they would need to improve on the pitch for next year ? scolari didn ' t make any changes for brazil after digit . maybe i ' m talking out of my ass .
   (ID: 3fb1292a0bd26711d797fe1a61e6229794c21b68)

3. dude . i thought the exact same thing . but really it ' s a convoluted ploy by the government to make me confused .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

4. yeah but the way naruto is handled i cant really see a make your legend without having someone really convince him cause every game is true to the story so far and are focused on the big named characters who we have seen do full fights . also i think the issue is the workload a game like that will drop on him to ensure the games gets all the information it needs for jutsu , clans , nations , etc . ugh i ' m making too many points , uh simple explanation is he would need to make a lore for naruto , where as dragonball creator has a full lore for dbz there really isn ' t much plot holes and missing information to detriment a full game like that .
   (ID: 9d6cadbef277b68098e82945a77678dbb2a079c6)

5. its nice to here all those things . i could give you one advice for creating memes dough . have you heard of meme generator before ? its a mobile app for free with all sorts of meme templates and lots of customizability . the great thing is if you are not home you still can make a meme on the go ! that is atleast what i always do and i can ' t recommend it enough . still thanks for all the support dough , it has been kinda hard making memes lately because i have a sorta writers block . you may have noticed that i upload daily which i dont recommend . so its always nice to hear nice things like that
   (ID: d650356549ff32c6bfb797b13c80b5a0d715da36)

6. great video good audio . i have nothing to improve about the video . only the intro is very generic . if i where you i  d make a new one . that  s a little bit more original or maybe skip an intro . still great video . if you go on with this quality you  ll get pretty far with your channel
   (ID: 4ae54d4dcad6354406284af9bc07ffc708ce92a2)

7. and by taking these other people into consideration you make a problem where no problem was . let them be what they want , not victims .
   (ID: 9425493e0ea7469367495f8e5947330e536cafa9)

8. i  ve been doing it with my husband for almost digit years now and there  s still some discomfort when it sticks it in . keep it super wet . i  ve gotten to the point where i let that discomfort make me aggressive , if that makes sense . it makes it even hotter hahaha
   (ID: 80bb9445ee518d7503eeef1b2c418d38a6e936e9)

9. yeah , kraus make some weird stuff . if you think theyre neat , check out some old altmans faucets . i think altmans closed the buisness though , so they ' re not made anymore .
   (ID: 40f1dd99755dca159ccdbdacafea183ed0a104cd)

10. i want to make it . so pretty ok  hand
   (ID: b301c9554f2e76b5eecf80851921ba7c198de59c)

11. shark . i ' m more likely to survive . crocs kill quickly , a shark will most likely just take a bite and move on once it realizes humans don ' t taste good .

12. 25k is all you make ? that sucks .
   (ID: aaee7c28c6f1f83a427cf3dccf635bb78656a19d)

13. well i always walk into a room with my head held high and with purpose so i start off looking like i belong  have confidence . really watch how you present yourself , use your body language to exude confidence . one thing i try to do but is so hard is to make eye contact when speaking with others . when interacting with people , i try to stand still and not fidget with random shit like my hair , phone or whatever because that comes across as being anxious . one thing i do which isn  t the greatest is i act cocky and borderline conceded . it makes me feel better and people who know me know that i  m not being serious . but sometimes you really do start becoming this person you  re channeling .
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

14. remembering that alcohol does work for it ' s intended purpose . it does make me forget problems and it does make me relax . it ' s hard knowing there ' s a bottle that can do that . almost like a magic potion . fortunately i ' m now aware that the consequences when i drink far outweigh the benefits .
   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

15. i just make a digit minute long video of me taking a shit
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

16. used to work at tb . changing your order to only beans or fresco style is super easy and employee are supposed to make your food however you want it . the only issue i ' d say is that when there are a lot of changes on multiple items during a rush it can get overlooked on the food makers ' order screens and you might get something you didn ' t want or not get something you wanted . food makers learn to make the items a specific way and it can be difficult to alter what is actually just memorized movements . i was never bothered about people asking to change the ingredients in the digit years i was there .

17. they couldn ' t make up anything so they either threatened me or rewarded me .
   (ID: 42d20fb8523115a55130d58a232603b846ad13a0)

18. it sounds cliche and like a instagram " quote " but being single is so much better than being in a relationship that ' s not healthy . you really have to see that you pretty much are in a relationship while you ' re technically single . that relationship is with yourself . that is the most important relationship you will ever have . no one else can " make " you happy . that ' s an internal job . everything else is just a bonus . good for you for leaving that behind .
   (ID: d785eda10245445843c3355a0710d262b0d65bb9)

19. makes sense . just funny how all ' s i did was make an observation which is most likely correct and instead of either acknowledging it , or moving on , they have to be so salty for some reason .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

20. i know ! it would have been so much better to have stuck with the hendrix . i can only imagine they changed it because they couldn ' t find anyone to make it work .
