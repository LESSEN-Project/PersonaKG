1. if it hurts someone , it ' s wrong . just the golden moral rule . you know , general moral principles are same for all people . anyway , i don ' t need a god watching me to understand that murder or rape is wrong and helping people and making them feel better is right . make love not war .  . also my atheism helps me easily accept some progressive modern trends  i support lgbt rights , feminism and sexual education , for example , while these things are considered as sins in many religions . also , it ' s interesting , i read somewhere , that there ' s a bigger percentage of religious people in prison that in the society . i don ' t remember the numbers exactly , but it ' s probably about digit , digit  atheists among the prisoners and digit  in general in the us

   (ID: 44eba9a0cf089ec615a77db5d42a2c01b63cb259)

6. because most people know that they can just choose to ignore things that don ' t interest them . i suggest you work on that , for your own sanity .
   (ID: 74058c90ada3aae7a59703064acbf3ced38f3681)
