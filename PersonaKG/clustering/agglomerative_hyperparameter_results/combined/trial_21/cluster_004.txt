   (ID: 6eec77fe98b9dc85ec1e5e7edc37cdb415794719)

2. in all fairness , sometimes it works out for people to hire someone to assemble it , especially if they ' ve got multiple complicated pieces . it might take an inexperienced person with no tools a day or two of frustration and sore hands to finish , when they ' d rather take only half a day off work , and spend a day ' s wages paying someone else to put it together in a few hours . my dad assembles furniture for a living , he charges  digit   hr when it ' s just him digit  digit   hr if he takes one of his kids to help , though a lot of that is to cover expenses and taxes for running his own business . so i ' m glad there are lazy people .

3. we saw a definite and dramatic shift in behavior in our first child just after a vaccination day , starting with 105f fever . what we have done with our kids since then is not to stop vaccinating , but to attenuate the schedule so that they are not getting many vaccines in one day and shocking their system . also when vaccines can be obtained individually as opposed to a combination shot , we go that route . our pediatrician is one of the best in the area and is totally on board . we didn ' t have the same occurrence since that first event , but obviously that doesn ' t prove causality .

6. nothing beats the taste of horse on cup day . my family has been eating horses on cup day for years now . i ' m glad you mentioned dogs  we should make a day when we can eat dogs as well . i don ' t think we should race cats though , unless we gave them lots of steroids so they got big enough that small children could ride them . do you think we could eat the cats ? i don ' t think they would taste too good when they ' re roided up though .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)
