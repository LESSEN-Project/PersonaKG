5. listen if you really want some advice . you have to just dive in a go for it . imagine how you would walk up to a guy and talk to him for the first time . it ' s the exact same thing . so pick a target and tell yourself you are going to go talk to that girl then count down from digit in you head and as soon as you hit zero your feet better start moving you otherwise it ' s just not going to happen . be prepared for it to go terribly a whole bunch of times . nothing wrong with that . pick a new target count down from digit and start again .

7. it loses it ' s bodily autonomy when it loses it ' s body . who are you to decide who ' s life is worth living ? i don ' t want women to have to suffer through an unwanted pregnancy . but i have to go with the lesser of two evils . here ' s a hypothetical thought experiment . you enter a room with a man and a baby . then the man pulls out a gun . he tells you that one of two things will happen . either you will go to prison for nine months , or he will shoot the baby in the face . what do you choose ? you could decide that you should not be imprisoned for the sake of someone else . why should it be your responsibility ? but i think it is clear that the morally right thing to do is to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves . even if you have to sacrifice of yourself for that person . i think a truly good person would willingly put their life at risk for an innocent human life .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

18. well , i would think it ' s probably a safe guess with that attitude that you weren ' t working in digit , digit , or digit , i was . i ' ve seen people lose their jobs , homes and even commit suicide because they couldn ' t find a job . i ' m not saying it ' s not right to quit for a better opportunity , i am saying to do it the right way and not to burn a bridge you may need to walk back over again one day . with the last digit years of the largest expansion of the economy since wwii , you probably haven ' t experienced that yet . you will soon .
