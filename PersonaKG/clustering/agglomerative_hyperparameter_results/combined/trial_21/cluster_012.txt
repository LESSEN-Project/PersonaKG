11. honestly i think the complaints about settings are overblown . sure , add a search feature for finding things even more quickly that ' s fine , but i don ' t know what jagex are supposed to do about it when people can ' t find the settings for combat experience when you ' ve got digit categories , one labelled skills and the other combat and both point to the same interface . if it ' s really taking you that long to find where combat experience in a list that literally says combat  experience i don ' t think there ' s much jagex can do to help you . people need to understand some games have a lot of options and that it ' s worth taking a few minutes to go through and see what ' s available rather than never delving into them . maybe if people really want a hand holding interface they should offer a streamlined  simplified bare bones with a toggle option for advanced settings as to not scare off new players .

14. glad you made it to he other side . you know what  s weird ? i still , at times , enjoy listening to christian music . not because my beliefs are the same , but part nostalgia , part good emotions , part because i don  t have an issue with a  higher power  that i probably don  t believe in . i  ve decided to just not analyze and do what i want . i don  t have to have a good reason . zany  face
