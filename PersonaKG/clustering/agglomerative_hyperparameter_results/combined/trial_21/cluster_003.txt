17. and back to your original premise , i believe that governments are not the answer . i see large central governments are the forces that hinder growth and human potential . i look at the current western governments and all the rules and regulations , paperwork bureaucracy covered in red tape and piles of waste  and , more importantly , the cousins and cronies who suck off the tit of the people ' s hard work . i think governments should be limited in their tasks and duties . i view the constitution as a contract to the citizens that clearly spells out the limits of governmental reach . the larger question , though , is why communism ? why do you believe that an overwhelming state structure is the way to go ? what appeals to you that you think it is the best system , especially with so many failures throughout history ?
