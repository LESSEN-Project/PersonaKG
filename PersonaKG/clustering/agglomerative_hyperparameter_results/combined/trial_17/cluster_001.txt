7. don ' t try to act it was intentional or that you were serious . just laugh in a way , that indicates that you know you just did something awkward . thats how you show confidence and the ability to laugh about yourself . but you still need to stand your ground , if your awkward moment becomes a permanent joke about you . but the absolute worst thing you can do ist to become the aggressor , if you try to bring the attention to somebody else , by beeing an asshole , you show everybody your low self esteem and bad character .

   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

15. merch is not a fanbase , but again my point about the underlying story has to make some sense to you . also america is obsessed with junk media , not all but the majority pushes this fanbase towards fringe . i apologise to those who didn ' t get that . if you have ever looked at tik tok or whatever for more than digit minutes you are probably going to still be offended . also just being extra anal , those two stores do nothing but by merch for new games so i would be curious how well kh sells compared to something for scale . i ' m not doubting it did well , just curious .
