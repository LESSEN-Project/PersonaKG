   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

2. in that case , reading book , playing football and all other entertaintment activities are proven waste of time . all off them try to make you have more fun , with some bad and good twists . playing video games make your eye  hand senses better while having bad sides too like raditation . while book makes you more cultured , it can make your eye  s lose its efficency like mine . some just look better to others because it looks pretty much more nerd  ish . and interesting enough by the great science video games are one of the most cheap activities with a decent computer .
