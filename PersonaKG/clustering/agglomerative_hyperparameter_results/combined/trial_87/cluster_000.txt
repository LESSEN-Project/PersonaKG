   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

2. i am i suppose . i just think it  s a bit disrespectful in the first instance to post pictures of someone that to me look to be taken with their knowledge , for the internet then to judge whether or not she  s healthy . she might be perfectly healthy for all we know . i believe there  s an element of people using health as a means to justifying their resentment .
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

3. i am completely satisfied . the three issues i run into when discussing the ending  general conclusion of lost with other people are thus  digit they don ' t realize what was already explained . such as , " we still don ' t know why there were polar bears there . yes , we do . digit they don ' t understand the ending . this i feel bad about , because i end up sounding like i think they are stupid for not getting it . but for some reason it requires a lot of explaining for some folks . digit they wanted a very simple , solid easy to digest ending . then i turn and say , " you were okay with the time traveling island , but the ending is too ' out there ' for you "
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

11. my thoughts on them , while not having seen them , is that i probably won ' t watch them . documentaries are supposed to be even  handed approaches to complex situations , but often end up being propaganda with a little egalitarian flavor . i have absolutely nothing against vegetarianism or veganism or pescatarianism or whatever , just documentaries with a mission .
   (ID: df28c2a39b633ca418192316a199668289382292)

12. i know it ' s perhaps a " you snooze you lose " but lately got spoilers it ' s exactly that . i mean i understand if someone doesn ' t want to get spoiled the weekly episode if he can ' t watch it right away , but if you didn ' t start watching by now you can ' t expect to browse around the internet without encountering some spoilers on way or another considering the popularity of the show , even in real life there ' s not one week without me hearing some got reference at work or whatever . the best way to go at it would be to binge watch the shit out of shit asap over the weekends and there you go , no more worries .
   (ID: a80b8bc356414690d849369456d68876c95d5518)

13. I'm interested in pets and animals.
   (ID: c6e395c03fa0151554baed67a84968066bfa9cf3)

14. why is money required to date ? do some free activity . go for a walk , watch a movie at home , cook dinner together , play a board  card game . do free stuff . also if you only have digit dollars with no means of making more , dating shouldn ' t be your highest priority . good luck op .
