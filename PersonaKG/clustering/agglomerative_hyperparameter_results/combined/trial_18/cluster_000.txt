3. you people will never stop trump . how can you people expect to stop trump if you people refuse to argue against his policies ? all i see is a bunch of people complaining about how " mean " trump is . the washington post lost their access to trump events because the majority of the articles they put out on trump have nothing to do with his policies and instead they just focus on trying to get the reader to become irrationally emotional so they can guide them into hating trump . maga

10. are you taking about trails in the sky digit or trails of cold steel digit because the english release of sky digit came out last year and the japanese release of cold steel digit came out last year and they usually take a couple of years to be translated . you can definitely start playing cold steel digit without having played any in the trails in the sky series . the first sky is only  digit at the moment but the other two are still somewhat expensive , by my standards at least . i haven ' t actually played the third sky , but i think the story is only somewhat related to digit and digit , in that it has the same characters but runs somewhat parallel to the story of digit and digit , which is a continuous story .

18. hunters do not ask anyone else to adopt thier morals . hunters are not compelled to kill by tenet but by choice , there are plenty of times i ' ve sat in a blind had a few beers and never touched my bow as deer wandered by . i can say that i didn ' t even try to kill anything today when i get back to the lodge and no one will say that i ' m not longer a hunter . my bet is if you say to a group of vegans that you just a little bacon today or a bit of scrambled eggs this morning the reaction will not be as favorable .
