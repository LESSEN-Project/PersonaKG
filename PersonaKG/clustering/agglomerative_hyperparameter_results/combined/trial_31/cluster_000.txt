18. repost but ok anyone other than one friend i mentioned in this story i dont know where to start . i was a weird kid had very few friends i transferred to a prepatory school where i was very joyful and joined a lot of events . i was stupid back then i had an less than the average toddlers intelligence made friends in a weird way as in not how you should ' ve interacted with complete strangers . i had fights and i was given too many chances to improve myself , like everybody is keeping me at easy mode even if i wanted to go normal . i switched to a public school because she was too worried abiut how to balance work and me the public school was a lot closer to where she worked . out of nowhere my social anxieties hit me like a truck , i didn ' t know anyone nor have any idea on what topic to start a conversation . then i thought that i should be myself and that is when everything went down f    ing hill . i did tons of weird a      t like i was autistic and stuff . my grades , my sanity and my social status suffered like hell i dropped like a bomb in through grand canyon , deeper and lower than i expected at fifth grade i never knew that it hit me like a baseball bat that i had depression , earlier than the normal basis like about digit  digit but the more i didn ' t know i had this the more it grew and affected medepression at my years was really uncommon i literally and socially closed doors to my few friend that i had . i only had one he stuck to me even i was socially and mentally weird he still still stuck with me . after a year of hell we finally graduated i never wanted to have any photos of my and my classmates but they still forced me to do it and bailed as soon as the camera flashed . i don ' t want anyone to know who i am and have any memory of me because it would be a waste of time and brain cells . me and my friend went to the same prepatory school from elementary to senior students . at the first day i made the god damn worst first impression of my life , the stupidest thing to imagine and it left my all  so  broken mind more broken than before then those boken peices were broken into more broken peices the more the year went on . i was bullied , humiliated , and teased in front of me and behind my back . the amount of sanity that i have left in my crippling mind and body was no more than a pile of dust . the amount bloodshed i wanted to do in those times , the murderous intent , the temptation to kill and torture them like they did to me . after the third period of my school i didn ' t show that much amount emotion just to hide the temptation to kill , my friend kept checking on me like i mattered the more he checked on me the less i wanted to torture someone . the bloodlust went away like it was a gentle breeze , but the depression didn ' t , from that day froward i wanted to make people happy even if it mean ' t to destroy of whats left of my reputation , the already destroyed mind of a person trying to make others happy despite the pain it felt , making them happy and having depression balanced each other out . my friend inspired me to be a better person by not verbally saying it but by showing it to me . thank you  from    grinning  face  with  smiling  eyesloudly  crying  face
