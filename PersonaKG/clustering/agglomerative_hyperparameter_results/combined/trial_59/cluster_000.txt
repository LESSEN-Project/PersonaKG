2. your comment history is just full of " very epic indeed " and f
   (ID: db1ffea2a957f19bfc0fffdbd89a6d65be91fd5c)

3. i have a very simple solution , use the dark ages v20 rules , it steamlines combat , i also have a couple house rules for combat . have your turn planned ahead of time . know what you want to do , or have your questions ready . feel free to converse with other pcs in between turns to coordinate . have your dice ready and roll fast . this is the most important advice i can give you about combat stop trying to make it challenging . just stop . stop trying to challenge the combat character every time you ' re in combat . he wanted to murder things , let him murder things , if he ' s able to slaughter ghouls with relative ease , let him do it , it doesn ' t need to be challenging unless he wants it to be , in which case it ' s far more effective to use single strong enemies than multiple weaker ones . making every single combat life or death , an insane challenge , etc . is unrealistic and gets grindy very quickly . use combat as a way to tell a story , not as a ' we need a combat ' scene . i would need to know the specifics of the combat pc in question before giving you any advice tho .

7. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .
   (ID: 4422c1db26c9be5bec35694a448a490c2761d985)

8. i just realised that everyone isn ' t perfect you know ? there ' s gonna be lots of people who ' ll come in your life and try to bring you down . hey sometimes you might even allow it , but eventually you ' ll have to learn to make goals to better yourself , cut those people off , and become a better person . only you can control how your life and self worth .
