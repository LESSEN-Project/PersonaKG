1. my mom explained it to me this way . santa is the spirit of the season . everyone is everyone else ' s santa . if you don ' t believe in the spirit of the holiday then you ' re killing the holiday .
   (ID: 2ce8587266f0888bb10672ccf8a7be1bc6c3f0d2)

2. i don  t understand this aversion to violence that you have . take electrical cars for instance , they  ve been around for decades and the only reason their use is not widespread is because of the influence of the car , oil , and car maintenance lobbies . cars cause , what , digit , digit  digit , digit deaths in the us yearly . is this not structural violence on a mass scale ? and how about if we were to apply this to big farming . syngenta , conagra , cargill , and monsanto now run all pretty much digit  of food production in the us . this has wreaked havoc on small family run farming operations as thousands of families have had to close their farms . is this not another example of structural violence ? there is no way to achieve the things you want  democratically  or without violence . the only way to achieve the things you want is to brutally and violently repress the ruling class , namely the purveyors of capital formation and accumulation within the transnational corporations . the transnational corporations will never relinquish their power and wealth willingly . to believe so amounts to liberal idealism .

3. i believe a year and like digit months or so
   (ID: d9e6e1ecc09dc9affbcc8ccb0191ff241370a782)

4. and back to your original premise , i believe that governments are not the answer . i see large central governments are the forces that hinder growth and human potential . i look at the current western governments and all the rules and regulations , paperwork bureaucracy covered in red tape and piles of waste  and , more importantly , the cousins and cronies who suck off the tit of the people ' s hard work . i think governments should be limited in their tasks and duties . i view the constitution as a contract to the citizens that clearly spells out the limits of governmental reach . the larger question , though , is why communism ? why do you believe that an overwhelming state structure is the way to go ? what appeals to you that you think it is the best system , especially with so many failures throughout history ?

5. well , i don ' t go around telling everyone i don ' t believe in the bible and all that nonsense . and i believe there are many people like me . it ' s easier to say nothiing most of the time unless confronted by one of those crazy people who want to send you to hell because you don ' t believe exactly like they do .
   (ID: fca46720f9aa154a0559b1e4d2d28cb0df46b00a)

6. i like how you have nothing to do in your life except type insanely long answers to a random persons question . does it honestly matter to you what i think and believe in ?
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

7. if you are connected to internet i believe you get regular drops the only non tradable drops possible are handed out gold wrench for example which don ' t appear at this time , and achievements
   (ID: 5a485308ca6e36eb17d7b0fc321fcf7695f3af53)

8. grew up educated not to believe such nonsense , got into a relationship where i was unhappy that we don ' t have the same views on a lot of aspects . somehow it worked and after a few years i realised that we complete each other  all we need to do is to talk
   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

9. yeah i  ve heard of that before , where i live it  s the freshmen trying to get seniors , but i guess it  s not that hard to believe basically putting on bets to see if you can sleep with someone
   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

10. it ' s about the dust bowl . especially if you ' re from the states , it ' s worth a read . it ' s hard to believe this happened not that long ago . pretty horrific stuff .

11. throughout my childhood and teenage life , my dad would bash on me and the me i ' m a nobody , i ' ll never amount to anything , to the point where i would believe him and think of myself as nothing , i tried real hard to make him like me , up untill i was digit when i stopped caring . figured it was a lost cause .
   (ID: 95f6209d0c49920f0309625c4cec2ea88e4ae469)

12. well i believe in god but like you , i can ' t stand fundamentalists like the woman you describe . they tell me i ' m going to hell too , and i laugh . just can ' t win . on the other hand , if you are an atheist , then you don ' t believe in either heaven or hell . so her telling you you ' re going to hell is like someone telling you canada is never going to win the super bowl . i wouldn ' t let it worry you . if want to get snarky , then remind her , hell is for atheists , and for people who fail to convince atheists to believe in god . guess i ' ll be seeing you there !
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

13. just use her phone once in awhile because yours is across the room or whatever . listen to what she says and don ' t assume she meant something a different and less sneaky  protective way . ask you mutual friends in private what they think , tell them your concerns . most of all , believe your gut and don ' t stick around for evidence of wrong doing . but do have a serious discussion about trust before you leave . remember , people with nothing to hide , hide nothing
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

14. not a great living but definitely a lot better . you do realize that mose of europe believes in a livable wage , not a minimum at least in the uk i know they do . i believe you are the one with a skewed perception . you grow up hearing " america number digit " so much that you believe it . since you like to throw your own heat , allow me to retort . from your post history i ' d assume you lack a level of empathy considering you told one person they are in america because nobody else would hire them , and your first comment ever is able not being able to love your own child because it ' s disabled . if you want to continue to sling mud at my heritage and mentality go ahead . i ' m not the one who got offended about a simple joke .
   (ID: 7008f149db59fea91167255eafa8bc84beab0f01)

15. i ' d imagine a vast majority of people attempting to get this skin did it in the first few days of it being released , and we saw zero proof of it being unboxed during a time where most superior packs or packs in general were probably being opened . i ' m less likely to believe it actually existed during that time than i am to believe that they simply waited less than a day before notifying players of an increase . as much as i hate to don a tinfoil hat , it ' s also possible that they purposely delayed the tweet just to make it seem like it was actually obtainable before . if anybody went as far as to take some sort of legal action against them for falsely advertising an item as a possible reward in a virtual lottery , delaying the tweet is one way for them to prove themselves innocent .

16. if you believe that you are fucking retarded . fact .

17. i don  t do anything for men . we believe you
   (ID: 19a9190bb25fd002a6b979a3f72494c6523d8880)

18. maybe push isn ' t the right word . the whole " you can ' t push your belief on me but if you believe in god ur dumb lolol imaginary friend " thing . i guess " be an asshole about " would have been better wording
   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

19. but i need evidence that your ass is fat , i cant possibly believe you without a picture
   (ID: 23df46bdba3eb265d08b02c9ec5f365cf45ae5fd)

20. can you explain how there is more ' opportunity ' than ever , and maybe define what you mean ? i find that very hard to believe .
