3. the vaping itself , actually . all i care about is a device that works . if it works , i ' m happy as a clam . nobody bothers me about vaping . in fact , i get more condescension amongst vapers than smokers . everyone else seems either really interested or just minds their own business .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

4. why do most people always want more ? what is it about some people that they need bigger and better ? maybe it just depends on what makes you feel happy ? people often compare with others but are you really happy if you have a bigger car then the neighbours ? are you happy if you have to work lot of hours and don ' t have much time left to spend on other things ? maybe if the job really makes you happy . for me , i feel happy when i feel the sun , walk in nature , see butterflies or hear birds sing and i am really feeling happy with my husband and our dog . but only you can feel and discover in life what makes you happy . don ' t contain yourself like every other book on the shelf empty pockets will allow a greater sence of wealth  eddie vedder

7. i would never want to measure it because i don ' t want to be either sad or happy about it since making me sad is giving me insecurities about my body and happy might make me cocky no pun intended about it . i am happy with it and it gets the job done well .
