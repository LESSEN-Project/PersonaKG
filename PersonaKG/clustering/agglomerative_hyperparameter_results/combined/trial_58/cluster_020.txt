1. we all screw up and make mistakes . you will make more in your years of driving . just kind of put your hands up and shake them and that kind of acknowledges that you know that you were wrong . it ' s sort of a visual " sorry . he can ' t do anything with your license plate . even in the worst possible case that he could , it ' s his word against yours . it ' s not even worth his time . he probably just let the dust settle . if you ' re on the road , you have to deal with people who make mistakes and assholes alike .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

2. oh no i ' m so sorry to hear that ! what ' s on the agenda ?
   (ID: 339d06087e421a1cf86d695af2a2088546f9dc91)

3. damn , sorry for dissing your favorite show . i didn  t know it meant so much to you .
   (ID: 3a16ba639560d155caf77e9cfc21f6a1df031d4f)

4. i  m sorry i don  t know you or your sister or the situation enough to give you advice that will fix everything . it sounds like you have some remorse over your actions but i have no idea if it  s too much or not enough . i can say a short letter might be the best solution if you think a direct confrontation might make things worse . understand you have no control over other people  s reactions only what you do . focusing on how you feel bad for your actions but also including why you  re angry in a way that focuses on your own feelings may be a good idea .

5. wait . wait , sorry if this is a stupid question but it looked to me like he was dead from the start of the video , are you telling me he was alive through it all ?
   (ID: 20fef7b83cf9ae51924e5491cac2f90901d833e0)

7. sorry to hear that . do you purposely avoid them now ?
   (ID: c502154cdae9232a9351bdc0e55d2030d75a8094)

8. how ever much money you think you need , double it . there ' s always things you didn ' t count on . you may not need all the money but it ' s better safe than sorry .

13. abortion is a difficult topic . on the one hand nobody should be allowed to govern over the life of another . also , i guess adoption could be an option as well . on the other hand , it can be that someone was forcibly impregnated and isn  t ready for the extreme stress of carrying out a child . pregnancy can also interfere with jobs and get you suspended possibly . personally i can understand both sides and don  t really know what to think about this . but hey , these were just a few arguments i came up with on the fly so feel free to add your own . if anything i said is wrong , feel free to correct me . and also , sorry for the poor formatting . i  m on mobile .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

   (ID: ab38d3f31156c0cca1babe826c83025e8694eca2)
