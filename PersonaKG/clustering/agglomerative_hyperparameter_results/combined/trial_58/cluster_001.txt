1. i don ' t subscribe to  getmotivated . i usually just see them on  all . it doesn ' t seem like good  realistic advice digit . digit  of the time .
   (ID: 3b00a7fe72d71c6162850ad66e6322e5d78fb79d)

2. why don ' t you trust yourself ? just get a parts list , post on  buildapc and  pcmasterrace for advice , and once everything looks good , build it . the only scary part about building is how much force you have to physically exert on the mobo at times to make the components slide into place  especially the ram , but everything else is just following instructions from the mobo manual .
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

3. this thing we call life is one big mystery . i dont know if this help but one poem really like is the  man in the glass  youtube  google it . for me , i think its about importance of your own love for yourself . once you have it nothing else matters . even if you are with abeautiful wife etc . it doesntmatter if you dont love  stay true to yourself . discover yourself first man . good things will come your way .
   (ID: 3c4a38138d39bd51556bd7f8a05ba48bf283c7e6)

4. if it was just someone ' s eyes and you immediately start jumping to conclusions they are digit  depressed youd be wrong . but that ' s not what i ' m saying and that ' s not what happened . he literally said he was looking for a reason to kill himself in the title of the post . that combined with physical expression can give us enough information to go ahead and act on the side of caution . if you enjoy looking for tiny cracks in things good for you but what happened in that thread is a really good thing that shows how good humanity and the internet can be . to me it seems ridiculous to try and want to pick it apart for any reason .
   (ID: f46d1bfdfed7fc05bbe39789c092019944471e9d)

5. i ' m not that much stronger than you are uh ? aren ' t you digit or 11k ? modesty is good , but don ' t contemn all that you ' ve already achieved . you are much stronger .
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

6. yeah , me and mine are already starting to think about migrating out . none of us have or want kids , but we ' re looking for places where we can get a dog , have a garage that we can use as shops to make things . so it ' s looking like tacoma might be a good investment for us .
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

7. little house on the prarie , andy griffith show , the waltons . just regular good ol lessons about life . how that you have to struggle and suffer through things sometimes and not have anyone to ' save ' you . and you learn to be a better person because of it .
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

8. that ' s some good shit right there .
   (ID: 79bb0063e4d93ebf3f272c94124194ae51d04a55)

9. yea , i realize that , however , it was pounded into since i was digit . one of the few good things about my father is that he actually gave a damn about the environment . so little me was constantly told to sort the trash and whatnot . it ' s just something i never let go .
   (ID: 5ee4d4a98d2da62835d0e63abf8fe5bbfa95111b)

10. One of my favorite things is good karma.
   (ID: 1ab03d054f341c1ede82c7eb9f871db0a696e44d)

11. glad you made it to he other side . you know what  s weird ? i still , at times , enjoy listening to christian music . not because my beliefs are the same , but part nostalgia , part good emotions , part because i don  t have an issue with a  higher power  that i probably don  t believe in . i  ve decided to just not analyze and do what i want . i don  t have to have a good reason . zany  face
   (ID: f90b0d899acf3c82adaa55fb250d0c7ea9eaeaf3)

12. living  is the hardest thing a person will ever do , nobody knows how their life will play out , people go through good times and hard times . my reason to live is to see what i can achieve in my life .
   (ID: 69878cc2cc3e4fe974feb7f6bf5a69bf75cd4951)

13. you ' re a good egg .
   (ID: 54c02bf73569d6b7f5a88c3d841a214eee1a4d14)

14. now i ' m not gonna downvote just because i completely disagree with you , just could tell you in a couple years there could be some other group of idiots who don ' t even eat vegetables because would also be killing and say everyone should only drink water . whatever your ethics are , good for you , but don ' t try and force them into people .
   (ID: f388f39a9ea47e429d419a3a30153fba53fa1033)

15. what a beauty . good on you !
   (ID: 2d0024ed521b501bfb33f63c06eccfecc2a92cb3)

16. you know what , i kinda like this . if you can clean this up a bit , this style could be good .
   (ID: d298609ba6b9516031b9d0b9bc9217d85ce28f05)

17. any good videos to explain what ' s going on ?
   (ID: 230ce64c825c9de0874b588b6d715819e39e5610)

18. it seems like a lot of the venomous stuff comes from the forums more than reddit probably because we can downvote the garbage away . i won ' t argue about things needing fixed in the game because i don ' t disagree and the frustrations make sense , i just know that a , " good job " from time to time is good for the community as well as the devs , remembering that we generally like each other .
   (ID: 05ea8ab3980e7e9b17e008954c8e6b0d7355612a)

19. i think they screwed up with the character daario naharis in game of thrones . maybe not the worst casting decision , as huisman does a good job . but they turned what was supposed to be a blue hair gold toothed barbarian into a pretty boy heart throb . come on hbo .
   (ID: faebbe18abd4d1c69e3bb9106178f797255444c5)

20. i like to have a good frame rate digit or digit i play on xbox and i want to see everything , theirs a ton of little details that you need to see to win or play your game correctly
