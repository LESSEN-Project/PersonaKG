5. no you dont actually wish me anything like that do you so quit lying . and those two rump rangers can go make their own baby . the idiot that allowed them to adopt needs to be fired . incarcerated imo . you seem like a very powerless person . i bet you are not very useful to others . you don ' t actually know how things work . don ' t worry , it will come to you as you get older and find out video games arent real .
   (ID: 457d7d37e1181cc932693cd4220e6fbfd564a75d)

6. that ' s probably not google . from what i understand google will start in salt lake city proper first , then west valley . i haven ' t seen anything that says there are plans to go anywhere else yet . my whole neighborhood is having fiber laid right now . i asked a worker and he said it was utopia . i wish it was google , but i ' ll take utopia !
   (ID: 22a043d8284bd8c7c31748b5cc8c8b8efc757df6)

10. it just makes you a shit person . like they would care about that , they ' re cartel members . i think everyone would wish for a quick and painless execution if they somehow got caught , and they probably know that too . by making it the complete opposite it really sends out a clear message , don ' t mess with these guys or you ' ll found yourself tied up in a basement , your body full of drugs to keep you alive longer so you can suffer more , now that ' s enough deterrent .

   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

13. i ' m not well  versed in trek , as i was always more of a wars fan . but spock was my main interest whenever i heard or read about the franchise . it ' s my understanding that he ' s only half  vulcan , but that he still has the option to flip his emotions like a switch , right ? it would seem feelings are internal and emotions are a physical counterpart to that , so either they have feelings all the time , or they can activate both whenever they wish . i think the whole concept is interesting . everyone should opt to be more like spock , because emotions are important for healthy living , but sometimes get in the way when making important decisions .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

14. i have two minutes left before my break is over . i wish i was in bed instead .

17. hello my friend . im sorry that you ' re feeling pain , and i wish that i could share some your burden . but know that you are definitely not alone . everyone gets caught in fear , anxiety , and self doubt from time to time . buddhism is like advance psychology , it will show you the inner workings of your mind , how and why you suffer , and how to end the suffering . have a look at this video  please feel free to pm me anytime you wish to talk to someone , i believe we could learn a lot from one another .
