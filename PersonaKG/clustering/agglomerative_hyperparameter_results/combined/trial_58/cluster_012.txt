4. star wars was the first sci  fi film i ever watched so i think it will always hold a special place in my heart . even though i adore and can speak about it for hours on end , i will admit it  s terribly flawed ahaha . i detest episode digit and hated rogue one but even in saying that , i still can  t take my eyes off the screen . maybe it  s the gross use of cgi in episodes digit  digit and jar jar binks  existence that ruined star wars for many , but i have such an admiration for george lucas and his space opera that i can  t help but love it . after having read a biography about george lucas , i think began to appreciate star wars even more after reading about the tremendous work that went into making it . i also just love the cast in general , i really think that mark hamill has such a sincerity in his character and princess leia and carrie fisher are both inspirations of mine so i think in that way i find the films endearing . so yeah , i could , as i said , go on for longer giving a more in depth reasoning as to what makes star wars something i could ramble on about , but hopefully this is a sufficient answer ahaha .

7. i didn ' t know the feminist movement  its impact was limited to canada . i thought of the arabs too . think long term . forget about walking on the streets , how many of these women have gone topless at home , in front of their own family ? the only bone of contention here is don ' t try and drastically change the social scenario by stating that female breasts are the same as that of a man . they are not . neither in shape , nor in function . sure , she can have the right to do it . but what use is a right if it can ' t be expressed at their own free will without thinking of consequences ? what use is that right if all it does is make you the focus of a sexually driven male mentality ? what use is that accomplishment if you ' re gonna shove it into a closet eventually ? some things , breasts included , are innately feminine . if you ' re gonna argue that it ' s not so and hence we should get equal status about this , i fail to see your point . if you ' re gonna argue that if men can , then women should too  i see it as the ramblings of a incompletely thought out pro  feminist , who has no pride in her feminity nor any respect for the body . have a nice day .

9. lol seriously ? " replace soon . devilsaur will have you set for at least digit months . at least . first off , you must be some sort of total noob if you think raid gear just falls into your lap when you start farming mc  bwl . you can go weeks without getting a piece off a raid boss . i think spending digit  500g on two pieces of gear that you ' ll use for several months is a solid deal and incredibly wise . in fact , i wouldn ' t even want to raid with someone who is so stupid to think digit  hit  digit  crit  74ap is only marginally better than windrunner legguards and pre  buff t1 gloves because simply put , devilsaur is far superior . this isn ' t exactly college level math we ' re dealing with here , you sound like a total moron .

16. i ' ve personally faced violence for being a transman more than once , and i live in a really bigoted place filled with truly awful people . i totally get where you ' re coming from  the point of my comment was actually to point of that transmen face their share of issues with being trans . most commonly , in my experience , misogyny that reduces us down to genitals and the use that men can have for them .
   (ID: 77e0b8c51dfb89ff57bd838b86ee4d78a9fe856f)

17. a preferred pronoun is a misnomer . replace pronoun with name to see what i ' m getting at . your name , whatever it is , isn ' t your preferred name . it ' s just your name . if i call you something else , that ' s incorrect . a person may use different pronouns and names over time . this is still not about preference but accuracy . you use the word obviously but there is nothing obvious about sex or gender . appearance varies culture to culture , person to person . you have no standing to simplify the matter to this degree . but let ' s say you ' re right . you ' re obviously male and we should use male pronouns to talk about you . a trans person doesn ' t necessarily enjoy your privilege of the obvious gender . so that trans person tells you what pronouns to use . how nice ! so why wouldn ' t you use them ? you are not required to use a certain pronoun . nobody can stop you from being an asshole . you have free will .
   (ID: 5146a89965a734a4d1ec9ec9145abae872a4569d)

20. people lying to you about how great they are and how deep and full of significance and meaning their life is . nobody cares about how your grandmother grew tomatoes instilling your love of fresh produce , or how your mother ' s use of seasonings opened up your senses , or your soccer coach touching you filled you with a love of sausage . i just could not remember if i needed digit tbs or digit of flower for a basic roux . please put the recipe at the top and your poorly written life story at the bottom so i can choose to not read with out being annoyed by having to scroll through it .
