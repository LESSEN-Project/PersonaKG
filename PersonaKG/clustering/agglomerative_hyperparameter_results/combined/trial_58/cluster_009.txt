1. were you with your boyfriend when this happened ? i mean with these sorts of things it ' s probably always going to be better if he heard it from you vs someone else , irrelevant of the when or what . your ' friend ' seems toxic af and removing her and ignoring her is probably your best bet . stick to your guns and stay true to yourself . she will most likely continue to spout shit and your shared friends will make a choice for themselves and if you just stick to the facts and don ' t get involved with her shit throwing then the friends who matter won ' t care and the ones who care about her shit don ' t matter .
   (ID: 06080b0d1273cc2321b21dde5865b5c1c5180e56)

2. i mean , that ' s possible . if you ' d regret not asking her out then just ask . worst that happens is that she ' s not interested and you ' re at no different a spot than you already are . try not to think too much about how things could go in the future , because you ' re not there yet . one step at a time .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

12. calm down ? what was not calm about my one sentence ? lmao .  your comments could be less dismissive towards people who do care about the service they ' re paying for . how is it dismissive ? someone said they didn ' t understand why people are ok with it . i said some people , like me , don ' t care . you should stop perceiving things that are not there .  what is there to gain from coming here and saying things like " i don ' t let such trivial things upset me ? you mean explaining my point of view . i guess add it to the list of trivial things that anger you .  cloud saves are purely beneficial , let people care without trying to make yourself feel superior for not wanting them . i never said i was against cloud saves , just that i do not get upset about the few games that do not have them . " just because you don ' t care about a feature doesn ' t mean other people shouldn ' t . stop being so self  centered " you should let people speak their minds and not be so insecure about it .
