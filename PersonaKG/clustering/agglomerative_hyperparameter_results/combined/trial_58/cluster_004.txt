1. start by not giving a shit about what other people think of you . do what you need to do for yourself . learn to say " no " more often without the repercussions of other people ' s feelings . the rest will come naturally .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

5. so if you can ' t wash your dick without making a mess , you just need more experience period . neither one of you should smell so bad that you gotta wash right afterwards . if that ' s the case , you might wanna start off with washing your dick before hitting it , and likewise for her don ' t wash your dick , walking around with a dick smelling like pussy all day is the best . every time you whip it out to piss or shit , you get that beautiful waft of vagina goodness . it ' s especially better after sitting in your damp undies , marinading with all your grime and her grime and remnants of urine and semen and b . o . mmmmmmmmmmmmmm . getting hungry
   (ID: eb701dce6e6a2a5da4a0d10410214d821dc525a2)

6. abortion isn ' t murder , there is a cirtain point of pregnancy where your baby is too old to be aborted . when someone aborts a child it is either because they aren ' t ready to be pregnant with a child , because being a parent needs a lot of responsibility . you need to know how to discipline your child , reach your child before they go to school , pick the best education for your child , that you can financially be capable of , feeding your child , etc , some people aren ' t ready to have that responsibility to nurture a child of their own . linking in with my first point most people who do abort children when they ' re pregnant are teenagers , people who are practically children themselves , and definitely not ready for that responsibility .
   (ID: 544afc73e94949100186d302e382bea6fc33beb4)

7. exactly ! when someone is wrong on the internet i need to tell them , otherwise they might not know !

8. do we need any more justification other than " principal ? like , you are literally attempting to justify having sex with a fucking cow . just get some real pussy .
   (ID: c23be0b501278176a288ed6b3ab6669ac6b9896a)

9. is all you own is hoop earrings ? cause that  s all you need . i  ve said this before and i  ll say it again , please make dirtier content . i would pay good money to see that body of yours uncovered .
   (ID: ac0e0bfdedf04bf5199d4337ba10a43f13e1e49c)

10. it ' s time to man up . you fucked up and you need to own up to that mistake . stop lying to your wife , get a divorce and enjoy seeing your kids every other weekend .
   (ID: 87564c50904c4e4801d5e96e4913f38c10582ea1)

11. support for people with intellectual  learning disabilities and asd . pay is good spend my days , going to cinemas , swimming sessions , arts and crafts classes , etc . i feel completely out of the rat race my job is literally to help people get the most out of their day . you don ' t even need any specific qualifications either you just need to be a nice person .
   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

12. thank you so much ! the only other thing i need is to find where this piece goes . its black and looks like a cover peice
   (ID: ea5cdb41822e9eac6a4230514be598981cadabcb)

13. judging by your replies to other comments it doesn  t seem like you are very interested in hearing any opinion that isn  t   your husband should totally cave and you guys need another baby  . one comment you talk about how it  s not fair for you to not get another human child because your husband wants a . boat . in another comment someone tells you that their ex  husband tried to force another child onto them and it  s what caused their divorce . and your biggest concern is if he had gotten the children he finally wanted afterwards ? in reality , if this were posted but in reverse . if a gentleman was on here talking about how it  s just not fair that his wife won  t have another baby and he was pissy and angry about it . not listening to anyone  s advice and wanting to argue why he should get his way . reddit would tear him the fuck up and you know it .
   (ID: f18b19a52bbf1505af84d01563a51626d4ae363f)

14. the specs look similar but i think the overall specs , build quality and materials , the tone arm and to some degree the cartridge are higher quality in the lp5 . incidentally , either one has a phono stage built in so no need to keep any money aside for that . ultimately , listening is the answer but although i haven  t listened to either of your options extensively , i thought the lp5 sounded better than it  s cheaper sibling . i  ve been listening to vinyl for many years and i know which one i would prefer if it were for me . lp5
   (ID: 7e155e58dbfbdb78d094711d4ddb65ae5ef94fba)

15. if you already have a full canadian licence you can exchange it for a full british , no need to get a provisional and then take a test although if you ' re feeling uncertain about driving here perhaps some lessons with an instructor wouldn ' t be such a bad thing . i ' m in a car club since i can ' t afford to own my own car , so i don ' t drive every day more like digit times a month or so . for me , driving in london is fine except i don ' t like driving through central london , rush hour or big roundabouts although i still manage them okay . i took my first test in pinner which is easy compared to other test centres and failed due to one silly mistake . took my second test in wanstead which is notorious for being difficult and passed .
   (ID: 8260f82c24d2a4a134e92bf2fdcfc09a8eecf8fa)

16. it ' s a crap shoot if your treatment is ok or shitty . they need to fire half of them . it ' s the only way to eliminate the worthless , lazy , and incompetent ones there only to collect a pay check .
   (ID: bb6976d9c9771467d072134ccdbbbd5c82e5a67f)

17. you ' re completely right . how did i miss that ? need to sleep more . thank you .
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

18. i mean if they see you with a bunch of paper they will probably ask you for some , that ' s what happens in my music class whenever we need to write something . i also ask other people for things like pencils and stuff because i ' m bad and keep losing my own stuff .
   (ID: 8eba9c7d48a60bfbded2227dacd3275ae756fcce)

19. unpopular opinion  while i wouldn  t do that for a chain , i would consider doing it if i worked for an independent . however , i wouldn  t do anything complicated . need a refill ? i  d tell them i  m writing the number by hand and once i  m up and running in digit minutes , i  ll process it . it will most definitely not be ready the second we open . is there a voicemail that will eventually pick up and accept messages ? do you have caller id ? i would be very picky about who i picked up for .
   (ID: a2ac729ecf8bc4b4e5e9971a848e76d3b574e65a)
