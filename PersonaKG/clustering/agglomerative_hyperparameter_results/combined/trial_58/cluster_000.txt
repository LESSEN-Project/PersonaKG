10. yea , you didnt answer the question . a drunk guy is held responsible for his actions if he is drunk and has sex with a drunk female . a drunk female cant give consent because shes not in her right mind but a drunk male is supposed to be in his right mind enough to know that the woman is too drunk to give consent . its a double standard that is ridiculous and you can down vote me all you want for it . but just answer the question , thats all i ask .

11. i ' m not sure that abortion is the reason . most of our parents were in the " silent generation "  that group of people who grew up in the great depression but were too young for wwii . the greatest generation crammed all their child rearing into the post war period and the result was the baby boom . the baby boomers are the moms and dads of gen y . i agree we are the best generation , though . i ' m proud to say that while the baby boomers partied in the mud at the original woodstock our generation rioted at the one they tried to put on for us .
