6. you  re making it seem that everyone who plays video games or anything like that is a lowlife piece of shit , my dad  s an avid gamer , is about 240lbs and could probably bench press about 250lbs , i  m not that far behind him and i play video games as well . maybe don  t generalize when you say that every gamer is lazy or is weak . and the reason that men don  t think that women should get it into their minds that hitting a man is okay is because , what if that man retaliates ? the woman could die , and it  s hard sometimes not to fight back , especially if it  s really bothering you . men don  t like to feel pain , neither do women , so why benefit one at the other  s expense ? double standards are bullshit .
   (ID: 93c3b3d523de0afd404d3bcb4acdf023866f9281)

7. i think it is folly to claim religion or faith are at issue here . you think that without religion this person would not have done this ? the issue is humans are animals and they do some nasty shit . i watched someone set digit people on fire the other day , watched the police shoot a guy in the back and watch him bleed out , watched kids killing insects with glee while their parents watch on , seen soldiers throw puppies off cliff along with many other acts with degrees of nastyness . i don ' t think in most cases these were performed acting as gods right arm or with any religious intent . people do shit because they want to and would probably find an excuse or reasoning to justify their actions . that guy kills because of god , others kill because they play too many video games , others kill because it makes them horny . we are all missing the point . humans are nasty , disgusting pieces of shit and are all capable of horiffic things . its just some people do it where the rest of us don ' t religion or not

11. vegas casino is one of the best bitcoin casino where we can play various of gaming games ! like poker , roulette , slots and blackjack . well i never regret anything because they provide the best for their players and aside from that they make sure that we are comfortable while we are playing since they are safe and secured gambling site unlike other online casinos which are scam sites and fake sites . well i ' m not interested about online casinos before , until my friend suggested this bitcoin casino . i love it because of the positive reviews about it , some of you may think that it is just a waste of time and money but its not ! because i had the best experience . sometimes i also lose some money but despite of that i chooses to continue because i ' m enjoying it like when i play slots and roulette . i also know that it is part of being a gambler you have to experience those things to make yourself wiser and learn your lesson in life that not most of the time you will win .
