1. now that i  m done spamming ora on all your stupid jojo trashing , your memes are absolute shit and beyond cringy no one would find them funny and there  s not even any real criticism , you  re worse than people who hate anime just because they hear other people who hate it
   (ID: ef181804526093c6a2f6a4e0fba8b4f18fc0e775)

2. glad someone said this ! i hate how men are all tarred with the same potential rapist bullshit .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

3. i suspect it the number of people who actively hate me might actually be much lower than i think  feel it is just because i ' m so damn boring anymore there ' s nothing for anyone to follow and hate , but plenty of people who don ' t like me . having asd doesn ' t help . i ' ve been told the malapropism " we ' ll burn that bridge when we come to it " is quite apt for me , because my capacity for dealing with people who make me uncomfortable is so low .
   (ID: 2f62aeebd18bd873078151ee21a92be33ffd3e29)

4. all the people you hate are in there except they have no faces . your throat aches whenever you speak . needles fall from the sky . you can ' t stop thinking about the embarrassing moments of your life .

   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

6. i can ' t say i hate the united states of america remember there ' s two american continents but i can ' t say i love it either
   (ID: a2291731ea6532473dc0e3f9275ce68c86abfad6)

7. god , i hate all of the rock fans . from the gatekeepers to the lewronggenerationhttps    type people . it makes me ashamed to be a rock fan . i can hardly wear a nirvana shirt without someone saying " oh i bet you don ' t even know that ' s a band and think it ' s just a brand " . bitch , you can fuck right off .
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

8. i like to pretend that everyone using a fusion rifle is just doing it to complete the thorn bounty . that way , i don ' t hate them .
   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

9. but that works the other way , too . that means that all people also have a little gayness in them , too , even if latent , so that when people try to act all homophobic , it ' s basically a self  hate whether they realize it or not , in fact studies have shown that at least a quarter of all homophobic men are closeted gay . i didn ' t mean to be offensive to people , but the kinsey report was widely researched and studied over years with thousands of interviews  patients  clients , it is the book on human sexuality . not everyone agrees with it , it absolutely was controversial in its day , and remains so today . btw , i flirt with self  proclaimed straight men all the time , it never works i keep trying , though , but every time i bring up the kinsey report it makes them take a step back . they too don ' t like the results , but it ' s the truth .
   (ID: b22d67acc81c3e3bf700f9a159ec06062eb72fd2)

10. i ' m afraid of my kids facing hardship in life , like any parent is . i worry that they ' ll end up entitled , but i ' m hopeful that we ' re doing enough to avoid that . i hate selfishness . i hate when people act entitled to anything , and i hate when people hoard what they have . the world would be a much better place if we all looked after one another . also loud chewers and slow walkers but that ' s another matter . i was raised by well  off parents , yes . we ' ve been together for about digit years .
   (ID: 439e78cca3643ee51185b36cedaa4c3e72551ef5)

11. anyone can be anything they want on reddit . so call yourself bisexual all you want to cover up your hate for gays , but i know lots of gay dudes that would agree with me . unless you think all gay dudes are sissies and unmasculine , in which case , you ' re proving once again you don ' t like gays . check your privledge .

   (ID: c7b03500469d01fff7d63dc804418c265ca4c838)

   (ID: 9721da66d978b8a2541ec60ba070b6fa9121482d)

16. as fucked up as a situation that is the only person suffering right now is you because of that hatred . find something to take your frustration out of course within the realms of the law . then let go of that anger and forget them . enjoy your life . it is far too short for hate . that  s just me though .
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

17. i talk to people every once and a while they hate me at first then get used to me and friend me out of pity . i don ' t know why they do that they could just stop talking to me if they hate me but it ' s just what happens .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

18. i hate such mis direction . a movie should be like fight club with subtle clues all around place . maybe its just my preference .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

19. thanks for the reply . would you be okay if they didn ' t wear their uniforms and instead marched as a group like companies do wearing a t  shirt that said which police force they were from ?   x200b  i guess what i ' m trying to figure out is if people just hate police being allowed in the parade all together or if they just don ' t want them in their uniform . i see a few comments on these type posts where people just seem to hate police period .   x200b  i feel it ' s important to mention that i didn ' t get that impression from you , which is why i decided to ask you for your opinion . i figured i ' d get a well thought out answer , which i did . so thank you for that !   x200b  p . s . reddit formatting is always a surprise , for me anyway . haha .

20. i work in product development and while i haven ' t had any moral dilemmas nearly as big as these , there are often issues to consider . what if i can design a better widget , but our factory can ' t produce it so we would have to outsource it ? consumer gets a better product , profit margin might even be higher , but we decrease internal production and hurt other employees . it is kind of funny how the phrasing of this could cause reddit to hate or love it . stifling innovation seems to clearly be a bad thing , but there is tons of hate when people hear about companies that close their factories and produce goods elsewhere . if your new product is different enough , it is possible that the current factory can ' t be modified to produce it without basically gutting the whole place . even then your workforce has no experience producing the new item , so if you want good quality right away , outsourcing the manufacturing of the new design is the only viable solution .
