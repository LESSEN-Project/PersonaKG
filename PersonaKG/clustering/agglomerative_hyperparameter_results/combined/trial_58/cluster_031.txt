1. i ' ll look for some of these myself . gakkou gurashi looked pretty promising and i still have k  on ! as a back  up , but i ' ll look for some more .
   (ID: 622ae5e8e0ffe2c066a3d94dcee004b5696643bb)

2. give us what we want or we ' ll shoot ourselves in the face .
   (ID: f7356e924b370675e942b29b9c2184dc895ea5b7)

3. if you ' re over digit you should have no problems legally moving out of home what you might have a problem with is finding somewhere to move to , there ' s a bunch of different options . you can look for a shared house to move into , or talk to a few people and put together a shared house . make sure you have money saved up for bond because it ' s likely you ' ll need to pay it . i ' m not sure about your exact circumstances job  studying etc but when you move you have to let centrelink if you ' re receiving a payment from them know as soon as possible . when looking for a shared house always meet everyone you ' ll be sharing with first , get a feel for them . obviously people will be on their best behaviour when trying to find someone to move in and help with rent , but if you don ' t particularly like them when you meet them i recommend just saying no thanks and continue to find a place . you want somewhere that you want to be , and to live with people you can live with . this can also be an issue when moving in with friends , you might be best friends but horrible at living together . it is different . make sure you figure out if your rent includes bills and which ones or if you ' ll have to save up for those as well .
   (ID: 3019ca7bd07e9287b998767b6d0eb22d6049a635)

4. one of my favourite showerthoughts is that we ' ll suffix everything with "  porn " that someday we ' ll have to call regular porn " sexporn "
   (ID: 3c135c69a8a47980440b74978da03e89463d9df6)

5. depends . if you ' re with bank of america , they ' ll service  fee you into bankruptcy .
   (ID: 063122b93a40a719244d27587193e154f2fed59d)

6. have you tried and i know that this isn ' t the most popular if even permitted thing here but maybe prayer or any thing religious ? i ' ve felt with this type of thing before and it ended up helping me , although i do understand if it ' s not for you . also maybe telling someone about this like someone in your life maybe if you do either you ' ll end up finding something worth living for
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

7. 1m ? you know , there are rats with that much bounty in about every belt . you ' ll have to put a few zeros on it , to get people interested .
   (ID: 699195a280fce86200065786c40a00e3096406da)

8. your reply made me think about it more . in another example , i guess if someone wanted to change their clothes for free at a gilded wardrobe they would just go to another person ' s house party . it ' s lazy , but effective i guess . i think i ' ll just visit a poh and get someone to make flatpacks for me there .
   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

9. not yet , will do in a couple of hours . i ' ll keep you posted if i get rich .
   (ID: c7e5f1c7a94109955f94d7acd2417ffad0ba60db)

10. it ' s not easy at all . it depends on if you can truly handle not only being a friend , but seeing her live her life with someone else that she ' ll eventually choose . i get jealous easily and it seeing a girl i want to be romantic with , do things with another guy is like waiting forever for your food and the waiter simply giving it to someone else and having to watch them eat it .
   (ID: e217e0e78b3d167105d634f49246c934025ff72b)

11. the only reason a person goes to hell is if they choose to .   x200b  i  ll elaborate . there are two main things one can do to go to hell  commit a mortal sin , act directly against your own conscience and do something you know in your heart is very wrong .   x200b  the requirements of a mortal sin are  grave matter , and full knowledge . if you don  t know it  ll send you to hell , it won  t , unless you know in your heart that it  s wrong and do it anyway .   x200b  in the end the only answer to your question is  i don  t know  and anyone who says they do is either lying or delusional .   x200b  side note  there are other things you can do , but they aren  t really relevant to your question .

12. by then , we ' ll probably have technology that can detect ghosts if they exist and eliminate them , and there will be no haunted flats or apartments .
   (ID: 6cb8904cf2faf74f712ddb1c620007fe43bf46df)

13. jdoe74 has a point honestly . if you like doing what you do cut the middleman and slightly undercut the business you currently work for and you ' ll definitely make more than they are paying you .
   (ID: 4d1c53b18fd4290c31e857fc9f9572542fef4fd5)

14. essential  what is a double double ? if you know what this is , you ' ll blend in well . just pronounce " about " like " a  boot " and pepper your words with the occasional " eh ? "
   (ID: 627809b826e1a364fb65664e0749e9e9eb90081d)

15. there ' s so many though . i ' ll try myself before spamming the sub .

16. " i ' ll love you for ever " rip

17. nice ! that  s definitely something i  ll do for future interviews . thanks !
   (ID: 2ab410cb3dc233b072c65fa9acc3c6323d05914e)

18. when someone puts " nm only " in their name i ' ll usually check their profile to see if they put other things such as  " if card is not nm i will send them back at your expense . " i ' ll usually avoid those members .
   (ID: 8e629a7555369b0d827116a133d05901757cd56a)

19. " i ' ll never have kids because long ass list of reasons "   tsu
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

20. the wrong idea about arranged marriages is that  s always forcing someone to marry someone else . while this is the case sometimes , but most of the times it  s not . i  m still against arranged marriages and i will never marry this way even tho it  s the norm in my culture . but , the way it  s done is that a guy wants to get married , his mother and other women of the family will look for someone that he might like and compatible with , they  ll talk to the girl  s family , and if the girl is open to the idea . they will set up a  date  for them , usually with the mothers present . if both parties want to pursue this , they  ll be an engagement period where they will get to know each other .
