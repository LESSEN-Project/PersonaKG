15. yes i just read that document someone posted above . i don ' t know what to say . this hurts to see his condition  what cgc is doing with him . they are drugging him to curb his impulsiveness  probably using corporal punishment on him . aspergers isn ' t handled with brimming the kid with heavy drugs . he should be given social skills because a person suffering from this condition doesn ' t get societal rules automatically . he needs to be taught social skills explicitly . when an organization which is supposed to look after the kids well  being is doing such things then it hurts . i know we ' re not just witnessing one case here . god knows how many welfare organizations out there do promotional campaigns on the social media to raise some funds but don ' t do any groundwork which should be their job . in the power struggle between his father  cgc , they ' re ruining his life . you were right . reiryu ' s condition isn ' t uncommon .

18. i have been exploring him a lot looking for things i may have missed and seeing what i can do with him , but he still feels like trash . unless someone finds some move or tech that i ' m not using or don ' t know or something , i think he will just be garbage again .
   (ID: 7cf18036f93dc6fc68e7a501c52e0ff5501b36e5)

19. from what i  ve heard , they  re still exercising at least once a month which is the same as before . they were all pretty excited when the  no more war games  thing was announced , but we don  t call any of our exercises  war games  so we just assumed it was a way to seem like we were giving up something without ever doing so . if anyone was to bring up the fact that we haven  t stopped exercising we could be like  we gave up the war games , but we didn  t stop our training exercises  . hell , i  m in japan and even we were hoping that maybe we  d luck out and they  d let us quit exercising as well . no such luck .
   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

20. yeah i understand this . one of the things i  m going through now is seeing high school friends on facebook make posts about being home owners , and i want to buy a house soon . so it is easy to feel jealous but i don  t want to . you know ? i want to mature and just be patient and not envy others . but it is a conscious decision that we have to make sometimes .
