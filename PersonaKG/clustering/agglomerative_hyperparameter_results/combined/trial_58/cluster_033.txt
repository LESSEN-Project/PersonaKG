2. you people are so touched in the head you accept that bull excuse . it ' s sickening . i hope one day you see how disgusting you sound and hang your head in shame .
   (ID: 5a01af4f9721facf5be110d8e134d4c4da020088)

3. i hope this doesn  t come across as rude but nobody here can give responsible medical advice and this is a sub for cancer patients , caregivers , and relatives . you should see your doctor with any questions  concerns . this may be a better question for askdoctors or healthanxiety . best of luck to you .
   (ID: b40d1d3ae1e77bcbdcb98e62deea24396d4b4d40)

4. i hope you have a great time . i ' m just thinking of my experience at the super bowl in digit . it was fun , but for the price and my seat location , i wouldn ' t do it again .
   (ID: 3790e844e04694d48c253f7aee4d3b61f116d4d6)

   (ID: 02e801249875692d61023bbfbc79d7ff34c9eddf)

6. sometimes the simplest solutions are often the best ones ! and unfortunately yes , certain types of people abusive , manipulative , selfish , etc will absolutely take advantage of someone if they think they can . but i hope you realize that you deserve better ! my confidence used to be and sometimes still is very low . but now i mostly see myself in a much more positive light . and believe me , confidence makes all the difference . i hope you begin to see yourself more positively as well . for what it ' s worth , you sound like a truly lovely domme . you clearly care for your sub ' s needs and respect their boundaries , and those two things say a lot about a person .
   (ID: 603a231fe5a5d93e7d1121f6265baf1dcb11f624)

   (ID: 4cc753880acafe19a59cd87ecc09d1637e797277)

9. i know what it is . it aligns with that by which i put my hope and faith into , humanity . that and i hold no reservation for superstition or a " higher " power .
   (ID: b5153b16e61f6bc5e4bf4d8db479b7093df1ae26)

   (ID: 2af8a0ff2295d21473f0e6ff67565738eb8f4df1)

11. hope is low right now . it seems like when we get a leader  someone who believes in and represents the regular people  they ' re easily corrupted . a lot of the most constricting or unfair laws are kept in place by the corporations who fund the lobbyists , who fund the congressmen who make the laws so the machine is like a great beast constantly feeding off its own tail . but hope springs eternal . that continued hope in spite of adversity is what makes america great . we ' re the underdog , the comeback kid who you see pull it together in the end of movies when all hope is lost . we ' re full of ingenuity and creativity and we run on elbow grease . we ' ll come back . we don ' t know how we ' ll do it , but we know we will .
   (ID: 699bf0afe2f1405d2208320e80156a99e90d356e)

   (ID: 18cbf1c145fcc3d10b99255dd1de8fb616ecb38f)

15. not relying on buying more stuff with the hope to increase my happiness , something that ' s so common in canada . not everyone of course but so many .
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

16. know what they learned ? to find a way and get a piece of their own in the event that it happens with someone else . hope they get these guys .
   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

17. and then they  d likely sanitise it or not serve the food . what do you think happens in a regular restaurant when that happens ? they just leave the blood and hope for the best ?
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

18. honestly the best thing for you to do is to tell your boyfriend straight up the entire situation . i don  t think the relationship will last sadly after that because he is straight and he can  t force himself to be attracted to you afterwards , but for your own personal happiness and mental health you need it tell him and transition . but who knows he might still retain attraction to you afterwards , it is a possibility . i know how bad dysphoria can be , my partner is trans and i  ve been with them before and after their transition and they  re much happier now than they were before . i hope you too can remain friends since all that would happen is that he loses attraction . best of luck to you , be brave and you can make it through . i hope all goes well red  heart
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

19. i hope your friend finds their dog  digit
