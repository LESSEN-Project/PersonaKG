   (ID: 5fa74a7d6a70c6f2f8a149864f494ac72eefd3e4)

10. i found an article about it on the web  and another in psychology today  the trick is , with a few polite questions and comments , to start a more meaningful conversation , but stick to appropriate topics such as  the weather . the person that you want to talk to . talk very little about yourself . people love to talk about them selves . once they are talking , ask questions like  what do you like to do for fun  or  for a living  also , study non  verbal cues , like facial expressions , and body language . if someone points their face or feet away from you , they may not want to talk . another thing to remember is that it  s just for enjoyment , and to try to get to know someone . don  t put too much pressure on yourself to get it right every time , nobody does . this includes neuro  typicals . it  s difficult for many people , not just autistic people . i think , however , as an autistic individual , that if you approach the matter analytically , that you may have great success at it .

15. for     ' s sake , let us have advanced worldgen options to choose what things our world has . let us choose which ores the world contains , what colors the dungeon uses , what color of underground moss we want , what kind of moon we want , etc . let ' s just say that i ' m constantly generating worlds that use the new ores , rather than the old ones that i ' ve come to know and love . it ' s ridiculous how i can ' t get a single world that has the old ores .

19. probably a matilda situation . in my experience , your parents don  t have to tell you that you were unwanted and they resent you for it . kids are pretty intuitive that way , and if he didn  t know before then he probably knows now based off of the fact that they want literally nothing to do with their grandchild . but i bet the maternal grandparents will have more than enough love to go around !

20. it is the helicopter mom of states . has too many kids and not enough time but it is hell bent on showing the other moms it not only loves all its children equally but more than they could ever love their children , and it will shame them for that . you let you kids drink sugary drinks sssssstttth well alright , oh you let your kids walk half a block to school oooh well i ' m sure they will be alright , oooohhh my heck you let your kids play with guns i should call cps . oh and don ' t forget all the social work . done half ass . entirely so she can judge all the other moms for being selfish bitches who only worry about their own kids , mean while her kids are dressed in hand me down second hand store out fits , and she has them on a diet that is really because she can not make ends meet despite her husband bringing in 200k .
