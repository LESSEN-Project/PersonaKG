13. it ' s not rude at all ! i do enjoy talking to folks with different thoughts and opinions on the world , as long as its a respectable conversation . i ' ve always believed that god lets us have our free will . i mean , what a life we would have if we where micro  controlled by a guy we didn ' t really know . i also think that bad things happen , because we don ' t live in a perfect world , and while i don ' t know what a perfect world would be really , i could say that it would be no harm to anyone . the world we live in is thanks to the fall , and is a consequence of that decision  thanks , eve !  unfortunately . humans , in my opinion , also need to have something to look up to , something greater than themselves , whether that be science , a public figure , a deity , or even an object .
