1. im waiting for kunimitsu and negan , and i know several pros and cons . pros are you know the most of the match up , move , what safe and what can be punish . cons are sometimes you do wrong input for example yoshi ender i always use with f3  digit but some times i mix that with miguel button input . also , having your brain expand the size of the entire roster , sometimes i found myself think of all the move i use when i fight those character , for example like if i fight yoshi , i would expect my opponent to only use what i also used but nope he use other tech so i find it difficult sometimes . sometime you you underestimate your opponent because you know most of the match up , and other than that , you can mix some move into other character for example yoshi didn ' t have savage but you think he has cause you play most of the roster . in short it can confuse you .
   (ID: cd4ad4cc67fcfb39fcb1f11e52709d863f1c0215)

2. i haven ' t heard of that book . i wonder if even if they read it if they would realize what they ' re in for . they are such amazing , hard  working people that are in it so deep that to admit defeat . well . i just don ' t think they could do it . wouldn ' t it be so embarrassing to say you tried and gulp failed . it really really makes me so sad for them . and i agree , it sounds like a book that could be quite dry , but i bet it would actually be quite interesting if you know someone personally involved . i would probably cry for them .
   (ID: aa8abed66c32a0519ab922c1a606563d97de28fc)

3. i don ' t recall hearing the word sportbike when i had a norton in the digit ' s . i think it may not have been invented yet . none the less , norton was the sportbike of its day . there were plenty faster bikes but no one could keep up with me on the mountain roads .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

4. but you  re insane to think that hitting your hand with a hammer the first , tenth , or even a hundred times will not hurt . it  s mental illness making you think there has to be a secret number of how many times you can hit your hand until it doesn  t hurt anymore
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

5. i don  t think he means joji as filthy franku , just joji himself , and if he has had this share of youtube , why is he in music vids
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

   (ID: 114e3678c6af9d322985bb4656e33b19c03a0479)

8. ok . i ' m genuinely curious . what possible course of action could you have done differently , to " save me " from the " burning world " as you put it . that required me beliveing in you ? what possible new resource do you gain from my belief in your " prediction " that will stop the world from burning ? or at least save me from this fiery premonition of doom ? p . s . i don ' t think listened and end is a good rhyme , and it maybe would have helped your case more if you rhymed all your " song ' s " verse .
   (ID: 808718709a1de9360ade79304c59728079eae812)

9. no . because i don ' t see any reason to think so . although , i guess i qualify as a loner myself , so i might not be qualified to answer .
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

10. btw , do you know any animes like nhk ? i mean , not necessarily it should be about hikikomori , but with similar psychological context that makes you think " wtf am i doing with my life " or something like that .  .
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

14. ok you think that then . no issue here .
   (ID: 02cf76dae1fda8da1d2e5bbbaeb0da5a77cb6e3e)

15. i think the fact that this happened proves for a fact that " we " are not better than this . this subreddit isn ' t even about lol anymore , it ' s about pros and funny lol pictures . it ' s pathetic .
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

16. wth ? you are given that much power , and all you can think of is how to cause trouble ? what the hell is wrong with you ? use it for something that helps people , dammit . save some people . deliver medicine somewhere . bring a long lost relative to his dying grandfather . something , anything , that doesn ' t prove you are an immature prick .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

19. male im not really friends with any girls , but i do know that a ton of stuff i say is a joke , and even sometimes ill give actual advice in a half joking way , its weird . something like " how about you dont please " cant think of any off the top of my head and also , yes , i hear tons of fucked up things but dont really get offended at any of it , confirming your point . . waait so are girls really that boring ?
   (ID: 8eba9c7d48a60bfbded2227dacd3275ae756fcce)
