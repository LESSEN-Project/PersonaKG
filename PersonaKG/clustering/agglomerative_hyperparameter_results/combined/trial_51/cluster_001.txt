1. yep , was looking to see if someone beat me to it before posting . i forget off the top of my head , but there ' s a country that did or still does need absolutely insane amounts of money to buy anything . they had to make a digit million bill may be off by a denomination or two . anyway , i want to say zimbabwe . can someone comfirm or correct me on this ? i ' d usually turn to google but i gotta get in the shower .
   (ID: 9789fadf3a050c71c64ca7e31c4857fc9094d643)

2. not waiting your turn . it ' s a basic thing we all are taught in childhood but not many people follow it after that .
   (ID: d785eda10245445843c3355a0710d262b0d65bb9)

3. one of the biggest errors our little human brains make is assuming people we know are the same from day to day . many people do not understand the episodic nature of depression . i strongly encourage you to mention to a friend of parent something like " this may be out of left field , but between you and me , i ' ve been feeling kind of blue lately . i know i don ' t show it , but i guess i could use a little extra support at the moment " say it in a way that feels like your voice . saying it out loud is scary , but surprisingly therapeutic in and of itself .
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

4. it  s beautiful , how much ?
   (ID: b544676f77b629fef343fb67689e28beb14aad3a)

5. i can think you should be honest with your feelings . i say with experience and to ignore or overlook it can be more destructive than anything else . if she genuinely likes you , she ' ll come back . if it ' s just the physical stuff the friendship will fizzle out . that ' s the worst part though . fwbs ruin good friendships most of the time .
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

6. well . when u leave the world kinda pauses . u see when u come back that the time of the day  night is the same , and every mob is in the same place . so they ' re just frozen in time . may not even know that we ever left once we get back on . this is probably a joke so yeah woooosh lmaoooooooooo but rule digit says no jokes or puns so this is hopefully not a joke
   (ID: db49a30ced23a0e386b799d5f970489f11a53f7a)

7. for some reason i sound really stoned when i talk over the phone
   (ID: 95acb2ca6e2c4b0e43ae1565f6eb3f529105e156)

8. except no , you do have responsibility . you know that word is offensive which , i would hazard to guess , is why you like it , and further you know what it means to call someone that . it ' s a legitimately offensive thing to call someone , and just because people have called you a faggot and you didn ' t care doesn ' t mean that other people can ' t be legitimately pissed off by being called that , or by that word being used . the idea that you can use a word like that and have no responsibility for how people react is like saying you can swing a baseball bat at someone ' s head and have no responsibility for them being pissed . it just doesn ' t make any damn sense . if you were as emotionally mature as you say you are , you ' d take some responsibility for your own actions instead of projecting that onto someone else . own your shit instead of forcing other people to pick it up .
   (ID: 573effd77bc41b375b82f92f6f34840f2f4dbff4)

9. yes you are . what in the world does mexico have to do with anything ? can you comprehend that they come from central america ?
   (ID: 8f17a8aa41d6f9ae6bf4690376763808f9363f80)

10. try to think of some flaws that you think the person might have and if that doesn  t work well then fuck .
   (ID: 1ab03d054f341c1ede82c7eb9f871db0a696e44d)

11. and when i say plans . i mean these plans would have been made way back when they were fuck buddies . as in . " hey man i really enjoy you and the sex is great . i know we will go our separate ways . but no matter what , or no matter who we ' re with . we will always fuck . deal " then some years later . boom here she is . " hey buddy , been thinking about you and how much i enjoy you . come visit me in amsterdam " are you ok with that ?
   (ID: fa749ff7262da656e34f21f4b902bd5287bf224d)

12. ok . i ' m genuinely curious . what possible course of action could you have done differently , to " save me " from the " burning world " as you put it . that required me beliveing in you ? what possible new resource do you gain from my belief in your " prediction " that will stop the world from burning ? or at least save me from this fiery premonition of doom ? p . s . i don ' t think listened and end is a good rhyme , and it maybe would have helped your case more if you rhymed all your " song ' s " verse .
   (ID: 808718709a1de9360ade79304c59728079eae812)

13. look at two people being able to civilly discuss a bit of a hot button issue on reddit ! while i agree about espn probably not wanting to put down too strong of a stance on an african  american for ranting about racism , she went beyond that with character attacks of someone specific just so happened to be our president in this case and seemingly contributing to an already boiling pot of emotions in the country . her hosting a sports show is debatable , i doubt many viewers are tuning into the digit for anything sports  related . that being said , espn has fired , demoted , or seriously disciplined sports analysts previously for less than what hill tweeted because they previously tried to portray an environment of " we are here for the sports , we don ' t have room for political discourse " ultimately , there is a much different atmosphere being portrayed coming out of bristol over the last few years . i don ' t think there was any place for what schilling said , like him or not . making statements like that about an entire group of the population the transgender comments is irresponsible and detestable , but just a few short years ago , statements like hill ' s would have been met with a very similar fate also .
   (ID: bd40d7bc2310ec67eb22f820945fdb7d0f6a2550)

14. does this position have an on  boarding process or do you guys throw me to the wolves ?
   (ID: 42d20fb8523115a55130d58a232603b846ad13a0)

15. i read , " however , she does seem to assume i don  t know what i am doing at all "  if my daughter was digit with a baby i would assume the same . being a parent is a major responsibility , i currently have digit . i ' m in college as well , and i ' m almost twice your age . college is literally the only thing i have the energy for outside of motherhood , i can ' t imagine what you would want to go out and do that your mother is like , " no , no , no " to .   x200b  as far as getting your mom to give you more freedom , she ' s probably afraid you ' re going to go out and get pregnant again  it ' s a very valid fear . she questions your judgement , your ability to be responsible . what she has to go on is you getting pregnant at digit . your first decision as an adult was to become a parent , it sounds like she ' s afraid you will continue to make decisions that have her questioning whether or not you are capable to live an adult life where you can make rational decisions for yourself .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

16. i would say flirting g but there ' s a girl i ' ve had my eye on . and no matter how hard i try her eyes never dart toward me
   (ID: e46c4597dda4f39a1122f37ba9383f7441387cf9)

17. he ' s said that he really doesn ' t drink . in his newest seneralgam he said this is probably the first time i drank in about a year .
   (ID: 114e3678c6af9d322985bb4656e33b19c03a0479)

18. well you gotta remember they have a job to do , and something as simple as that seems pretty minuscule to you but is a big deal for the employee , boss , and establishment .
   (ID: 3857340322f3015e4a24e7f6aa252884060f24ce)

19. what are you doing to change it then ?
   (ID: 4776f36398122cafa421393accf6939d82603a44)
