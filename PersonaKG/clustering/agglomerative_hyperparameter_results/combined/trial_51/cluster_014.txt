4. they are on the menu as a breakfast item in japan . the  frankburger " in the top row , second from the left to be honest , as much as i love hot dogs , i haven ' t been impressed with dogs at hamburger shops . burger king ' s dogs aren ' t very good and neither are a  w ' s . i can ' t imagine mcdonald ' s would be much better .
   (ID: c3739aee1cfa0a286d1056b5d9225e9d6e4f6547)

6. parting them out ? it seems like the cars that sit there are really common cars . maybe they use them for parts . like a mini  junk yard .
   (ID: 7f3ed7262bf05d9d101b2b917869b90e43710a7a)

7. off topic about this picture but on topic about the bikes do these bikes have better baskets ? like are the holes on the side of the basket huge because the baskets are useless if you wanna keep your phone or anything in there because they will just slide out . like today i used one in miramar and i had a can of iron bru import from scotland i think and it slid out the side of the basket and pierced a hole in the side causing it to squirt out this is one of the older bikes

   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

12. happy apple , there are several thousand of them left over from the 70s in little antique stores and it literally just makes a pleasant jingle when the kid pushes it or touches it and then self balances like a giant weeble . will generally run between digit and digit bucks depending on where you live . you can also find them online on amazon or ebay but then you ' ll probably pay digit or digit plus shipping . fascinates them for hours at this age .
   (ID: 6aca29520994a85891e32b7ad6030791dfa1cbe2)

13. nah . i wonder if you would be willing to compromise though , like maybe you could take the floor and turn it into art so you still have those memories around ? here are some possible ideashttps
   (ID: b40d1d3ae1e77bcbdcb98e62deea24396d4b4d40)

14. yeah , my school forces us to use them . even though someone at school looked it up and it would be cheaper to get another computer .
   (ID: 535c3113ba487b9152c4b0adbe8c36822bc45ca4)

15. another good place for them it depends on what the original intention of that classroom was , my woodshop in highschool had them over every table

   (ID: 4a5a9ac8eab027b38804427b3c8c5e19c8991de3)

20. you can tell by the map , if there are a group clustered together far from the street than they are being hoarded . or if they say last ridden is digit days ago but last located was digit minutes ago those are hoarded . anything that says last located longer than a few hours is probably gone . you can change the search setting in the bottom right corner . i  ve gotten lucky with one  digit bird that looked like it was in a garage on the map , but was actually behind a dumpster . typically any yellow and red ones are hoarded though . if you report them as hoarded or missing they will disappear from your map .
