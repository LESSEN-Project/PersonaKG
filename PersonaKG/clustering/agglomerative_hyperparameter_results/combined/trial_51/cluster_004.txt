   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

2. i discovered i was pregnant at digit , almost digit . just like you i want to be a mother but i want to have a stable situation to do so . i just began college so it was a really bad news . however i live in france so all is paid with the social security it ' s called like that in france . i saw a doctor and i had to do blood tests and an scan to know the stage of the pregnancy digit weeks . then they gave me a drug which provokes a miscarriage . it hurts and there ' s a lot of blood and you ' re going to bleed almost digit month after that but it ' s not that bad , a labour hurts surely more ! i was alone during the abortion because the guy didn ' t want to be involved and i never said my parents , i was too ashamed and i didn ' t want them to be disappointed by me . i ' ll maybe tell them one day . don ' t feel stupid , you took the birth control , you just didn ' t have luck . it ' ll be okay , your boyfriend will certainly support you during this event . you ' ll never forget but you ' ll know you made the right choice and that when you ' ll be ready to have a child , you will offer him a great life .
   (ID: 862cb85d93fa9b931c3c64cf2fd17ef592d48c50)

3. i am so sorry to hear about her condition . i can understand that it is difficult right now with everything going on including your wedding , it  s okay  people can become anxious and may not want to face a difficult  sad situation . your being honest at least . it  s often good to just relax and pull back and think about your two events in life and reflect . be thankful . anyway , i hope everything goes okay for you and your family . this reminded me of something  please see coco pixar  i think that it may help you and give you a different perspective about life in general .
   (ID: 7f37f47fcf6439c13308caa3da8118ac14f861f6)

4. you have to remember as a child those pets are one of the few friends they have at home . i  d try breaking the news as soon as you can so she can at least try to understand . just tell her your situation and what you had to do .
   (ID: 74d9c413c2cf59d223d7510b599edf6b6b1df3a2)

5. sister , i feel this on such a spiritual level , you are not alone i gave my son up for adoption when i was digit also rape i know how you feel . it was a horror show , they thought  digit a month could support me when i was put on medical bed rest because of the baby when i was living alone . every mother  s day is a kick to the stomach because i am a mother , but not a mom . every time someone asks me if i have kids and i kinda stammer out no every time someone finds out and tell me how  selfless  i was . how  happy  i should be . no one understands the hardship and emotional toll giving up a baby is after his birth i spent digit months on the streets because i couldn  t work , i was experiencing severe post  partum psychosis . i was institutionalized for a month . i felt like i didn  t deserve to sleep , be happy or healthy . i started to self injure which went on for years , my left arm is covered in scars now , digit years later it is a bit easier to handle thinking about him somewhere growing up and being happy , but even as i  m writing this my heart hurts and there are tears in my eyes you  ve got this , it gets better every year but you won  t forget , and that  s ok . there are not resources for birth mothers but we have each other . there are great support groups like the on your feet foundation which offers post  placement support . most of all , thank you for sharing your story . it couldn  t have been easy , if you need an emphatic ear , please use my inbox
   (ID: 46cf1fc2a9c8dec12fa16589117be75cf1571e1d)

6. that ' s understandable , i ' m sure the pain and study are more than hard enough to deal with without him making matters worse for you . i hope you can see someone helpful soon !
   (ID: 8b7590cb8502d6abd38b320b842aa7642186b6d8)

7. aw i ' m glad you found him ! and i love the name cyrus !
   (ID: 2d26439362b22d8737b6d2a810c70fc3b9a3ddaa)

8. i hope you both are ! it ' s a good feeling knowing that you have someone who cares about you no matter what and accepts your flaws . knowing you can barely talk for years while you ' re off doing your own thing , but then when you talk again it ' s like no time has passed , that ' s a good feeling , too .
   (ID: 28ecb35c880034ee5298d0c4abb71cabdafd1e4f)

9. those little things are the exact things i don ' t want to forget while currently living with my so . we don ' t do much . but when we do , it ' s really nice . i certainly am scared i will miss the nights we just get high , eat , and watch tv then go look out at the stars . it happens more than the date night things , but i don ' t wanna forget !
   (ID: 354f69f9c6cf00a975f2f112bc11eaa79f843f63)

10. that ' s awesome ! thank you for the knowledge . and that he is . which is why i was saying that if he had done this off the leash it would have been golden . but it ' s still pretty fantastic .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

11. you did what you could . this is the only time i advocate getting a well bred puppy when you have children  it ' s the only way to ensure you know its temperament .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

12. hey queenofhearts90 ! i  ve felt this way as well , it  s a terrible feeling . it  s not good to dwell on it too much though . i would do different activities to keep your mind off it . and speak to your husband about this  that is important . i hope you feel better soon . slightly  smiling  face
   (ID: 7f37f47fcf6439c13308caa3da8118ac14f861f6)

13. i  m sorry i can  t offer some kind of fix all solution for you . it  s a tragic thing  years later and my mother  s still stuck in her old ways . the only thing you can do for them is try to be supportive . as i learned , though , some people . they really just don  t want to get better . it  s a sad life to live , and it hurts to see , but there truly isn  t much you can do . patience is key , and if they can truly find it in themselves to seek a better life , then they will  it may take days or it may take years . overall , it  s just a question of ,  is it worth it ?  do you truly want to stick around through thick and thin , then the answer is yes . unfortunately , i believe you  re already doing all you can by being a supportive friend . maybe he  s not quite as far gone as my mother was , and a family  friend intervention could at least get the wheels turning ? other than that , i regret to say that i have no advice . best of luck xx

14. i don ' t think you can message him unless he follows you
   (ID: b6c3e540255084641f0e148a3992d9113c560f0b)

15. thank you for spending the time with your child . i wish my parents didn  t work so hard all the time because i could never see them . trust me , they  ll be grateful you were there for them because not a lot of parents are . i wish more people would spend more time with their children because it  s very important to their development . she  ll only be in your hair for so much longer . keep up the good work !
   (ID: 74d9c413c2cf59d223d7510b599edf6b6b1df3a2)

16. that actually sounds really beautiful . i guess this is actually my issue that i have never learned to be by myself as i went from one relationship to the next since i was digit . thanks a lot
   (ID: 9721da66d978b8a2541ec60ba070b6fa9121482d)

17. glad you realize how cringeworthy that was  kudos to both of you for growing together and laughing about it !
   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

18. thanks . i will be on my guard . i will try to work on myself too . i ' m actually away for digit weeks after he gets back with digit weeks here with him before i leave with a girl friend , so maybe some space will provide some clarity . maybe it will end us . the uncertainty is killing .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

19. honestly , i think the best thing you could do for her is surprise her with your presence on mother ' s day . that would be the best gift ever for her .
   (ID: 1b4a970a63450e21b56e1d38502b30aca032cd3f)
