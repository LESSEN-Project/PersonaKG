1. groceries most likely , it ' s never been enough to do fun things with really . maybe if we moved it to a yearly event !
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

2. yeah , they live digit hours away from my job , what else would i do with it ?
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

3. thank you for you advice and kindness ! i don ' t want to throw them away but i think your right and i will . also i did turn it into a piece of art because i thought it would be waist of such beautiful things and i thought it was a little funny to do so . but it has to at the least be a reminder of such negatively and a bad experience .
   (ID: dc0783c6951122c6edfc85430901cf133c146b32)

4. my grandpa made notes about where he got things , but i doubt there ' s anything like a receipt . well , they ' re family heirlooms at this point he ' s got pictures of him with them in china back in the 50s . so i guess i ' m not going to worry about that at this point . i don ' t think anyone in the family would want to sell them .
   (ID: 4c696d3f1d19d74a8b9e25c3dddb75deefc97a4b)

5. i ' ve recently decided to tackle my hoarding tendencies and purge my house of the stuff i ' ve kept most of my life that i thought i would use  look back on fondly . i ' m digit , so it ' s about digit years worth of stuff . reading old journals , notes to people , " poems " so bad i can ' t even consider it poetry , and looking at things i thought were cool , i want to die of embarrassment just from reading  seeing them . all i can think is " people let me be like this , i showed these to people , i sent these to boys i had crushes on , why ? " i want to burn it so there ' s never the chance of anyone finding it in a landfill , that ' s how bad it is . on the other hand , i have found some things  pictures i kept from other people and i want to send them to them so they can feel the cringe , too , and maybe we can have a good laugh about it .
   (ID: 28ecb35c880034ee5298d0c4abb71cabdafd1e4f)

6. a nice box is nice , but i would rather spend my money on a nice knife and have them safely ship the knife to me . i have my own display case for my knives , don ' t need one from the manufacturer .
   (ID: 3857340322f3015e4a24e7f6aa252884060f24ce)

7. any bets on what ' s in the jacket ? i ' m guessing a gift for his daughter ?
   (ID: 31010e05529816820e206497e04c189d0c81c647)

8. it depends on the scenario . am i just trying to make it to the next paycheck and i will get my item back ? if so then i ' d pawn a gun . if i ' ll probably never see it again i ' d go with some of the random electronics i have . an old cell phone , video game console , etc .
   (ID: 238107f17ccd21a5cb87efbd00d55a861389ba26)

9. these are really special ! can ' t say i ' m mad about the mattel dolls but i ' m not about them either , if that makes sense ! i ' m not hating on them is what i mean .
   (ID: 23d8dae7213e264b515a84a02f18e02f44dbe192)

10. he typically does that but that is why he didn ' t do that this year . he knew it wouldn ' t be used on me , but for the kids or household . i understand that he was trying and i appreciated that it ' s a gesture of love . but i ' d honestly would have preferred for a non  material gift like a morning where he took care of kids and i go do my own thing which i got the following week after having this exact conversation with him .
   (ID: 0eb234eb32f4a74b31c625730bfcb4190d403d56)

11. yeah i feel you . my dad made me a wallet a few years back , it still reminds me of him he doesnt live with us and you  re right . a handcrafted possession from a loved one is 100000x better than a store brought product
   (ID: 0cd386c702105bbc1d5ff54477982a219c3af52c)

12. that sounds about right . whether they know or not , they will appreciate the fact that you are mature enough to make first contact . if yo utell them that you ' re worried about your spending they could only help . well , good luck anyway .
   (ID: cd0b72d117bf74908c3edaaf3947b089a9dafc0c)

13. what sucks is that i think all of these colors are so pretty and would purchase them all if it wasn ' t for the vaginal inspection thing and the fact that they ' re trying disney like that .
   (ID: 1b90fe7ac45d325859956bedb446558d1a1d6bfd)

14. jesus either you have had a great life of presents or you ' re just ungrateful
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

15. would u ever think about selling some of the stuff , like the songs she wrote ? i love little things from the past like that and id totally buy one off you .
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

16. it ' s yours so you can do what you want . like other ladies have said , you should get it appraised , then sell it or regift it . you ' re not obligated to keep a gift , no matter who gave it to you .
   (ID: 8889ee4547e570f04696e9cc7b50124dca69b82e)

17. my suggestion still stands . it ' s not about the dollar amount , it ' s about the durability and the thought behind it . if it ' s something godawful , then don ' t get it . even decades later i still fondly remember these employees . if it ' s something physical that your cfo will keep and use , then go for that . i ' ve eaten cheeses , chocolates , and drank booze , but i don ' t have the foggiest who gifted them to me . those things are forgettable . i ' m sorry that i don ' t have a specific suggestion , but get something that will last and keep you in the thoughts of your employer . i did a quick search and found . it ' s digit but i ' m sure with some searching you can find a suitable gift . good luck ! edit  personalized items are a plus . they show you put some thought into it .
   (ID: 0e56d8a3bf928d2e85ff5b7a5a98f913d2826b00)

18. that ' s definitely a good choice , timex is a solid entry level brand with a long horological history . if you ' re still on the fence , or want other options , consider what style he will use the most . does he like intricate , mechanical things , or is he more into the fashion aspect of it ? what sort of workplace environment does he work in  is he outdoors and  or working with his hands a lot , does he wear a suit and tie ? do you want this to be a watch to only put on for special occasions , or more for everyday use ? does he own any other watches ? watches are often one of the only pieces of jewelry a man will wear other than a wedding band , so it ' s usually worth it to put some thought into it , which it definitely looks like you ' re doing so kudos ! if you decide on the timex , you ' ve made a good decision . if you want other suggestions and can help narrow it down a bit , i ' m sure we here at  watches can help you out !
   (ID: 2e34fbd58bc49726f7e8c74b8ea82513ca226ab4)

19. i figured is less pressure than doing happy events . have you ever heard of anyone complaining about funeral flowers ?
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

20. i see things a bit differently . no doubt your dad would appreciate a higher end and therefore more expensive turntable , but as an unexpected gift from his child , either of your options are priceless . go to the top of your budget and if your dad particularly likes audio technica , go with the best you can afford . i don  t know what other equipment you already have , but make sure that you have a pre  amp or integrated amp with a  phono  input or else keep enough money on one side for a suitable phono stage . good luck .
