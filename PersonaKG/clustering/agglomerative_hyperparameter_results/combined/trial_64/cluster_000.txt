20. my vote for actress would be andrea . prison relationship is true . mormon affiliation appears quite recent  those women at her shower saying they  d always wanted a black friend . you wouldn  t say that about someone you had fellowshipped and worshipped with for years . but she  s been on reality tv before , she obviously is a black hole of attention needs . i can see her , and people like her scouring the reality tv adverts looking for one they might qualify for . with her , the mormonism would have been further bait for the producers . she  d have a good sense of what is needed to catch their interest . i think the more of these reality shows we see , the more manipulation we will see by participants . god help their friends , family or partners who are no longer useful . gives new meaning to  collateral damage  .
