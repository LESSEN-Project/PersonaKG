1. wave back like you haven ' t seen them in years .
   (ID: 7cece6bbdf487f99b6d494ab790bde8e66ce8966)

2. if you have netflix or something i put on . show i ' ve seen many times over as background noise to help me sleep . or sometimes music if netflix is down
   (ID: 9e778023eda5589ac577e3789edfd900d208edf7)

3. in what way was it clear that he had assistants feeding him information ? i ' ve never seen his live show but i know he has been under intense media scrutiny for his entire career . if he was cheating in this way i can ' t help but feel he would have been publicly busted for it .
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

4. i  m aware of it . just never seen it look like that
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

5. i ' ve still never seen a physical release of any shantae game . are they specific to certain regions ?
   (ID: 2ac4d2cea574e655d7fdb1ab9b4886989929ca96)

6. tricky one this . i suppose if you went for a girl with those tendencies in the first place , or if that  s what first attracted you , then it would be hypocritical to ask her to change . if it  s that your partner has become sexually suggestive online recently , i would assume that there  s an underlying reason for that perhaps . not saying it  s necessarily a sign that they  re unhappy in the relationship , but some people need more flattery or attention than others . i  ve seen the huge amount of likes girls get on instagram for these types of pictures and it must be quite tempting  addictive .
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

7. when i was digit i got a ticket for riding without a seatbelt because the cop claimed he had been watching , and my dad disengaged the park before my belt had clicked . i had no job or anything so digit  was a big deal , and the cop looked like the most pathetic , sweaty , airwaster i  d ever seen . clearly hadn  t issued a ticket in ages and just had to get his quota up .
   (ID: 8df56ee782672f11aeb0f19bf7978b1b1c04e678)

8. i sampled 1st chapter and part of the second . there are hints of effective altruism , but not much . also , this taylor is stupidly straightforward . one would think that utmost priority for a parahuman whose power stops working when she is seen would be ways to prevent being seen . the obvious idea is making a lot of smoke bombs , making suit out of them , igniting them all . if someone sees you , you turn into smoke  spewing teenager . as soon as smoke obscures you , you gain your powers back . once smoke dissipates , you turn into smoke machine again . that ' s the idea i got by thinking about cheats for a minute . taylor who lives this , whose life and death depends on it , would think of a hundred more cheats . she did not . i am disappointed . also , i feel compelled to ask the questions  spoilers about ending of worm  s " can taylor win ? if yes  why did simurgh choose this timeline ? why didn ' t contessa involve taylor in her path to victory right away "
   (ID: fae28587bce17296589bf92d656ad68ee32601d6)

9. i seen what you did there
   (ID: 1bb2b5ec27ad0397aea65ab5151bd4a19742f52a)

10. what state is that ? the reason i ask is i ' ve seen plates for all digit states before but i ' ve never seen one like that
   (ID: 7026695d5469f9ac5987bd602ce0be29968523db)
