1. yeah i ' m guessing so . it would have to feel weird as hell though . they probably have a drug to duplicate that feeling .
   (ID: b5942acb07bb8a74e4924ef75fa70edb4f626161)

2. thank you for the reply . with their tone , i feel like many of the responses were as if my question was , " can i attempt to sleep with you while you are shopping . it ' s closer to , " what i feel compelled to strike up a conversation with you while you are shopping "
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

3. you seem to have your head on straight , you want to create something of your own , really embrace your parents ' legacy . if you really feel like its the right move and you ' re excited about it than no one can stop you . however , be prepared for long nights of your own , be prepared that if you do meet a woman and you do have kids that you might put them in the same situation you are in . now thats also an exaggeration , you could completely re invent the company to where you dont even have to lift a finger and youre home with your family all the time . but that will take a very long time . its all your personal preference man , dont completely rule out a college experience and a chance to take on a different path because you might hate working digit  digit in a factory with loud machines all day . whatever you choose to do , just make sure you ' re happy and keep your options open
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

4. there ' s more to life than what it is for you now . there ' s a whole fucking lot , little guy . you live , learn , experiment and feel a lot of things along the way , and you never even know what it ' ll bring you , which is the most fun part ! just like good ol ' retarded tom hanks once said
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

5. holy fuck me ! that ' s awful , i feel bad for your uncle ' s friend . , that ' s why i feel so bad for truckers , people are assholes because they think they are faster and can get away . what they forget is that the trucks are way bigger and will crush them like a bug , how did your he handle it after ? i can ' t imagine even though in a way the guy deserved it for being an ass , it still had to affect the driver . edit  spelling
   (ID: 45bf5c8227b94451beff1dce1059d0d2c683c40c)

6. it happened about a year and a half ago . i am unsure if i could still do so . looking back on it now i wish i had right away . then again i didn ' t quite know what was happening . you hear about it and know the stories . outside it seems so simple but inside it is just a cluster of confusion . i definitely did not feel black and white about it . i was in shock about it and actually just didnt let my mind process it . not to mention the extreme victim shaming and drama that was ensued by my ex over it . the prioritizing of his own feelings . he callrd it " what you did " and how could i have done this " to him " . it distracted me from really ever doing anything about it . and yeah , it was a big thing in my life . still is . i ' m still dealing with it . i found out recently that this guy has another case against him apparently . if i speak out it would help the case . but i am trying to heal . and i ' m currently unsure if i pursue going to the authorities what will happen . will it reopen everything . make it worse . will everyone turn against me again . will i lose the little friends i have left . will i feel worse ? will i find closure ? i will have to tell my parents . now that will just open up more wounds and i am already swimming in lacerations . i am just unsure if i have the strength to survive all of those factors . and until i find that strength i have kept quiet . but then on the other hand i am beginning to feel that if speak up i will find more strength and maybe more closure than i thought i needed . i don ' t even want to face or him or ever see him again . because this guy made me believe that he really cared about me . the lies he told me . if i ever see him again i don ' t know how i would react and i fear that as well . part of me still cares for the part of him that he pretended to be . so it still scares me that i might feel those feelings if i ser him again . for me its hard to let go of that person because i really needed the person he was with that mask on . and i fell for it . ah i dont know . but i do know that hes young . and capable of getting better at being that way . so something needs to be done so he doesn ' t do what he did to me to anyone else , or worse .
   (ID: 9981a65782780477b53d712e936b6997a4092240)

7. i mean tell him you feel like you ' re going back to the person you was . tell him your side of the story ! how you believe the fight was unnecessary . that you feel such a similar pain . who knows , maybe he understands and talking about it will grow the two of you closer together . perhaps there is a good friend who is willing to give you another perspective ?
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

8. hello , how do you mean you feel like your in the wrong place ? could you elaborate .
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

9. is there a particular reason you dont want baze ? i feel like it ' s the same with wiggs  if you have one , you might as well get the set .
   (ID: 800762ac8d54632109094a4e9132fe0aed711561)

10. not a secret but i feel like everyone should know that moai created all . it is the only true god and being . we are all simply spectacles of moai .
   (ID: 88279b92dca36b3b3c236d960135a2afe2e68b33)

11. i ' m generally against shaming suicide because they clearly feel bad enough to kill themselves already , but if you have kids and you kill yourself you ' re no better than a someone who abandons their kids for any other reason .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

12. only a hand full of times , i feel like the only thing it trains is core

13. you ' re colombian , i ' m guessing , yeah ? i feel you will finish first in your group .
   (ID: 3fb1292a0bd26711d797fe1a61e6229794c21b68)

14. that ' s you being afraid because you are creating thoughts in your own head about things possibly going wrong . if you were to do any of those activities you mentioned and at any point during them something made you feel nervous or that something is wrong , it ' s your gut feeling . think of fear as a thought process and your gut feeling as a natural reaction .
   (ID: 2db14c004e6ef125f85aa3678978a5718eebd11a)

15. let me tell you one thing . if you feel unloved , you are telling that to yourself , you are loved by everyone . depression is hard to pass and i am depressed for no reason it seems . my youth pastor has said that i  m telling myself that i  m a burden , that i  m bad and you probably are too .
   (ID: 29f3e9a3f8c02fc1b9aa346cffb8edec6caac89f)

16. hey man . you have value in your life . atm you might not see it but trust me when i say this . you should consider counseling . the way i get through my depression is this app . reddit has made my life so many times better . if you feel invaluable , remind yourself that we here , on reddit , love you . you are unique in your own way . we love everyone . here , you can drop all of your hardships . search for a purpose to live , if that  s religion , video games , programming , building stuff , reading , reddit , skateboarding , doing whatever . if you can occupy yourself in any way , do that . when you think about ending it , you get closer to ending it . if you think of living , you get closer to living . i hope the best . if you ever need to talk , i  m here for you , hell , all of us are here for you !
   (ID: 29f3e9a3f8c02fc1b9aa346cffb8edec6caac89f)

17. yes , it can . please don ' t misunderstand me , i ' m not putting you down in any way , or being negative . consider that more than digit  of the people on the face of the earth have never cut themselves on purpose , even once , in their whole lives . we don ' t have something wrong with our minds that drives us to cut ourselves to be able to feel something . i can only hope that you get yourself some psychiatric help to figure out why you do this to yourself , and learn how to feel something that isn ' t pain . i can ' t imagine what put you in that place . i hope you can find a way out of it .
   (ID: 514a3ecd0d04716c9225352c4a3a5d5424dd8056)

18. i feel like everyone but me is into hookups
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

19. so what actually happened ? what sorts of rumors  slander can be so bad that they cause him to step down ? i want to support him but i feel like i ' m only hearing part of the whole story .
   (ID: c1c3bee034ba3e70e4bd22d7987533e43f2b424b)

20. our commanders does the same thing and i understand why are they so pumped when giving out orders . if you are in the middle of a fight , he  she doesn ' t really have time to type out orders specially if the group was portal bombed . so at least the people in the channel gets the right instruction so that they could react appropriately . sometimes our guild run havoc groups when we don ' t feel like joining the zerg and i sometimes speak rapidly when we are in the middle of a scuffle . it ' s not much scolding but more of excitement specially if you can feel you can wipe the enemy zerg .
