   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

3. don ' t let that bother you , i believe in you and know that you will do fine . just for fun you should look on youtube for tips and tricks on selling cars
   (ID: e871625874733300de2a83384cee8c72546d3ec6)

4. yes i can but you will probably make fun of me if i say it . i use my senses . it gets me through a lot of things in life and not just listening to the ' smart ' people that try to get me to believe something that they want me to believe in . when i look around the world i can see that it is flat . i have never ever seen anything with my own eyes that makes me think the earth is round . that ' s why i believe that the earth is flat .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

5. aw i ' m really disappointed that you took my comment out of context  this is thehandmaidstale so context is the one thing that should be assumed here . adoptive parents are real parents . i thought that went without saying especially in the context of tht . stealing someone else ' s baby because you think you deserve it more than they do is not the same as adoption ! not even close ! since my original comment was so misunderstood let me be perfectly clear . adoption is agreed to by both biological mothers  parents and adoptive parents . everyone involved wants the child to have the best life possible . biological parents typically choose adoption because they believe that adoptive parents will love and care for the child . i believe that the wives aren ' t capable of loving and caring about these children more than their actual mothers , even though they have been deemed better and more worthy . now as far as parents biological or adoptive go , no one can love you more than they can . least of all a random couple who thinks they ' re better or more worthy than you .

6. it doesn ' t upset me at all . i don ' t believe it will help , but if it makes the other person feel better then fine .
   (ID: 2ad50e702ea7ef4cc62a34ca116f658d564c0474)

7. exactly my thoughts , regardless of whether you believe in god or not , this stands to be true .
   (ID: 8a0d7d262d95d9c10d914ff3b70f342e066aee23)

8. i believe it gives you a little bit more time as you still have enough time to walk under them before your timer is up and you can log out , and they would have to pathfind to you which takes longer than someone standing beside you . although i guess you could just barrage them and run while logging , i dunno .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

9. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

10. i view religion as a evolutionary barrier that humanity have to eventually overcome in order to march towards a bright and rational future . religion did indeed once have a purpose in human society , but i believe that purpose now no longer exists .
   (ID: c766fd259305ab2b0cd283ae4331fb90fc52e356)

11. because as like everything else we don  t believe in hear say bullshit . if we believed every bullshit story someone from the past wrote down we would still be worshiping cats and cutting off virgins clits . so from all of us to your god i say this  all it takes is a two minute appearance and boom , we  ll all believe  .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

12. well , i don ' t go around telling everyone i don ' t believe in the bible and all that nonsense . and i believe there are many people like me . it ' s easier to say nothiing most of the time unless confronted by one of those crazy people who want to send you to hell because you don ' t believe exactly like they do .
   (ID: fca46720f9aa154a0559b1e4d2d28cb0df46b00a)

13. i  ve never heard anyone complain about being an extrovert . yup believe it lol , this subreddit is borderline toxic because because are confusing anxiety  social anxiety with introversion . the extrovert subreddit has digit subs . compared to digit in introverts lol . and a whole lot of self doubt gets passed around this subreddit . i  m out peace .
   (ID: 79b35c8caff79f47f37bb4856cc6b57bcd49e5bf)

14. basically any truck commercial is ridiculous . especially the one with martin luther king , jr . speaking in the background . i could not believe dodge actually thought that was a good idea .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

15. yeah , show people blackadder or a bit of fry and laurie and they can ' t believe it ' s the same guy .
   (ID: 58245e8d537b9e7b6d76cc6a9919ea776e4ef6f0)

16. i don ' t believe that anybody feels the way i do , about you now .
   (ID: bfc2e9a6e5f84327293fa1a1fd0287066782bcec)

17. the best way to achieve balance is to eliminate emotion from any discussion regarding the control of these alpha predators . from the beginning of reintroduction , it was clear any logic had an uphill battle against the pro  wolf movement . i believe it was a mistake from the start , but i have adapted .
   (ID: 130fa156e7a286a021dcdff2492d6048231cb82f)

18. i like how you have nothing to do in your life except type insanely long answers to a random persons question . does it honestly matter to you what i think and believe in ?
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

19. how the hell is a thin cloth supposed to save you from oc spray and tear gas ? like i ain ' t trying to take sides here , but this argument is dumb , do you genuinely believe that will work ? these kids cover their faces out of the sheer edginess of larping as revolutionaries in the street , like antifa and the like , let ' s not bullshit ourselves here .
   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)
