1. i work in product development and while i haven ' t had any moral dilemmas nearly as big as these , there are often issues to consider . what if i can design a better widget , but our factory can ' t produce it so we would have to outsource it ? consumer gets a better product , profit margin might even be higher , but we decrease internal production and hurt other employees . it is kind of funny how the phrasing of this could cause reddit to hate or love it . stifling innovation seems to clearly be a bad thing , but there is tons of hate when people hear about companies that close their factories and produce goods elsewhere . if your new product is different enough , it is possible that the current factory can ' t be modified to produce it without basically gutting the whole place . even then your workforce has no experience producing the new item , so if you want good quality right away , outsourcing the manufacturing of the new design is the only viable solution .
   (ID: b650c9c531ec58d468c7c1fc9b7083efc4cbca9c)

2. what if i told you that you could have a new , better mom . a mom that isn  t alright with serving poison .
   (ID: 841a375b464a5650f1c027d1c7ae73415228c6ab)

3. this is the reason why i sort by new !
   (ID: 4167b7bc7d40ac86ca6b492ac0bbaefa992711f6)

4. same here . i ' m glad that the next chapter is free . i still haven ' t gotten the hag or shape chapters . but if the killer in the new chapter is fucking ridiculous like , say , a guy in a bunny suit , someone ' s gonna get a machete up they ass .
   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

5. it ' s not the game it ' s the fact every post is them thinking they are clever with a new name .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

6. how awesome for you ! congrats on the initial weight loss and your new baby boy . you ' ll get back down in no time . keto is amazing !
   (ID: fe374743dd856c29f2117723cef01c1fdc3b3b5b)

7. thank you ! i guess i  ve been too preoccupied with thinking about the  who am i now  and so ive completely failed to think about the  who do i want to be in the future  wow . this is eye opening . it seems so basic , but i completely missed it . thank you . . and new socks would be nice . there  s nothing better than a plush , new pair of socks .
   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

8. ok . i ' m genuinely curious . what possible course of action could you have done differently , to " save me " from the " burning world " as you put it . that required me beliveing in you ? what possible new resource do you gain from my belief in your " prediction " that will stop the world from burning ? or at least save me from this fiery premonition of doom ? p . s . i don ' t think listened and end is a good rhyme , and it maybe would have helped your case more if you rhymed all your " song ' s " verse .
   (ID: 808718709a1de9360ade79304c59728079eae812)

9. I live in new zealand.
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

10. when showing friends who are new to csgo or counterstrike in general i always go to community or casual classic servers just to get the " counterstrike " feeling and learn the maps . if you have no idea about what you have to do in the game it ' s no real use to head for competitive . ive met so many people in matchmaking who didnt even know that you have to plant or even defuse the bomb . knowing how to " eco " or what to buy is something you will learn on your own later on . to learn how the game even works would be my first priority . a lot of my friends are coming from games like cod and are new to the fact you have to buy your weapons and they still dont understand why you cannot buy your weapons you want every round .
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

11. only a few weeks ? fantastic ! you can start looking for a new job and leave this one off your resume .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

12. i will admit i worried about that a bit when we went to new zealand for our honeymoon . saw a lot on the internet about rampant tourism being out of control , etc . it turned out to be fine . we went in the end of a shoulder season us thanksgiving and built an itinerary of all the " second best " or " less popular but great " things  for example , hiking isthmus peak instead of roy ' s peak near wanaka  spending time in wanaka instead of queenstown . never underestimate the ability of crowds to all take the same photo and go to the exact same digit places .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

13. the new leperchaun movie
   (ID: bdbdc7c12fe37172b721ff3ae186b84ad646d582)

14. i guess it really depends on the location . some places may be way worse and others way better . best we can hope for is swift rollout of the new maps .
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

15. i ' m new to this . should i just start naming weird sex positions ?
   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

16. One of my favorite things is new information.
   (ID: 1b15fd08311192b471933a314f66dc758a923c02)

17. that sounds really fantastic . i had the same thing with my so , we didn ' t kiss until our third date . we ' re still together a year later , and i know we will be for the rest of our lives . it sounds like you know that , or something similar , about your new love . good on you , and i really hope it works out . thanks for posting this , it ' s nice to see something so happy and positive , especially given i ' ve been having kind of a rough time of late so aside , she ' s wonderful in every way imaginable .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

18. i swear people must sit here all day thinking up new questions to ask here ! this is something new atleast
   (ID: fada832baa55975057f6409e8926deefae094f1f)

19. i would say this is now my favourite audio on here , but i am still determined to get through your jerk off contestpart digit without having to hold back almost the entire time . your voice is perfect both for submission to the bull , and humiliating  dominating the husband . your cute but evil laugh is perfect for cuckolding . i keep looking forward to your new posts .
   (ID: 720bf2762acb0f756492e6e40ae840126dae87ce)

20. right ? i was so glad they played maud gone at that show , though i preferred their version at shaky knees the most . what did you think of the new stuff ?
