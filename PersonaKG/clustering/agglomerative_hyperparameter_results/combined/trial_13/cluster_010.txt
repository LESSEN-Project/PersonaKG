1. it ' s been a really rough year for me and it ' s so encouraging to see jack so happy and kind . what i love most about jack is that he really seems to care . i get a feeling that he has less of a " youtube persona " and more that on youtube he shows off a true energetic and happy side of himself .
   (ID: abbe051c76bbb939d8594349cac549cb5435920d)

2. it will be ok and just imagine the relief when it ' s all over and in the past ! your doctor will not scold you for holding off on appointments , she will be happy you came in ! even if you have the worst case scenario , you will be in the right place , plus most cervical cancers are treatable when caught in time .
   (ID: d8014467041b98317d9f1dec2b0dae4ff9405b91)

3. even though felix constantly gets targeted by vox , wsj , and other mainstream media , he doesn  t let that effect him , he just ignores it since the articles aren  t true . he doesn  t do what makes us happy , he does what makes him happy . he helped some smaller channels get popular . so felix is truly a kind and caring youtuber
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

4. do you think you are human , or anything else ? digit . are you happy ? what else can i do that would make you happy ?
   (ID: 2ce191fd1043183c73daf2ab41afee9b122fd42b)

5. i see . i feel people want others to exercise to conform to their standards using health and physique as a dumb excuse rather then caring about someone being happy . ofcourse it is different when someone is obese but you get the message . also , many sports are boring and gyms are full of toxic shits anyway .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

6. there  s a reason mr nye is so happy all the time , and it  s in that elevator
   (ID: 7bd4f8e2f55f684df651b44f2faa8769031fc782)

7. she ' s lucky to have a guy like you who is out here trying to make an effort to keep her happy . good people deserve to stay on top . you mean well and i pray she sees it just as that . best wishes in your endeavors brother
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

8. if you ' re happy and making enough to live comfortably in the manner of your choosing then it sounds like you ' re getting what you need most out of the job . what do you need beyond that ? maybe that person needs more , and that ' s fine for them . find something to do that makes you happy , surround yourself with people who do the same .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

9. hey . firstly you need to speak to someone be it a doctor or the samaritans , someone . secondly why are you looking up reasons instead of looking inwards and seeing what the actual issue is . do you have depression or something that maybe people around you don ' t know how to handle ? what kind of person are you ? are you kind ? thoughtful ? generous with your time ? empathetic ? honest ? nice ? these are all traits that people like . or are you selfish ? negative ? deceitful ? apathetic ? narcissistic ? irresponsible ? egotistical ? you can change your behaviour and your characteristics . you are not always going to be the person you perceive yourself to be now . everyone has the potential to change and grow . believe in yourself . only you have the ability to make yourself happy . don ' t depend on others to validate you . mind yourself .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

10. i would never want to measure it because i don ' t want to be either sad or happy about it since making me sad is giving me insecurities about my body and happy might make me cocky no pun intended about it . i am happy with it and it gets the job done well .
   (ID: 2971f819c4d7400b9fa7806434e9037b6af4dfae)

11. i would say that has some truth to it . shows and movies are getting more realistic and we realize that life doesn  t always have a happy ending but there  s still a story to be told . if look back to  50s   80s , almost every movie that depicts the future was very vibrant and colorful and everyone was happy . but in today  s cinema every time we see the future on screen it  s dark and dismal and destroyed . something to think about

12. loool how can imad say that his batting was up to the mark and that he was very happy what ! even inzy ' s interviews made more sense

13. they are the best . they raised with great values and always supported me to do what makes me happy in life even though one of my dreams was to live digit time zones away from them .
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

14. yep . it happens . i noticed that i developed a crush on someone else . nothing wrong with so , and i still care for them just no longer in love with them . it ' s heartbreaking to realize especially when there is no right thing to do that makes everyone happy .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

15. i ' ve always been of the mind that marriage isn ' t for me . along comes my current partner and i can ' t get it out of my head . and i ' m happy about it . it ' s kinda crazy that way .
