   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

5. i don ' t recall hearing the word sportbike when i had a norton in the digit ' s . i think it may not have been invented yet . none the less , norton was the sportbike of its day . there were plenty faster bikes but no one could keep up with me on the mountain roads .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

6. i don ' t really buy that , as she ' s racing to the next interview , where she does the same shit . seems more like she wants to keep rolling on to the end of the hour and get the day ' s work over with . or trying to squeeze way too much into one show . why not just take your time with one interview . like literally everyone else on cnn ?
   (ID: a3c37892d1eb5776c9a4299ce29fc6200c20dd34)

8. a friend of mine was being a dick on a constant daily basis after a recent event happened . like he would criticize every thing i did like how i played a game or ate food or even laughed . it bothered him so much he had to say something harsh every damn minute . but his comments pissed me off so much after a few months that one day i snapped and screamed in front of all our friends " diego you became a fucking asshole ever since your dad died " and there my moment was .
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

   (ID: 589a27cacaffb5126785db9f91c141a3cea2daae)

11. i was nice to the new guy and now he insists on calling me throughout the day talking about shit i don  t care about for like digit minutes a time . i always have to make an excuse to get off the phone . also he got my number off the work group chat . it  s annoying af .
   (ID: c391065478603a686531cbdd50568136a5e14508)

12. make the most of the time you have with them . cherish the little moments . my dad plays harmonica and is really good . i always thought it was weird but the older i get the more i appreciate it . it  s not my cup of tea but i know one day i  ll miss hearing it . life is short and you only get one chance at it so make the most of every day .
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

13. who said anything about cutting calories ? i said eating . once . a . day . eating once a day doesn  t necessarily mean you  re cutting calories . it depends on what you eat and how physical you are . i assumed the op eats something high in calories and fat for that one meal which if you eat a meal with those characteristics you will hinder any weight loss efforts but the op said they  re not trying to lose weight so it  s irrelevant .
   (ID: 60a31a4071ae4962f2a308822d53a634a3760fa1)

14. thank you . sorry anthrobird , i didn ' t mean to detract from your thread or your question , just to try to reassure you that what you are feeling is completely normal and it is difficult and i am sure that anyone could understand the way you feel .
   (ID: 2ce191fd1043183c73daf2ab41afee9b122fd42b)

15. i wonder what would happen if for one day they switched what the upvotes and downvotes do .
   (ID: f46d1bfdfed7fc05bbe39789c092019944471e9d)

16. the truth is that we all have our flaws and if your brain cells are so underdeveloped that it is impossible t9 even have the slightest empathy then i feel sorry for you .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

17. oh my , this is really well done . i could listen to you ' re voice all day .

   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

19. this is the hardest thing to deal with in this day and age . this kind of stuff has happened to me and what i did was tell twitch and stuff like that . they don  t listen to creators now . it  s super difficult .
   (ID: 29f3e9a3f8c02fc1b9aa346cffb8edec6caac89f)

20. i don ' t think the complainers get it . the guy could ' ve retired and then there would no more new shows ever . the fact is , when he was terrestrial , he was a machine because he needed to keep high ratings to justify the costs . now that ratings don ' t mean as much and he ' s an older guy he ' s entitled to more time off . he warned everyone over and over and sometimes i think you won ' t appreciate the digit  day weeks until it ' s all re  runs all the time .
