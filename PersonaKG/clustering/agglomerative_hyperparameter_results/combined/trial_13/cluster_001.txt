1. me ? i dont have an existential crisis anymore i accepted we probably live in a simulation a while ago sounds stupid but look up neil degrass tyson ' s video on it he explains it really well but you should probably just take your mind off of it and or work toward accepting it and like me it might give you some weird peace knowing that nothing you ever do will matter .
   (ID: 0501bf1e5cd313190bb4590a1c677057b15a6e47)

2. i know a few people who are approaching the ends of their lives , yes . i don ' t look forward to their death or anything , but i understand and accept that they have to die . everyone dies eventually . we should focus on making the time that we have better instead of desperately stretching it out , and making overpopulation worse .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

3. kinokuniya has some specific anime ones but they  re expensive . honestly just print your own on sticker paper or look for those cheap sticker collections on souq  amazon . ae
   (ID: 7c96bac704435347f721cc9a3056b8d7be16cc06)

4. i ' ve developed the habit of just not openening my mouth as wide when i yawn . it ' s almost like muscle memory now although occasionally a wide one happens and it ' s mildly unsettling . lol . i recently had someone tell me to look down when yawning as you physically can ' t open your mouth as wide . good technique if you can remember it .
   (ID: 2ad50e702ea7ef4cc62a34ca116f658d564c0474)

5. one might wonder if it was your experience , and not your age that had to do with that though . i can certainly see the draw of stability , but im sure your kids love you regardless .
   (ID: 4972a31c1a3df007d761e27a613a3b6a99c3a0ca)

6. yes , he is your president , even if you didn ' t vote for him . you don ' t get a participation trophy for protesting . youth may be the future , this is the now and we need someone to fix this mess our country is in . maybe some day when you ' ve experienced how the real world works and start paying real taxes you ' ll change your stance on what you want your children ' s " future " to look like .
   (ID: de5db66359e6314e9bac24fd9a10ec1d49584c4f)

7. it ' s hilarious to see americans take guesses , like the rest of the world didn ' t fucking exist lol just look at what happens where it already is legal , dummies .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

8. a brief look and i am guessing it is real . i can ' t take any more than a brief look as my liver is already in open rebellion and i think exposure to that site would probably prompt a few more organs to join it .
   (ID: 59ebeb8d8fee755bce043a6482743bde8a2a0bb1)

9. im pretty sure everyones gay . by degree . do you like porn ? do you like your women ravaged by a flaccid penis ? or a hard one ? . see you just realized you ' re digit  more gay
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

10. i have issues with this . why is a blind person using a pencil . why are they trying to colour something . are they drawing something ? if so what are they drawing , does it look like the thing ? or is it like in the episode of becker where jake sculpts a woman but it looks kind of like a blob , until he explains that it is how she feels ?
   (ID: 8360c6d04ba11da7a727532482d78505e52a4150)

11. guess that would be dependent upon the weirdos that make up the community . what kind of weirdos are these ? what do they look like ? what do they sound like ? what are their hobbies ?
   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

12. you can  t prove that the soul resides in your body . when you  re dreaming even if you know you  re dreaming you  re there in that body . when you  re in  real life  you  re here . you , aren  t what you look like , you is somewhere else .
   (ID: b5511d022d9aa43868b3f1a7ca2e4368d861570c)

13. i think the guy just look like him , not much more to it .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

14. if it was easy op wouldn ' t ask for a quality of life change qol suggestions aren ' t limited to being difficult , in fact most of them i see are purely because the current version is annoying . stop trying to argue against qol suggestion with skill cap complaints , literally everything in the game can be considered part of the skill cap . e . g . why show a number for gold when you can just see if there ' s a gold rim around the item you want , why show health  mana numbers when you can just look at the bar , why show health  mana at all when you can just calculate how much health your hero has at each level with each item then calculate mathematically the damage after reductions of each enemy spells as they happen . my point is that skill complaints are nonconstructive criticism and just plainly bad arguments .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

15. it may be a little unclear now that i think about it , but if you look at the timecodes , i also won the first lost run i did ever .
   (ID: c9b1e924c86788c982ec59df3d5704354a2a4ae1)

16. they need to belive that they are actually going , imagine the look on their faces when they see mars just passing by their windows
   (ID: 35c328d4a335c5fd9ddfe5f40bbfd2580065561c)

17. you insinuated that you were a member of avo . so you are a member or you think it would be cool to be one . either way i ' m sure there are better servers for you .
   (ID: ddbcd7b957a26c37891ce72069afaf688ba19977)

18. hmmm . she might just be cold , what does her poop look like ?
   (ID: 801c30bb9f7fe270789d76054d77c547f65e41eb)
