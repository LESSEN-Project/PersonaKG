8. " best results ever tested on headphones drivers " this is the stupidest comment i ' ve read all day , it ' s like a lie donald trump would tell . is this the official company line ? there ' s no such thing as " the best " are you saying it ' s the closest to the harman target response curve do you know what that is even ? that would be notable , but no reasonable person would call it " the best " because there ' s no such fucking thing ! only an idiot who ' s only owned headphones they carry at wal  mart would say something like that , while patting themselves on the back for how smart they think they sound

9. i  m digit  sure that this is nothing more then a well intended attempt to  spice things up  also , i read some reviews on the stuff , there are lots of ladies saying really good things about it . from what i  ve read , it is supposed to intensify sexual experience for the women who use it . hey , think about it . all of the stuff in there was for you and your pleasure . it was stuff that you like , along perhaps with something that he thought that you might enjoy . consider how it is advertised  actually copied and pasted from ads for this product  like a virgin makes it feel like the first time ! works so well , you and your partner will feel like you  ve travelled back in time to your first encounter . like a virgin is an alum  based tightening cream that can tighten the vaginal walls making penetration more pleasurable to a woman and her partner . the tightening of the vaginal walls may increase sensation during penetration ! as married couples , we go through so many things together . we confide things and discuss things that we would never tell anyone else ! i don  t know if you read all of these posts , there are so many . i hope that you see mine and realize that the poor sap fell for a clever marketing scheme ! the product is marketed toward women , with promises of enhancing a woman  s sexual experience . don  t feel sad , he just wanted to get your rocks off .

15. still have to read it , but only heard praises to shangri  la by mathieu bablet . here  s the summary  in a faraway future a few hundred years from now , humanity lives in a space station far from earth . the station is not ruled by a government , but by a multinational corporation that everyone seems to almost worship . in appearance , the station  s inhabitants seem to be content with this  perfect society  . in this context , men want to push their own limits and become the equals of the gods themselves . and through the implementation of a program intended to create life from nothing on one of the most hospitable regions of titan , shangri  la , they intend to rewrite  genesis  their own way . meanwhile , a hero is sent to investigate the mysterious explosions that have occurred in some of the laboratory stations that have been studying this process of creating life  from nothing .

16. the most common entry points are  gaunt  s ghosts  follows a company of imperial army soldiers led by comissar gaunt . good for a perspective of the regular soldier in this grimdark setting eisenhorn trilogy  follows inquisitor eisenhorn and is a good source to understand how the imperium works space wolf omnibus  follows the process of recruitment  training  creation of a space marine . the main character knows almost nothing of the galaxy , so he and the reader learn together horus heresy where i started  it actually is warhammer 30k , with it  s story being about the imperium civil war and the rise of chaos across the galaxy . self contained and explains why things are so bad in 40k . the only problem is that it  s a huge series with over digit books though not all are necessary reading . yet i absolutely encourage you to read  em all
   (ID: 127d601df381c9f971eae1e3fd42953571015813)

17. i can ' t watch the films due to the fact that i ' ve not read the books . i know that ' s weird

18. read the book and you ' ll find out . it ' s not that bad , really . it just gives some insight into king ' s mind . he ' s a pervert , just like the rest of us . he ' s just not ashamed to have his name attached to it .

20. i read what you put at the beginning but if you believe they should ' ve been in the top digit , you could ' ve included them anyway . i just don ' t think there should ' ve been an honorable mention list for intros that are worthy of being in the actual list .
