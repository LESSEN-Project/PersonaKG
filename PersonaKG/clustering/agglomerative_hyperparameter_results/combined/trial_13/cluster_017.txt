1. thing is i wouldn  t call it a debate if we were to go by the textbook definition . i could almost guarantee that if i sat down with lorinbassnectar he wouldn  t want to have a debate about policy he would simply shut me out . i  m sure , and maybe i  m making an assumption , but i  m sure that we could both agree that a lot if not the majority of his fan base has no knowledge about policy and simply follows what is posted . that  s what i find dangerous . when so many people look up to an individual they treat his words as facts , and this applies to both sides of the aisle . i also call it dangerous because it is a sure way of not only ostracizing a large portion of your fan base who listens to your music to escape reality but it could even pose the problem of many people losing hope in one place where they thought they could find it , and that is dance music . that  s just me and i can tell from the many downvotes that  s it  s not a very popular opinion .

2. digit  agree . my 6th grade science teacher did this and it was so much fun going to that class .
   (ID: 01d091dafa86b9d15d91404a1a02a0fc98011e8c)

3. out of interest do you think you should be able to send anything you want to anyone else ? if not where do you draw the line ? i think almost everyone can agree that threats of violence should not be protected under freedom of speech . that said , thank you for offering your take on this , it was very informative .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

4. i agree with you . it ' s disrespectful when people say friend zoned . all you want me for is to get in my pants ? if you don ' t value my friendship then just leave .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

5. just say you disagree , if they want your reason , they ' ll ask for it . then , they can decide whether to agree with you or not .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

6. i agree , though bumblebee is a bit more frustrating due to how tough it can be to properly transform him .
   (ID: 718ff22055f41bd70e24ec98f0898a1526112965)

7. i don ' t know all the rules and have been the gm for a few years now . i agree that everyone starts somewhere . look up matt colville on youtube . he has some excellent ideas .
   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

8. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

9. i totally agree ! it ' s hurtful and harmful for so many reasons and for everyone ! why does anyone want that straight bar right where the jumblies are !
   (ID: aa8abed66c32a0519ab922c1a606563d97de28fc)

10. i wasn  t in high school . i wasn  t born when it was made . i agree it  s a bit over  rated and the memes are a bit forced but it all comes down to  the show most people grew up with .  it  s a similar situation to the office , in the fact that everyone loves it because it  s just popular . i don  t know a single person who willingly watches spongebob anymore by themselves so it  s all just nostalgic nonsense speak of random clips from the show

11. i ' m not sure that abortion is the reason . most of our parents were in the " silent generation "  that group of people who grew up in the great depression but were too young for wwii . the greatest generation crammed all their child rearing into the post war period and the result was the baby boom . the baby boomers are the moms and dads of gen y . i agree we are the best generation , though . i ' m proud to say that while the baby boomers partied in the mud at the original woodstock our generation rioted at the one they tried to put on for us .

12. that still sounds like you are condrodicting yourself , someone can not be smoking hot and also be unattractive . but whatever , agree to disagree ?
   (ID: ba841e2486d1df5b5baefde5ead0636c7c03c79c)

13. i do agree with the stop memorizing stuff , but i think we need to focus on what we teach first before we focus on how . i think a student should be able to teach it to have a true understanding of what they ' ve learned
   (ID: 7008f149db59fea91167255eafa8bc84beab0f01)

14. i feel like you put more thought into this than i did but i definitely agree with everything you said except how it was turn two , a lot of ads these days don  t actually have atk bar boosters a lot still do too but my josephine would get turn digit fairly often and strip  provoke whatever threat was thanks for taking the time to analyze my strats !
   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

15. if you can ' t learn , what ' s the point of having this discussion at all , right ? and yes i agree there ' s no point in trying to regulate or advocate any life choices to anyone unless one is willing to uphold them oneself first . i ' m sorry but it feels like you have had to deal with a lot of hypocritical people especially people who have been unempathetic about the situations infertile people work under . i apologise if i came across that way .
   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

16. i don ' t understand your point ? are you ok with having someone kick your ass for jaywalking ? if not then we can agree that vigilantism isn ' t permitted .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

17. there are no kids , and i agree with you a hundred percent . it is best to end it . but it ' s hard confused  face
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

18. i completely agree with you , if anything people who are  special  have it better off a lot of the times . a person could act the same way as another person and just because the reason behind that one person is medically known they would get special treatment and the other would not even they couldn  t control it either .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

19. i think a lot of us can agree " daddy " is creepy as hell , but the idea of spanking is just as creepy for me .
   (ID: 36314aee005a03517f2446ec0da2834fe0f712d6)

20. ha i agree but in your own opinion with this scenario who would you go with and why ? based on what you know from comics ?
