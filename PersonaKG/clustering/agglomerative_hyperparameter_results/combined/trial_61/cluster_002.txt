9. lol ! but seriously , it ' s ok for people to talk about thing in hindsight , but if you are in a situation like that and feel threatened and are concerned for your families safety then calling ti an over reaction is slightly wrong . i mean , an over reaction would be to keep going right ? one hit and she was down , he didn ' t start stomping on her like so sort of berserker . that would have been an over reaction . he pushed her way after she pushed him to show that they shouldn ' t mess with him . she started to advance on him , in his mind he is surrounded by a bunch of teens who will most likely fallow her lead . one punch in self defence and in defence of his family . situation deescalated . obviously one punch could have killed the girl . but she and her pack of friends were the aggressor . should he just man up and let them feast on his bloody corpse while his family run for shelter ?   x200b
