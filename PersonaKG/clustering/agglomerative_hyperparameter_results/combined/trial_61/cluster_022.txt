   (ID: 45bf5c8227b94451beff1dce1059d0d2c683c40c)

16. it ' s not really shepard anymore , the shepard ai has much bigger priorities than talking to an old crew now . everyone would think he just died during the crucible firing .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

17. i was waiting for someone to call him a narcissist because that ' s more fitting . but you still want to use the coward name as well as if the correspondent dinner was so important that you find him in contempt for missing it . if you find missing a social function of no significance cowardly then you would probably have to believe everyone is a coward . everyone has missed something weather it was work or a party or some other social function simply because we didn ' t like it . everything he is doing most people do as well . avoid things they don ' t like and do things they do like . what i don ' t understand is why there is such a high value placed on the functions he avoids . if your favorite person was president and missed it would you think they are a coward as well ? or would you automatically justify their actions ? by all means if you like the word coward then use it but it seems childish when there are better words to use . again i don ' t support trump but he gives you guys such wonderful opportunities to look smart and be little him at the same time and so many throw them away to use childish name calling . i can ' t say exactly why you use that word but i can tell you through my digit years of life digit  of the time it ' s simply a insulting derogatory use rather than an actual character assessment .
   (ID: 25ac51284c94eb6c58e189bbefc7f2bb9bb9e1b5)

18. you need to get on this ride . i have been on it for like digit years and every single day he makes me laugh . every single day he outdoes himself . it ' s like he ' s in a competition to be the stupidest person in history and he ' s miles ahead of everyone else .
   (ID: 24bccbf5956c17ad493afaca1dced8dd5090f865)

19. i don ' t know what kind of eye corrections he had done but when i had mine done i needed full wrap glasses that were technically out of regs they came with a lanyard so i still was able to do pt and normal day to day activities . depending on what was done you could end up doing irreparable damage to his eyesight . dick for not informing anyone and placed himself at risk but if he has a profile he ' s got a profile not much you can do . could nc him technically for not keeping everyone in the loop but that would just be reaching imo .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

20. i have been playing the bass since . september ? but i am well aware of meme wizard davie . i do wonder if he is aware that he did a voice reveal a while back though .
