1. well you can only lose your virginity once so that  s not really a question did he make you lose trust in other men ?
   (ID: 6ab15493c00b6b6223b3fca29e367366c44d8578)

2. I have a girlfriend.
   (ID: 62dd5d4401c12ad4672526fa5c980c544020cf98)

3. it sounds like friend a has reason to feel that way . if the two of you have expressed attraction to one another and don ' t have the courtesy of open communication with friend a , that gives rise to some suspicion . why are you hanging out without inviting friend a ? why are you two seemingly ganging up on friend a when they share these feelings of discomfort ? i ' m not saying you ' re betraying them , but it doesn ' t sound like you ' re being kind either . if the friendship falls apart , it sounds like it ' s because everybody had a hand in it , not just friend a .
   (ID: 022767076c8e9ed224fa7eeaf7db901f4f85512b)

4. i like  agree with what he ' s saying . he just isn ' t most people ' s idea of " a wordsmith . how much can you really fault him for that ?
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

5. I have a wife.
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

6. knowing you have an issue and truly wanting to change is i really positive first step . do you know why you react in this manner . was that the way relationships were modeled to you by your family ? do you have anger management issues ? growing up , i was quick to anger or to feel hurt by others behavior . i ' ve found that if i ' m really angry , i have to walk away . in the heat is the moment , i can ' t think clearly . sometimes i have to take discussions for a couple days . this gives me time to not only assess the situation , but also my feelings . it is essential to me to understand why something has bothered me . sometimes it ' s the actual issue , but others times it turns out to be something secondary to the original problem . and sometimes it ' s just me overreacting to the problem . i ' ve also found that when i ' m really upset , it better for me to write my husband a letter explaining the issue , and my feelings surrounding it . this allows me to be honest , and rational .
   (ID: 854fece503b60c994d3291263ce8495e5048d976)

7. talk to him about it . if he seems to dislike it as much as you do then i  m sure you can find a common ground of when in the hectic schedules it  s more likely to happen if either of you initiate .  dry  spells happen in every relationship at some point and it  s important to talk about it and reassure him it  s not a guilt trip rather seeking open feedback because you feel so strongly about it .
   (ID: e7516540d2045135f43a4a7c61f0bd88856c8ff4)

8. the same thing happened to me . i do believe that there are induviduals who misuse sm and take it too far crossing the line to rape . mine eased me into a light sm world . very light . made me trust him . told me all of these things . then when i was pulling away from him he went from digit  digit and choked me into a submissive state . when you fear for your life and that you won ' t wake back up the next time he chokes you until you pass out , you go into shock . or at least i did . i thought " i can ' t say no because if he doesn ' t get what he wants he will hurt me more " and that was a serious thing for me because i couldn ' t possibly have imagined that he wanted more . but he did . then he went right past sm and straight towards torture and humiliation . all without my consent . he knew exactly what he was doing . he knew from our previous discussions that i never would have allowed that to happen . he also knew me . so he choked me enough to make it happen for him . i ' m sorry you went through all that . sm can be really tricky , my personal experience aside . because i really don ' t have any . but i did do a lot of reading on it after my rape . to help me understand why . it takes a lot of trust . if someone goes against your comfort zones it is not a good sign . a sm shoukd always be respectful no matter what .

9. I have a wife.
   (ID: b5f9b695867ef3b560a4fe7610f75e43b62809f6)

10. either she has changed and you move past it or you just have different moral standards and that is not something you can just get over
   (ID: bef3bdf131cc9dbe9d33343a3b9988680236cf9d)

11. sorry , that probably came off as a why not essential oils ? type of comment . i do hope you find some good documentation to show him , as what you  re going through is horrific .
   (ID: 765135d22ccec6feceb4fa47636d721a4530a57c)

12. i agree with you to a large extent , but part of me imagines some couples just like doing things for one another thus that they don ' t let their so do certain chores as its their contribution to the relationship . so i understand how it can happen unintentionally without someone being lazy , or useless .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

13. understanding why you broke up , and why you  re both better off that way . unless there was cheating you should be able to stay friends after any relationship
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

14. I have a girlfriend.
   (ID: c65a473965fbe88679c85b0d206d90b8c65789fe)

15. you ' re pretty self  congratulatory about your relationship , but the examples you give further down are far different than the struggles some people have in their relationships . failed exam ? not getting promoted ? that ' s life . if you have to pat yourself on the back for staying with someone through that then perhaps you have a different and privileged lens . my read on this thread is that their partner has persistent deep rooted issues that aren ' t improving despite ops best efforts and support . it can take the relationship beyond saving , and it ' s important to recognize that and take care of yourself   if all other options have failed . so revolution outcast ,  digit for the advice from half  elfbard .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

16. that is a real problem , and it is one thing i ' ve really struggled with reading posts on this subreddit . commentors are naturally quick to suggest a break  up  it ' s easy for them to say , they are not emotionally involved in the relationship . but that ' s the thing , if you love someone , if you ' re in a relationship , you will have fights once in a while , there is conflict , you won ' t always agree and you will be frustrated by things your partner says or does . for a stranger it is easy to say to just walk away from the situation when reality is not what they want it to be . but this is not how you will be able to grow a strong , sustainable relationship with a partner that you ' re deeply emotionally connected with . i wish people would be a bit more sensitive in this thread , rather than just see it as a quick opinion release for entertainment purposes .
   (ID: 93e9e943e9d5e6606a938961fd4d02312afb101b)

17. i feel like you don ' t understand anything about the human mind . you are objectively wrong , yes i am now talking facts not opinion just to be clear . when someone is in a relationship their brain becomes attached in certain ways after experiencing things so for an example , you cuddle with your girlfriend and you two both enjoy that , then your brain will start to crave that to fell good , but if your girlfriend stops cuddling with you , you and or your brain might feel like now it needs more out of the relationship to feel good because it ' s missing that important piece , cuddling . now after a long while your brain will instinctively tell you and make sure you know and are aware that you need to cuddle to feel good , so now instinctively your brain will want you to find someone else to cuddle with , but but you still love and adore your girlfriend but she isn ' t giving you everything out of the relationship so you need someone else to fill the gaps , it ' s usually not something someone can just control . people don ' t just cheat cuz they think it ' s fun , unless if they are clinically insane or extremely sadistic . usually another factor in cheating is that your brain doesn ' t want to ask for it from your partner because you may think you might not ever get it from them . cheating is still fucked up and wrong but you need to understand all of that before saying anything
   (ID: 93e3d10c1d0bffae76c0adb5d9a96d6abf1aade9)

18. so you haven ' t actually told the guy you ' re not interested ? seems this guy doesnt get the hint and can ' t mind read , but he seems harmless from what you described . just some guy who was interested and you are not . just tell the dude you don ' t want anything to do with him . he ain ' t psychic . and your account is a couple days old , what ' s your alt account that you used to post on letsnotmeet ?
   (ID: dceaf5128ce079240dc5048df74d704163edc3a5)

19. don ' t wanna over  pry but any particular reason you stayed with these guys if you weren ' t super into them ? or was it just early on in the relationship so there wasn ' t an attachment yet ?
   (ID: 5f43a3019d69696064ac659bf6dd25b51f1e5bb6)

20. why do i feel like he ' s just vaping in his ask
