7. One of my favorite things is human beings.
   (ID: 00b878c3a1ec656c05e2872b35fdccfcfda3baac)

8. the fear of spiders is not something humans are born with , it is something you learn . if your parents always start screaming and crying when they see spiders , you ' ll learn to think spiders are scary . dogs also don ' t have an instinctual fear of spiders , so they would have to be taught to fear them too . most dogs aren ' t afraid of spiders , so they don ' t have a born fear of them either . but i ' ve seen dogs that are afraid of spiders , and their owners are always afraid of them too , so it seems they can learn it too .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

9. it isn ' t animal cruelty to leave a dog home for that long . while i ' m at school , my dog is left home for around digit to digit hours , and most of the time she sleeps , plays with her toys , or just stares out the window . as long as they ' re well potty  trained it won ' t be painful or hard to hold it together for that amount of time . when my dog was a puppy we had someone to come at noon and let her out , but now she doesn ' t need that anymore .
   (ID: 38a1a6eac84444872020421e5880d0a28cd981e1)

17. by that logic , we shouldn  t allow driving at all because it increases the risks of harm to people and people  s pets . it is already being worked on self driving cars to minimise the potential of crashes . here is a article about that  dough i do understand what you are trying to say , i would still just do rules like that because still , it puts the animals in danger . earlier you said that weed lessens the aggression , but sooner or later other drugs will be legalized where they do make people more aggressive . that is the problem . by just having rules like that it would atleast prevent a few drug users to buy pets , which is better then nothing wouldn ' t you say ? sure it maybe just prevents digit drug users from buying pets , but thats better then nothing in my opinion .
