   (ID: 5c7a23731c46d9c75722023d6108cb45a421fb75)

2. when showing friends who are new to csgo or counterstrike in general i always go to community or casual classic servers just to get the " counterstrike " feeling and learn the maps . if you have no idea about what you have to do in the game it ' s no real use to head for competitive . ive met so many people in matchmaking who didnt even know that you have to plant or even defuse the bomb . knowing how to " eco " or what to buy is something you will learn on your own later on . to learn how the game even works would be my first priority . a lot of my friends are coming from games like cod and are new to the fact you have to buy your weapons and they still dont understand why you cannot buy your weapons you want every round .
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

3. just look at the flowers . that and fear have gone down such a shit hole it ' s beyond sad . gj ruining a good thing gimple and co .
   (ID: ed8c4bb1975edb0f627baa6dac44e74cbc7237c6)

4. i  m so confused , it has not been delayed why does everybody think that ? i don  t think the site ever even said spring where you guys think it did . i could be wrong , correct me if so
   (ID: 09ceeb62f2a165a9c38283d43984e8e6f6f5580e)

5. why would you have to do it on the smith ?
   (ID: 441f42a774bfb13dc694fc8515be8a2da22decb1)

6. the overall monetization and and grinding you need to do to get some cosmetics and a few guns . if you don  t get the guns by the time the season ends you have to rely on rng from the caches . the gameplay has gotten boring and zombies hasn  t received many good updates besides the dlc maps . that  s how
   (ID: d53ad0bccb6d6f62bf1a4957708759d7b446498b)

7. not to video game , when your loved one i presume ? is in a hospital .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

8. impossible question because of personal opinion . films connect with different people for different reasons . emotional , traumatic , loving , inspirational . there ' s a lot to consider . i study film and in all honesty there is no greatest movie of all time . you can potentially answer this question with a few films that are technically and creatively the best but i believe that the greatest films are the ones the make you feel something unique . me personally always been a batman fan but not much of a marvel superhero fanboy and so thats why the dark knight is one of my all time creations . the feeling of truth , power and responsibility in that film will always affect me . but if you whole heartedly believe that something like happy gilmore or harry potter is the greatest movie of all time then go for it . im sure theres a reason why and no one can tell you otherwise .
   (ID: 373e4a2c6b02258f35adf64ee79e2e3f52d4b654)

9. yeah but that  s like saying you don  t want to build any other caliber but 9mm because the magazines won  t fit . i understand what you  re saying but from a practically stand point you  re talking about building something that doesn  t have any support other than a small niche . the glock platform has been gone over a billions times now and everyone knows how to use it . also you can get digit round mags for glock at around  digit all day .
   (ID: 7a9e9aefc410e8b5acd9c3517008c5fafa71b994)

10. yeah . its good but here ls a lesson i learned for communicating online . you never know who is on the other end , so never say something you might regret . what if your parent uses reddit and gets into an argument with you ? total exaggeration but you get the point
   (ID: ea5cdb41822e9eac6a4230514be598981cadabcb)

11. i ' d be fine paying more if they didn ' t drop king of the hill , stargate , doctor who , babylon digit , mash , etc .
   (ID: 47503483b65f94d9e176031a7c8a7bff26fdb36c)

12. definitely . that ' s why i think it might appeal to someone with a gun to my head . either that , or maybe they ' ll think , " this is one sick mf ' er i ' m dealing with here .
   (ID: 338e964d6f616e85c5b26cf7b63ec2dba22cf7ba)

13. did you say that sao the original not abridged was good what is wrong with you ?
   (ID: 1df1bd07e28c0df73bd865f8cb447d7c8f1bd4d3)

14. this is the one thing i ' m sure won ' t happen .
   (ID: ad354e4ff17df20491ccc56909f27492df8892fb)

15. i think damage should be the number one criteria . that ' s the whole point of fighting , right ? i feel like aggression is a terrible way to score if you ain ' t hurting no one . i mean , i can follow someone , make a mean face , growl , and point at them angrily . that ' s not fighting though .
   (ID: 3b00a7fe72d71c6162850ad66e6322e5d78fb79d)

16. it was a franchise about killing greek gods . then we kind of slid in the viking world which made little to no sense . i don ' t want a white greek going around killing chinese god ' s too . that just doesn ' t fit . you can make his kid do it for all i care . but not kratos
   (ID: 199704b2ab3344a95185dd1a9c09023379518eb0)

17. what ? are they crazy ? first they make a stupid reboot not long after the original and now they wanna force lgbtq narrative into a history movie ? so what , they going to make stauffenberg gay ? maybe goebbels ? there is no hope for hollywood .
   (ID: 74b39a57f22c2783cb59064a6f33cd8db3d8f787)

18. he justified danish people being black and having red hair . sure blacks can be danish and red hair no qualms against that . but to change a characters image just because the actor is talented and we have to fit her there for the sake of disney ' s music gimmicks bothers me indefinitely . i wouldn ' t want goku from dragon ball z to be a woman . i wouldn ' t want james bond to be asian . i grew to stop enjoying the spider man series because they took toby mcguire off and recasted another white male actor whoever it was i just remember his face and not his name . changing what you used to enjoy into something else regardless of race gender or even person is going to make those who enjoyed the series before stop enjoying it as much . you took our memory of something we once held dear for over the span of almost digit years and played around with it for your own ethnic representation and hollywood ' s gimmick gains ? why couldn ' t this new actor fit in a new disney princess movie . why couldn ' t she act in a live action version of something that resembled her better like the princess and the frog ? because disney is making bank off the propaganda . because they want it to be an issue that common sense and racial views mix up in . because they wanted the indefinite blind support of all african americans supporting this change along with whomever decided to make it a thing about race ps  i ' m not okay with the gross display of the new lion king or detective pikachu . and they ' re still animated but on a different dimension and art style . disliking that is the same pretty much as disliking whatever the fuck is going on with the little mermaid movie right now . it ' s been digit years . keep it that way and stop trying to milk disney movies the same way bethesda milked skyrim disney !
   (ID: 199704b2ab3344a95185dd1a9c09023379518eb0)

19. i know , i ' m getting one for other purposes
   (ID: ea5cdb41822e9eac6a4230514be598981cadabcb)

20. if you can ' t try and keep up with them , let them go .   x200b  try to know what your capabilities are . there may be some times where you are actually left alone intentionally or unintentionally where you have to defend yourself for a short period of time against a horde or a big enemy . work a little bit against the tide when you find yourself in this situation and i ' m sure you will better yourself in some way . make a game out of it if you have to , and if you survive on your own for that time , be proud of yourself and reflect on how you did it .   x200b  be patient always . if the rusher dies , kindly remind them that this game works with teamwork  or don ' t even respond at all to them . my experience has mostly been them ragequitting after dying so i could go and revive the bot for extra help .   x200b  don ' t be mad if the group fails . keep trying . it ' s just a game  a beta version of the game , at that . it ' s going to need revision before it becomes a truly enjoyable and playable game .   x200b  edit  oh and always keep player outlines on . you can coordinate yourself to stick with the main group going at a better pace if you know where everyone is .
