4. i know this sounds like a standard answer giving to everyone , but i know that its the best way . i know that because i also was in that position when you have lost so many of your friends , that there is no place to start , to regain them . put yourself out there , and with out there i mean really into the world of the people you want to befriend . when i needed a friend to go to parties with , i needed to go out alone , to find those with similar interest . and is definitely not so hard when you start building up confidence to go up ro people . most people don ' t have a reason to approach you when already having their social circle , so there is no was around for you to just start randomly talking with people that think may be symphatic . nearly all of the people i started talking to reacted super positve on that behavior . some may find it strange at first , same stick to that attitude and evem some of them will become your friensy
