18. this describes my problems as well . i ' m on vial smasher partnered with kraum . lots of x spells , including my finishers like torment of hailfire or jay ' s immolating inferno , and nothing infinite . its a " curious control " deck until i ' ve built enough mana through rocks , urborg  cabal coffers , and  or the two creatures that double your black mana . i play guttersnipe and a couple others like him , so i have good targets for curiosity , ophidian eye and tandem lookout . it ' s actually a lot of fun , and i haven ' t been hated out , because it ' s not like i ' m blowing up the world by turn digit or anything and vial smasher ' s triggers are random which i think helps a lot with people ' s feelings about the deck . my win rate has got to be over digit  , probably higher , but i don ' t keep records . if cedh develops a little more locally , i ' ll switch kraum out for thrasios and go full tilt .
