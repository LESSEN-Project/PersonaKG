1. ghost stares . like they don ' t even see you .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

2. religious bigotry is why people like you don ' t get respect . you offer nothing but hate
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

3. i would hope that nothing would happen , because that doesn ' t really matter .
   (ID: 3adf883c491ca030d52ee22ed62e166c87ed0d5e)

4. we sound like we ' re fucking every time we speak .
   (ID: eca32d278abf2524af02edbb3cc3041ed8b0b880)

5. apparently you ' re there as well , if this is your grand solution towards fixing things . and where are you pulling this out of ? your ass ? i do not see a single word from my person condoning homicide here .
   (ID: 7b7a217eaddb7df1a9d81ec63b381094afacc280)

6. i wonder what would happen if for one day they switched what the upvotes and downvotes do .
   (ID: f46d1bfdfed7fc05bbe39789c092019944471e9d)

7. i agree . especially a punisher rear slide plate cover . unfortunately a prosecutor can turn anything around and convince the layperson of wrongdoing . from what you saw with the young guys . officer how many hours do you spend in the gym ? how many hours do you practice with your firearm ? so it is more important for you to be stronger to carry more ammo than to be proficient with your gun ?
   (ID: 05dea10a374f0f09c767062f0a3d0b51b6d20b9d)

8. all i said was that people who do this are gate keeping . that ' s all i said . how is that complaining ?
   (ID: 8a45584f421735874a74f108ab7578f85dee40cd)

9. so what if they actually don ' t like you ? does that make you worth any less as a person ? i don ' t think so . opinions are not real and this is why  if some stranger walked up to you and said  " you are such a shoelace " you ' d probably be indifferent and you wouldn ' t care that much because it just doesn ' t make sense , right ? so if you swap the word " shoelace " for " asshole " and you swap the word " stranger " with " friend " does that make any difference ? probably not because it ' s just a word . you are not obnoxious . somebody may think you are while somebody else thinks you ' re not . you may even be your own worst enemy because you call yourself obnoxious ! it ' s just in your head though , don ' t believe the demon that exists inside there solely to give you a hard time . it ' s not real .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

10. being proud of where you were born or what you were born as is pretty silly imo . be proud of the choices you make , not what was chosen for you .
   (ID: f2eafcb4d8e0b098ec90234d0bc310dcc0e2a189)

11. you don ' t get that ? people have pride in their high school , their professional sports teams , their state . humans are social and want to belong to a tribe . i ' m with you and don ' t see it that way for myself hence why i no longer live or associate with the south , but you have to intentionally ignore all culture around you to claim you don ' t see it or understand .
   (ID: e707e3b97faf5ee7a6bc4fac3f1e296e163b3c89)

12. i fixed it to be less confusing , read again .
   (ID: 8a4ed3ff6aeac985870de52972da8599efd48ae2)

13. because they love misaligned backs and broken phones
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

14. yeah , the first week of season digit the planes were just fine to everyone , i didn ' t see a single post about how op it is until the freaking sword was realest . now the sword is gone people want to attack the planes now ? excuse me , what the fuck . i just think people doesn ' t want anything added in season digit if this is the case . whats the point of playing fortnite if you can ' t have fun and keep bitching on how everything added is ' op ' . in conclusion , plz stop this , bring back the sword , and subscribe to pewdiepie .
   (ID: 84a0b9e5d9e0e37c98f992c96c029f6ec99fb1ca)

   (ID: 3c135c69a8a47980440b74978da03e89463d9df6)

   (ID: e5d0bb05742c6f7a9fca52d483dad13871b861d0)

18. you are thinking way to much .
   (ID: f24af2fec683eb8f7c778684c641d964456c0341)

19. you have to know me to realize it but i stay too calm . everyone who knows me well knows that i will f ' n lose my mind if i ' m falsely accused of something , but if i ' m lying about it i ' m relatively calm .
   (ID: dc639446b154d74c8655191b5a755643abd00c2d)

20. or , this will blow your fucking mind , the guy drove away in a panic because there was gasps a shooting ? also my point still stands about them assuming the hate crime , what if it was a muslim and they assumed it was isis ?
