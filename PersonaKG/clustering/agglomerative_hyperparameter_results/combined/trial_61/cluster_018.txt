1. i see no problem here . perhaps some insight other than just a circle ?
   (ID: 94a09b177657107f89104f80152cc459c4dca0ea)

2. I am horny.
   (ID: 162574c7cc4882122c2781c596a51e5023f21691)

3. i said this on another post , but this really feels like a cheap attempt to keep people collecting the same pokemon . i like the idea of the lucky system , but giving luckies their own pokedex entry makes me think that they did this just to give completionists something else to chase . if they had kept the same system , but instead made it so pokemon had a chance to turn shiny instead of lucky , i think this would be a lot better .
   (ID: fc70415de2435c629ec792dbd90c954786c0bd16)

4. sorcerer was my first choice and i have never looked back . i have tried all digit classes out , but always found myself coming back to my sorcerer . i re  rolled my attributes  skills and race vs leveling a new toon to use stamina instead of magicka after a year of being a magic sorc . i have to say that both magic and stam sorc are very fun and by far my fav class overall . ultimately it will be up to you and your personal preference . your play style will  should dictate what class you play and enjoy . i myself am aggressive and offensive sometimes too much so . i have a mageblade and enjoyed it for a time . sneaking around ganking  picking off the weak ones is fun . i think magic night blade is in a tight spot right now in pvp but things change with every update .
   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

5. never drank alcohol .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

6. no makeup . none .   x200b  you will be found beautiful without changing your looks . if i don ' t find you attractive , someone else does .
   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

7. i think most men over digit before that most males would do a pig if it had big boobs prefer the natural look and the covers of these magazines are what women think what men like . the porn industry never realised this and tries to blame its fall in profits on piracy but the reality is that people would rather watch the videos of real people unenhanced by surgery that are widley available online for free .
   (ID: 3f0409a6efb16c26d2f9f7a14f5e75b8945ba427)

8. i want ana but seeing as how i ' m gonna have to whale for ecchan and arthur brother wants me to swipe king hassan as well plus i still need to work on helena so i reluctantly had to pass on this banner .
   (ID: 0ff3db030062a58f30958a7a7b74373cf4f7cbd6)

9. from someone of the gender you like  hi
   (ID: 7424e4821daf78f7a38983c3e1a291ee7ce757d2)

10. i know a lot more guys that enjoy shopping . this might be dependent on where you live and the materialistic culture of the area . i ' m a girl and i don ' t care about shopping , but i live somewhere now that ' s completely different from my home town . misogyny is still really strong in my hometown and women are heavily valued and judged based on appearance   so women typically have their hair and nails done and have new clothes and accessories every few months . i ' ve never cared about any of that and i ' m super frugal , my husband on the other hand loves to shop and spend money . not sure why he ' s one way and i ' m the other , we had similar upbringings
   (ID: e707e3b97faf5ee7a6bc4fac3f1e296e163b3c89)

11. same . why i like group chats so much from people on reddit . makes me feel semi important
   (ID: 533870e07f5d5bb315a9e1e8278df4d123d8a887)

12. my start  up lead engineer is shutting down possibly permanently and i literally have nearly failed out of school for the work i do . i was lead on for digit months that things would get better , so i took on more responsibility and happily so until i was literally laying a young girl i hired specifically because i was requested to hire someone digit months prior . it was then i knew i had no real authority , power , or potential . i ' m dragging my self through to find something else while i support my family , but the young girl is back for this week and likely to be laid off again for good this time . i had to do it last time and this time it ' s likely all three of my young staffers so my heart is broken over a job that gave me nothing . in complete honesty the reason this shut down is even happening is related to the sales people who are in charge of the shut down . they sold us fake futures but couldn ' t win a contract worth shit . btw the plant was backed by a large conglomerate and managed by a small entity outside the plant . for reference .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

13. every time i get used it ' s just another masturbatory story to me . who ' s next ?
   (ID: 917dfa16e92ce1db67ec3f88bc07b87b70a36c95)

14. i question the kind of women you classify as beautiful
   (ID: 5fa74a7d6a70c6f2f8a149864f494ac72eefd3e4)

15. nta . it  s your wedding . you can invite who you want . i get that there might be some tension within your family , but i feel like your family would be kind of inconsiderate to not put that aside for your day . it  s not about them , you know ?
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

16. beautiful . i wonder how many guys at school wonder what you look like under your clothes . if only they could find this post .
   (ID: f709eec52cd0c0cff5afc1f9f3e0caa4a2797782)

17. so i see no one asking the bigger question here . can we fuck it ?
   (ID: 81d70b67b241a70f23e355cf7b40f5e937ce7cb9)
