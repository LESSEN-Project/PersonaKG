10. interesting to see the mix of opinion on the 30k london salary . for what it  s worth , i think this seems bang on what i would expect . for those saying it  s very high  my first job was in a london call center and it paid 18k back in digit . i was an unskilled uni dropout with a poor work ethic . you can get to 30k by default just by adding a some skills and experience . for those saying it  s very low  this job is looking for someone with digit year  s experience . so the target candidate is going to be in their early twenties and most likely has no family or other responsibilities . they  ll manage on 30k just fine .
