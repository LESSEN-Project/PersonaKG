1. i ' ve recently went thru the same thing . my so used the line , " my family has been going thru some very tough times and i need to be there for them " i believe she went that route because she hates confrontation and didnt know how else to break it off . i was devastated , still am i think , but i had come to the conclusion that some people dont deserve the love we have for them . but more importantly , they dont deserve our suffering either . dating is hard  social media has drive people further apart due to the anonymity of it and stunted a lot of people ' s social interactions . give yourself all the time in the world to heal . work on self love , pick up a new hobby , volunteer , join a support group , play d  d with a local group . anything to distract from the pain you have inside . you ' ll know when you ' re ready to begin dating again . dont rush your healing . only you will know when it is time to get back on the saddle , and dont let anyone pressure you into something sooner than you ' re willing to go for . i hope this helps . chin up . you have an obligation to yourself to make happiness for yourself right now .
   (ID: f35d74d4d36905b144a4851bae7ac6c2014ebdbd)

2. i used to cut myself . if you were to see me in person , you ' ll see the scars on my wrists . i ' m not proud of it , but it ' s something that i went through . please go see a doctor and get on some meds .
   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

3. yeah it worked for me but definitely everyone has their own thing to cope and release all the stress and anxiety . it ' s about finding what works for you .
   (ID: d785eda10245445843c3355a0710d262b0d65bb9)

4. i ' ve never been in a coma but i know someone who was , they said it was like they never slept and immediately woke up but remembered some things people had said to them
   (ID: b5e15026c378d181e66e2b38bfc245705510a727)

5. listen mate , i  ve been fairly suicidal recently too but for different reasons . i don  t want to make this about me but i cant relate with your reasons , so all i can tell you is my insight on dying and how it put a halt to my suicidal thoughts . i am not a man of faith . i do not believe in an after life  reincarnation , a superior beings , an inferno  limbo  hell  purgatory . i simply believe in  science  is the way i suppose one could put it . with that being said , i believe that when one dies , it means lights off . forever . i believe it means that your existence is ultimately pointless  because if you no longer exist , then you cant acknowledge that you ever even existed in the first place , because you no longer exist . therefore , you cant prove to yourself that you ever existed because you don  t exist , and even if people on earth still exist to acknowledge your death , how are you able to acknowledge that they acknowledge your death if you no longer exist to acknowledge anything at all because you don  t exist . in fact , you cant even prove that anything that has ever happened ever since the beginning of everything , even happened at all because you  re dead  you don  t exist . this will probably sound totally crazy and might be pretty difficult to wrap your head around , but i don  t know how else to say it and it is what made me not want to kill myself . instead , it made me want to live . it made me want to breath in the air , to touch what there is to touch , and see what there is to see , because once you die there never was  is  will be anything . i know it sounds too abstract and just flat out bonkers , but i really hope you understand it i really hope anyone understands it . i don  t know mate , i really tried and i hope you feel better and that everything turns out okay .
   (ID: 05b66d977b603757baf68e2315ea2e5970865864)

6. another thing is that i found that my ego is too strong . i use myself as an excuse and as an explanation for things when i don ' t really know who or what i am . i feel my life is too self  centered and that i need to feed less to my ego
   (ID: af764f37d4a75bdb762464b079f842d6af0847b7)

7. you are not alone . all of the feelings you feel are normal . i wish i could be more helpful that that . but i do want you to know there are others who feel the same way .
   (ID: ad8037a59ec7bca69b8b7b8d9ef7b08984b1e3eb)

8. people tend to tell suicidal people " don ' t do it " without understanding what it ' s like to be truly suicidal . while help is something i think you should consider , i also think it ' s your right to end it if you wish and many of us would understand . things do get better , but sometimes waiting for things to get better is too miserable to handle . whatever you choose , i wish you the best .
   (ID: 372e357e1e3acd2a4dea24aa56a5900a539a9e59)

9. hey , just here to tell you that your feelings are valid but they are not you . a lot changed when i realized that i could be the witness of my feelings rather than the feeler . allowing yourself to feel everything you  re feeling and holding yourself in a safe space . i know words are mostly meaningless but you are so young and so needed . you will get past this . keep going .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

10. i  m sure that you will find someone better , but for now , im here if you wanna talk . i feel you dude .

   (ID: 6eec77fe98b9dc85ec1e5e7edc37cdb415794719)

14. harmful gossip and twisting my own words around to make me look bad . also , they tell people that i ' m crazy because of mental illness and dissuaded a woman , who was interested in me , to stay away from me because of it . people will smile in your face and then fuck you over , for there benefit . people will see you trying to do something and they just try to take you down , mostly behind your fucking back . when the time comes when you ask them why , they ' ll say " well , you should of had more confidence in yourself " fuck you bitch and i hope you die . of course i shouldn ' t think that or say it , but if they do die , good riddance . i would , definitely , take pleasure in them dying a painful death . if the tables were turned , they would feel the same way . people will plot and take your girlfriend away from you because they ' re jealous or they feel that your not a good enough man . then every time you see them , they have a big ass smirk on there face . your ex  girlfriend doesn ' t what he did and if so , she doesn ' t care . she has no regrets . sorry for the long rant .
   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

15. do you have to fight it back ? being sad can be a beautiful thing too ! you can ' t always bother your friends and family but it ' s definitely an option . does it feel like you care a whole lot about those people , so much that it actually hurts , like , in your lower chest ? sort of like something is squeezing ? cause i ' ve had that before .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

16. I'm interested in smoking and tobacco.
   (ID: d3bac57ba3f5572800e9732b3d2159f8a3fcbfdc)

17. i  m sorry to hear this confused  face . i hope you get better soon . give it some time , i know it seems difficult now , but it  ll get better . at least you had a conversation about it . i would also talk to other family members and close friends about starting to drink so you can gather other perspectives . bye .
   (ID: 7f37f47fcf6439c13308caa3da8118ac14f861f6)

18. i was just reading an article about how digit  digit of young people feel lonely . it made me reflect on why . i am older than you and still suffer from those negative thoughts . i have friends , family , kids , a great job , and yet i have those negative thoughts . two things , these thoughts are not gods thoughts about you but it is the enemy  s . reject those things and dwell on what is good and on heavenly things . it  ll be a constant battle for life because the enemy dwells here looking to devour . lastly , get involved in the church and serve others . you will find meaningful friendships and find fulfillment when you serve people volunteer , missionary work , evangelize , etc . i know that there is a ministry for you to join and a regular bible study . i  ll pray for you . i know what you  re feeling and i know it  s a struggle but we are strong through christ who strengthens us .
   (ID: 71de6d78a2a9fe7dfc17e6667ec92f75a8d4c302)

19. yep , and i can understand that , but just realize how little that one mess up actually matters in the universe !
   (ID: 20704d953f0b1774a4782d2f049f69736ac4eea2)

20. i  d say talk to other enby people , they may have a similar experience . it may help you find yourself . ultimately , though , it  s you who  s gotta take the information given and figure yourself out .
