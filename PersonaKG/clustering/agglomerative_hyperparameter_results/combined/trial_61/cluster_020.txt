2. there was this girl holding a sword and when i asked her why she just said that she always came prepared . i ' d like to think that she and her friends were actually having some variety of supernatural adventures right beneath all our noses .
   (ID: c6cc92fb6dee5f65446e9383372864b9e25f1d60)

3. learndota2 though this is very old , some of them are still relevant purgegamers youtube , he has digit playlists dedicated to teaching dota digit and a series where he teaches day9 everything about dota digit . just ignore all the idiots who go out of their way to shittalk lol , most people from dota days are still butthurt that pendragon took a few ideas . drow is similar to ashe and pudge is similar to blitzcrank , frost marksman and fat hooker respectively . teemo is apparently similar to techies ? at least in the sense that they plant mines and you get reported for playing them if i ' m remembering teemo correctly . there ' s loads of thematic similarities between heroes as well if your keen on some of those . e . g . shyvana reminds me strongly of dragon knight .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

4. One of my favorite things is songs.
   (ID: 8b409a812bfe5e21e6e8924b5c822fc50d0d2c9a)

   (ID: 2e2a44cdfc726423ec202a2fe420543af441d1ad)

6. dude . so with you on this . concerts , festivals , comedy shows . i realized a couple months back that while i enjoy a great number of things that this world has to offer , i love very few things . which is why i find myself despondent at events that i  ve paid money to attend . brain  i thought you liked this band . me  i do . brain  why aren  t you enjoying yourself then ? me  i don  t know . isn  t that kinda your job ? brain  me ? psh . i  m only here for the free show , man .
   (ID: 08da4119a215672a002df8147181afbb771a75f9)

7. One of my favorite things is rough stones.
   (ID: e3f34e146ce06ba2b5fc5a249c73494f93f56e86)

8. i was put off by the new animation style at first elitist 80s  90s kid here so i had always ignored it . the few clips i saw of ahsoka made me think she was annoying too . it wasn ' t until i noticed all the seasons on netflix last month that i thought to myself " ok dipshit , time to stop being stubborn " and i began watching them in season order . i realized they weren ' t chronological so i found the proper order and it ' s been very , very entertaining . i always have these moments where i prove myself wrong about not liking something but i never learn . the one thing i really appreciate about this series is how it humanizes anakin and even though he still has the rebellious streak , he doesn ' t come off as the whiney version of anakin that you want to slap . it actually made me a bit sad that you know he will eventually turn , because he ' s pretty likable in tcw .
   (ID: 0861712f8592c280471770109eb434101eb06dca)

9. i know ! i ' ve downloaded all their albums , but if i could actually find them in the store , i would jump on them so fast . i can ' t even find any dead meadow records either .

   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

11. although i love clannad and code geass with all of my heart . they arent flawless . and i dont think its good to keep saying to yourself that nothing will beat this anime . because then you ' re making it harder for yourself to find a really good anime . i recommend going in every anime with the thought that this could be you ' re digit  anime . this way you can enjoy more anime .
   (ID: 622ae5e8e0ffe2c066a3d94dcee004b5696643bb)

12. i have been keeping up with the series and am mostly loving it . you ' re right about it being pretty unpleasant . great stuff , though !

18. i had never heard this until now . very nice . one of my favorites is ' feel the tide ' . but my all time favorite is ' the cave ' . dancing around my now wife ' s small college apartment listening to mumford and sons for the first time as she sings and we make cheap noodles and lemon pepper chicken is literally one of my favorite memories .
   (ID: 7a0302ed354e54bfa45e1de27055f29421f91f29)
