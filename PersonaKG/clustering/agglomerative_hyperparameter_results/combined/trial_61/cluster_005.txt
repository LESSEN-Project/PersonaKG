1. nta judging by the fact you could pay off all her debt , plus buy her a new car it was obviously a decently large sum , that i agree with you i would not just randomly hand out to a girlfriend of digit months that you do not live with or are engaged to . maybe you could of helped her a little if you really wanted to , but you have no obligation to give her that money , or justify how you spend your hard earned money .
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

2. i don ' t think it ' s games , she might have left a tip under there when she wrote this note and forgot it was on there for future orders . she didn ' t even get a drink so i ' m guessing it ' s an old note . it ' s like the people who have a note asking for soy sauce on their bk order .
   (ID: 85a05d28a3a638ea67074ae6793644f5f667c9f3)

3. without consent , it ' s definitely not a crime . i really hope you ' re not bragging about being a sex offender . also , i asked a few questions , don ' t be a coward and answer
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

4. when i was digit or digit i had a fish tank and the heater was not working properly it was my great uncles second hand tank and heater randomly shuts itself downto take a break and anyways i thought ' hey this can ' t be that hard all i have to do is just setting it for a higher temperature and fish won ' t be cold ' . well the problem got bigger and all my fish died . my mom blamed the heater broke down and killed them but i guess i slow  cooked my pets . r . i . p . fish i ' m sorry
   (ID: 2834b254700cedfb96641229b712899b4d697418)

5. thats extremely true . it doesn ' t mean you don ' t like the girl . even the most thunderingly beautiful , intelligent and witty girl ' s names are still just tiny pieces of information bobbing on the oily swirl that is the short  term memory of a preoccupied inebriate .
   (ID: 54c02bf73569d6b7f5a88c3d841a214eee1a4d14)

6. my sil is doing some " dr . bearenstain bears " diet . she was pressuring hubby ' ' can ' t you tell i ' ve lost weight " his response  i ' m not going to look at you like that , i dunno , around the hips ? it ' s not the same as cookiewisk . he told me about this after and we proceeded to discuss how she basically eats less than her digit year old . sigh
   (ID: 7911b1d92de80b0e1abd4e2a29e4f762a8a2908f)

7. my gram is digit and my grandpa died ten years ago . we ' re all individuals , but her biggest complaint is that she ' s lonely . i think you could ask her what she wants , does she want to talk , be in someone ' s company , or alone ? i do worry that sometimes even when someone says they want to be alone , it ' s not always for the best as they may be just wanting to hide and be in pain alone . if there are interests of hers where she is with other people , i ' d encourage that and offer to help get her to those outings if she is unable to get there herself . i think you could make it a routine of visiting her or doing one of those activities , eating a meal or a few meals a week with her as a routine . i ' m not sure how much time you have or whether your family members have time to do the same , but you could set up a bit of a schedule .
   (ID: 345fbf1e655edda9a5f8099ba480dfe0a7a0bd47)

8. nah man , she ruined the entire story for me . what started off as the best liara  mshep fanfic , the rarely written and only ship i really care about , and i can ' t even read it anymore because the anticipation of her very existence irritates me to no end .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

9. a stock market crash did happen , but he lost digit  of the money , and it should have regained it ' s value and a lot more in the previous digit years . what does she think your odds of winning are ? 10k sounds like a small risk if you have a good chance of winning hundreds of thousands .
   (ID: ff39f069f8b23a1fe1a55ce497714a8d205eb0fa)

10. she loves hugs so i  ll be very happy to do this favour for you
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

11. dont hit girls ever , not even if your being attacked , just avoid them . thanks grandpa
   (ID: fd9de666ca1e952a2f9c7367d60476a6d4b8b996)

12. due to this sub ' s rules i can ' t say what i want buy you should just leave her .
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

13. just be straight forward with her . i can  t tell you how to bring it up , you need to figure that out on your own , not on reddit . if it comes from you heart and voice , it will feel sincere and she will know . be yourself and just tell how you feel . that is it . hope everything goes alright .
   (ID: 7f37f47fcf6439c13308caa3da8118ac14f861f6)

14. calling me a fool for giving you advice ? if that ' s how you treat your daughter no wonder she talks back to you and treats you badly . you literally described your own child as a " fucking ass  hole " your digit year old daughter . jesus christ . the stuff you have described makes you look awful . and your ex  husband never shaped her like that especially when your the one " looking after " her for the majority of the week .
   (ID: 4bddcbadec311f472e8b62614b7394e14eb1d7ac)

15. yeah i feel bad for my uncles they are both digit and tried but never goy married for life . what i mean is digit got divorced and other is just alone . they are in india , i did go visit in december , and they got happy to see my family
   (ID: 83e7249cc03d41173f9e8ddb8ec1a71adef91e52)

16. well you ' re just going to have to get over your fear of her having a relationship with someone else . cause it will happen . same thing will happen for you too . it ' s not the end of the world . how many girlfriend ' s have you had ? i ' m assuming more than just her because you used the phrase " most recent girlfriend . " most relationships don ' t last , no matter if they ' re romantic ones or not , and i don ' t think they ' re supposed to . you were with this girl for digit days , that ' s nothing . you ' ll find someone else , or you ' ll spend the rest of your life debilitated by your fear of something that you have no control over . i ' m willing to bet that won ' t happen . keep your chin up man .
   (ID: deb51648159c9d9d915a701d8f77ac885a29b9b4)

17. if she ' s insisting but let you pay the other times , let her this time . i dated a guy for awhile who paid for every single thing , which is super flattering , but when i told my mom she was like " you need to pay too ! just make him let you pay " so i felt weird about it . we are told we need to take care of ourselves first , to be independent , that we can ' t be " bought " etc . i think it ' s actually a good sign on her feelings towards you . while i ' m not dating that guy anymore , i offered a lot to pay because i didn ' t want him to think i was taking advantage of his kindness . i did finally end up paying for a few things here and there , which worked out because he never carried cash and i ' m a cash girl . i doubt this will be the new " rule " where she will always pay for herself .
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

18. i think not airing my so and my problems on reddit is one of the best choices we ever made . just sit down and talk to her about it . it sounds cheesy but communication is the absolute key to any relationship .
   (ID: df32c155f124e2413f811d36f780385403a5374a)

19. we all have shit we ain ' t proud of , what good can come from telling her this ?
   (ID: bc8c44b6bdc162869dcaaa34272a8b4784f44b9f)

20. sleep with every men she is sleeping to tell her who is boss . i hope this is just a hypothetical situation rather than a real situation
