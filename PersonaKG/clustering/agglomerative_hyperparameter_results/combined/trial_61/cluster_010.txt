1. hahahaha that ' s one date you ' ll never forget !
   (ID: 14942db2673f05d429e3df3e81ee89b62cf80338)

2. that varies from country to country but the point remains , get some distance between you and your old life and do everything you can to leave it in the past . doing your time isn ' t the end of the punishment , you ' ll keep paying for it for many years to come if you don ' t distance yourself from your past misdeeds . there ' s a lot of complex issues at play but there ' s a lot of data that shows once you ' ve been to prison once you ' re probably going to go back , and if you ' re the exception to the rule at best you ' ll probably just have really shitty jobs and constant struggles for the rest of your life .
   (ID: b489bebca81ea07c422e4a78e54cd162edf2a814)

3. just our silly gift exchange . we pick a theme for the year . it has been  something from a truck stop , something blue , something homemade , your favorite song on a cdhad to explain what those were to the kids and then a quiz to guess whose was whose . things like that . usually we all pick a gift , open them , then have a dice rolling game where everyone gets one chance to steal another ' s present ! we have a large family , so getting one present is way easier and just so much more fun and it takes the commercial aspect out of the holiday and makes it more about our family being together and doing the usual silly shit we do together .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

4. sending you love , fuck him . you ' ll be ok .
   (ID: 1d327d2812dfee71bf8ef77d36ffd5eb70efd55b)

5. what happens if you die of old age ? does this only work for accidents , or do you become young again ?
   (ID: 1476398f6c778fb461539e3f78b07720d4ceee83)

6. yeah , that ' s a little unfair . although there would be false positives there too , like " you must really enjoy the elliptical "
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

7. definitely discuss this with your doctor . and maybe consider getting a squatty potty ? it ' s supposed to ease the strain . they have them for sale i my local grocery store for  digit . so going to be getting one as well .
   (ID: 2d26439362b22d8737b6d2a810c70fc3b9a3ddaa)

8. man . if you  re suffering from dts then you already know the answer to your own question . what you should be asking is , how can i get help ?
   (ID: 386a392e883042f376e701f5ad03fc1c67ffde36)

9. you nailed it . my instructor once told me that if you think you have something wrong , identify the problem , take immediate action , and fly the plane . communicate with atc if you can , and worry about possible consequences later . he told me that it ' s far better for you to have sign an faa statement than to have your family sign a release at the morgue . i always remembered that .
   (ID: 5603c8fcb517a4b5745afb8c3f46248974edebe3)

10. i just opted out . if i want to be back in , how do ido that ?

   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

13. christmas day with my family and my girlfriend . my sister insulted my girlfriend at the dinner table . i immediately experienced what i can only describe as pure rage .   x200b  i quite literally saw red . as in , everything became tinged red . i got up from my chair and made it around to the other side of the table where my sister was without any conscious thought of what i was doing .   x200b  when i got to her my sister i just sort of stopped and looked at here with a kind of angry bewilderment . i hadn ' t make any conscious decision to hurt her or yell at her or anything so i didn ' t know what to do . i ended up just going back to my chair and not saying anything .   x200b  i honestly don ' t know what other people at the table thought i was doing .   x200b  as an aside , i had always thought that " seeing red " was just an expression until it happened to me that one time .   x200b  in the many years since that happened , nothing has ever made me that angry .
   (ID: be9f60605270d73ac3a4e5b587575b1f65df15f5)

15. i ' m gonna die alone .
   (ID: f67f4ffc3afd37a9ece4ede606682407c9b920b1)

16. it ' s in the name ' self harm ' . your just hurting yourself to supposedly make yourself feel better even though it would never be enough .
   (ID: 480e1d5457cca32a54c00398823abca7aae20b86)

17. same mate ! i can get aggressive with ovd triggers sometimes , small doses of edibles through the day keep the symptoms way manageable if not gone
   (ID: 46cf1fc2a9c8dec12fa16589117be75cf1571e1d)

18. so what does " hectic " mean to you and can you cite a reference ?
   (ID: fcec87cb8b541d87ad0eb8b52c3541c8fc49132b)

19. i wish i didn  t find your account , your post history is fucking mental . it  s literally like some true detective serial killer shit . you need to get out before its too late .
   (ID: c06f82a9d6f502a9c5707645e6b0bc869ff37975)

20. i was speaking to girl once a week at martial arts and at the time there was a lump on my face . i said with a perfectly straight face that it was a brain tumour and that id be dead in digit months . i though she would have got dead pan humour but she didn ' t and i quit martial arts at a latter time so sometimes i think about what she thinks happened .
