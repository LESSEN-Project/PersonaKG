1. i would say file a police report anyway , regardless of whether they would be interested and do anything or not .
   (ID: dccaef8a6226163d8d10afb2d04eb5a7babea832)

2. i just came from digit other places and no one there could get it right ! that  s because the problem is you , sir .
   (ID: 0adc203530167f27a334f03a3d44b3c302d91f2a)

3. it ' s about the same honestly . now if we talk digit ish years ago , i think " midget " was still useable
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

4. did you skip the whole part where i talked about 3rd party verification ? i have the internet , it takes very little time for me to confirm the legitimacy of qualifications . there is no full information in the real market ? please explain that , it doesn  t make sense . also , i hate to break it to you but there are shitloads of unlicensed drivers on the roads every day . so if you  re assuming you  re surrounded by competent , licensed drivers every time you are on the road you need to wake up to the reality of that situation .
   (ID: 8b20a772d1697ecc1b19f9f6451e7346e8b98987)

5. since you aren ' t actually posting from the great beyond is it possible you ' re missing a decimal in that number ?
   (ID: 6aca29520994a85891e32b7ad6030791dfa1cbe2)

6. digit  confirmed . so , what gets to happen is that we get to do the same thing when they get cars . i am about digit months away from realizing that dream .
   (ID: f8d48136e1ccbc739d4b7fb8db1e8f668422b145)

7. one can argue that even world conquerors don ' t really need retinues , so i wouldn ' t put lor as necessary at all . nor tog or soi for that matter , unless you really want to play as the specific groups they unlock . my ideal ck2 starter pack is way of life , the reaper ' s due and monks  mystics for the extra peacetime content ck2 is famous for . on jade dragon  i love it . the new cbs are absolutely awesome , usable on all bookmarks on all tiers in all regions . and china itself is , in my opinion i know others don ' t concur , a welcomed addition to the game that really makes me constantly check up what the hell the emperor is doing and how i can profit  not get destroyed from that .
   (ID: 67ef96fb30756c49a9ffdff2579058eb2a3c1398)

8. maybe they didn  t get around to it yet ? you can also notice some states are mentioned twice or more so it  s pretty much incomplete and i assume will expand greatly prior to end of digit as stated in the keynote .
   (ID: 3e3ba4fedc605802fcfce7c50b515d9b8d4a7af9)

9. my mom told me when i was digit that i was dead to her and to never contact her again . i spent the next digit or so years trying to reconcile and after a girl dumped me because , " what kind of person isn ' t even loved by their mother " i started to just tell people she was dead . it really helped me move on . i know it sounds horrible , but it works for me . it ' s been almost digit years and i still just say she ' s dead . i don ' t elaborate on it or make up any story on how she died .
   (ID: 23a788cf7874353f54f4163f0e2c16e6043d04a1)

10. my options are digit ' digit or a nearly digit " dick . i ' m a bit torn between the two to be honest
   (ID: b4e4c05c47c7939661297c7f0b909e47f4ef628e)

11. it depends where you are at , really . for instance , i see no use for t3 material anymore , so if you still need ibc you are much earlier in the game . the only useful things for late game players are cores and maybe the shards .
   (ID: a304d2b10646e73686547edafa852cc87a894eb5)

12. where the hell are you finding this for  digit a bottle ? i ' m in tn , so just south of where it ' s made , and it ' s like  digit here .
   (ID: ecc98de1e575d7e863a2124b364b8ed586778ba5)

13. lol i wish it were simple , it ' s been digit days but you never know those last digit might be totally different
   (ID: 3b45915d58b20f0e2abb6b26d4534980a5d3aa68)

14. it only seems to apply to certain numbers , and i ' m not sure why we do that honestly . i ' ll say the digit , the digit , the digit , but i would just say digit for that highway .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

15. some guy shot up digit mosques and killed digit people . he live  streamed the whole thing . literally a few days ago . it  s just a bad time to post a meme like this . normally i  d be fine but there are certain circumstances that are bad at the moment . he said during his digit min stream stuff like ,  fortnite taught me how to floss .  and  sub to peddiepie  kinda surprised you haven  t heard about it yet but the reddit community has stayed out of it so far .
   (ID: f270f54ee5a501d23ceae23084513e682d0cfd32)

16. did you know we only use digit  of a stoplight at any given time ? think about it !
   (ID: 063122b93a40a719244d27587193e154f2fed59d)

17. i was thinking about doing this , but never went through with it . i realize now that it ' s cheating
   (ID: 6b2e7201275c9aa1dcb6d1b24840765a41796c3d)

18. you should really be able to deflect bayonet charges like this with a well  timed melee attack . it doesn ' t have to kill the target like it does here , but it should stop the charge and prevent you from dying . it could even work differently across different melee weapons , or only be a feature for certain ones . example being that it ' s much harder to shove aside a bayonet charge with a knife than it is a large club or shovel .
   (ID: 812f0130222ed7d2f4768ba9e9d81f1c42857723)

19. like digit or digit days thanks to meth
   (ID: deb51648159c9d9d915a701d8f77ac885a29b9b4)

20. sounds a lot like my story , honestly . your best bet is to talk to her about it . don ' t do what i did and hide it , it ' ll probably come back . digit divorces , digit years old , a ton of self esteem issues later and i ' m just starting the transition process now .
