   (ID: a74790331386859adbbd886bd045a7391e95948c)

2. same here . my study of religion led me to conclude they were all manmade . the way that i see it we all have certain drives for meaning , for purpose , for morals and certain emotional needs getting over the fear of death , wanting to reconnect with dead loved ones , wanting a sense of meaning in life , etc . and religions each navigate a way in which they can fulfill these human desires . and i think that the religions out there today are still in existence because partially they tended to fulfill these the best .

   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

7. out of how many games ? or is the number just " too many to count ?
   (ID: aac80ac9ebef70ab8fe6bc14a8fcccb472099b84)

8. the danger it presents yeah , the danger it presents in your mind . you don ' t happen to be related to jack thompson do you ? literally the same exact arguments as all those retards who said the show digit and pregnant romanticizes teen pregnancy . then looking back history proves that the show literally did the opposite , it lowers the rate of teen pregnancy
   (ID: 737313878d4c0ea930e14b4d6569b91c8028c768)

9. a lot of us lost family in the holocaust so believe me when i say i know how you feel . joking about what happened is childish and immature . my great grandfather lost his life one night after he got drunk and fell out of a guard tower . yes i know , straight to hell , but it had to be done .
   (ID: 7ebdc00c75f6f836557e13d39a9efb279ed2ef7a)

14. glad it  s helpful  i  m fairly  new  as a catholic and not a cradle catholic either so i can empathize . there  s a really good video series from  dynamic catholic   they are currently doing this series during lent and i find it helpful  they  re 3ish minute daily snippets . it  s easier for me to listen to a video on my phone daily than most other things . certainly i don  t say the rosary enough . a couple days ago the video was about the  lie we tell ourselves   it hit me that i lie to myself too , sometimes , and you might as well . it really is more about saying yes to god everyday , even if we muck up and we do , and he knows this ! hope this link works . ? best wishes

15. imo the stories are all kind of like david and goliath . believing in god allows people to do stuff because they feel they can . so all stories are based on what happened , but the only real ones are christmas , easter and ascension day are true for the most part . i believe god didnt make life as it is , but started the process of evolution and the earth and life in general . i also think the earth is digit  digit billion years old . all my opinion , dont judge me . also homosexuality , swearing and premarital sex are all okay and i dont immediately dislike people who do not believe . i like to call it rational christianity .

16. sorry on mobile so i booted up the game today and accidentally clicked kyf instead of killer  the game lagged out for maybe a straight minute and then loaded killer without me backing out of kyf and selecting killer killer loaded weird , i had all the perks at rank three but all four perk slots , both addon slots and the offering slot were locked and all the cosmetics except mike ' s bloody mask eventually it smartened up but never did give me my mask back or take away the overalls . i ' ve even played a few matches and still nothing

17. you forgot to decline everything for the number of words in the sentence .

18. excuse me how did you enter the uk . i don ' t believe this , it ' s probably just my mum .
   (ID: 3737c6c8726b12f17da2de38c32a6c19123f9a4a)

19. ok so i ' m going to attempt to steel  man your position and i ' d like you to do the same with mine . so what i ' ll try to be steel  manning will be the position of a god existing and him broadly fitting the christian god trying to stay clear of the mess that is different denominations . the strongest case i could make for god is to use the first cause argument . i would argue that once something happens you can always ask " why " then once you ' ve got the answer you can ask " why " once again . it seems logical to assume that there has to be something quite big and powerful at the end of it all . as to why it should be the christian god , i ' d argue that most christian teaching only ntseems internally consistent to a creator god . for instance loving enemies because they are made in god ' s image is consistent with a god who made us all . whereas that is not so easy with other religions . do you think i did the god  claim justice ?
