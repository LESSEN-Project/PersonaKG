1. we were standing in line admiring the flowers at a local grocery store . she starts small talk , and she is very sweet . we both mention the beautiful color variety they have . she goes up to them to inspect closer . ' what color do you think is the prettiest ? ' i tell her the yellow were my favorite . she picks up digit dozen , digit in the color pink and digit in yellow . she goes to pay for her groceries and hands me the pretty yellow bunch . ' i thought you could use these to make your day a little brighter ' . i thank her and she leaves . here i am in a long line in the grocery store , with the biggest smile on my face . now what she didn ' t know is that i was having sort of a rough time . she , and her kindness got me through that day . whenever i get a little sad , i think of her and remember that there is good out there , wether i ' m feeling good or not .
   (ID: 9e1be6964f5835f58b6cdaac71f8b557f0b4a42f)

   (ID: 8b409a812bfe5e21e6e8924b5c822fc50d0d2c9a)

5. this has been one of the most wholesome threads i ' ve read on reddit , my wife and i are going through a horrible streak in our business , like literally completely broke and feeling hopeless . being that down financially is just such a burden on your mental health and self value and yesterday her parents bought us food because we literally didn ' t eat yesterday . i broke down a bit and started crying , the feeling of worthlessness was what hit me the most . i ' m not even sure where i could find food banks in mexico , not sure it ' s a thing here . i hope y ' alls financial situation improves and can make ends meet , all while remembering who helped us along the way .
   (ID: bc8c44b6bdc162869dcaaa34272a8b4784f44b9f)

6. way to go ! good for you hehe i am glad to hear that . that ' s a good push for me to try and approach the next person i ' d be interested in . thanks a lot for this . i have approached people before different reasons romantic interest not being one of them , i guess it shouldn ' t be so different , right ?
   (ID: 1634046145226dc01b1fa030132efd0574c38352)

7. yeah good luck . you ' re most likely not gonna say that kind of line unless you ' re into that person , so i think you ' re at where you wanna be with him . one more thing id say is , just dont rush it .
   (ID: 89e76efb1868896fe46bffbc2c10d965b53857d1)

8. isn ' t that new feeling the best ? happy for you .

9. that actually helps me more than you might think , its been eating at me because even though i have friends who cut i ' ve never met someone else who does this , so just knowing there ' s someone else helps .
