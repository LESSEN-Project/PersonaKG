2. dear lord , isn ' t this supposed to be the 21st century ? i have no problem with homosexuality and if either of my sons turn out to be gay , bi or whatever i would fully support them . i ' ve got gay colleagues , friends and relatives of both genders and you know what , they ' re just like any normal person . probably because they are . what people do in their bedroom is their business , no  one else ' s , and doesn ' t alter anything else about them . people need to stop being dicks .

   (ID: 54182f6e08cc212d89e66f7640449d6fa9717bd9)

4. again , that doesn ' t mean that the choice should be taken away from young boys . just a question  what about their right to vote ? why should we take away a young boy ' sperson right to vote ? or how about their right to make life altering choices ? part of being a parent means , unfortunately depending on how you look at it , making decisions for your kids .

5. peta is best represented by thanos . he thinks there will be less suffering if he kills half of everyone and peta thinks there will be less animals suffering if they kill more of them . they are technically right , if they kill all the animals there will be none left to suffer but that is some twisted villain level thinking .

6. wmd ' s were indeed found in iraq after the digit invasion by coalition forces . took an in depth course on the history of british military failures and counterinsurgency . if you read this comment and get defensive , please read about it ! it is a very interesting topic ! if you do choose to read about it , take a look at some government statements and reputable books that have been published . don ' t listen to what conspiracy theorists have to say . be smart !   x200b   not an invitation for debate . if you would like a conversation , message me and we will have a civil discussion . no name calling . i ' m not evil or brainwashed . every time i bring this up , people love bashing me . like , dude , i just spent the last digit years of my life studying the war in detail . thanks folks    x200b  anyway , that ' s what i think everyone should know .

7. yta . it won ' t confuse your kids . they aren ' t stupid . you can ' t use religion to be homophobic because there are many other things that aren ' t in god ' s word that you still do cutting of hair , wearing different materials , etc . as well as that the bible states various things about your wife being your slave . so you being against homosexuality is on you , not on god . if you ' re worried it ' ll make your kids gay  it won ' t . if they turn out to be gay , it ' s because of their genes . yta bigtime .

8. this . thank you i was trying to figure out a good way to explain it .

9. in objective reality , herding children into groups of thirty and having them close their eyes while they pretend to psychically communicate with a deity , does not do anything at all to prevent gun violence . it doesn ' t really do anything at all , period . it ' s pure political posturing and religious exploitation of children . i completely agree with this .  also in objective reality , instituting reasonable , nuanced , and tested gun control policies is strongly associated with reduced firearm  based violence , homicide , and suicide . these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . this statement is technically true , but misleading . let me quote relevant part of scott alexander ' s essay   " gun violence " is the wrong category to use here .   suppose that you went to your doctor and said " i keep having headaches in my bed at night "   your doctor says " you should sleep on the couch .   you ask your doctor " and that will solve my problem of having headaches "   your doctor says " no , it will solve your problem of having headaches in your bed "   this is a bad solution , because although the problem was phrased as " i have headaches in my bed " , the real problem is just headaches . if we get rid of bed headaches at the cost of causing exactly the same number of couch headaches , that ' s completely useless .   " gun violence " is a category much like " bed headaches . some criminologists very reasonably propose a " substitution effect "  that is , if someone wants to commit murder , they ' ll use the most convenient weapon they can get your hands on . if that weapon gets banned , they will substitute the next most convenient weapon , and so on , rather than just deciding not to commit any more murders .   so suppose there were digit , digit gun deaths in the united states . the government bans guns , it is miraculously successful , and gun deaths go down to zero . sadly , by a total coincidence there are also digit , digit more knife deaths .   this would not be a good outcome , but if we ' re looking at " gun violence " , we could hail it as a victory  " gun control reduced gun violence levels to zero ! our plan has worked ! hooray "   so if we actually want to look at effectiveness of policies , we need to be measuring something else , like the total homicide rate . another wordy essay from scott alexander in which he spends a lot of time analyzing studies of gun control efficacy and comes to the conclusion that australia  style gun control , if implemented in the us , will probably , maybe , tentatively , reduce deaths somewhat . maybe .  these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . i am not a usa citizen and second amendment is not relevant to me , actually .  when you consider objective reality , there is no argument . there is no debate , except over the details of the gun control legislation that we ' re going to enact . if scott alexander didn ' t remember to consider objective reality , then his advice isn ' t worth consideration . frankly , scott alexander ' s analysis is much more nuanced than " there is no argument " claim . there clearly is an argument , and pretending otherwise is delusional . if you have specific rebuttals of points made in the essay , i want to read them . claiming someone does not consider objective reality does not constitute a proper argument , though .   x200b

10. i  m not speaking on behalf of pro  gun people , as i  m not one myself . however , from an outsider looking in , the problem runs much deeper than ownership of a firearm . so deep are some of these problems , banning guns wouldn  t work at all . it is a broken and divided nation right now , on every front . until attitudes change , healthcare , particularly mental health , is easier to access , financial divides are healed , race divides are healed , and the distrust of your fellow man is fixed , banning guns would do next to nothing for crime rates in the country .

11. it ' s just fun to start conversations with people !
   (ID: fd9a89336fd3cad9dd1a173e01055683165a532e)

12. a girl on the street who struck up a conversation with me about politics , back in digit . she seemed well informed , well spoken , intelligent , etc . she was conservative leaning , but disliked the republican party for being political hacks and not representing their base properly . she and i talked about the election in spevifics and she obviously didn ' t like obama . the policies that he was promising were things that she wasn ' t a fan of , plus the fact that she was unhappy about the direction the nation was moving . i agreed , in general . i wasn ' t a fan of all obama ' s policy promises , but she took it as me digit  agreeing . then she handed me a paper and asked me if i could attend a meeting . it was for a neo nazi group . i pointed that out . she flashed me her digit arm tattoo . i handed her back the paper , then left as she yelled out how i was handing the future to the " halfbreed sand nigger in chief " and that was the day i learned to find out what if anything someone is selling , before investing time in a political discussion . she was so nice , so reasonable , so very polite . all to sucker people in .

15. religious bigotry is why people like you don ' t get respect . you offer nothing but hate
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

16. if it meant sparing the lives of innocent people than yes . of course . but don ' t get me wrong , troll man . the citizenry will never rise against the government . keep jacking off to the dystopian fantasies that you and your ilk keep wishing for . gun owners are not a homogeneous group . they don ' t all feel as paranoid and cowardly . some simply want to hunt , some are sportsmen and even a few want their gun for self defence . but a select few , a real small minority really , want their guns because they ' re scared . of the bogey man . the men in black coming to take their guns away . i should feel sorry for folks like you , but i don ' t . keep wishing for the apocalypse as the world walks by and looks at you with pity and disgust . as you hold up your ipad or smartphone and type a response , think about how oppressed you are . you can ' t can you ? because you are not . when the biggest worry in your life is hitting the bars or getting into a good school then realise you are not oppressed . people around the globe have real reasons to take up arms . americans do not and never will . wake up .

   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

20. thanks for proving my point . what point did i prove ?  can argue that there is good and bad practical result from the study of physics results from the study of physics atom bombs is not the same things as physics speed of light in a vacuum or weight of an elementary particle itself .  not only in the physical realm but the spiritual realm . what is a " spiritual realm " , what evidence do you have that such a " realm " exists ? where is this realm ? how do we access it ? how do we measure it ? how do we test it ? how do you determine what is and isn ' t part of the " spiritual realm ? you will have to show that such a thing exists before i can debate with you about it .  see how we don ' t agree on the basic premises of the debate ? it ' s not a disagreement , it ' s a misunderstanding , on your part .  oooh , edgy . i don ' t coddle delusions . you can piss of with your snark and get off your high horse if you want to actually talk about this stuff .  but . i can argue that religion is an evolved mechanism for time binding moral and ethical meta  narratives that has aided people in learning how to interact with each other and behave in social groups . that is not mutually exclusive from my definition .  in that way it has alleviated suffering for millions of people over thousands of years . again , not mutually exclusive from my point of view .  who is right ? i have evidence for my claims . you do not . there is no evidence for any such " supernatural realm " on which a lot of what you claim is based on , and so , i am right .  that you even refuse to see that more than one idea can be true at the same time means you have no idea what you are talking about . i never said that " more than one idea can ' t be true at the same time " , but it ' s not something i would disagree with . the earth can ' t be flat and an oblate spheroid at the same time . the sun can ' t orbit the earth , and the earth orbit the sun at the same time . fusing hydrogen atoms together can ' t produce helium and beryllium . it looks like you do not know what you are talking about when it comes to physics . i can point you to some reading material if you ' d like to learn more , but i ' m not going to give you a physics lesson here on reddit .  the real answer , for people who think instead of just blurt out declarative statements based solely on their own opinion assumed to be objective truth you condescending tone isn ' t welcome . if you ' re going to talk to me like that , you can fuck off and scream your nonsense in to the void , or go over to  flatearth where they welcome conspiracy theories .  is that the debate cannot have a winner because   the two parties do not agree on terms , like what " good " means . you . never tried to establish what " good " was . nothing in your comment talks about goodness . you talk about some spiritual realm , and then make some bogus statements about physics , which leads me to believe you are not arguing in good faith and just want to push your narrative . i ' m perfectly fine if the debate does not have a " winner . we aren ' t on stage in front of an audience , and i would venture to guess very few people will even read these comments . that your goal is to " win " and not to understand , again tells me you are arguing in bad faith , with no intention of learning anything .  we have almost no detailed records of events from digit  of the time period debated . detailed records are not the only evidence from which we can derive facts .  essentially this debate is a farce for hanging your confirmation bias on pot , meet kettle . the same applies to you , bud .
