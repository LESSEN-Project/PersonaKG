18. if you do that , i would recommend giving some kind of advantage to brawl . utilizing martial arts or specialized maneuvers of some kind would probably be preferable , but v5 hasn ' t expanded that much yet . if you don ' t wanna rework all of brawl to give it some sort of viable equivalence , then keep the rules as  is . otherwise it ' s just not viable to use fisticuffs and it makes players like me that wanna punch people slightly disgruntled . if you want a reasonable justification for only using half potence , if you had super strength you could accidentally break your own weapon , so you have to hold back your strength to , instead of utilizing your full strength , you only utilize what you know you could keep under control .
