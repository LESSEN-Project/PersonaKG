   (ID: f35d74d4d36905b144a4851bae7ac6c2014ebdbd)

2. i ' m hard stuck in borderline gold and i play with plat players and they all believe i should be at least in low plat . i play zarya and pretty much any off tank and it ' s hard to find a decent main tank so this is accurate af
   (ID: 7da77d27f88bf1f61217e0ac91e9049e57a7e29d)

3. no , not really . i pretty much take it just to avoid feeling like crap . sometimes i ' ll take an extra mg or two if i ' m gonna be in an extra anxious situation like say an interview but even then i don ' t really feel it does to much and i don ' t wanna go past that dosage .
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

4. no . i want the opposite . i hate being questioned after question on what it  s like . what are they saying ? who  s talking ? what are you seeing ? when are gonna have another episode ? what do you see during your episode ? the idea is say i got the dosage of my meds upped and wait about two weeks to  let them settle  until i can officially say i don  t hear them anymore . lve been scared to come forward because about this because i was so used to having hearing the voices and everything that when they went away it was unsettling and it wasn  t a problem lying because i started believing it myself but now that i  ve grown i wanna break out of it so i can truly learn who the new and better me is
   (ID: 4e784da799782c45d8883de53e87a533129a3b8e)

   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

6. it ' s the same as life . once you accept that you ' ll die someday it ' s much more please t not having to worry all the time .
   (ID: 2ce8587266f0888bb10672ccf8a7be1bc6c3f0d2)

7. the only way to stop crushing is to just ask them out , and move on if they say no . realize that she ' s not special , and she might not be for you . people fear rejection , so instead they find someone and then subconsciously have fantasies of them . that " perfect girl " could be in reality a serial killer , a sociopath , narcissistic , etc . you must get to know them before developing feelings . looks can make you notice someone , but it ' s your job to talk to them to know if they even consider you a partner , and whether you even actually like them
   (ID: 3e7b07ddd384cb288bc529e6aeb73f840aa5a294)

8. it takes over literally every aspect of your life . everything . it gets to a point where you literally have to put yourself before anything else . it can seem narcissistic to people who don  t know what you  re going through , but when it comes between wanting to blow your brains out and everything else , it  s an easy choice . hopefully
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

9. i ' m not a doctor but i believe opium is in its own category of opiates . i don ' t think it ' s considered a depressant except in higher doses . kind of like alcohol . in addition , opium then is not nearly as refined as say heroin . maybe there were other items being smoked . from personal experience i had back surgery like digit years ago . if i took one opiate painkiller i was pain free , calm and chatty . more would make me tired .
   (ID: 30572ac5982532854b2ead41285ed9bbaba6d654)

10. i am sure you can find something positive in life , did you check for stds ?
   (ID: 161e54996257552df993f906d6f848a053922141)

11. my psychiatrist says i have ocd tendencies along with aspergers syndrome . i don ' t know if i actually have ocd or not but from my experience i also get these impulsive thoughts . " i liked these girls when i was a young child , do i still like them now ? " that ' s basically my worry , i ' ve been an adult for a few years and i worry the same . " why won ' t these feelings go away , i don ' t want these feelings and thoughts . they were okay when i was younger but not now ! stop it stop it stop it ! " my psychiatrist says sometimes we have trouble shifting from developmental thoughts to adult thoughts . he also said to be in the present moment more . i don ' t want these thoughts , i don ' t want these feelings . i really think i have " harm ocd " but we ' ll have to see what my psychiatrist says next session in digit weeks
   (ID: f9d3bf7ce779e854aa865f12a7dfaaee14a65cfa)

12. i loved it because the world felt like ds1 , which i played first . ds3 is awesome but it ' s essentially a remake of demon souls and i don ' t like the hub and spoke world those two have . people give it too much hate and don ' t bother getting deep into why the devs did what they did with the game .
   (ID: 95c90f0b7430996843a42a4f365667a13e4c2eb5)

13. i ' m not sure about how much you ' d need every day but you can certainly become more tolerant of peppers until you can eat them like any other food . you essentially build up a resistance to the spice of it and become , as it were , immune to spicy foods if you do it enough .
   (ID: 993e97b08b2c0bbb5df4c4050ba876286c54054d)

14. i didn ' t necessarily ' disappear ' but i moved several times until i was unknown by anyone in my ' new ' life . on the occasions i ' ve been passing through places my old life existed it was strange to see that actually very little had changed . if cloning could be done , i ' d probably replace myself in this life with a clone and go again . but hey ho .
   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

15. if there  s one thing i  ve learned from dating apps keep the conversation focused on making plans . small talk can really dampen the situation especially if you haven  t met yet , no reason to talk about everything before hand . wait until you meet each other in person .
   (ID: 5b59b30ecdf3a93e4634d1600b3020fd8e9dc7e2)

16. if you don ' t like your job , find one thing about the job you do like , and make time to do that one thing every day . you  ll have something to look forward to everyday .
   (ID: 225291489bc1a4ddf3d197a3062fa9ff935f3029)

17. this is how my b  w knights deck started . i needed a lower power deck for when i end up in those awkward super  casual pods . it ' s been interesting to have to tell myself ' no ' when i come across cards that would be great it in it . that ' s a whole new realm and i ' m sometimes proud of my restraint .
   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

18. so far , they have dismissed my fears about me maybe being depressed among other issues by telling me that i merely " lack faith " , hence my maybe depression . they won ' t allow me to see a doctor , even if i ' m practically begging for it . a psychiatrist is their " last resort " though , they said . funny , considering the fact that they were supportive of me wanting to pursue a psychology degree back in high school .
   (ID: afb250d177d47ce6467dfa3414d91e9e07eec6c4)

19. yeah true living in the moment sounds like it would do the trick since i think my issue is that i worry about the future . thank you
   (ID: 9721da66d978b8a2541ec60ba070b6fa9121482d)

20. i  m a ftm , and the first bit of your comment sounded just like me lol . i have everything planned to a t . i read somewhere about ftms being more likely to get induced so for some reason in my head , me giving labor always starts with me being induced . i think i do this because if it  s induced it  ll be planned and i have a weird obsession with planning everything lol . reading this really made me stop and think it might not go how i plan for it to go , which is scary .
