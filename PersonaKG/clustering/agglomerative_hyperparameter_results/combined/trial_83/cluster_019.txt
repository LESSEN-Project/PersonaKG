   (ID: e46c4597dda4f39a1122f37ba9383f7441387cf9)

2. vader needs all speed you can get , so speed set and best speed secondaries . ep needs at least one set of potency . thrawn also needs a lot of speed , some would say even higher than vader ' s . can be modded with good speed or with a focus on survivability . as f2p you will never keep up with the arena meta , so the best you have to do is have some priorities and work towards them . to climb higher on arena , the best advice is to focus on getting good mods , that is what separates good from bad teams . at digit . 5m you should be in a guild that finishes haat , if you are not then it should be your main focus . otherwise , working toward hsr would be smart , because you will need quite some time gearing up multiple squads . if you don ' t care about it right now , jtr is a great focus , she is a beast can solo haat p2 and p4 with a full resistance team , or can solo p3 with thrawn and cls . aside from that , chewbacca or revan albeit we dont know yet what is coming , i ' m farming kotor in " advance " are some other nice goals to have .
   (ID: a304d2b10646e73686547edafa852cc87a894eb5)

9. just make a new character ! that  s part of the game ! learning and trying new builds ! just re  level another character ! it  s endless excuses over at that community when the fact of the matter is  the game is complicated for the sake of being complicated . plus , the story  theme  tone is nothing great like diablo digit and digit were . poe is not a valid replacement for diablo in my eyes .
   (ID: 9414b9913220ebe2601862e3001aac74ebcffe33)

10. another good strategy is to have foreknowledge of whether or not they say " shoot " at the end of the phrase , and then do the opposite of what they do to disrupt the round to give them more time to think , and generally they ' ll not choose rock since they had to think for a longer period of time , and will digit  of the time choose scissor , allowing you to choose rock and beat them .

15. ive done it before intentionally once or twice . it requires a good deal of self awareness . to do it i tried focusing on and idea , almost as if a mantra , as i drifted to sleep carrying the idea with me through diminishing consciousness . then at some point you are just dreaming and you have to realize you are asleep . hopefully this is done by realizing that you are dreaming about what you intended and then go from there . i realized though that i got terrible sleep when i did this so i stopped . i also knew someone who claimed to lucid dream a few nights a week for a about a year . he practiced techniques and got good at it .
