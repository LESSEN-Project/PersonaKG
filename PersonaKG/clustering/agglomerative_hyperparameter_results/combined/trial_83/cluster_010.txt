" i ' m sorry you ' re going through this .

8. while i know mocking gobert for crying leads to a toxic environment , is there not some point here in at least examining why he  s crying ? gobert , reigning defensive player of the year on a team playing great and trending upward , broke down because he didn  t receive an individual honor . specifically , an individual honor that feels more like a popularity contest for an exhibition game . can he not let this past him ? does he really need the validation from a combination of fans , players , and journalists to let him know he is a good athlete ? he  s last year  s dpoy ! on a great young team ! i don  t want to attack the act of crying in itself , but i feel like for me to defend it , i would have to know he  s crying for something that matters . if he cried after getting knocked out of the playoffs , or blowing a digit point lead , i would understand . crying after not receiving an all star bid ? i guess i just don  t get it . if there  s something bigger i  m missing here , please enlighten me , because i really want to understand this better . i just feel like if i was an nba gm or coach , i don  t want my player getting worked up over not receiving an individual honor when i  m focused on winning real games .
