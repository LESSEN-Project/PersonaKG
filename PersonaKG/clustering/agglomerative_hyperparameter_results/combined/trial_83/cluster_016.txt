1. well it  s actually not exactly safe to go there right now with all the protests that  s going on . but my friend actually stayed there for digit  digit months last year and he  s been telling me and my other friends to just go and live there . i truly would want to and could literally change a community .
   (ID: f8dc0ff928f07f3c544894b03ad92f5944e13321)

2. but what about rebuilding the world ? why do you think they introduced so many new communities ? " your world is about to get a whole lot bigger "
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

3. it ' s a place you can visit , but you don ' t actually go there .
   (ID: 9a4083ece31f241c8374b733a1ef26a760deb17a)

4. thanks for the info ! yes i ' ve heard it ' s very beautiful and i can ' t wait to see it . do you recall which tour you chose ?
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

   (ID: 0092767d04168a05a983237480637793d5458cba)

6. by the time time traveling was invented people might not care enough to change it , it would probably be ancient history to them and not worth rewriting history as they know it .
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

11. i ' ve been to your town !
   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

12. if you want good advice be willing to spend upwards of  digit each . depending on the size of your group that should be enough of get you a hotel on the strip , entry into a day club , entry into two night clubs with bottle service , and enough for some rippers after each night club night , and of course food and pre alcohol too for each day . some say bottle service is not worth it but it really depends how big your group is , if you got a group bigger than digit i think it ' s totally worth it . girls are way easier to meet at the clubs this way and they almost always will stick with your group when the party is over and you move to the rippers at the end of the day . rippers also are more reluctant to a push private dances on you when girls are in your group which is good cause you will get fleeced with private dances . having a hotel on the strip will save you money on transportation and also if a girl asks you what hotel you are staying at you will be judged if you say strat or the other cheap hotels away from the strip . stick with mgm , new york , ph , aria , even monte carlo . go for a range of clubs , xs has a pretty sweet day club , omnia is pretty upscale night club , and pic and go to a more washed out night club as well such as tao . this ensures you will meet a good range of girls to spend the night with .

13. went to north korea because i was an idiot . while i did survive the trip , i would not recommend anyone to visit a place where secret police agents follows you everywhere .
   (ID: 943cc5e526975c71d69ca1804666ab2f83b06a27)

14. i used to so many many years ago . i never had a bad experience but i wouldn ' t do it now . i ' m glad it ' s been a positive thing for you . i hope you find yourself tomorrow healthy and safe . what had you done beforehand to prepare , if anything ?
   (ID: 8797828a745ecd521e3b219ff004d26777b4f4f7)

15. i think london would be too urbanised if that makes sense ? american cities , at least the massive ones work on a grid structure , making them a bit easier . london is , comparatively , a fucking mess , not to mention huge . so unless they dropped a nuke incredibly close , it would be a nightmare to build a game world . maybe with the power of future consoles but i don ' t think it would be that feasible
   (ID: 6ab97df6bacac740d323c579b509de1838c5d332)

16. good . can ' t really be that arsed about them finding another group of people who want to kill them . can we instead have , say , a pretty damn mean snowstorm descend on the area and they have to survive that in their communities , with loads of walkers in the area ? possibly even having to still make trips between the communities ?
   (ID: 2ac4d2cea574e655d7fdb1ab9b4886989929ca96)

17. i  d like to know more about your old town . if you can remember more , update us

19. weirdest  bungalow cutest  bubbles most frightening  murder
   (ID: 239eded9e37fe1b7388561d1e82993d15dd4fc15)

20. with soccefootball there are so many players around the world , plus the transfeloan system , it makes it easy for the wealthy clubs to acquire good players . in the nba it ' s a lot more difficult , sometimes there is nothing they can do . teams like the lakers and knicks would have been relegated a few years ago , despite how big of fan bases and wealth they have .
