1. are you sure you want leather ? something like the tourmaster is a way sensible . i have the black one , btw , it ' s about as anti  logoey as they get . it ' s a three season jacket all in one . the liners fit easily into a tank bag so i can head out early while it ' s still chilly , strip them out and stow ' em for the hot afternoon riding . there ' s three parts  the mesh outer jacket , a rain liner and a quilted liner . the liners can be used in any combination . i ' ve had more than a few tourmaster over my digit digit  digit decades of riding  this particular jacket is of typically good quality . lists for about  digit but i think i paid closer to  digit .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

2. but they both literally do the same thing .  .
   (ID: aadf22a91ea1305681d9e9e51890c22ca2a37577)

3. if i tell you the answer , you will have have learned nothing .
   (ID: a7cc693c08ec25a5aeb346572b504a32001418a5)

4. if treated correctly you can get more than digit hours . the constant heat increases resistance , which is why you get digit hours .

5. rtuk ' e internetten sallamak varken baskin falan ne gerek var kardesim  s
   (ID: c41e4affc406bbc71e6c12aabf095d759b6dbec2)

6. you mean you want to use a simple splitter cable , like the type you ' d use to plug two sets of headphones into a single headphone jack ? i personally wouldn ' t do that . i ' d get a proper mixer although for what you paid for the scarlett and the cost of a cheap mixer , you ' re probably into the cost of a better interface that has multiple inputs and would allow you to use it as the mixer kind of like what i do .
   (ID: 364e60394a4f5ca22ac4f75dfb86f39a4969dda7)

7. it  s not really about hiding runes tbh you can just get to see those using the sw exporter anyways . i like having my island empty and it makes the game lag less ! mostly do it for the organization purpose tbh
   (ID: 7c96bac704435347f721cc9a3056b8d7be16cc06)

8. i have a tablet but i just use it for youtube or netflix sometimes .
   (ID: 3fb5cf32d13620677a9e3d9bd2657b8432abf31f)

9. give me half of what you found and i ' ll tell you .
   (ID: 2623e4996f6df0e5814dbede4fbc9c1f13de4382)

10. this is probably impractical , but i thought it might be cool if it was like the raid equivalent of ditto , since they both know transform . like you defeat a common raid boss like magikarp or something , and one out of every digit times it transforms into mew probably before the catch , so it ' s still a tough throw and you don ' t accidentally waste golden razz on a magikarp .
   (ID: fc70415de2435c629ec792dbd90c954786c0bd16)

11. because of streaming platforms like netflix and hulu . also last night
   (ID: ad898f238b3dc29e08e2e0d1ae1f284c2c13604e)

   (ID: 23394798067974e95a922a95c6609d16ca1b11dd)

14. the is is a good answer . the words really just very broadly define what they do . when it comes to implementing these things , it  s a huge variety that  s hard to really categorize .
   (ID: 76442d997e7f64c10223aeac0f4ff8af70ff9dde)

15. if you ever find that  feel good  character let me know . i would like to try them for myself

16. i ' ve never experienced this with my antidepressants before . what are you taking ?
   (ID: deb51648159c9d9d915a701d8f77ac885a29b9b4)

17. by no means an expert just from my experience lvl digit at this time . digit  from my experience incense only works for you my wife has the game too , beside me on the couch will not see the same pokes or any i see when i have incense activated . incense seems to attract pokemon that are " native " to the area , but not necessarily the pokemon on your nearby list . i use incense when i ' m sitting at home being lazy because when i ' m walking around they pop up regularly but hardly at all when stationary . incense seems to create pokemon rather than attract nearby ones . thats all i got , hopefully someone else can help with your other questions .
   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

18. honestly , i feel like the fits are more " solid " if i can put it in a word . when i use your traditional flight they always seen a bit flimsy and inconsistent . i know a lot of it is mental , but it ' s just what i have come to know and trust . also , fit flights spin , and i have noticed that it really helps when you are grouping your darts close together . less chance for one dart to prevent another from hitting your target . an additional benefit is they seem to last much longer for me . they are more expensive , but i think the value is there , especially for the shafts . i use the same shafts for almost digit months . i have never broken one and only change mine when they get too dirty i use white always . as for flights , i would say you have about a month or two months before you require changing . when i used regular flights , they were getting torn to bits every week .

19. yeah like op said there are two other people here possibly one who are shadow banned so check that out . anyway i ordered some 350s off ali about a week ago and the tracking number begins with ls . they just got processed through the sorting facility , and they haven ' t done anything else . it just takes a really long time for it to get out of the country . give it some time .
   (ID: 89c3606d2dfc5d2a2da97fb49ddc1894f8bf330f)

20. i have had a couple of them , but i do use mods and some of them have not been updated for digit . digit . are you using any mods ? what are your system specs ?
