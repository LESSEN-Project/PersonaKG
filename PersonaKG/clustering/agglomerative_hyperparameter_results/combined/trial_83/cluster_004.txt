1. dude yta she sounds like she lives alone in her apartment so why in the absolute fuck would you take all that food to your family . if you live with your family they feed you don ' t they ? and honestly why would one person make a ton of food . hmm . maybe it ' s because they want leftovers . dude if you manage to stay in this relationship you better count your blessings .
   (ID: de9f62a8114c08877e3a53460027d9810f5f3912)

2. you found a girl you enjoys soviet jokes ? i wish . such a dumb thing but i enjoy it anyway , man you just broke my heart . best thing you can do is just talk to her . by the sounds of it you may never see her again so what  s there to loose ey ? it would be ideal if you could just set a date that one day you two can meet up but that  s hard i know . at the same time life is full of those relationships that you are so unawarely fond of until they disappear . the worst part is sometimes you can  t save them . however those are the ones you cherish the most . don  t look at it on times missed out . you had a great time and should see it as that . it  s all about perspective . it  s only depressing because you see it that way . don  t forget to look at yourself from further away . i am a little depressed as are we all but i just imagine a camera zooming out from my view and into a third person view of me right now . then it just pans out as far as you can picture . it helps to just realise how small all these things you are worried about are . look at the whole picture instead of fixating on a single fault .
   (ID: 411b23f3d2a1f254c1c92c17670bb02c191a1301)

3. you do what it takes . if doesn ' t hurt him for you to fantasize . if you tell him what you just told us , it will bruise his ego .
   (ID: d06e7949138d7c04b968c15f3dd6f37d07c5a670)

4. shite in her kettle
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

5. i see crazy ass homeless people or crackheads all the time but some dude sticking his dick out is better than a earthquake or asteroid
   (ID: 701f8001d10c04dcd53d9b13ab2a896b452e50f7)

6. maybe ? i mean most of say you want to feel loved , you want a relationship that includes sex , this would just make it meaningless .
   (ID: 6259aa52bc6c6edc83b90b70ae922dcaba51cac8)

7. i think you really don ' t get it . we don ' t want a significant other , we do not want to find " someone to spend our lives with " your post and your opinion shows how little you actually know .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

8. is this a real thing ? people get accepted into colleges because their parents were there ?
   (ID: d23bd8fb57b99544637110d5b376dba68b3e2d0f)

9. roll around uncontrollably and hug her and tell her it ' s going to be fine but try and find a way out . shes for sure doing the same thing . we tell each other we love each other and embrace . wait for sweet death
   (ID: df32c155f124e2413f811d36f780385403a5374a)

10. she ' s amazing in the last photo , too ! i know of the on  off sub but it ' s still a strange thing , imo . it must be the mystery or desire to see what ' s under there . the beauty of women ' s fashion and style or something . idk .
   (ID: 1f3e82e13d88ba22fce8ba80102ccc24b3880ae9)

11. do you think she keeps the same stuff she does on the normal backpack but everything is tiny ? maybe she does videos for tiny cooking and that ' s where she keeps all her tiny ingredients .
   (ID: 9a96ba583f43f670f5797ea5031052161bf613cf)

12. it sounds like depression . i  ve been in your girlfriend  s position and it  s tough for everyone involved . i urge you to look at the fundamental soundness of your relationship and decide if this issue is enough to end it . whatever you decide is not wrong . it  s okay to determine that this relationship in its current state isn  t working and that ending it is the best option . just , make sure there aren  t better options , first .

13. incel is just classing someone as ugly . they can literally have any characteristics
   (ID: 95583dff17d109cd099c45c49642d5da447bf632)

14. it looks like a family photo with the new , hotter , younger step mum .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

15. yes she is very close to her stepmother . you asked about our relationship , we have been in a de facto relationship for about digit . digit years now . i have been doing what i can to comfort her and be there for her . i took her out to lunch today i actually wrote this post on the drive home to take her mind off of things and get out of the house . at the moment she is ok then bursts into tears at random times so all i can do is hug her , tell her i love her and let her cry it out . when she was told she cried and then asked to be left alone for a while so if she needs some space i think she will tell me . thank you for the advice , there is a lot there to take in so i will have to read it a few times . her stepmother still might pull through and beat it , but all we can do at this stage is hope for the best . thank you again for helping me understand and giving me pointers on how to approach this .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

16. well if you ' re mormon and under digit it ' s the fact that the person doesn ' t do the thing where they go on a date with you twice it more in a row without going out with someone else .
   (ID: 9e778023eda5589ac577e3789edfd900d208edf7)

17. i ' ll be sure to remember that when it ' s your child or your bestfriends child or a relative of yours .
   (ID: 03cf8378bcb94745c52eb716a381f55774f3b358)

18. major props to her honestly , i ' m assuming youtube didn ' t know about this when the video was made , so i wonder what they ' re going to do .
   (ID: 5173a1d5475490650d7365b2c2b2f2c579d33099)

19. i ' ve done photography for digit  years and have lost count of how many times people have asked me to make them look thinner or cover up things they perceive as flaws . my rule is i only remove temporary things like pimples or cold sores . we can work with posing and lighting to highlight your best bits and draw attention away from parts you aren ' t comfortable with . but i ' ve always said to people i photograph  " we ' re going to make you look awesome and aren ' t going to tell any lies . yes , retouchers are just doing what they are being told , but i ' d quit a job where i was asked to do things like this . if you choose to be ethical , you are choosing to not have a bunch of jobs .
   (ID: fcec87cb8b541d87ad0eb8b52c3541c8fc49132b)

20. if someone doesn ' t wanna be in a relationship the worst thing you can do is try to talk them into staying .
