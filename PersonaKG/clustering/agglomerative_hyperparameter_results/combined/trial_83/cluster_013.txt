1. i don ' t know about you , but being the oldest i had a bunch of responsibilities forced onto me since i was digit . they weren ' t even like " oh he ' s going to walk the dog " it was like " he ' s a terrible example for the digit other younger siblings , take the trash out that we filled past the top by the hornets nest , and go clean up the dogs watery shit and don ' t come upstairs until your finished " i really wish i had the " responsibility free " childhood most people seem to have .
   (ID: a73b0dda35d389b4f74e47db6574e0f71738b683)

2. thanks , that only made me think everyone else was doing the same thing , and doubled down my fear that they were just tolerating my presence out of politeness . that ' s pretty much how all of society works , we all just tolerate each other existence . you fit right in .
   (ID: 225291489bc1a4ddf3d197a3062fa9ff935f3029)

3. got to be pretty insane to be against it . once a marriage doesn ' t work anymore that ' s the only option .
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

4. yes no maybe . i don ' t know . can you repeat the question ?
   (ID: 920ba0628cbea5588ecca4c8ba7f80b411ff70ef)

5. you should tip generously , and more importantly , you should know that bartenders and servers notice every single time you don ' t tip . we remember you the next time you come in . we notice as you begin to put down a tip but decide not to because the bar is so busy and clamoring . we started believing in god only so we could repent for the regrettable , unspeakable hurt we wished upon you and your bubbling children . we especially remember you if you were over the top friendly , because only people who don ' t tip believe smarmy inauthenticity is currency . to quote chuck palahniuk   we are the middle children of history , raised by television to believe that someday we ' ll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars , but we won ' t . and we ' re just learning this fact . so don ' t fuck with us .
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

6. it ' s okay . i don ' t mind it . i actually appreciate it . thank you so much !
   (ID: ab3c8c681660786b8cfd174d247a71a2d57b02b6)

7. yeah , if you ' re curious you can find out more about the person via messaging or whatever means you decide to use . but you shouldn ' t just meet with random people just because they told you to .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

8. my strategy is not to be a fucking bitch and go do it . who  s going to stop me no one .
   (ID: b2a2cd889183833ca9a753b2d28f6d89d867e1f9)

9. my mom once went to a popeye ' s where the service was really slow and there was bulletproof glass separating the cashier from the customers . the service was so slow that a guy who was waiting in line was able to watch a few episodes of daredevil in the amount of time it took him to get his food . my brother wanted to leave , but my mom had already paid for our chicken and she didn ' t want to trust the dumb kid behind the counter with her credit card again . the moral of the story is that you shouldn ' t go to popeye ' s restaurants in the ghetto .
   (ID: 17d6f5fb6fdd1b0ceedb5ec118276bdbb72a462f)

10. that idea is still there , you just have to ignore society and their ideas of livelihood . honestly , the thought if having kids isnt in my book and i still dont know if i want to get married . so i ' m just living and loving my life the way it is now .
   (ID: 2e369dc21156ed2b443bc09084e27c8acb516093)

11. if you ' re actively trying to help them grow , then you ' re not guilty of inaction , my dude . even good people sometimes do bad things , make mistakes and need help to understand why it ' s not ok . tbh if you think your friends are worth trying to help and not giving up on , then fuck what others might think of you . you just be as positive an influence as you can be . good luck , getting people to change their minds is tough work , but hopefully you ' ll get there .
   (ID: f114f40c03e5812464be61882b264a0abe2a545e)

12. i guess digit . digit million people shouldn ' t be goths

   (ID: a5976f282a96c036f5e4d14957305323c9a5776d)

17. this is a truly horrible situation as a single dad i can ' t imagine what i would do if i lost one of mine . my heart goes out to you .
   (ID: 1afb7597077681179430af152997f04fd73ba0ee)

18. i don ' t really have anything to say , but you ' ve put a smile on your face for having personal responsibility . i can ' t sympathize with the ' previously religious ' part , but for the rest , you ' re not alone . being responsible for your own actions sucks sometimes .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

19. i feel like " luncheon " is one of those words that you can ' t use anymore without sounding like you ' re trying too hard
   (ID: 3994e1d32967dee02bf170d70c0ccc2d7dbd99d5)

20. depends how fresh . if it just happened , you say sorry and then might wanna give them space to process whatever it is you did .
