19. i  m a bit late to the party here but i found both of these to be exquisite . the laptop typing is a huge trigger for me and you nailed it . the only thing that could make that better is the visual trigger of long nails , but that  s entirely a personal preference . i won  t recount what others have already said in regards to camera setup , i couldn  t put it better than they already have . being a regular viewer of your non  asmr stuff , i found this to still be in line with what i  d expect from a larkin love clip , and honestly there isn  t enough asmrotica . so thanks for contributing to that . outside the tapping , one of my personal favorite triggers is hair clipping and scalp massage . i  m sure you  ve got a long list of things you  d like to try for asmr . i  m curious what asmr you listen to achieve relaxation . there  s a few yt personalities that i  ve grown to love and look forward to listening to when they release new clips or role  plays . i  d be interested to see if we have any overlap . thanks again for being so personable and hope to listen to more asmr from you in the future .
