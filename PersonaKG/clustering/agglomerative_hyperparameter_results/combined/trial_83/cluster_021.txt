15. it  s about the stories we tell ourselves . the narratives we build in our heads . let me give you a few examples . if i bought into this dumb idea that you have your late teenage years and early 20s to build your future vs . i have my whole life to do it , then i have a huge problem once i  m not in my early 20s any more , and discovered that the career i picked in my late teenage years because all those well  meaning adults told me how f  cking important it was to pick my future career at that age is not a good choice for me , and that i hate what i do , and , according to the most common belief , what i  m destined to continue to do until retirement in digit or digit years from now . i have a pretty f  cked up life . if i didn ' t bought into this stupid belief , i can still change this career to something else . the same is with the following beliefs that you have just one career in your lifetime that once you have a family their often not so basic ! needs are more important , and you can  t do anything about it , and you need to suck it up , even if it means climbing the wrong ladder for the rest of your professional life because they rely on your hefty pay check each month that you absolutely need to go to college that you absolutely need to graduate from harvard , because your father graduated from harvard and , by the way , that  s the thing he is most known for in his life that you need to make your parents proud do what they tell you , or what you think they would like to see happen in your life , because they were so good to you and you feel that you can  t let them down , and , as a result , they think they can plan your life for you , that you absolutely need to own a car and buy a new one every three years that you absolutely need to have the same lifestyle your parents have , that you will retire at the predetermined age that that  s what we all eventually do  we will retire  so it  s even unthinkable that you could not plan to retire that you stick to what is tried and true , maintain the status quo and avoid risk because that  s what your parents told you  because that  s what they care about that you sacrifice your life goals , your dreams , for your children because that  s what parents need to do , that you not your children are responsible for securing their best future which is so wrong , by the way ! , that you can  t succeed  achieve your dream because you weren  t born in , say , silicon valley , that you can  t succeed  achieve your dream because your parents didn  t give you what you need , and don  t support you , on and on . of course , life likes to surprise us from time to time . it really does . but most of it , boy it is exactly what we make it and , most importantly , what we first make it in our heads .
   (ID: fed0c0c8b0ae958dd1a6a750f7a4f677f0b34628)
