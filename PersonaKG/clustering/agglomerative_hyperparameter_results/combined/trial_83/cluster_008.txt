11. not said , really , but vocalized all the same . so i was sitting on the bus on the way home from high school , and over the years , you come to know most of the other kids on the bus , by name at least . so one of my bus  bound acquaintances in the grade ahead of me , let ' s call her claire , at the start of the bus ride starts laughing about something . now as claire was sitting directly behind me and allegedly having just been told one hell of a zinger , the laugh was loud . loud enough that it really hurt my ear . my first instinct was to reel around and produce an equally loud , pitch perfect imitation of said laugh . claire just looked me dead in the eyes and said " wesleyrobertsimpson , i did not appreciate that . " i ' ll never forget that moment , nor forgive myself for it . tl  dr  never genuinely insult somebody else ' s laugh , you ' ll never forgive yourself .

12. " i ' m sorry . this is very upsetting . we have things in place so things like this don ' t happen . but you can see , mistakes can happen . thank you for bringing this to our attention . are you ok ? i can tell you ' re rightfully upset . here is a refund . i will alert my staff to take extra care in the future . i am so sorry this happened . i hope we can regain your trust " or something of the like . always say you ' re sorry , even if you ' re not the one who made the mistake . i have seen pharmacists that become completely defensive when they are told they have made a mistake . it always ends worse off than if they just said they were sorry and made the situation right . drives me bonkers .
