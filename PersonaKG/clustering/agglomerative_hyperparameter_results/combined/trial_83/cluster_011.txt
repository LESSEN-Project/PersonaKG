20. since what a fursona is has been explained to death here i ' ll just add to it first , you do not need a fursona to be a furry . in general " being furry " is a very loose term . the only thing in common between all of us is that we like anthropomorphic art . however if you do want to interact with the community outside of reddit having at least an oc as an avatar will help tremendously . second , hya reddit is the best place imo . stay here if you want amazing furry art regularly oand go to furry  irl some nsfw , not a lot for memes and shitposting .
