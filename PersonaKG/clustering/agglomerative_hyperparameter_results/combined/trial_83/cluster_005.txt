4. for me , a major reason aside from image quality and so on to jump from compact to dslr was response time . in this line of thought , a jump from dslr to mirrorless might make you feel that the camera is laggy , because , well , despite all the advantages the evf offers , it ' s still more laggy than an ovf . that ' s subject to change , of course , but that ' s it at least with today ' s technology . if viewfinder lag compared to a dslr is not an issue for you , then go on  sony ' s got some amazing stuff to offer . as for the d700 , i don ' t think it really has a true successor yet think what d700 is to d3  the digit with these digit mp is into another category but if you ' ve got the nerve and resources to cope with large files , why not ?  the df is a very much a niche model , moreover it ' s plastic  y and not that well built from what i ' ve read  the only nikon option left in the category of full  frame  and  not  so  high  resolution seems to be the d4  d4s , which i think is justifiable if you have the money , but then again  by far it ' s not affordable for everyone .

19. it appears from the back story that the artifact psychology doesn ' t truly want to just kill things . personally i see it that the hammer wants people to see it kill people . to be widely known and feared . you should change the concordance to reflect this . here are examples   digit if the owner makes an intimidate check that results in digit or more enemies of the same level running away from the battle . " owner delivers killing blow to  digit  of enemy party  digit . instead make it so that the  digit one is gained if two or more of that creatures allies sees it happen . " owner kills helpless enemy  digit . instead change it to the owner executes an enemy . not simply a helpless enemy , but it has to be made into an event . also make heavy concordance minuses if the owner losing in a way that many people know about it . you might consider making any good aligned character who picks it up immediately be at the unsatisfied level due to the naturally non  good nature of the hammer . it might also be interesting to have the owner take a  digit to insight checks due to the paranoia of the the hammer .
