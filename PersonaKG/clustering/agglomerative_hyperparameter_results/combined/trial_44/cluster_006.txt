5. my friend was in a similar situation . his parents are british but they moved to south africa and had him there , so although he is a uk citizen he wasn ' t classified as a local student for the purpose of uni fees . you could always try germany . you could study for free at public german universities as an undergraduate . good luck !
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

9. i don ' t know enough about canada to know if this is stupid or not , so feel free to ignore me if it is . can you sign up with credit karma ? it ' s a free site that will show you your credit reports and they also will show you offers you might qualify for . check it out and see if they recommend any particular cards . discover cards are usually pretty easy to get , as are capital one cards . just be careful of things like annual fees and high interest rates .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

   (ID: 1b4a970a63450e21b56e1d38502b30aca032cd3f)

13. this looks very hard . i wonder how students can afford this . it ' s very hard to want a good education with this . i ' m from france and all public university and schools are free , everyone who ' s motivated can build his destiny and make studies . there is also the apprenticeship which permits to make studies half time and work half time in the studies domain . this is great , you can become a engineer while having a salary more than digit per month , and you ' ll strat as engineer with digit years work experience . the us system is so hard , but i think this isn ' t the worst . in my opinion the worth is healthcare . having to pay for health is awful , pay 20k  for a pregnancy and labor is so much ! this requires a lot of organization and brave .
   (ID: 862cb85d93fa9b931c3c64cf2fd17ef592d48c50)

14. I am astronaut.
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

15. i have no advice , as i am in a very similar boat . i ' m digit and have digit years in admin , hate it , am considering a new career but have no idea what to do . i too love reading and writing but don ' t want to pursue writing full time for the reasons you mentioned . i just wanted to say that you are not alone . there are so many people our age who feel unfulfilled with their current career and feel that it could be too late to start a new one . it isn ' t . think about the average life span . we have a whole lot of life to live , it ' s never too late to pursue happiness . have you ever considered that for people like us , perhaps there will be no aha moment ? some people simply don ' t have digit purpose to devote their lives to . that can be so scary because it can leave you feeling restless , directionless and lost . i watched a ted talk that referred to this as being a " multi potentialite . here ' s the link if you care to check it out  maybe you should do some searching . find what naturally gives you joy . it doesn ' t matter if it ' s a profession , a hobby or an interest that captures your attention . identify things that you are excited to do and go from there . some of the happiest people found their dream job completely on accident while just doing something they love . i hope that rambling helped some . best of luck to you !
   (ID: a9b07d3f94647dffebe730771c20ee3ca1af7ec4)

16. the connections you make can be more important than the things you learn in the classroom . so if there are clubs and internships related to the job you want do them . look for jobs that have skills related to what you want to do , or can at least sell to your future employer . the worst ? you find out you hate what you are going into but can change to something else before you are too invested ! the best ? valuable connections that will help you get where you want to go . remember , its not what you know its who you know .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

17. i have nothing against people studying what interests them , but i don  t have much sympathy for people with these degrees who complain about how hard it is to find a job in their field or how nobody wants to pay a lot of money for someone with a liberal arts degree .
   (ID: 4654e3a9a75835f9ff28170ddf31d5d3cf296ea2)

18. i ' ve been working at starbucks for several months and nobody ' s found out i hate coffee .
   (ID: d54a04c3eba52404f5dd7abb0e459a949dbc7f93)

19. hey all , so i ' m currently a 1st year physics student in one of the better uk unis and am starting to fear for my future . the thing is i only have enough money to sustain myself for the duration of the course , that means that i will only have the opportunity to do one internship because of how the uk system works , no masters studies , no digit year industry placements . so after digit years i will have a bsc in physics and will be looking for a job . i ' ve tried reading up online what a physics graduate can do , however most of the conversations are geared towards masters and phd ' s and for undergrads they usually talk about majors  minors in the us , which isn ' t a thing here , i only have physics to my name . now , i don ' t care that much if my job has little or nothing to do with my course , as long as it doesn ' t feel like my education was a complete waste of time . though it seems to me like i can ' t get into nucleaoptics  medical  meteorological physics , because they have enough masters and phd applicants . i like programming , but i won ' t be qualified enough to compete against compsci  engineering graduates , even if i take extra modules in them .   x200b  so besides teaching which i really don ' t want to do , am i completely screwed ? i only have one chance at an internship , what sector should i aim for that has no problems accepting physics bsc ' s with a little bit of experience ?
   (ID: 96167969642339382f3b9c4eeee4ea73aec3823c)

20. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .
