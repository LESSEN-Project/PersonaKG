1. thing is i wouldn  t call it a debate if we were to go by the textbook definition . i could almost guarantee that if i sat down with lorinbassnectar he wouldn  t want to have a debate about policy he would simply shut me out . i  m sure , and maybe i  m making an assumption , but i  m sure that we could both agree that a lot if not the majority of his fan base has no knowledge about policy and simply follows what is posted . that  s what i find dangerous . when so many people look up to an individual they treat his words as facts , and this applies to both sides of the aisle . i also call it dangerous because it is a sure way of not only ostracizing a large portion of your fan base who listens to your music to escape reality but it could even pose the problem of many people losing hope in one place where they thought they could find it , and that is dance music . that  s just me and i can tell from the many downvotes that  s it  s not a very popular opinion .

2. everything you just listed off can be said about alot of other places outside of the united states included i guess they ' re influential pop culture wise , but not much else

3. anime is a genre no different than a type of music , and yes it may have many subcategories like most things do . you can keep trying to justify your point though .

4. I am unaware manicurists.

5. i ' m going to assume that you , as a police force , have limited resources , and you can ' t possibly investigate every reference to some crazy thing in art . so , if that ' s the case , how do you choose what to investigate ? are you investigating rappers because you think they ' re more likely to be involved in crime ? that could be racist and prejudiced . if you ' re investigating rappers why haven ' t you investigated carrie underwood for " before he cheats " ? start to see why it might be a civil liberties issue ?

6. artists do far more than criticize community norms . if anything , they emphasize the feelings that people share in those communities . the better question is , and the one i think you ' re trying to ask , is  is there a place  allocation of resources for dissent ? absolutely , it ' s democratic . artists see the world in a different way and i value that viewpoint . national endowment at the community level . i would fund that so hard . i ' d like to think that a majority of people would feel that way .

7. i live in america too , we have made music , sport , fashion , art and scientific contributions unique to us . it may not be thousands of years old but i think it  s there . sorry if i  m coming off as rude .

8. i recently watched a special about them because i was a fan when i was a kid . they ' ve been staying out of the media and keep their personal lives private , but they actually have a highly successful fashion brand that has been winning awards for years . many celebrities wear their clothes . i think it ' s called the row .

9. everything you just listed off can be said about alot of other places outside of the united states included i guess it ' s " influential " in pop culture , but not much else .
   (ID: 95f6209d0c49920f0309625c4cec2ea88e4ae469)

10. simply put , the united states produces a lot of these things . like , alot of them , and at high quality . i ' ll specifically talk about television since i ' m a student in that right now , but it applies to many industries . we ' re a capitalist country , and as a capitalist country we have companies desperate to produce things that people will buy . in many cases , this means producing high quality things , or things that people like . for example  in television , a recent thing that has been introduced is " complex television " . shows like breaking bad or the wire simply would not have existed a decade or two ago , but when the internet was introduced networks had to step up their game and start making shows of high quality so people would keep watching and the networks could keep making money . in my opinion then , it all comes down to the united states focus on creating things that people will buy . not only do people in the us like and buy these things , but people in other countries do as well . it ' s one of the best things that resulted from the introduction of the internet , and the new stress put on entertainment producers to create better content .
