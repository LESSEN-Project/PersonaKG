1. i know you ' re going to get downvoted and are using hyperbole , but that may not be bad for them . not a " forced labor " kind of thing , but something designed to show them the value of work . maybe they could help build a park or something like that .
   (ID: 114f7cbc1e95e422548314f66f04854e144a7a35)

2. i have no idea , but i really want to know now i would assume so , coz it ' s just like different breeds of cats or dogs reproducing together . tho it might be that the dragons are all too proud to do that , and want to keep their bloodlines pure
   (ID: 3019ca7bd07e9287b998767b6d0eb22d6049a635)

3. yes , travel would be impossible unless you were rich . why do you think no one would maintain them ?
   (ID: fbed02b3d7caf00e8d1533f452f8951cf390df73)

4. since obviously terminus is the tv version of the hunters finally , people can shut up about them now , does that mean one of the crew will become tainted meat ? i ' m just trying to figure out how they can get out of this situation . perhaps someone sacrifices themselves ? crazy shit man .
   (ID: 9c2d2fde31927b8cc3bc419049de8844ca720cb9)

5. that  ll just prove the point that they are lost before they go in the laundry . why would you kill an urban myth ? are you insane ?
   (ID: b74c6f378f67934bed1f9dd4c591152d002827ec)

6. know what they learned ? to find a way and get a piece of their own in the event that it happens with someone else . hope they get these guys .
   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

7. yeah this sounds like a filming thing . it ' s awesome you guys are so on the lookout though , wow .
   (ID: 1d327d2812dfee71bf8ef77d36ffd5eb70efd55b)

8. edgar meyer and victor wooten on the same stage ? every bass player in the crowd would go home and kill themselves . so not all bad news .
   (ID: fb5e95e954b3ee83c39276138f0fa3b854970db4)

9. yes they do . i won  t spoil it but the story is pretty cool at the end . i ended up finishing the game and growing his hair out completely , looks like a castaway .
   (ID: 23394798067974e95a922a95c6609d16ca1b11dd)

10. i always just assumed this and never bothered to look it up !
   (ID: 9c2d2fde31927b8cc3bc419049de8844ca720cb9)

11. i suggest you talk to them , not me . i already have .
   (ID: 3e510494aac4d4cfd98d8ee4e7b04dffd5534bee)

12. trash . thats what they smell like .
   (ID: 0ddaeffad510fe540496c0e0b97a1a85b13282eb)

13. that actually sounds like a good idea . the only problem i see possible is where do they go for work afterwards ?
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

14. seriously , the fuck is the deal with this ? do only guys with fat ass cocks have kids ? shit blows my mind
   (ID: a90f01f580b7cc08038958d5c1f659fd492b1f2c)

15. the ones who entertain and the ones that observe
   (ID: 9b58219d8f43f5aa6e34770c7b9c7896c88c8fe7)

16. they will be the only ones to survive the zombie apocalypse
   (ID: f8d48136e1ccbc739d4b7fb8db1e8f668422b145)

17. that would require them to leave their mothers basement
   (ID: a93c4b4e04523abdf134a40204e81619d6e659ef)

18. they ' re all rescues , so they know a good gig when they ' ve got one . they ain ' t squealing .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

19. i haven ' t heard of that book . i wonder if even if they read it if they would realize what they ' re in for . they are such amazing , hard  working people that are in it so deep that to admit defeat . well . i just don ' t think they could do it . wouldn ' t it be so embarrassing to say you tried and gulp failed . it really really makes me so sad for them . and i agree , it sounds like a book that could be quite dry , but i bet it would actually be quite interesting if you know someone personally involved . i would probably cry for them .
   (ID: aa8abed66c32a0519ab922c1a606563d97de28fc)

20. yeah i ' m guessing so . it would have to feel weird as hell though . they probably have a drug to duplicate that feeling .
