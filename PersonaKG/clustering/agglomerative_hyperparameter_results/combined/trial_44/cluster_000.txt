3. my cousin and i used to dry hump each other when we were kids . we used to fight a lot back then , and during the worst of our spats our parents would lock us together in a room and not let us out until we say sorry . and dry humping was our way of saying " sorry " to each other . the ' rents did not catch on , even when we were noisy af and already having proto  orgasms with each other . by the time we turned digit , our fights were less frequent and the adults now have the common sense to not lock teenagers of the opposite sex in a bedroom .
   (ID: afb250d177d47ce6467dfa3414d91e9e07eec6c4)

4. no shame in going alone ! i  d probably prefer it honestly . the important thing is having a great time and celebrating the bride and groom  s wedding day
   (ID: f72a72c8ffe94061edd962dd3f8293ca75595021)

5. i don ' t do stand up lol , but i ' d bring friends that way you have real incentive not to fuck up to avoid embarrassment . but at the same time that could make you more nervous so it ' s up to you and how confident you think you can be up there
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

6. what sex actually felt like , as opposed to what i had been told it should feel like . shouldn ' t ever have worried . it went fairly well , and we ' ve been together for seven years this july .
   (ID: 5d032deb25ff976c97c846d4d1073b0e71b447a3)

7. proposals in front of a whole crowd would be terrible . i have always thought a nice one would be very intimate and just in a really nice location at a nice time of our lives . i think if a genuine man puts in effort and real thought that ' s what matters . my sister still lives at home underneath my mother ' s house . she got proposed to by him getting on one knee under the house . worked for her but i would be underwhelmed lol . nothing hard about going somewhere beautiful and secluded . but hey , marriage isn ' t about much of this anyway . it ' s a promise to someone to love them entirely as a human for as long as that person is alive . to be the other half of that human through all of life ' s journeys . choose wisely .
   (ID: 7a3a98777bf2cebb6bd14409075a19b82035e535)

8. why do you even want input for this question ? thats a personal decision that shouldn ' t be influenced by anybody but yourself .
   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

9. the legal one is the newest of those aspects , and i think it ' s completely reasonable to feel like your wedding is when your union is witnessed by your loved ones  that ' s how it ' s been for far longer . i digit  agree with this ! signing a piece of paper at a courthouse is just going to feel like any other day . marriage has never been super important to me because fh and i have been living together for a few years and i basically already consider him my husband . but having friends and family witness it will really make it sink in for me .
   (ID: 169c51cc138a4161080068ded4dcf87863ffee36)

10. that ' s good ! when i say as an avid moviegoer , i mean that the encroaching on space maneuver would annoy me even if it was an agreed upon date just because it can be distracting  if i go to the movies , i want to watch the movie . but i ' m glad he ' s found someone . he can ' t be faulted for explicitly being told it was a date . the virtue of it being valentine ' s day though isn ' t a defense i would hold up in court though . how did you end up liking deadpool ? did you see the second one ? do you have any thoughts about once upon a deadpool ?
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

11. in my opinion , it is kind of like fooling a drunk friend . it only turns out well if their ok with it , and even then doesn  t work all the time . i  m no expert , but you probably can  t tell someone  give me all your money  and get away with it .
   (ID: bd0712716940e41d4901cd77632c868dc43fa8f0)

12. when you say to attend , you  re speaking with a bit of certainty that you  ll be getting into those programs . how confident do you feel on those chances ? even if the chances are low , i do believe it  s up to you and what you  re looking to do in the future . what do you really want . if academia is more important to you than becoming a clinician , declining an acceptance may not be the worst idea . but it is ultimately up to you and what you see for your future , and that is what will give you the most fulfillment later on in your life .

13. haha it was a one time thing via tinder so i don ' t have it , but i would suggest you just be upfront and say you want that to happen .
   (ID: c6e395c03fa0151554baed67a84968066bfa9cf3)

14. what kinds of stuff would you do during your haunting ?
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

15. go for it . what  s the worst that could happen ?
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

16. nta , rsvps are there for you to know how much you need to buy . ans if people are showing up with other kids and said nothing about , they shouldn ' t be surprised that they got nothing . things like this make me mad and the guests get pissed like its your fault they bought uninvited people with them .
   (ID: 2e369dc21156ed2b443bc09084e27c8acb516093)

17. i have a better idea . why not go and have sex instead ?
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

18. i went and saw bohemian rhapsody by myself when it came out . it was a first for me going by myself , and i actually ended up liking it more by myself because no one was distracting me by talking to me . no one gives a fuck if you  re by yourself anyway , you  re just going to see a movie , no one  s paying attention to anything but the movie . have a good time !
   (ID: f72a72c8ffe94061edd962dd3f8293ca75595021)

19. i mean i  d be down for that as long as i don  t choke and die like that one kid
   (ID: 787f4a3fe31691883105c973a6b8e3df9df1436e)

20. don  t do it man , there  s better things to life that you just haven  t discovered yet . on a side note , imagine how confused and upset your dog would be if one day you didn  t come home , or you went into the bathroom and they never seen you again .
