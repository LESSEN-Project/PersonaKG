2. masturbation . i mean this seriously . people always say how women " reach their sexual peak in their digit ' s . i think some women are simply not familiar with themselves , comfortable with their sexuality or aware of what really pleases them until they get older in a lot of cases and that ' s what causes this widespread thought . my mother encouraged me to get to know myself sexually on solo before i involved a partner . how can you explain to someone else what pleases you if you can ' t please yourself ?
