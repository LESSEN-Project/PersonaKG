1. we had a player in my city who came from a different , larger city for work . back then the lgs was new and so were the players so he ' d shark trades and crush fnms and other events easily . anyways eventually i learnt how to play properly and became a better player than him , so he stopped coming the actual bad experience however was when i was to his old store back in the larger city  he knew the owner personally and that was where he went to sell off his robbed cards and stuff  he ' d given the town a reputation as a place where everyone can barely play and he gets to sweep the trades and tournaments without trying . me being one of the few people to stick with the game after he ' d ruined it so thoroughly , i guess he ' d really made up some stuff about me out of spite so i get in and as soon as i ' m asked where i ' m from it starts getting whispered around  the standout experience was me asking how much they wanted for their foil tamiyo ,  i wanted it as an anniversary gift for my girlfriend but depending on whether they used f2f or scg pricing it would ' ve been better to get her the expedition hallowed fountain  and the clerk just told me " more than ten bucks still want it ? " and walked away without ringing me in i didn ' t spend any money there , but i drove back up for an edh tournament and got second , and then again and got first . now they ' re nicer to me but having to earn respect from strangers after being the butt of rumours soured me on the community , i go to a different place

2. you should respect the membership i used to have and let me still use everything , despite no longer having the membership . failing that , you should respect me and come up with ways i can still use everything but for free , and fuck all your other members and your ability to make money  i ' m more important .

3. im not sure what to think of this to this day .   x200b  so my family and i were visiting the main island of hawaii , we were visiting the black sand beach at the time and some older asian people wanted to take pictures with me , keep in mind these were complete strangers . now , i was about digit at the time so i agreed . they took pictures with me and then asked where i was from and all kinds of personal stuff . i answered all the questions honestly being a naive little kid . then once they had just stopped asking me a question , they pushed me away . did they see my parents and let me go ? am i overthinking this ? what scares me is that they probably still have the pictures of me .

4. people paid you money for a decision you made . no one forced you to make porn . so you do owe fans at least the content they paid and clicked to see . if this sub helps them find it , then that  s what you owe them . if a real actor quits , they don  t get to take down their movies or shut down fan sites that get in the way of them living a normal life or changing career paths . that said , it  s not a big deal to me . i understand you couldn  t hack it and would rather just give up . we  ve all been there with a job . if you ever make a come back , you  ll want the social media infrastructure in place eg this sub . i  ve seen girls quit and come back once they re  discover how hard it is in the real world to make this kinda cash . also , you should know that shutting down a sub is meaningless . another can pop up . and anyone can still google their way to your naked body . what you need to do is file with social security for a name change even if you didn  t use your real name , but especially if you used your real name .

5. i have lived for a little over digit years , the human form i take now is only one of dozens i have taken in my time here . i have grown to respect your species and have gone what you would call awol . if the elders were to find me now it would be disastrous not only for me but all those around me and anyone i have ever interacted with .
