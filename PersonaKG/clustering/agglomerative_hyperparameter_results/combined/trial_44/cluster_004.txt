1. it  s awesome that you are excited to step up and be a  not real dad  . it  s the best feeling in the world when they come running out the door after school and give you a big hug . but take it from me , if something ever happens between you and her mom then it  s going to hurt like hell . enjoy every little moment . i still miss my exes kids but there  s nothing i can do about it .
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

2. i  m digit and i wish to god that we all lived in a time that kids could play safely , noisy or not , outside if they wanted to .
   (ID: 7e155e58dbfbdb78d094711d4ddb65ae5ef94fba)

3. parents who don ' t have the emotional maturity and capacity to care and are therefore very permissive and hands off are very detrimental . parents who are very accepting and open , but still talk to you about situations you may face in life , possible positive or negative consequences , are there for you at least emotionally no matter what  those are the truly cool parents . the first was my parents . the second is who i strive to be .
   (ID: 445ba4596e4bcff0c96b23f038cf784185970198)

4. first of all he ' s real and i would ask him . what ' s your favourite cookie ? and please let ' s not lie to ourselves , saying santa ain ' t real is like saying the easter bunny or tooth fairy isn ' t either . you foolish man
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

5. jesus christ being obsessed with wanting to be a mom to the point that it ' s probably your only personality trait at eleven years old is kinda yikes
   (ID: 44eba9a0cf089ec615a77db5d42a2c01b63cb259)

6. i ' m with you on this one . nah is really the best answer . his family just lost their son , but op is justifiable in his response . unfortunately , death changes things
   (ID: 40e9f2306751118eda95174d093680e74831a34d)

7. absolutely ! initially i ' m like wtf that ' s weird you don ' t say ily to ur mom that just ugh then i ' m like oh wait that ' s what it supposed to be like and i ' m happy for them to have that .
   (ID: 555615a7b22f65cadd2e223e2e891e540623f3a4)

8. they always signed us up for whatever activities we wanted to do hockey , baseball , figure skating , dance , etc . and made sure they brought us to every single lesson or game . not only did these activities teach me so much about goal setting and working with other people , it showed me how to support the people you love .
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

9. i hope this doesn ' t get buried in here . having kids is so hard . i wouldn ' t say regret . but after digit kids , oldest is digit and youngest is digit , it has been hard . they have had situations and problems that are not the normal problems . what ' s even harder is , the grandkids . you raise your kids the best you can , being all stressed out and stuff . and they have problems that can not be helped . one of them is mentally  emotionally disabled and has a bad life and wants to bring in digit kids to the mix ! and , as a grandparent , you can ' t do a thing about it ! you can help your own kid , but not your grandkid ! not if the parent doesn ' t want your help . tl  dr   you think having kids is bad when they are young . when they get out on their own , that ' s when you really worry .
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

10. is that like sports day ? do all the parents come along to watch ? " oh we are so proud of our little jimmys cock "
   (ID: 3f0409a6efb16c26d2f9f7a14f5e75b8945ba427)

11. why are you dating someone with kids if you hate kids that much ?
   (ID: c502154cdae9232a9351bdc0e55d2030d75a8094)

12. let me ask you something do you collect comics because while i don ' t i understand that leaving pen marks and damage on those comics is a serious thing and the kid still damaged  destroyed op ' s personnel property and should suffer the consequences .
   (ID: 1df1bd07e28c0df73bd865f8cb447d7c8f1bd4d3)

13. this sounds kinda healthy . i know far too many people who do the opposite and bury themselves in kid issues to the neck and when the kids leave , they have nothing more to talk about and get divorced . if you  re resentful about it , why not say something ?
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

14. are you sure you ' re not jealous of the time they ' re spending together or something ? seems really weird to be all upset about this , obviously if the kid was upset she ' d say something .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

15. i was on " what would you do " the nick show when i was a wee lad about digit and they just said look into the camera , don ' t do anything until you ' re told to , and remember that your parents are in the audience !
   (ID: 98f9b074f3fba12c7403be7000f77b6a560c5a02)

16. woman took my seat and had her kid next to her . normally i wouldn  t have made a fuss , but she got all loud and hostile when i pointed it out while standing in the isle i had window seat . always do so i can sleep . so i stood my ground until they moved all of their junk and moved so i could sit down . slept so i didn  t endure the heavy breathing and flares the rest of the flight . be nice to people .
   (ID: 757e143549620faa46043c6954071c7a8dd6b484)

17. i was never taught to believe in santa , the easter bunny , etc . as a kid and i won ' t be doing it for my kids either . i never once spoiled the identity of santa for another kid because i was taught that it was really important for some children . heck , my cousin who is more like a sister to me believed in santa forever and i never once even thought about spoiling that for her . the lengths that some parents go to fuel these lies are kind of insane though . there are posts on websites like pinterest about how to make fake snowy footprints throughout your house or easter bunny droppings wtf ? and it ' s just so much effort for a dumb lie . but also . if i buy my kid a bomb ass christmas gift there ' s no way i ' m letting some fat old fart who doesn ' t even exist take the credit .
   (ID: e16a0d174adc309bd63cefcfaac2428d7ebba9e9)

18. yeah i would definitely go to diagon alley if i could .  and once your kid starts writing you letters about the amazing experience they ' re having at school , i imagine you would relax a bit . that ' s true , but i would still keep in mind that kids are kids , they will ooh ' s and aah ' s at probably everything they ' re showed but they aren ' t necessarily aware of the danger surrounding them . take the basilisk or the dementors as examples , were muggle parents even informed about that kind of stuff ? because if so there ' s digit chance they would allow their kids to go back at that school , dumbledore or not really .
   (ID: a80b8bc356414690d849369456d68876c95d5518)

19. i love how every time this question comes up most of the answers are  i don  t hate kids , but .  . if you don  t hate kids , op wasn  t talking to you .
   (ID: 7cece6bbdf487f99b6d494ab790bde8e66ce8966)

20. " can you pick up my kids from school after this ? "
   (ID: 2ea109772fcc0738f65030d7584f4ec864e785dd)
