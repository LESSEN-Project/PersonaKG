1. don ' t feel like i can be entirely myself with a product that is designed to keep you hooked and online . plus the fact that you ' re being seriously tracked by the evil zuckerberg . facebook is one of the most unethical companies out there , why would i trust them ? i deleted whatsapp too because of him .
   (ID: 5bb6e2d4db1d5ccf3a1f430564735551dfb4c28b)

   (ID: a70e276355baaea2f732281343d3f63ea5d96365)

4. i don ' t think this is lying . i think this is something personal to you that you didn ' t feel like sharing , and that is ok because it is no one else ' s business . if you wish to tell them in the future you can say you didn ' t want to tell them before . but you don ' t need to explain yourself , like i said it ' s your business . not a lie .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

5. you probably suck as a parent if you feel that way
   (ID: 4f1b65a581332b9d19507ccf0e921d0967e013e7)

6. first off , i like the thinking behind this and it was really well thought out . however i think i  d have to disagree with this . i feel like euphoria is trying to be as original as it can . they make it like no other show that i know of , and i feel like they are creating their own plot . but if this is some version of romeo and juliet , i wouldn  t necessarily be mad about itexcept for the fact that fez would die plz no .
   (ID: c0f309bee7152ab458da8ec03fbb1e17fa2876cd)

7. well , if you stand under the wrong tree a pissed off drop bear might get you , but a snake will only strike at you if you startle it when close enough that it doesn ' t feel like it can get away  like if you ' re crashing through the bush chasing one or two terrified people . i ' d be at least a little concerned , but then , i ' m not a murderer . if i was a victim , i ' d take the chance of a snake bite and leg it at the first opportunity . i save my ' everything in australia will murder you ! ' stories for my kiwi husband and friends  it makes me look like a badass when i tell them about how i killed an eastern brown with a shovel or found a redback in my bed .
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)

8. no . nothing can get you what you feel you don ' t deserve .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

9. bahaha that sucks dude . i empathize with a team becoming more frustrated as the losses stack up . but i still feel the worst for the maid who had to walk into what probably looked like an alien murder scene .
   (ID: d239102bc184479462fc1422e316856d8bca37ba)

10. it ' s confusing . long story short . if you have the capability to fall in love with a person , that says so much about how powerful your capacity to love is . people have all of these rules to let them feel emotions . we forget that we don ' t always need to wait for company to have fun , for money to feel rich , for gains to feel strong , or for a partner to feel love . we can feel these emotions really whenever . when you give yourself permission to love someone , you are actually just exercising your very talent of being able to generate love , and you subconsciously let the feeling override other programs in your brain . it is a practice that you are actually doing with yourself and all by yourself , you just think that you are having that experience because someone else is there . similar to how hateful people deep down truly hate themselves , people who are loving people deep down truly love themselves . this isn ' t toxic at all , it ' s just a dynamic that what you project onto the world is a result of how your feel inside . if you can go so far as to fall in love with someone , you must perhaps underneath many layers truly and genuinely love yourself .

11. hum , talk to him and tell him how you feel , your fears , what you want and what you expect of the future with him , that you live him if you do . and ask him if he ' s willing to be there and take the compromise with you to make it work . depending on the answer just do what it ' s best for you and the baby . it ' s better to leave on time than stay and get more hurt . good luck !
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

12. i don  t believe he would want me to feel guilty at all , but it doesn  t stop me feeling it .
   (ID: c391065478603a686531cbdd50568136a5e14508)

13. i really want to just say thank you , i was nervous opening up about my fear on such a large platform . i wake up knowing i have so much potential with how i ' m able to handle myself in different situations . i often ask and find myself noticing how much lack of common sense their is in the world and i ' m quick to pick things up and feel like i have great communication skills . i feel torn inside my heart and mind at times but i need to get my shit together one step at a time and just focusing on my future . it ' s just i still find myself not knowing how with what field i can excel in . so i will need to work on the basics .
   (ID: 035cdb776979e198d6824c24b5c3e7399d673eeb)

14. i think perhaps with the increase of social media , people , particularly younger people are comparing themselves to others not realising that they ' re seeing what is essentially a high  light reel . that being said , depression is prevalent in older people too . and thankfully the stigma is lessening . people are more aware of it and people who suffer aren ' t as afraid to say how they feel . back in the day you would ' ve been told to " get on with it " and you did but you still had to battle your own mind . i think sometimes people kind of rely on medication to do that battle for them now rather than address the root of the problem and try to fix it themselves . now , i ' m not saying medication is bad . if you suffer from depression you do need help to manage day to day life and that ' s okay but you also need to try to help yourself .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

15. offensive jokes , i feel terrible because i ' m essentially laughing at someone worse off than me . it ' s something i ' m not proud of , but sometimes . you have to feed your inner demons sense of humour haha
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

16. sounds like they might be a bit envious of your successes and they are picking on the tattoo out of spite . why see them at all tomorrow ? it will be more crap about the tattoo and nothing about your new job . reschedule and say you are sick . it  s your bday , you deserve to feel cherished and loved and you aren  t getting it from them .
   (ID: 51b402555c8be7c06ad4a60a2d8d5b71885f838a)

17. getting up from bed to pee . i just feel really lazy . i end up holding it until i actually have to go bad
   (ID: 3e7b07ddd384cb288bc529e6aeb73f840aa5a294)

18. not at all . i ' m a very clean person . i get comments all the time about how i have pretty much perfect teethhaven ' t been to the dentist since i was a kid either , i always smell really good and so does my clothes . hygiene is a very real thing to me . i can honestly say it isn ' t that . like i feel it ' s more a thing about them being concerned about their own smell and maybe them not wanting that around their face . idk . trips me out . cuz even if that ' s the case , why can i not smell  lick my fingers but they are all perfectly fine with me burying my face down there .
   (ID: eb701dce6e6a2a5da4a0d10410214d821dc525a2)

19. i completely understand how you feel , i also like to have a " signature " weapon . i think this is the kind of thing that you could ask them on facebook , maybe you ' ll get an answer .
   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)
