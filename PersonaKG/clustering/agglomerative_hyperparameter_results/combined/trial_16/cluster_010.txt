14. not said , really , but vocalized all the same . so i was sitting on the bus on the way home from high school , and over the years , you come to know most of the other kids on the bus , by name at least . so one of my bus  bound acquaintances in the grade ahead of me , let ' s call her claire , at the start of the bus ride starts laughing about something . now as claire was sitting directly behind me and allegedly having just been told one hell of a zinger , the laugh was loud . loud enough that it really hurt my ear . my first instinct was to reel around and produce an equally loud , pitch perfect imitation of said laugh . claire just looked me dead in the eyes and said " wesleyrobertsimpson , i did not appreciate that . " i ' ll never forget that moment , nor forgive myself for it . tl  dr  never genuinely insult somebody else ' s laugh , you ' ll never forgive yourself .

18. do you want cell service on it ? i bought a  digit tracphone at walmart for my toddler to watch netflix on during a trip . it has all the things you mentioned . it ' s locked to their network so you ' ll never be able to take it essential l elsewhere , but it seemed to handle what i required of it .
   (ID: 6eec77fe98b9dc85ec1e5e7edc37cdb415794719)

19. since what a fursona is has been explained to death here i ' ll just add to it first , you do not need a fursona to be a furry . in general " being furry " is a very loose term . the only thing in common between all of us is that we like anthropomorphic art . however if you do want to interact with the community outside of reddit having at least an oc as an avatar will help tremendously . second , hya reddit is the best place imo . stay here if you want amazing furry art regularly oand go to furry  irl some nsfw , not a lot for memes and shitposting .
   (ID: 96167969642339382f3b9c4eeee4ea73aec3823c)

20. the unconditional surrender of germany has just been announced . at midnight tonight , the war is over . tomorrow you ' ll begin the process of looking for survivors of your families . in most cases . you won ' t find them . after six long years of murder , victims are being mourned throughout the world . we ' ve survived . many of you have come up to me and thanked me . thank yourselves . thank your fearless stern , and others among you who worried about you and faced death at every moment . i am a member of the nazi party . i ' m a munitions manufacturer . i ' m a profiteer of slave labor . i am . a criminal . at midnight , you ' ll be free and i ' ll be hunted . i shall remain with you until five minutes after midnight , after which time  and i hope you ' ll forgive me  i have to flee . he addresses the factory ' s ss guards
