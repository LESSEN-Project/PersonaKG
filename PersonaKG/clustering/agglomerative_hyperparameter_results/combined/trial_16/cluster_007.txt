1. misophonia is a serious disorder . if you file for divorce , you might be on the wrong end though . seeing a psychologist might be more beneficial . what about all the other people you hear eating ? or maybe she was just absurdly loud ? who knows .
   (ID: 5bb6e2d4db1d5ccf3a1f430564735551dfb4c28b)

   (ID: 128346fc1e56ccadd25a4b200ecae44637d48f5f)

6. amlo is just another stooge that protects and propagates the interests of transnational capital . he provides cover and a nice veneer while the capitalists go in and loot the natural resources , markets and labor of the country . much in the style of an obama or trudeau . i have no idea why you think anyone would care what time the asshole wakes up at and why you find this at all admirable . it ' s funny you would leave out the chavistas and maduro . why do you have such little political imagination ? why do you think your liberal tendencies are at all permissible in this sub ? are you another one of these white latin american men that has no problem stomping on the rights of indigenous peoples so long as capital accumulation processes can go on unabated ?
   (ID: 77d0324af3e030bb9fb9365a16e870bd522fd275)

   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

9. i think this whole discussion revolves around the concept of " beating the shift . and i ' m asking this honestly  i just can ' t fathom how a single is considered not beating the shift . to me , just getting on base at all is beating the shift , since just getting on base is paramount to scoring runs in the first place . i
   (ID: 2bb956084cb9bf79f58345d6cf6beca98e76bbb4)

10. i just started watching the dragon prince . only on ep digit , but it ' s already shaping up to be pretty epic . great visuals and storytelling , likable characters , awesome world building , it ' s just awesome all around . one of the creators of avatar the last airbender , aaron ehasz is on the writing team on the show as well , so one can draw a lot of parallels between the two shows . not too violent , but not too tame , so perfect for a kid your son ' s age . and no annoying voices in the characters , so you won ' t need to claw out your ears . it ' s just good clean fun for the family .

   (ID: 3cc393500aaac3a2ee1cd96955cee486bb062a46)

12. no problem . i think if you ' re doing a long term planning and you ' re not good with investments and finance , yeah they totally worth it . but in my own opinion i ' m no expert . if you just wanna deal with your saving , then nah just invest your money in a moderately safe portfolio and take it out when you ' re done .
   (ID: 9adb5fb6fb9aeeeb65afe41002460d73817044b0)

13. kinokuniya has some specific anime ones but they  re expensive . honestly just print your own on sticker paper or look for those cheap sticker collections on souq  amazon . ae

14. yeah that or when i would come home from my neighbors at night you would just see me booking it to my house lol i would never risk it
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

15. well the moc only helps you with getting trade prices for gunrunning vehicles and the bunker unupgraded doesn ' t make you any money if you buy supplies , you just break even , not even considering staff cost , so your best bet is to make around 2million and buy the equipment and staff upgrades and then you will make 135k each time you buy suppliesthe staff will cost more tho , but that shouldn ' t be a big problem
   (ID: a443986595c715cd541cd3925619cb6f1e8ada83)

16. i have always loved austin powers i watched it for the first time when i was about digit and every time i watch it , it just gets better and better
   (ID: 589a27cacaffb5126785db9f91c141a3cea2daae)

17. it  s kinda shaky ground . on one hand , a lot of companies would offer the phone as an apology for the confusion , but if they  re asking for it back , it  s probably best that you do return it . best case , they harass you for a while , and then they drop it . worst case , the actual customer or apple themselves take you to court over it . depending on where you are , legal charges vary , and if they  re likely to amount to more than the cost of the phone , then they may just leave it . if they  re paid by the loser of the trial , then they may file for theft . it  s hard to tell , but probably best just to return it .
   (ID: 0f6c6c4bd3531c7f028b4bf901123522dd67c300)

18. the derren brown method  ask them politely what their charity does , whatever they say , just put a disgusted face and say " oh , you ' re collecting for that are you " and then walk off like a boss .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

19. funny , just like you chose to make yourself look bad , you could have just as easily ignored my comment .
   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

20. you just brought tears to my eyes . i ' m so fucking tired and i don ' t see a better future but i ' m still hanging for some fucking dumb reason .
