10. thing is i wouldn  t call it a debate if we were to go by the textbook definition . i could almost guarantee that if i sat down with lorinbassnectar he wouldn  t want to have a debate about policy he would simply shut me out . i  m sure , and maybe i  m making an assumption , but i  m sure that we could both agree that a lot if not the majority of his fan base has no knowledge about policy and simply follows what is posted . that  s what i find dangerous . when so many people look up to an individual they treat his words as facts , and this applies to both sides of the aisle . i also call it dangerous because it is a sure way of not only ostracizing a large portion of your fan base who listens to your music to escape reality but it could even pose the problem of many people losing hope in one place where they thought they could find it , and that is dance music . that  s just me and i can tell from the many downvotes that  s it  s not a very popular opinion .
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

11. google anything you are not sure about , every little thing . digit  of the time you find the answer . it seems like common sense but most people never do it .
   (ID: 20e44d996799f8bb3fe89546818050bf021f4be9)

12. i ' m not sure . probably a few threads out there . i only say this bc nosleep is usually creepy or paranormal shite that mostly can ' t really be real ya know ?
   (ID: 97c35f21c6a14bb50b6faae9a7b18cd5968c350c)

13. ive watched the whole video and i am not sure if you read my post . my main argument is not autism . it is other minor damages caused from vaccines
   (ID: 23958be5bf9424a3f6c71e7474e54c2eabcfab9d)

14. okay cool i think i will just go for it haha , i ' m ready to care for them and for sure i won ' t neglect that ! aww , thank you so much
   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

15. am i safe to charge my switch with a wall adapter , power bank , or car charger as long as i use plugs that are 5v digit . 0a or 5v digit . 0a which is what i own ? i  ve heard that these should be fine since they  re below 18w but i just wanted to be sure i won  t brick it .
   (ID: 7df89b558f49c9f710c5f928f61dae67f52229c7)

16. me too . but i stopped playing actively for about a year now just making sure i do my deadpool daily . just be patience and play hardcore with a good alliance and you should be fine .
   (ID: a1ba9b657b043ce2934cc0ae7b42c0a0bf3ba2fa)

17. when we have guests at home i will literally stay inside my room and don  t leave which is especially bad if they stay for a few days because i will literally just starve myself until either i know for sure that i can avoid an interaction with them or i can  t hold out any longer .
   (ID: dcc0b8be922b572122c03b3f5e2a0f9fccb4d351)

18. i ' m not entirely sure what happened all i know i someone broke the law and there is absolutely nothing we can do because my whole damn filthy town is courrpetd
   (ID: ba6e71577de908a22c0e12bb76ecba264f52d94e)

19. i ' m not sure i see how that relates ? fat acceptance , in my understanding , is just accepting people for what they are and not judging them . there ' s no expectation at least no reasonable expectation that we should have to find fat women attractive . could you elaborate on what you mean ?
   (ID: f3f34b7b903c833de2625265da4585abdc86ab7c)

20. i just want to work on developing strategies that make money . focusing on development and especially ai and ml . it seems like the closest thing to a well paid " problem solver " , plus the feeling that i could " create " money for myself was something i ' ve never felt before and feel regardless of what happens in life , as long as there are markets , you could be somewhat self sufficient . not sure what role that would be called though , they seem to go under many names or none at all . i just want to prepare myself to " get in " to any position to start .
