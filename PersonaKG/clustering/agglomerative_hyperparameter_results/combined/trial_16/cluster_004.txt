1. the entirety of it ' s a wonderful life . haven ' t got to the happy ending yet .

   (ID: aadf22a91ea1305681d9e9e51890c22ca2a37577)

3. first of all , the night before have all your running stuff out and ready to go , runners , and all of your clothes . i would suggest putting your phone or alarm somewhere where you have to stand up to grab it and turn it off . it took me a while to get accustom to getting out of my bed in the morning but i promise you get used to it . your body is also just warming up and blood needs to flow so stretching is a must , maybe start at a walking pace , leg raises e . t . c . as for where to run , honestly when i first started i couldnt run very long and i went a few blocks over and turned around , sort of did a loop . once i got comfortable with that i ran every side street , up and down until i got to the end , then came back . i started doing it in reverse , then i expanded out of my neighborhood . its good to change up the scenery to avoid getting bored . now i run all over my city and i love it . for winter its a bit tricky but do your best to work with what you have , use an old jacket to avoid sweating and sticking up your nice one , use old sweaters and a scarf . i used normal running shoes and slipped a couple times but hey , get back up and keep going , you ' ll be okay . roads are usually more clear than sidewalks . once you have money for a membership just go to treadmills , i know that will be 100x better in winters . try and help your mom out around the house , shovel the walk e . t . c in exchange for a gym membership . but please remember to always always always stretch , it will help in the long runpun intended .
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

4. no , i wouldn ' t accept that , i ' m the type of person that streams their porn , not download unless i got some friends to get the same deal . i ' d invite them over so we can game over lan .
   (ID: 5173a1d5475490650d7365b2c2b2f2c579d33099)

   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

7. i  m pretty sure my neighbor is into some hardcore drugs as the cops have stopped by quite a few times . weirdest thing is seeing home move next door and being this completely normal dude to now being a crazy drug addict . i remember the first time i met him he was really nice and we talked about music for a while while i was cleaning my car . fast forward to a year or so later , i got home from work late and he was walking by and he tried to shake my hand and wouldn  t let it go as he told me that he was a nymphomaniac .

   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

10. nta , rsvps are there for you to know how much you need to buy . ans if people are showing up with other kids and said nothing about , they shouldn ' t be surprised that they got nothing . things like this make me mad and the guests get pissed like its your fault they bought uninvited people with them .
   (ID: 2e369dc21156ed2b443bc09084e27c8acb516093)

11. day digit  got the patch test added to my back . it was kind of annoying at first because of how it felt like my back had a brace on it . my shirts kept getting stuck on the tape as well . day digit  my shirts still got stuck on the tape , but i figured out how to lay down with it on . the tape started to itch really badly . day digit  i was told that i was smelly by my brother , but other than that i was fine . the tape was really itchy at night , but i just ignored it . day digit  i went and got the test removed . removinf the tape felt like a wax and was very uncomfortable but it wasn  t that bad . i had a lot of tape irritation . the only patch that my doctor is concerned with is  digit hydroperoxides of linalool , commonly found in fragrances , cosmetics , and hygiene products . i was told to wait a couple of days and to see if it got any worse because right now they can  t say for sure that it is a positive match . the other splotches are either dyes or common reactions , like polka dots from cobalt . i went out and bought fragrance free shampoo  shaving cream . now i just got to convince my girlfriend to do something similar . i hope you all are fighting the good fight ! don  t hate yourself because of eczema ! it  s just your body is confused and fighting itself ! don  t worry ! be happy !

12. i got my eye . on . you
   (ID: 41ecb08cd807b953da29a82cba9ddfcf32745fc3)

13. thank you for your comment , you  ve made a lot of sense to me . it  s like a switch gets flipped whenever i begin to think about doing something for me . study , art , meditation , even my last therapy session i struggled to keep myself present and awake . having been in therapy for a year now , my therapist has only recently begun talking about dealing with my cptsd so i  ve got a long way to go . hopefully i can begin unpacking my terrible coping mechanisms soon because they really are disabling in so many ways .
   (ID: 8b7590cb8502d6abd38b320b842aa7642186b6d8)

14. all we can do is take pride that we recognize it now and keep moving forward each day i know from my experiences things probably got rough for you in a lot of ways in those days and this stranger is proud of you for bettering yourself . better days will come
   (ID: e3f34e146ce06ba2b5fc5a249c73494f93f56e86)

15. yes , it  s not rape . i personally believe you should always disclose that you  re transgender , even in short term activities like hook ups , for your safety . what if someone outs you to them ? what if blah blah blah . a lot of things could go wrong . there  s plenty of stories online where they talk about how they almost got beat up or killed because they disclosed they  re trans or forgot to or something . personally , as a trans man myself , i want to know if my partner or hook up is a trans woman . i wouldn  t be mad or anything last minute , but i would want to know .
   (ID: 3510b342268f3bc4c3f1e402201d7c565dfb7648)

16. i save the christmas cards . that way , during the holidays i can hang up digit years worth of cards and it looks like i got a lot of cards .
   (ID: a31ab3f3ccb2d987e0948a7a8ed52f5d74b72960)

17. the president is telling you we need to go to war . does congress do everything the president says ?  you do not yet have the information about how gwb got a briefing in august that it was going to happen and ignored it . the president is not the only one who gets briefings . the democrats are on committees that get most of the same briefings . they have access to top secret information that you and i dont have unless you are getting e  mails from hillary clinton . they knew what the president knew and they did nothing either . to vote for war and then say bush lied is a fucking lie . they are as responsible as he is . im willing to admit that bush was pushing for war and was wrong to do so , but what you cant to is hold those democrats responsible for letting a war happen that they should have prevent if it was such a bad thing .
