1. i wish i were joking too women dont tend to talk about how a loss feels or how it ' s not just a loss but more like the death of a dream . " be lucky for the kids you do have " is not a consolation in any way .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

2. i watched this when i was digit shortly after i saw forrest gump and i was struck by how similar the films were . each tells the story of a unique individual ' s life throughout history and the women he loves . however where zemeckis is overly sappy and a bit to hookey , fincher makes a much more subdued version with a whole lot more nuance . both pitt and blanchett give stellar performances and i wish we talked about their performances more . additionally , this is a lot more visual than zemeckis ' s film with blanchett ' s gazebo dance scene being a real highlight of fincher ' s visual style . all in all i like this a lot more than forrest gump and i think people deserve to give it another chance .
   (ID: a62b69d15e6c81a1a1acb2d0dd4bf9119038ff09)

3. yeah , if a directors cut comes out that ' s digit  hours long then maybe . i know i ' ve crapped on it so far but ww , flash , and even parts of aquaman were good just wish dc would stop trying to race marvel and just make good movies .
   (ID: b5f9b695867ef3b560a4fe7610f75e43b62809f6)

4. mimi  chan , the feral subreddit war hero we all need  currently preparing to get buthurt bad . pretty sick right now . wish me luck !
   (ID: d298609ba6b9516031b9d0b9bc9217d85ce28f05)

5. i wish i had someone like you for a relative . it sounds like you know what ' s up .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

6. i mean , its your call . if you wish for me to stop posting these i respect that . but may i ask what qualifies as high content then ? this is an entire essay written about the characters on the show . yes , it has speculation about why characters acted the way they did . but all the events listed happened in the show and ultimately were just a different way to view the shows events . there is a lot that could be said about these posts , but them having low  content doesn ' t really make much sense considering how much longer , more detailed , and how much more i discuss the lore then many posts on this sub .
   (ID: a22b82fe301caa42c89cbd71b2e3733753f695d9)

7. i wish a man would make eye contact with me and flirt with me to start a convo . fuck internet dating bullshit . however , i will always feel scared when walking in front of a man at night . guess i ' ve watched too much rape porn .
   (ID: 91dc65ba6eef536f17becface16989de7f988dce)

8. im digit and a recovering alcoholic . alcohol has ruined my life . most people drink so technically yes . this is something that makes you ' stand out ' but dont con  notate my words here , it makes you stand out in the absolute best way possible . maybe itll never create an issue in your life if you get drunk a few times , but looking over here from the other side of things , it only left me broke , with ruined relationships , guilt and shame . onward brethren i wish you the best outcome of whatever your life story has written . iwndwyt

9. the first time i played runescape i was a total noob i knew nothing about the game at all and i was rather young i was atrocious at the game and i remember sitting at the castle that i cant remember the name of when a dude came up and offered to teach me the game he was so patient it took me like digit minutes to do something rather simple and he was just so patient to this day i wish i knew who that mystery man was we played for like digit  digit hours and he helped me all the way and was rather patient .

10. i wish that could become his nickname now because that was incredible
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

11. hey lindsey , i wish you didn ' t smoke weed . you ' re not the same when you smoke , and i miss my friend . i ' ll be outside .
   (ID: ea3b9395602c702397d514c6da7049b089458032)

12. you  re white . you think you  re deep  above average intelligence . your most amusing thing at home is when your doggo sits as in a human like position . you secretly wish someone would love you for who you are , and despair that you  re single and wonder what  s wrong with you but in the outside , you say to your friends you  ll settle down when you  re in your late 30s , now is not the time . you wonder if it  s your job in trades that keeps partners away who want white collar jackasses , but resolve to keep it real and work on your guitar skills hoping that one day someone appreciates your hidden talents . . just fuckin w  u , other than you  re white and have tools , and a dog , no idea .
   (ID: 392895b8f4f938fb4e2bfae6551b901dccf33ac2)

13. im really interested in how your scar looks . i know i sound pretty creepy , but i just like seeing some wounds but they are being really not nice to you , as if it was your fault that you happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and get injured by the wrong person . i understand that it may make people especially kids feel uncomfortable , but if they just see things like that from a young age , they just won ' t grow as discriminant as the people are nowadays . i wish you best luck , and don ' t let people limit you just because of some damn scar . that doesn ' t make you a different being . you ' re still the same human as everyone .
   (ID: 8487a8406f04273c554e2e578c3a667648916790)

14. the short answer is , get in and be the doer , not the done to . if he ' s wishy washy , unless you ' re in super deep , consider the fact that you are the age you are and the people you spend time with rub off on and affect you with you wish them to or not . pull back , give him some space and give yourself some space to evaluate what you want from a relationship . it sounds to me like you want a lack of games and a proper commitment of " we are together and we love one another , so let ' s make this work " it doesn ' t sound like that ' s the case .
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

15. i still dont know how to do that exploit . wish i did
   (ID: 80d504f68f5028edc4d8e5926e3a2a93b0c84d8f)

16. oh , wow . my spouse has so many little weird things that drive him over the edge that i wish he would stop . for example , if i want to go to a restaurant later in the evening and that restaurant is going to close in less than digit minutes , he will not go in . he will freak out , he ' ll get angry , he ' ll do anything but set foot into a place that won ' t be open for another hour . he also insists on being early  " on time " for things that we don ' t need to be early to and things that no one is on time for like , the party starts at digit , he wants to be there at digit , even though we know there will be no one there til digit and we ' ll have to spend digit hours sitting there making awkward small talk with the host and their best friend and who didn ' t expect anyone to show up so early . the really big one right now is that he ' s developed all these weird anxieties around sex and would prefer for me to have it with other people rather than freak him out about it . that ' s the biggest thing that i wish we could just do naturally .

17. what questions do you wish you could stop seeing on askreddit ?
   (ID: 6212c082850f067a67618ad2a3b9f8ed336590f4)

18. i ' ve never been discouraged from being in the room . the techs and doctors don ' t really talk to or even look at me , but i ' m there and no one every complains . might be time to switch providers if you ' re able , i kind of get there ' s not much for me to do but listen and be there for her but not letting you in if you and your partner wish otherwise is a different matter .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

19. man i wish i didn ' t get so motion sick playing pavlov . this looks awesome . i ' ve found that if i jog in place while i ' m moving i can stave off the sickness for a while but it does catch up to me . otherwise i ' d be playing all the time .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

20. i wish you well . i hate to say it because it ' s a stupid cliche , but it can get better .
