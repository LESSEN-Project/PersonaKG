1. it ' s hard to give advice because everyone handles this sort of thing differently . we went through three miscarriages , but they were all before our first child , so for us , there wasn ' t any question of trying again . for some people , it helps to start trying again right away . some want to wait for awhile before trying again . it ' s probably best to give it some time , for your wife to get back to normal physically , and for you both to heal emotionally . make sure she knows you ' re there to support her , but don ' t smother here either , give her space if she needs it . and always keep in mind , that unless she has an underlying health problem which it doesn ' t sound like is the case since you already have two kids , miscarriages are random occurrences , and aren ' t likely to happen with the next pregnancy .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

2. where did you gather that i think everyone owes me something ? last time i checked friendships are a two way street . i get what you  re saying bro , but you don  t and never will know the extent of my friendships with these people . and just for the future , there are nicer ways of getting this point across . maybe think twice next time you call a suicidal person a  douche who thinks everything is a fucking gift  .
   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

7. i have had very similar experiences with edgepark though i never ended up ordering from them . just the short list   i only mentioned interest in the omnipod . digit weeks later , received approval letter from my insurance . they had requested rx from a doctor my pcp , not endo without my consent .  misquoted my benefit level to the point of not believing my insurance company about how to code the rx  tried to tell me that they don ' t like to fill the omnipod rx without also filling dexcom  when i cancelled the order after both me and my insurance company yelling at them , the order magically appeared again digit weeks later . went to byram , no issues , very pleased .
