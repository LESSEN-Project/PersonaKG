12. waaaaaaay too many blockbusters i know daredevil isn ' t a part of the cinematic universe , but it was much better than any of the movies minus the fillers and plot holes it didn ' t follow the same formula of intro , blah , blah , and buildup to the cgi fight scene at the end , yay everyone ' s happy now . it had depth . it had enough time to explore both the hero and the villian . i felt like if mcu took a page out of the netflix book , they ' d be a little better off . i don ' t understand how people are still so impressed by the same cgi anymore . it ' s gotten bland . also , the action was very organic .

14. the same way you deal with any fear , you face it you understand it and you overcome it usually by sheer force of will . when people begin to question ones gender fear of passing is very prominent however , until you are further into your transition it is incredibly hard to really tell how well you can pass or blend in potentially the fear is irrational , its takes effort to pass but being fearful about what may or may not happen will just paralyze you
   (ID: 2e1439e8eb18b181a69a66cc4c1b2dc22ce774f0)

15. I have a father in my family.
   (ID: 34784a4c9eca2e43db08bf9f548798a984337741)

16. ahh but that  s just it ! you have these desperate people who wants a baby , and they pay thousands for drug therapies and test tube kids ! and for some same sex couples , it  s not even possible to get a full generic match . so no fertility treatments  more adoptions  less in foster care and less babies born into it as the newborns would be snatched up by the baby hungry people who now do not have the option to create their own bio babies !
