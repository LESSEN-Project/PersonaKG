   (ID: da770212ea31887c4be30925213eff0dc5d8687b)

6. well even if that ' s the case , it ' s sort of hard to just take control  analyze your own subconscious without professional help . this was like a few months ago . i guess my biggest fear relationship wise is becoming that father in the movies who is so thrown into his work , that he never makes time for his family which causes them to drift apart . this could be something else or just something petty . i mean i won ' t tolerate something that ' s obviously worse like cheating or something but i ' m not sure how to " fix " my issues in terms of attraction unless professional help is called upon i guess . i think it could be way worse though .

8. i ' m sorry about your struggle with depression . i have had the same struggle and can empathize , suicidal thoughts included . the comment she made was terrible and i ' m sure it stung extra hard in that moment in particular . but maybe try and see it from her side too . she had a terrible day with bil i know how much stress this kind of situation can be because i was a drug addict and it hurts everyone and puts a lot on others close to you . it was a problem on top of a problem . it was obviously a terrible thing to say but from what you wrote i ' m sure she didnt mean that . do you really think shes a sociopath or something ? i would hope you guys can sit down and talk things through , sincerely . just wanted to comment because i have said terrible things to loved ones and definitely didnt mean it . best of luck .

10. we are finding it fun and manageable as we enter month digit with our digit month lab . he  s definitely not an adult yet and there is training that needs doing regarding occasional rude behavior and overstimulation , but he  s very nice to the cat and has a great temperament . for a first time owner having a baby at the same time as a puppy or young dog might be crazy . a new dog is kind of like a baby , you  re always trying to figure out what it wants and how to get it to go to sleep ! perhaps i  m speaking too soon but as long as we have a dog walker and have like . digit hours outside of work to train  exercise  bond with him , he seems very happy and sleeps all night . we ski on weekends and feel bad about the alone time , so usually try to spend one day doing a lot of dog  centric active stuff with him .
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

   (ID: 46cf1fc2a9c8dec12fa16589117be75cf1571e1d)

17. if you want my advice on what you should do now , in your present situation . keeping in mind that it is just that , my advice . i ' d say you should first make peace with yourself and the situation . accept that you can move on and live a healthy , happy , productive life full of love and positive relationships if you never speak to him again . this is vital . it ' s the single most important thing you can do right now . search your soul . be strong , and realize that strength . then , tell him you ' re sorry for trying to force his hand , but you realize that you can ' t continue this way . then walk away . it sort of speaks to that old addage " if you love something , set it free " if he wants to be with you , truly wants to , he ' ll figure it out . this will accomplish digit things for you . a you ' re absolving yourself of his blame for ruining the other girl ' s life and you ' re removing a card he can play later . let me explain that a little better . say you don ' t take my advice which , again , is your choice and you keep up the ultimatum . in digit days , he chooses you and the two of you continue your relationship . no relationship is perfect . everyone fights . everyone has bad days . everyone feels annoyed  irritated by their partner . and everyone wonders if they made the right choice . this is what you ' ve given him  a great big if . one he can idealize in his head . " oh , itssodifficult is being such a bitch right now ! othergirl wasn ' t ever this bitchy  crazy  irrational  werewolfy ! i bet if i ' d stayed with her , i ' d be so much happier now " that ' s a seed you have helped plant , and every time there ' s an arguement or disagreement , it grows , as does his resentment . and if he stays in touch with or reestablishes contact with othergirl , she is the one who consoles him . she becomes the one he can talk to , and their bond strengthens . this isn ' t a great way to go about establishing a healthy relationship , set aside the fact that manipulation never ends well . b if he does decide you ' re the one he wants , making that choice is now his . and he now has to do something to get your attention  win you back , which is , i believe , under the heading of " needing to prove " something to you , yes ? so it ' s a two birds one stone type deal , whereas now all he has to do to win you over is say " yep , i dumped her " c you ' ll renew this relationship on equal footing . that ' s important if you actually have hopes of this relationship lasting . sorry for the wall of text .
