3. " well , ted is a werewolf , william is a vampire , eris ? a witch . " michael says straight  faced . " me ? i ' m an angel . well , half  angel . this is a school for the supernatural . " i stare at him . i had known that the school was strange when i first heard about it . i received a letter in the mail inviting me to hargrove , including a pamphlet that showed the large colonial manor . my mom had read through it and exclaimed , " you got a full scholarship ! " although i had never applied for one . so there i was on the bus from the airport , riding alongside a handsome , tall guy who introduced himself as michael . the bus was travelling through deep , dark woods . " no , it isn ' t " i replied to him . " are you crazy ? werewolves and vampires ? they don ' t exist . i ' m just a regular person . " michael looked at me with a half  smile . " i guess you have to see for yourself . " the rest of the ride i stared out the window until we arrived at the school , which was much more spooky than it had seemed on the flyer . the bus stopped and a man stepped on . " alright everybody , if you don ' t know me , my name is mr scott . we ' re coming off the bus alphabetically to make sure everyone ' s here . bill ? " bill stood up . he was a huge person and nodded at mr scott . he rose , crouching to avoid the top of the bus , shaking it as he descended . " those half  giants , am i right ? " mr scott smiled then quickly moved on , reading more names down the list . i stared and squinted at him , wondering if i heard him right . " michael ! good to see you again , i hope you had a nice summer . say hi to your dad for me ! " he clapped michael on the shoulder as he walked off the bus . " alright , let ' s see . nicholas ? you here ? " i stood up . " just nick is fine , thanks . " " great , good to meet you nick . i ' m so glad you ' re joining us as hargrove . " as i walk up to the front i notice mr scott ' s legs seem strange , as if his knees bend in the wrong direction . i look quickly up at his face to avoid staring and see tiny horns poking through his hair . in shock , i quickly step off the bus . michael is there waiting for me . " believe me yet ? " he asks . " i ' m starting to , " i shake my head in disbelief , " but if everyone here is a supernatural creature , what does that make me ? " " i ' m not sure . but i know how to find out . " michael replies . he leads me into the school and across a beautiful , expansive foyer and into an office . " mr ripley ? " michael says , poking his head through a door . " there ' s a new student here who doesn ' t know what class he ' s in . " mr ripley had strange , smooth skin like a burn victim . he was also tinted a light green and had yellow , vertically slitted eyes . he smiled , revealing two rows of small sharp teeth . " hey michael ! who ' s your new friend ? " " uhh . nick greenwood , " i answer , stepping forward . " yes alright nick , let ' s see here . " he runs a clawed finger down a list . " ok , right here  wizard class , druid subclass . does that help ? " " perfect , thanks mr ripley ! " michael smiles with perfect glowing teeth . " so you ' re a druid ! that ' ll be a fun course ! the angel course is full of ethics classes . " i think back to the way animals seem to treat me differently than other people , how i always seem to know what they ' re thinking and how our garden always has a much better crop than our neighbors , always completely untouched by pests . " yeah , i guess that makes sense . i ' ve always liked being in the woods . " " well you ' ll certainly be doing a lot of that . settle in , man ! i ' ll see you around ! " michael walks away and i ' m left alone in the foyer , wondering what i ' m supposed to do from here and what i ' ve gotten myself into . i hear a voice behind me . " nick ! our newest wizard ! let me show you where you ' ll be staying . "

7. i haven ' t told what you can and can ' t find funny , i ' ve told you what is innapropriate to say , there ' s a difference . when i said it was a joke , you said this  " no , it ' s not . jokes are meant to be funny to more people than just you . " sure you might not be saying that i didn ' t find it funny , but you were saying that no one else finds it funny . which is wrong . you are wrong .  my actions here were mostlt for the benefit of the op . you ' re words most likely bothered them in a big way , and as well as wanting to stand up to someone behaving like you did , i also wanted to show the op that someone would stand up for them and hopefully counter how you made them feel . a person on the internet who is mature enough will understand that most people will be sarcastic when given the chance . especially since he didn ' t put a " serious " tag on his post . my comment was very much clearly a joke , made obvious by the exclamation point . the fact that you got so triggered by it just highlights your immaturity and inability to recognise jokes on the internet . you might find that this flaw , this cluelessness to social cues , is one of the reasons you were bullied .  think what you want of my actions , i feel like i did the right thing . you didn ' t do anything wrong . you are just acting like a stuck up bitch . you ' re like that one person that always takes a joke seriously , gets offended because it isn ' t a " clean joke " and complains about it while other people just laugh .  and well done for admitting you made a dick move , most people don ' t have the balls to go back and admit a mistake . no need to congratulate me on something everyone like me will do , this is just showing how naive you are . there is no mistake , there never was a single mistake . i am a dick . people like me will always admit to acting like a dick . why do you think i do the things i do ? i ' m not oblivious like you .
