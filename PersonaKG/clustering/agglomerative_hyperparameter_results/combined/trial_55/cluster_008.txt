5. what does it mean
   (ID: 7e8d23b8f1f993c239648b064d6f3e414288a7dd)

6. don ' t tell yourself you ' re not allowed to feel sad  happy  angry because someone has it way worse than you . there will always be someone who is in a worse situation than you that does not take away your right to feel something . even if you are dead , there will be someone somewhere that has been tortured for digit years and wishes they ' d be dead .   x200b  similarly , don ' t tell yourself you will never be good at something just because someone is better than you . there will always be better than you . if you aim to be  digit out of digit billion people , dream on , but the chances of that happening is slimmer than winning the lottery digit times . just because someone is better does not mean you are bad . someone may scores a digit and you may score a digit that does not mean you are shit , that means you are just worse than that one person .

8. i don ' t mean to woosh you or anything , but that was a joke , i thought you would be able to understand , sorry about that , but in my opinion being a man is knowing what to do in the toughest situations , getting your loved ones out of bad situations no matter the circumstances , always being a guiding hand for your children and someone your entire family can look up to .

11. i know that . i was just saying that for an eli5  level explanation , x  x " equals " digit at digit . meaning that the limit of the function exists . of course , as others have pointed out , you can define other limits that are still indeterminate that come out to other values . or no values at all . at x  digit , ln1  x  sinx  digit  cos  digit x evaluates to digit  digit . but , as any mean girls fan knows , the limit does not exist ! but the limit of literally taking x  x to digit does , in fact , equal digit .
