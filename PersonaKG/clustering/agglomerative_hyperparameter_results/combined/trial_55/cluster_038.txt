2. remember kids , you can always be a child if you continue to believe the ehonomi is cok iyi .
   (ID: d2c8c42e9cfcdada2e4a7785bcb8272d5f79a002)

3. you  re right they aren  t the same thing at all , of course they wouldn  t come back the same . like religious texts are treated as truths , many people disagree and tweak them . same thing has happened in history texts , you can  t be digit  certain that it happened in the past . someone may have messed with the records . what separates history and religion is the faith you must have to believe in it .
   (ID: a77a8bcaa391d8b6584d32e6ad243e71297d7258)

4. i can tell you but you won ' t believe me .

6. it wasn ' t a mistake . what about america ' s history leads you to believe when they slaughter innocents it ' s an accident ?
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

7. impossible question because of personal opinion . films connect with different people for different reasons . emotional , traumatic , loving , inspirational . there ' s a lot to consider . i study film and in all honesty there is no greatest movie of all time . you can potentially answer this question with a few films that are technically and creatively the best but i believe that the greatest films are the ones the make you feel something unique . me personally always been a batman fan but not much of a marvel superhero fanboy and so thats why the dark knight is one of my all time creations . the feeling of truth , power and responsibility in that film will always affect me . but if you whole heartedly believe that something like happy gilmore or harry potter is the greatest movie of all time then go for it . im sure theres a reason why and no one can tell you otherwise .
   (ID: 373e4a2c6b02258f35adf64ee79e2e3f52d4b654)

8. i ' m a christian . i believe that jesus preached for us to do things like love , be compassionate , generous , and honest . as such  i believe in evolution and human  caused climate change , because the proof is overwhelming . i believe that being gay is neither evil , nor a choice . god created gay people , just as he created me . he loves them , too . i refuse to believe that god would be so cruel , as to set gay people up for failure . i believe that money and religion cannot mix . either you serve god , or you serve your greed for money . not both . there is no such thing as a racist christian . there are plenty of racists , though , who call themselves christian . if you truly love christ , you love your fellow human , no matter the ethnicity . i sincerely wish that the many cinos christian in name only in the world would recognize their own hypocrisy , and denounce dogma , when it clearly causes suffering , inflames hatred , or requires hefty lying to oneself .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

9. its not moral to believe that the fall justifies all the bad stuff , it just caused it to happen or was the kickstart i suppose . i do believe that adam was made from dust and eve the rib . the snake , in my view , was satan in the form of a snake , or talking through a snake . i read the bible in a metaphorical way . of course many things are taken literally like the earth flooded folks who arent christians , thats their choice . i would never say  go burn in hell  to anyone regardless of age , beliefs , or gender . many good things come from all corners of the world too . there is a misunderstanding between atheists and christians though .
   (ID: 13429813198f2aaef97e18644aa776da323f48a1)

10. congratulations . i know how hard it is . i believe in you . the potato believes .

12. the power to believe i  a cappella
   (ID: 2af8a0ff2295d21473f0e6ff67565738eb8f4df1)

13. may i ask what exactly do you believe in so i can procces how different it is from my speculations or any other of religious people . what exactly do you believe or care to believe as an agnostic atheist ?
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

14. hiding secrets is a large issue here . find a therapist you feel you can trust and talk this through , either alone or with your significant other . seeing a therapist doesn ' t mean there ' s something broken about you , you just need a sounding board to sort through the emotional chaos . believe me , it helps . hang in there .
   (ID: 40a3b3e3ead468881f7392ff22e867f06207755d)

15. i know this deviates from the question a little but i don ' t ever thank a god for the good things in my life because i believe , a long time ago , the idea of a god was turned into a method of controlling the masses by organized religions and churches . whenever someone thanks god for the great things in their life , i just wanna scream , " why can ' t we appreciate human worth and accomplishment for once " pretty much any luxury or innovation that exists today we can thank a human for . a simple human being did something amazing ! i just believe that we shouldn ' t waste our time worshipping some thing we have never seen for our accomplishments when we could spend our time thanking each other and ourselves . also , if there is a god , why in the hell should we worship it ? our god is terrible ! why would a perfect , omniscient , all powerful being create things like cancer , disease in general , mutation , negativity anger , rage , sadness , fear , hatred , or even pain or death ? and why would it ask us to worship it for making those things ? that is a selfish , cruel god that ignores the " rules " it set forth upon its creations .

16. after a nasty change if leadership we believe you are just too close to the former director and our lawyer thought it would better if you resigned i broke no rules
   (ID: 7c3eb339580d281fcb54cb04dbb55f6921fceec5)

17. i agree , i don ' t think the misery between pedro and chantel is fake , but i believe everything her family does for the camera is , and they are terrible actors . i have no doubt they are a bunch of crazy bitches when the camera isn ' t on and that much of pedro and maybe chantel ' s misery is caused by them .
   (ID: 85a05d28a3a638ea67074ae6793644f5f667c9f3)

18. i didn ' t actually think you would do that . thanks , my respect for you just went up a bit . i don ' t know about ' many ' , i ' m not qualified to make that judgement . however , i was not . i was raised more or less secularly , with a bit of new age bullshit thrown in once and a while . as such , i think i give christianity a lot less respect than others do , because i never believed that it was a better way of looking at the world than any other ' god ' belief that any other culture has had , ever . again , i can ' t speak for ' most atheists ' . we ' re not organized . i ' m not even familiar with most of the major proponents of atheism , i watched dawkins speak for the first time yesterday . however , i don ' t seek to understand you , and i don ' t understand why you think i should . i have plenty of reasons to believe that , firstly , there is no validity to your beliefs , and secondly , that religion in general and christianity specifically causes a great deal of harm in the world . i have plenty of christian friends that i respect for things other than their religious beliefs , but i don ' t believe any of them are as involved with their religion as you . i ' ll counter your question with ' why do you think that i shouldn ' t attack you ? ' , or ' why should i respect your beliefs ? ' .

19. i thought i heard something like that but i ' d rather not believe it because it just makes it so much better .
   (ID: 9c2d2fde31927b8cc3bc419049de8844ca720cb9)

20. first of all , a lot of people don ' t have online , so that ' s a factor . second of all , i believe the matchmaking system is based a bit on location , so that may be something . all i know is i ' ve never had a problem with getting people in a lobby , and i often find it hard because i invite my friends to my session , but the lobby is often full .
