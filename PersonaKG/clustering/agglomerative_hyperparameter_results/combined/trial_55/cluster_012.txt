1. what i meant to say is that the post is for that time and so far i ' ve seen no proof of a digit leak . so that ' s why it could very well be fake . now , if someone can find the actual post from then or cite it somewhere that would be interesting . i ' d want to look more into this project the list refers to .
   (ID: 9789fadf3a050c71c64ca7e31c4857fc9094d643)

   (ID: 9a4083ece31f241c8374b733a1ef26a760deb17a)

   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

6. i have a feeling we don ' t know the full story on how succession works with supreme kais and gods of destruction . how come it ' s shin linked to beerus , and not this ? he was higher up the pecking order of kais , seems like the natural choice for a god of destruction to be linked to . we ' ve seen that kais train successors , and there have been hints that beerus  whis wanted gokvegeta i forget which to become a god of destruction . so maybe they ' re not immortal beings , so much as chosen powerful people who have some magic done on them to link them and balance creation and destruction . with this in mind , nobody would have cared that much if buu had killed shin . just pick up with the next in line for supreme kai , and train up a new god of destruction .

11. no , they are not flushable . if the box says so , they are lying to try to sell more tampons , though i ' ve ever seen that on a box . tampons are literally designed to plug and soak up liquids , so they do that in the pipes too . " flushable " wipes are not supposed to be flushed either , they do not break down .

20. not a worker , but the lady behind me got upset about the bill she got over  digit and thought that she could refund it by puking it up back on to her plate . she got even more upset when they wouldn ' t accept it , and started to trash everything ! of course , they had to call security to get her out . by far the weirdest , but funniest thing i ' ve ever seen !
