   (ID: 248dfc064467a4d774ed5853571f5757bace1bf3)

2. i came to this thread to point out the soundcloud recording and defending this prof . glad to see reddit has actually followed through like i have and now are asking the same  or similar  questions like " what is going on with this picture ? " and " what ' s this about the student doing something illegal ? "
   (ID: 9d1e879011bb23fa9a0cff4c99a536feb2705b86)

3. i ' m glad that they moved away from that . i think the floating words thing is used way too much in tv now . the first two examples that come to mind are sherlock and the good doctor .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

   (ID: b1f9e512a76d2c07b1eae248bca4e0bf140d4bc8)

   (ID: feb4a6aeed8e7e14b0592329bd91d7933a93217e)

11. dude i am super glad to hear your little dude is ok . i bet he ' s happy and healthy . sorry if this question bothered you , it just kinda hit me all the sudden that like in those movies where it ' s pulled off well , it would be devastating to a parent . then again i only have dogs , but i know i wouldn ' t even be able to stand seeing that in a movie
   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

12. once you start the ball rolling with saving money it ' s can become addicting to see your piggy bank et fatter and fatter . just ask yourself , why put your money into depreciating assets ? is it worth the short term excitement for having less money in the long term when you could be using the extra money to pay off debt and expenses ? you will be glad in the long term if you saved your money for important things .
   (ID: 89bda4e1242c8f5567558138509db8b02cf94cd6)

13. i know what you mean . i used to get panic attacks that lasted days , weeks even . my situation was so bad . i ' m glad i found mindfulness . good luck
   (ID: f9d3bf7ce779e854aa865f12a7dfaaee14a65cfa)

14. are you serious ? edit  i ' d be glad to help you and all , but that ' s really not a lot to go on . sorry for sounding like an ass , though .
   (ID: 1b536a1a785be8a375bc7a04c0ffc9457562d78c)

15. glad someone said this ! i hate how men are all tarred with the same potential rapist bullshit .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

16. honestly probably tempal or in your mouth if you angle it right . you shouldn ' t do this though it might seem like shut like its better to just give up but its not its better to carry on tomorrow could be a better day . tommorow might be the best day of your life you find your dream girl start dating and live a long and happy life glad you never ever killed yourself . or you get help and are still glad you get to atleast attempt life and perhaps you really do something maybe youre the guy who cures cancer anyrhings possible . dont throw it away and pass your pain onto your friends and family . please find help  someone in your position not too long ago .
   (ID: 0501bf1e5cd313190bb4590a1c677057b15a6e47)

17. i was just meaning to be a smartass honestly with my original comment , but sounds like you got yourself into a much better situation though . really i ' m of the belief that everything happens for a reason , learn from your mistakes and your accomplishments . glad to hear that it sounds like it worked out well for you in the end here
   (ID: 1cf567904675ac1ca7b5a90612e5479a5b6c9bef)

18. just glad it ' s so cheap or else it ' d be a joke .
   (ID: 315ad21e3ce098f09bec23f9b7509d07540912c7)
