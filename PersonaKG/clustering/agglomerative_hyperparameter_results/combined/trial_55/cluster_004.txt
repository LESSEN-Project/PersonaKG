9. you  ll go through about an hour or so of practicing the moves on the ground with the guys who will be strapped on to you , they never once talked about what to do if you wanted to back out , so the thought was never in your mind . when you get up in the plane , they  ll talk you through it while you reach altitude . when you reach altitude , you don  t have much time before they pretty much throw you out of the airplane . it was fun , i was excited to do it so i was never scared of it .

16. jesus no we didnt need a whole other film but i thought they made some questionable choices for the last act . visually i thought the snapped heroes returning was pretty meh . it shouldve been strange leading them out of digit massive portal , instead we get t ' challa first . why ? and the whole assemble felt too spaced out . get rid of all the filler warriors and have the main heroes together and get a better run  up action scene , they shouldve used the angle that was in the infinity war trailer that had hulk running through wakanda .
   (ID: 5fa74a7d6a70c6f2f8a149864f494ac72eefd3e4)

17. this has given me food for thought . i have just weaned off my antidepressant because i  ve been experiencing all over body pain and a variety of other negative symptoms for more than digit months and my doctor is convinced that they are all side effects of lexapro . i suspect fibromyalgia but ssd is another possibility i hadn  t heard of before . i  ll be looking into it more , thank you . thanks for the blog link too , i love how this community comes together to share advice and resources toward healing !

   (ID: 72cfb7666d0a97ebe283c019ed67b8b62982ac18)

19. i lived in ignorant bliss that my mother , who raised my three other siblings and i as a single ma was the strongest , most diligent and overwhelming powerful person i ' ve ever meet , i thought she was so compassionate and loving that she could never be sad . but three weeks ago , she called me crying , just apologising over and over and over for how she raised us . in light of it all , we had some goddam hard patches but legally or not we always made it through the night . and for some strange reason it only hit at that moment that my ma wasn ' t a goddess , she was a human who could fall down . and for the first time in digit years i saw her fall for the first time . that shit hit hard . love ya parents who ' ve done you well . we ' ll never know how hard it was for them .
