   (ID: fd9a89336fd3cad9dd1a173e01055683165a532e)

2. no one , they ' ll find a way to fuck it up doing stupid stuff
   (ID: 2a3d0cc7409627207d71d58affd421983020efbe)

3. duuuuuuuude . now seriously  this is impressive for a first release . sure , they ' ve been working on it for some time , but it already has features that are still missing from opera and people are complaining about  digit versions after the abandonment of presto . everything is looking good , it even works on , although a bit sluggish on the machine i ' ll be using for some more months . i noticed it has some gestures , but it seems they are neither documented nor customizable for now  e . g . down  right closes the current tab .
   (ID: 32520dc340c18ed101e3d5ea02b3a7bca25dcc29)

4. keep trying , you ' ll never get as many upvotes as me .
   (ID: eee9dc5129787c4d2a8fda055f09565efcf9322a)

   (ID: a77a8bcaa391d8b6584d32e6ad243e71297d7258)

6. oh , for that just buy a cheaper car with folding mirrors and be sure to turn your dash cam off when you leave . i ' ll let you know if you parked well or not .
   (ID: 444a09ca39f58d05353b9b684dd02178e70eed93)

7. no , because i like the game just enough to keep playing at least until there  s more dragon ball super or something and even then i might just stop playing for awhile . i won  t quit until i stop having fun and so long as i have battles with people where the timer is at digit , we  re both down to one character and everything is gonna come down to the next move , i  ll keep playing . when things get too easy or hard for me to do , i  ll stop
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

8. do it ! who knows , maybe you ' ll fall into another career path you love even more ! i took off several years after college before taking the pre  reqs . i learned a ton , had some great experiences and some not  so  great experiences , and am pretty happy with my decision i guess we ' ll see how my cycle goes . i actually think you ' re very mature  you ' ve figured out what might be best for you !
   (ID: f179711c18514780c1b0257643d893ef1cf5a081)

15. its not really about the money . i can make money in incursions in no time . but i think doing some lvl5s with a carrier as well as repping poses and hauling ships around , would be useful . but its not very high priority . after all i think i ' ll train it with my alt .
   (ID: 699195a280fce86200065786c40a00e3096406da)

16. i ' ll bet you anything that they don ' t do twitchcon with this patch . if for none of the major flaws it will be because the extra character models in the zombies make the game super laggy . i ' ve been watching some streamers doing scrims tonight and that ' s their biggest complaint
   (ID: b30983a02e6c6ad80a50a521eee441b9f454a5e9)

   (ID: 164327be87300906de16932661437c5b2b671c9d)

20. i didn ' t want to make a full post about this but i see you a lot in comments . so i ' m doing my first dosage of 600mg i ' ll be doing 300mg and than waiting an hour and doing the next 300mg , i think ill be fine . my friend on the other hand is doing 800mg for the his first trip , should i try and get him away from that idea ?
