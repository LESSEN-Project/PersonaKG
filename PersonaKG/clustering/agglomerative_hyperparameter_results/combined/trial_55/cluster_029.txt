8. i was just answering op  s question . sorry if my response offended you . if you don  t want to have in depth discussions about the show and waste your time , why even browse this subreddit ? that  s kind of the point . i love the show how it is i was just giving my opinion of what i would do if i could change it . no need to get upset .
   (ID: 9d6763f3caa1ca2559f1a3c525c70ffea81a61c2)

9. yeah i understand this . one of the things i  m going through now is seeing high school friends on facebook make posts about being home owners , and i want to buy a house soon . so it is easy to feel jealous but i don  t want to . you know ? i want to mature and just be patient and not envy others . but it is a conscious decision that we have to make sometimes .
   (ID: d28c94c02761dbceb7bd64e3288f28eeef3a75cf)

10. many subreddits have rules about what can be posted . you just have to follow these rules and find the appropriate subreddit for what you are wanting to post . some subreddits even have certain times that they allow certain things to be posted , it can be rather confusing . once you figure out which subreddits  communities that you like and want to be a part of it will be easier . one more thing , most subreddits have a minimum account age  karma requirement before you are able to post anything at all . so , just begin commenting on posts and gaining karma , eventually you will be able to post like everyone else . just dont ask the mods what the minimums are , this will likely result in a ban .
   (ID: 1f135ff98983a673a19c956d41be6fdeca8513e4)

11. now it makes sense i guess , like who wouldn  t want to subscribe to this lad
   (ID: 1306973da0fba9f8c4b839b9163f3f01aacfe98a)

12. no , it ' s quite normal to be sedated for it . you generally have to ask for them to keep you awake . it sounds like a failure of the anesthesiologist if they were unable to keep you sedated , and it ' s battery unless you told them you want to be awake plus you described it as what sounds like battery to me .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

13. i agree . once the achievement hunters get their aps , everything will be back to somewhat normal .  the only real bad thing about leagues so far are the pve commanders . yeah , there ' s a ton of them  but on the flipside , they probably really want to help . it just so happens they get overwhelmed with all the things they need to do . they may have been used to running with their guild then decided to try it out on the server . i once commanded our guild run in wvw and it ' s really different when you ' re working with your guild and when you have pugs with you . with your guild , you know what they are capable of so you always know what to tell them . with pugs , there are a lot of probabilities with them  are they upleveled ? because they might not survive the first clash . are they here just for the karma  xp  loot ? then they won ' t follow instructions if you tell them to " stack " , " blast statics  might " , and so on and so forth because they would be like , " whatever man let ' s get this over with "
   (ID: 261413214c13676b8aee2ce20a47107c4ccfe6b8)

14. i have never stated that disobeying an officer means you deserve to die . i don  t think that at all , i think that anyone when encountering the police should obey an officers orders because it gives you the best chance of getting through the situation with a a better outcomelesser charges and b reduces risk of bodily harm . please don  t put hateful intentions onto me as i wouldn  t apply them to you . i  ll i want is for people to be more informed on police work , by doing so we make lives easier for everyone
   (ID: 350ebf5f22b005c6fa011b8241361bb7184ec8d5)

15. why would i want to talk about when i buried my shit as deep as i could ? oh wait that ' s not what you meant .
   (ID: 0577b566bc01c7d79464f522c720317d81923a8c)

16. what else would be cool is if we could pick the types of missions we want to join into with others
   (ID: 52e0e376c09b4862d8eea84ae547c3466a2aac4b)

17. it ' s not easy at all . it depends on if you can truly handle not only being a friend , but seeing her live her life with someone else that she ' ll eventually choose . i get jealous easily and it seeing a girl i want to be romantic with , do things with another guy is like waiting forever for your food and the waiter simply giving it to someone else and having to watch them eat it .
   (ID: e217e0e78b3d167105d634f49246c934025ff72b)

18. what do you want ? answer that first even just to yourself and then it will be clearer what you should do . i want hugh jackman to come over to my house and rub me with oil and roger me senseless . i can want all i want  nothing wrong with wanting . it is just that what we want is not always going to happen .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

19. pf is like ip tables except its made by openbsd which is what pf sense uses and yes is included in my rabbit hole but i want to learn the inner workings of pf and openbsd gonna land my self in some sort of trouble by the end
   (ID: da770212ea31887c4be30925213eff0dc5d8687b)

20. my dude , with respect , you ' ll know if you have a problem . when it hurts indiscribably but you dont say anything . when you desperately want to talk to someone but cant even imagine anyone understanding or caring enough to listen . feeling like you should cry but cant when you ' re alone or otherwise relaxed . thats when you know . if the feeling you have now keeps getting worse and worse or you feel any of the other things i said , go see a psychologist and talk to them about it . its often expensive but its the only thing that will ever really help you . best of luck to you though , its not a bottomless pit , get help and you can heal . the sooner the better .
