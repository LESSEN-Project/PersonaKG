15. everyone is going to have a different opinion on here . and that  s great . here is some more confusion for you to think about  as a guy , we are always told hitting on women at the gym is a horrible idea . he gave you signs once , but not the second time where is the consistency . even  alpha  male  hunters  enjoy it when an  alpha  female gets flirty first . cautious approach  maybe just ignore him entirely the next time and see if he initiates something . that would be a pretty good indicator he wants to keep things going . the  alpha  approach  screw it ! ask him ! the worst he can say is no , then you can stop wasting your time . no shortage of dudes out there . plus , then you can you can give him the  just friends  smile if you see him at the gym , and walk by letting him watch what he  s missing out on .
