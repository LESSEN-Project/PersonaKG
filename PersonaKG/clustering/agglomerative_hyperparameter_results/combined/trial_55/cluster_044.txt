   (ID: 239eded9e37fe1b7388561d1e82993d15dd4fc15)

   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

3. i just watched the movie a couple days ago after reading the book , also titled " unbroken . the book provides more detail , and even though the movie might help to visualize a little more , i think the book is a great read .
   (ID: 38a1a6eac84444872020421e5880d0a28cd981e1)

4. did you read what you just typed ? if something has low odds and it happens it is generally considered lucky . doesn ' t always have to be , for example , two digit stars to be lucky . edit  yes i ' m aware that you could also be unlucky in this same manner . but i would not consider this to be unlucky .
   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

5. that series is the worst thing i have ever read , and i wrote smut many years ago . i shake my head at that , but even my inexperienced arse writing was nowhere near constant ' rape ' , at least i made sure consent was in it , despite being new to writing .
   (ID: 5d032deb25ff976c97c846d4d1073b0e71b447a3)

6. interesting to see how a lot of people think posess is op , yet you consider it underpowered . i guess you just have to read the comments saying it ' s op to see what potential it has
   (ID: 0092767d04168a05a983237480637793d5458cba)

7. oof , i fucked up . for anyone who hasn ' t read that horrible series , the guy has this problem where he doesn ' t like to be touched , but the main character sort of cures that .
   (ID: 5173a1d5475490650d7365b2c2b2f2c579d33099)

8. well , its been a while now and nobody got it , so here ' s the comment again with slightly easier to read formatting . you ever met a gay person ? or asked them about their experiences growing up in abusive atmospheres with people using language like this ? up until very recently this kind of talk was pretty common , and it shouldn ' t be tolerated just because it ' s " some guys down the pub " . fuck that . all it takes for this kind of crap to be perpetuated is people like you who dismiss it as " pub talk " , and " banter " . good job there , i hope you ' re proud of yourself . read the first letter of each sentence .
   (ID: f7356e924b370675e942b29b9c2184dc895ea5b7)

9. ps i love you . the best critical review i read about it was  " go see p . s . i love you , or you could hit yourself on the head with a meat mallet " that describes the movie perfectly .
   (ID: 1b4a970a63450e21b56e1d38502b30aca032cd3f)

10. i take it you ' d already read the short story before you saw the movie ? the story was really creepy in its depiction of a very wrong small town .
   (ID: f024c8cde5b36a880df271cca31792d32264df2c)

11. i haven ' t heard of that book . i wonder if even if they read it if they would realize what they ' re in for . they are such amazing , hard  working people that are in it so deep that to admit defeat . well . i just don ' t think they could do it . wouldn ' t it be so embarrassing to say you tried and gulp failed . it really really makes me so sad for them . and i agree , it sounds like a book that could be quite dry , but i bet it would actually be quite interesting if you know someone personally involved . i would probably cry for them .
   (ID: aa8abed66c32a0519ab922c1a606563d97de28fc)

12. funny how if people post suggestions then " it ' s useless because niantic doesn ' t even read the sub " but if we post criticism " we have destroyed pokemon go  niantic . which is it ?
   (ID: 31010e05529816820e206497e04c189d0c81c647)

   (ID: fe374743dd856c29f2117723cef01c1fdc3b3b5b)

14. i know too many people who read buzzfeed and acept what they see there as fact . grown adults . digit years old . it ' s terrifying .
   (ID: d51e2f0207b67be3748f59fc0b78f82cd1e47a1c)

15. whenever i scroll past this i always think it says ' fantastic bright red cancer ' so i always double take and then read ' acer '
   (ID: 063ff05b3364c41fa72065634c0e90854c7272a4)

16. i honestly hoped that it was a joke because it was the silliest shit i ever read in my life . worst part is some actually apologized .
   (ID: 803d3eb0d3664275a2ad6840048dba9d4d991cf7)

17. i read it last year and didn ' t really care for it . i think the religious  mystical aspects didn ' t appeal to me , and so much of it was about that . i ' m not going to read any other books in the series .
   (ID: 22a043d8284bd8c7c31748b5cc8c8b8efc757df6)

18. i was not . my parents were presbyterian on paper , and i think at least my mother did does ? believe . i was taught almost nothing of religion , and only have the vaguest of memories of ever going to church . i think we went a handful of times when i was very young . maybe that ' s what allowed me to gloss over the religious context when i read the books as a kid .
   (ID: 22a043d8284bd8c7c31748b5cc8c8b8efc757df6)

19. i couldn ' t even force myself to read all of that . that dude seems like a danger to society . if you ' re at a university i ' d seriously consider speaking to a counselor or safety official about all that . dude needs help before he hurts someone .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

20. that ' s pretty scary . is there a creepypasta article or something ? i ' d like to read it sometime .
