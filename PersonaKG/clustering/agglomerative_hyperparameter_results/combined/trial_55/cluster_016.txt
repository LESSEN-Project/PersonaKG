4. genjo  digit genjo had inquired on possible peaceful resolutions , and both paviche and dani scoffed at the idea . though , genjo had encountered the orks before , and he knew how difficult they could be . peace didn ' t always mean not fighting , it could also mean all fighting for a better cause . genjo would have to enlighten these orks . perhaps he couldn ' t stop them from fighting , but he could redirect that energy for a better purpose . that was an idea for another time . for now genjo would just listen on as dani and pastel both asked their own questions . dani ' s was more practical of a question . though genjo already knew the answer . having faced the orks before , he knew how destructive they could be . pastel , however , asked a question of oddity . it was almost as though she didn ' t want to help . perhaps she ' d need enlightenment too . all should do what they can to better the world , even if others are more qualified to do so . after a back and forth between pavi and a newcomer , lady ward , on whether or not to let pastel become a meat shield , a woman named delilah would enter the tent to further the debrief and speak of what the true job was . essentially it was a search and destroy mission . find daggartooth and end him . genjo wasn ' t too sure this type of plan was necessary , but he ' d keep an open mind . he didn ' t want to kill , but that didn ' t mean he wasn ' t prepared to fight . the team would also get a bonus for retrieving stolen goods from a group of pirates called the sororitas . this stolen tech intrigued genjo . what could it be ? how was it stolen ? what dangers did they pose ? and what happens should they remain lost ? however , genjo would ask the questions that meant most to him .  " i have but two questions . these items that you wish us to retrieve , what are they ? and what benefits do they have ? i merely wish to understand the importance of them . "

   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

9. i ' m not well  versed in trek , as i was always more of a wars fan . but spock was my main interest whenever i heard or read about the franchise . it ' s my understanding that he ' s only half  vulcan , but that he still has the option to flip his emotions like a switch , right ? it would seem feelings are internal and emotions are a physical counterpart to that , so either they have feelings all the time , or they can activate both whenever they wish . i think the whole concept is interesting . everyone should opt to be more like spock , because emotions are important for healthy living , but sometimes get in the way when making important decisions .

10. i remember seeing this on the news . that teacher is the best , and i wish i had someone like that when i was going through something similar

20. i wish i were joking too women dont tend to talk about how a loss feels or how it ' s not just a loss but more like the death of a dream . " be lucky for the kids you do have " is not a consolation in any way .
