13. okay , then in answer to your question i would say that if you actually want to have sex then you might develop some kind of negative hang up about penis size but there are tonnes of ways to pleasure someone besides that so it shouldn ' t really have a negative affect .

14. if the foundations of your house crumbled , would you just say  fuck it  and remain there ? if you live a while away from the jobs , borrow the money to buy a secondhand bicycle and ride it to the nearest town , and to see your friends . the littlest steps are often the biggest . you  ll get there , i know it  s difficult , but you can get it .
   (ID: 0f6c6c4bd3531c7f028b4bf901123522dd67c300)

18. if he say to his brother " i wanted to sleep with your girl " he will get mad obviously . so you can either say nothing and after some time things will be normal again or you can say everything and hope that you won ' t make them angry . but whatever you do , do not go with " little moves " like wanting to apologising or something like that because you are going to make them confused and maybe angry .
   (ID: dcb1bc1d0feb2af72f09ec35633379706e2b36f0)

19. so you keep telling me , i must have really made you angry with my opinion . didn ' t know it would shake you so badly . at the point you just parrot what i say while putting crying emojis in it i would really call it a conversation .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)
