1. if you are seriously interested , then give shelter to at least one in your house . i ' m sure there ' d be space for one .
   (ID: bbb6fee39268cdbbb90618968b5dbe6dee839233)

2. i ' m not sure what it is , my ex plucked it from a hotel out front and i cloned it last summer
   (ID: 917dfa16e92ce1db67ec3f88bc07b87b70a36c95)

   (ID: 6f291f3688a3a398f92cd165b10b1d3796d86840)

4. the only problem is it can turn into murder , yes most likely accidental but still killing for another person . she admitted she doesn  t know much such as road rules and the lane change was just an example . that  s why i  m not sure
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

5. my mum taught me to lie to my dad about how much she spent on clothes from an early age . he knew we were lying and never challenged it . not sure why she insisted on lying about everything she bought , my dad couldn  t have cared less . nice memories
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

6. the official statement is that it was suicide  asked them when they try to get me to testify . the whole thing is shady considering he wasn  t in his home country  pretty sure there isn  t even supposed to be an investigation from his own country because it happened on foreign soil .
   (ID: cc15a2c089fadf84b135f1f61f9666baac04a6e3)

7. our ranger may be the most op character in our group at the moment . not sure why everyone says they suck
   (ID: 4220698c420fc0ae5858bf747f40efb2251b9ed8)

8. in not sure this is unpopular  but yes there is only so much seasoning , so many ingredients you can add before a dish starts to be horrible . nevertheless people want the best , most expensive , extravagant thing they can find . even absolutely fresh , local ingredients prepared by highly trained chefs will only get you so far in terms of a mark up . food is ultimately just dirt , seeds , and slaughtered animals  the gold beckons you into a web of sin  but don ' t go in
   (ID: 85ac769b0cb349e567cb91e8109645bd1ac28b9f)

9. i would change my lottery numbers . for sure .
   (ID: 96ea4e7f6c3452a58ef71fc7276006fdbf2ccb01)

10. it depends on the quality of us and international intelligence . it ' s clear that we aren ' t sure exactly where all their military sites are , making it more difficult . either way international powers could defeat the army i imagine relatively quickly , as despite large numbers of military personnel in the nk army they lack basic supplies  equipment . they could of course do a lot of damage to south korea with their artillery , and possibly conventional forces the latter is unclear .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

11. i didn  t find relief with omep  i didn  t find relief for the occasional heartburn but have the shortness of breath under control with zyrtec and singulair . which would make you think its just allergies . but i have every other symptom of lpr , and if i don  t watch what i eat the shortness of breath comes back . so it  s been a combo of avoiding my personal triggers and these meds are helping for sure
   (ID: f14ea91df683dc236b3ffe5956871b69581e71d3)

12. thanks , buddy . i appreciate the compliment . i ' ll be sure to share more of my stuff .
   (ID: 191aa96179821ac46f9548541f04899c2adacec9)

13. thing is i wouldn  t call it a debate if we were to go by the textbook definition . i could almost guarantee that if i sat down with lorinbassnectar he wouldn  t want to have a debate about policy he would simply shut me out . i  m sure , and maybe i  m making an assumption , but i  m sure that we could both agree that a lot if not the majority of his fan base has no knowledge about policy and simply follows what is posted . that  s what i find dangerous . when so many people look up to an individual they treat his words as facts , and this applies to both sides of the aisle . i also call it dangerous because it is a sure way of not only ostracizing a large portion of your fan base who listens to your music to escape reality but it could even pose the problem of many people losing hope in one place where they thought they could find it , and that is dance music . that  s just me and i can tell from the many downvotes that  s it  s not a very popular opinion .

14. i  m not sure what the limit is , but there is some value of goods that you  re allowed to bring in as personal luggage that is allowable as tax free . if you  re worried you can voluntarily declare it and see what they say , but probably smarter to check the regulations online first . if you  re below the allowed value then don  t bother declaring since it isn  t required , but keep the receipt and maybe a printed copy of the regulations in case you get stopped .
   (ID: d8e39e092041fc01f24bedce425d10f55bd2a764)

15. once told someome i hated strawberries for no reason . not sure what u expected to gain out of that one
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

16. there are too many socially awkward nerd out there who may have done bad deed to the rest of the world . but this is the guy who seems to cross all borders of narcissism . if the guy couldn ' t care after his kid then what was he trying to achieve by keeping him separated from his own mother . and as much focused he was on his career , perhaps he could receive international recognition for his works but karma will get him for sure if not soon . and i ' m saying it as a non  religious person . sure we are sitting here  doing the pseudo  humanism debate on the condition of reiryu but it is a pity for all of us that we cannot do anything for that kid .
   (ID: 5ec957438fa111872baaa0871df8459459cc2519)

17. i ' m sure trump has something to do with it
   (ID: e807b18e05d35f02282740d90e8c63546558b267)

18. i think if i knew my kid was going to die at any young age i would make sure that they had a full life full of love and happiness . unfortunately if you don  t send your kid to school you can go to jail .
   (ID: 19d727be6c2cbac7b528c7c522e3aa512e48025f)

19. for sure . i have a few gay friends . they are awesome , but you just gotta get that out of the way right off so there is no confusion on either party .
   (ID: fa749ff7262da656e34f21f4b902bd5287bf224d)

20. i see things a bit differently . no doubt your dad would appreciate a higher end and therefore more expensive turntable , but as an unexpected gift from his child , either of your options are priceless . go to the top of your budget and if your dad particularly likes audio technica , go with the best you can afford . i don  t know what other equipment you already have , but make sure that you have a pre  amp or integrated amp with a  phono  input or else keep enough money on one side for a suitable phono stage . good luck .
