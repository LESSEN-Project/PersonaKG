7. never asked for your pity fuck face nor did i ever suggest i was a good guy you did suggest however that i was a bad guy . blindly follow orders ? really guy are you for real ? there is a fucking huge difference between blindly following orders and doing a fucking job without bitching like a pampered millennial cum dumpster . i ' m sick of asshats like you making assumptions about the intentions of a fucking soldiers enlistment . my job pointless i ' m pretty sure quite a few families would be proud to know their lives are pointless . maybe we shouldn ' t be there but people are being killed but that doesn ' t matter to you because they are not americans right ? so me stopping tali from murdering husbands raping wives and kidnaping children and turning them into sex slaves is pointless ? irregardless of why i was sent there in the first place it ' s still pointless because it ' s not your family . ok thanks for the clarification .

20. not said , really , but vocalized all the same . so i was sitting on the bus on the way home from high school , and over the years , you come to know most of the other kids on the bus , by name at least . so one of my bus  bound acquaintances in the grade ahead of me , let ' s call her claire , at the start of the bus ride starts laughing about something . now as claire was sitting directly behind me and allegedly having just been told one hell of a zinger , the laugh was loud . loud enough that it really hurt my ear . my first instinct was to reel around and produce an equally loud , pitch perfect imitation of said laugh . claire just looked me dead in the eyes and said " wesleyrobertsimpson , i did not appreciate that . " i ' ll never forget that moment , nor forgive myself for it . tl  dr  never genuinely insult somebody else ' s laugh , you ' ll never forgive yourself .
