5. no problem . hopefully there are more like you in the world . fair play to you for wanting to brighten up a strangers day . another thing would be leaving post  its on mirrors in public toilets telling the next person how great they look  have a lovely smile  fabulous hair . or if you are out to dinner and it ' s really good , specifically ask to see the chef and give them a tip . i don ' t think they get them very often .

12. coz it often is creepy af and unwanted . especially if the person sending the unsolicited msg hasn ' t even interacted with the receiver on the comment thread or anything . and a lot of people are very sick of getting unsolicited msgs , and yeah , it ' s really not hard to quickly write , hey is it okay if i msg you ? it takes like digit seconds , and either they say yeah sure and everything is all good , or they say no and it ' s a good thing you were respectful and asked . and honestly , why would someone have a problem with simply asking ? do they want to hide the fact that they ' re msging people privately ? why do they not want anyone to see that ?
