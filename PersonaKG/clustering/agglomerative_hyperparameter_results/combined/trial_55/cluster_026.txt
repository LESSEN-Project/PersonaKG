   (ID: 53aee34a0ceaafd2f3baaa01c94219ee83a7dace)

4. you need maxed temple but i think what you ' re doing wrong is that you got the other t5 super monkeys after you got the temple . i read somewhere that you need to get them before you get the temple .
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

5. have you tried it ? you need to try it .
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

6. he ' s digit years older than you and you ' re gonna have a miserable life ahead of you if you stay . you gotta worry about yourself first . you do what you think you need to do .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

7. if you like one of the teams you shoot against , that is close , you can see if they need players ?
   (ID: 6eb8259d7d6b7ae101dda44ceaaf3b9edaab4fad)

8. i didn ' t say i didn ' t care for my friends , i said i ' m only obligated to provide care for my child . not paying for my friends things through tax money does apply to them as well . i don ' t want to be forced to give charity . that ' s theft . if my friends need help , they should come to me and other friends and family members for help . i don ' t have any adult children , but in digit years when my son becomes a legal adult , if he is unable to get affordable health insurance , then i will help him , granted i ' m still alive and able to do so . that ' s what parents do . and i do have an employer provided insurance plan . i am ok that they use my money to pay for other patients ' procedures because i can opt out of it if i choose to .
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

9. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

10. shame that the media has been doing his shit to pewds for years now , but seriously we need a plan
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

11. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

12. just a quick question  why not make the " vik " something closer to a kashtan ? it would certainly make the dreadnaughts much scarier since this is hfy . you would need to reduce the number probably but it would look much better in my head .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

13. support only  please don ' t tell me the truth or your opinion , i only need to hear my point of view through a different mouth
   (ID: 161e54996257552df993f906d6f848a053922141)

14. that ' s exactly what i need to do .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

15. we need a t . v . show were flat earthers look for the edge . then at the end of the siris they get roasted by scientists
   (ID: f3a18644ac7abbbf38805d44618254b8104cce6f)

16. just gotta be honest with her on how you feel and if she doesn ' t want the same thing then maybe you need to move on .
   (ID: 5d6cecafd26473d96b39b973965364f09d4d41f1)

17. we need to know about the attic !
   (ID: 0254dc2f43007419c5c3fd1e155e6bf15fce137d)

18. yes , i would say trimming is important and obviously wash yourself advice i would say is needed with or without pubic hair but if there is no pubic hair anywhere the friction situation could prove to be quite uncomfortable . it ' s there for a reason , i don ' t see why we need to be changing everything about our bodies . just accept yourself and your partner for who you are !
   (ID: 44f5ba2e2e79c07f77ae334e708119f166a6aca0)

19. you need to be more hydrated , after you sweat that much you must be thirsty
   (ID: 870d9d198f856764296262192823c935f1daf781)

20. look , i want to sleep . i don ' t understand why you and the other human need to bounce on the bed or whatever it is you do to make it shake .
