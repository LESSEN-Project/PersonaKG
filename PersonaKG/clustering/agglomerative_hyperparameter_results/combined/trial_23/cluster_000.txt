4. i ' m guessing you did not want to move into your wife ' s parents house in the first place . do you think that if this injury were from something like working out that you ' d be as upset by it ? what if it had been your wife that had made the mistake ? is the resentment confined to the injury , and your in  laws supposed stupidity , or is there something about the living situation itself affecting your attitude . i ' m guessing it ' s a more generally bad situation for you and it feels better to hone in on one specific outrage than to look at the entirety of it . perhaps highly speculatively you ' re worried that you ' re the incompetent one . good luck btw   that ' s a tough situation .
