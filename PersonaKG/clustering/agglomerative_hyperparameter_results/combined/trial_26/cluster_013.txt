16. if you ' re not happy with yourself , trying to find happiness from others will lead to nothing but disappointment . you ' ll come to realize that although there genuinely are people who want you to be happy , no one person can do it around the clock and to the degree you want . and it ' s not their responsibility . you have to be complacent with yourself first .
   (ID: 23b74d30984aae116954fc82863fe4bd913ba329)

19. for me it was oregairu , when i first watched i was at a point in my life where i acted very similar to the main character , and i hated that . the main characters actions never did anything but make me dislike the character , when i finally realized how similar i was to the mc i decided i wanted to be more positive and get better at making friends . while now i don ' t have a lot friends , i do have more than i used to and am a generally happy person . i think that if i never watched that show i would be much less happy with who i am now . tl  dr  oregairu made me realize the reason i wasn ' t happy is that i hated the kind of person i was .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

20. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .
