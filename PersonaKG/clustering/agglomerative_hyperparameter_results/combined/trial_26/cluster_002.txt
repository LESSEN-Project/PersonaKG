12. nobody could ever profit from a nuclear war , seeing as how it would pretty much destroy every nations economy , cause mass starvation because of contaminatited food and crops , and possibly cause a nuclear winter . so , if nobody profits from it , its unlikely that anyone actually starts launching nukes . the whole point of nukes is to scare the opponent into submission . same thing with russia talking about how they could use ballistic missiles to disrupt yellowstone and destroy mainland usa  even if they did that , it would affect them just as much as the us and theyd lose just as much as theyd gain from doing it .
