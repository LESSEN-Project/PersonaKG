   (ID: abe6eb04e68a888a202387e9e893a2359a7c1822)

6. remembering that alcohol does work for it ' s intended purpose . it does make me forget problems and it does make me relax . it ' s hard knowing there ' s a bottle that can do that . almost like a magic potion . fortunately i ' m now aware that the consequences when i drink far outweigh the benefits .
   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

10. i grew up on a pig farm . my chores when i was digit were harder work than any job that i  ve ever had as an adult . pig farms are highly sustainable because they can eat just about anything , including communists . if the shit were to hit the fan , that  s exactly what i  d feed them . this guy !
   (ID: afb309c0f8d875957ab1e2c406a762b6127668b6)

13. i ' ve been told i never smile , and i do not do well with people . looks like it ' s something to work on .
   (ID: 8e9d9ac876fd2e0508d95d3e43def46faae3c312)

14. let me guess you work inside ? i work on a blacktopped parking lot around a bunch of shiny ass mirrors , wearing a black shirt and grey pants . fuck you its not that hot . i havn ' t sweat all week ive just been secreting a slime all over my body . not that hot . pshhhh
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

15. it sound that those people in your life are holding you back and that isn  t good for mental health . i  m not saying you should get rid of them but certainly make them aware that your life is more than chores or work and everyone needs a hobby and shouldn  t have to hide it .
   (ID: 2d1b758f410687b90c33a1260646954b4c1301f7)

16. that  s a lot of guys ! why did it take so long to work ?
   (ID: 472de55a2855849453179c0ccb5234c4ea9d1192)

17. that  s a pretty serious issue people can take your pension  tax return on top of other things . not to make you worried but i  d see if the place you work for has identity theft protection or some benefit in that matter .
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

18. it ' s probably what ever mod you have that makes you see your feet in first person . generally what i do for issues like this is i disable all mods in my mod manager or game launcher and than i slowly work enable them again one by one till i find the mod that ' s the issue .
   (ID: 114e3678c6af9d322985bb4656e33b19c03a0479)

19. i play online vs exclusively . i ' m not saying this to piss you off , but i can poke check and stick lift all day long and hardly ever get a penalty . my poke checking could arguably be considered poke spamming i do it so much . it ' s all about proper positioning and timing for those poke checks , and never poke from behind . as far as stick lifts , they work very well during puck battles , especially along the boards . if your opponent gets possession , lift that shit right away you have to be fast and it ' ll almost always come loose and back to you . i ' m not saying it ' s perfect far from it , but if you ' re getting penalties on poke checks and stick lifts either your timing or positioning is off . go ahead and downvote me if you want , but i hardly ever get penalties for pokes and lifts . almost all my penalties are checks into the boards that ea will randomly call boarding or charging .
   (ID: 7c5209c3b827e0de0cd436466f80ce09b615606b)

20. i worked like this for a while digit years or so , and liked it . bosses understood we had to have breaks every now and then and we did when we wanted to . i do not think it ' s too bad , each brick  thing moved being less than digit kg and you can do the work how you like , it was more freedom than in most of my it work most bosses didn ' t know what they were talking about . so basically , i didn ' t see negatives  you got   from bosses for doing " hard work and not complaining " is good in any later work you like  apply . if you don ' t get decent wages then that ' s a different issue altogether .
