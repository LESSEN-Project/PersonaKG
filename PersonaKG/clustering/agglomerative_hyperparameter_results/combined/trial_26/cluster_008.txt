16. i nominate bird box as tribute . never has something that  s been so shoved down my throat  oh my gosh youd love it !   scariest movie ever !  disapointed me so hard . how did they get so many a  b listers on this mediocre film ? the dialogue was meh , they never showed the monsters which , you can do that . if your suspense is really good which this wasn  t . and that ass pull character growth where it took this woman five years to love these kids through flashbacks was lazy writing ! . but maybe i  m just jealous , cuz netflix hasn  t touched my psychological thrillers .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

19. huh . i never romanced tali but i figured he would say it at some point , maybe you missed it ? i don ' t think shepard ever says it first though , i remember him answering " i love you too " to most of them , but not the other way around . i guess it ' s usually the love interests who confess their undying love and stuff , shep tends to show more with actions than words .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)
