1. i ' m sorry if i was confusing in my reply . i ' m not trying to discourage anyone . i actually consume soy products daily . i was trying to convey that if you are concerned with phytoestrogens you should check with your pcp . i would also tell a meat eater the same if they are concerned with a certain aspect of thier diet .

18. hahaha no , i ' m sorry ! i think i know what ' s happening . i didn ' t object to you using the term pseudoscience , but to you defining as science with shaky bases . it ' s just flat out not science of any kind , only posing as such . that ' s the distinction i was trying to make you understand . i think i might have been a bit clearer , but i ' m on the phone , so i was perhaps too curt . sorry again .
