1. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .

5. i didn  t have an excuse for why i didn  t tell the husband he was being cheated on . but i did say that i was shocked by her actions and while it was sinking in and i was trying to figure out what to do , she ended up confessing to her husband . it was an ugly mess for sure , but i was concerned about their children who are friends of my child and me being an  outsider  to their family dynamic . also , i was not told any of the details of her affair , including who it was with , so how could i approach the husband with zero information ? and then have the kids be like  your mom is trying to break up my parents  and suddenly my kid is involved . my husband and i had an opportunity to speak with the husband who was cheated on , as we wanted to assure him he was still our friend and he had our digit  support should he need anything . and , the answer to the original question is , cheaters are assholes . not the person who was put in the middle of the situation by a manipulative , pathological liar .
