15. insular people have always done this to protect their own worldview . races , religions , ethnicities , classes , etc . they  ve all been scapegoated and hated for no solid reason because one group feels threatened . i dislike religion because of the use of dogma to legitimize cruelty , but worst of all is hypocrisy . conservatives want to claim to be about individual liberty , unless they feel so inclined to limit any particular group on a whim . christians want to claim to be a bastion of love and patience , but only for a small subset of people who personally serve their agendas . it  s not a difference in opinion that separates you from most of them , it  s iq points !
