   (ID: ddbcd7b957a26c37891ce72069afaf688ba19977)

2. takei ' s exact quote was  " i take no solace or joy in this man ' s passing . we will not dance upon his grave , nor stand vigil at his funeral holding " god hates freds " signs , tempting as it may be . he was a tormented soul , who tormented so many . hate never wins out in the end . it instead goes always to its lonely , dusty end .

11. i love how every time this question comes up most of the answers are  i don  t hate kids , but .  . if you don  t hate kids , op wasn  t talking to you .
   (ID: 7cece6bbdf487f99b6d494ab790bde8e66ce8966)

12. it sounds pretty conflicted to me , it felt wrong to discuss your feminine side but equally you hated some masculine traits . right now that doesnt make you either or and thats okay if you can put your hatred for your male traits in context to feeling more feminine then potentially it might be some dysphoria , then again you might hate big feet because you can never buy the right shoes . i think you have some more self exploring to do , to see whether you are really comfortable with the idea of being feminine  female , when you do you will notice any big red giant flags saying " wrong " or maybe like me you will not .
