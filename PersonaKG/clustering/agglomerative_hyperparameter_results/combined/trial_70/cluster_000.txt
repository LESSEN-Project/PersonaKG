5. maybe his friends are just used to mockicking him and they do it rather jokingly . that ' s kind of insult  based friendship  relationship , commonly occur in real life . hiccup allows that because he is fine with it . if it comes to the villain , why wouldn ' t he try to insult him ? his aim was tomake hiccup lose his nerves , start acting impulsively and be easier to defeat . of course the more accurate and touchy the insult is , the better are the results but maybe grimmel couldn ' t come out with anything better as he never met hiccup in his live so he just reffered to his appearance . after all he ' s tights aren ' t very thicc .

16. basically , if he  s a changed man , why is he bringing this up now ? if he  s moved past this , why does he feel the need to express this ? being love and validated aren  t synonymous . you can love your pops , but think his actions are wrong . furthermore , people are in love with what they think liam is . who outside of his close friends and family really knows him . how many people loved kevin spacey before he was ousted ? i dont think you understand what i mean when i say he  s seeking validation . he wants people to say  yeah , i understand how you could have those thoughts  . that  s why it  s selfish , it  s self serving . he could have said ,  i was a racist who unjustly went around hunting people i knew nothing about hoping to kill them to satisfied my twisted definition of justice . instead he churched up the story to try and justify is actions . like i  ve said , if a white person raped his friend , would he have acted the same way ? i  m willing to wager he wouldn  t . we can be empathetic , we aren  t monsters , but we don  t have to validate it . these are the thoughts of a fucking racist .
