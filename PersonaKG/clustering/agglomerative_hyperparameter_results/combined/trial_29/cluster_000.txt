15. well , you didn ' t add a " serious " tag , but i ' ll give you a serious answer anyway . i ' ve done a fair amount of research on this . all adults   the ones with the money   hate school fundraisers . the idea that gives you the absolutely best return is this  you send a note home at the beginning of the year explaining that you know everyone hates school fundraisers , and you are therefore going to dispense with that nonsense and instead request " direct giving " include an envelope . ask parents to donate the amount of money they would otherwise be wasting on wrapping paper , cookie dough , and other crap they only buy to placate their children . you will end up with substantially more money than if you actually sold the wrapping paper or cookie dough . if you ' re dead set on holding a fundraiser , try the " original art " one . find a company that prints original art on random things mousepads , t  shirts , coffee mugs and does school fundraisers . they will provide your school with all the materials . each kid draws a picture and then goes around to family  friends and tries to get them to buy a mousepad  t  shirt  coffee cup featuring their original art . it ' s still a terrible idea , but at least you get something your kid made instead of some awful cookie dough .
   (ID: 54097549786e78808b0d9772bb36b401b5761588)

16. One of my favorite things is trees.

18. also , what language would you like the mewtwo to be ?
   (ID: c956c3bf88cce2d3de1fc9f4d4a6e7b082a20dbb)

19. it sounds cliche and like a instagram " quote " but being single is so much better than being in a relationship that ' s not healthy . you really have to see that you pretty much are in a relationship while you ' re technically single . that relationship is with yourself . that is the most important relationship you will ever have . no one else can " make " you happy . that ' s an internal job . everything else is just a bonus . good for you for leaving that behind .
   (ID: d785eda10245445843c3355a0710d262b0d65bb9)
