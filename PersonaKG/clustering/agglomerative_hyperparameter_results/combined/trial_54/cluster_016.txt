1. kid , expand your thinking . what would happen if everyone thought like you ? if banging chicks is the ultimate measure of success , we ' d probably go back to the time when sultans kept harems . women are humans , not trophies for you to ejaculate in .
   (ID: dfcca9c384a4fff7bbeb3cd1fb2f40aacb47fd7e)

2. well if i could choose which person was the target i wouldn ' t need to change anything cos they talk enough shit already
   (ID: f6b8978c4b660719e17dff38ba86c988b9bf86f5)

3. oh you used a big word ! was that hard ? is that why it took so long to type out ? you all wonder why woman don ' t even want to look in your direction , bold of you to call me stupid when you can ' t even understand how self destructive your life is . hating woman and then wondering why they don ' t like you back , crying about it to other basement dwellers like yourself . woman don ' t owe you shit and they never will .
   (ID: b6c3e540255084641f0e148a3992d9113c560f0b)

4. your argument in response to me yes , to you . you ' re literally the only one who read my posting that way . you are making a claim the charity isn ' t even making either , they never said anything about saving tax  payers money . people can demand anything , don ' t mean it ' s the right thing to do .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

5. what is the dumbest question ever asked on askreddit and it links me right here .
   (ID: b6567f005c34603036e6119544386ff4f12ec3a9)

6. if i didn ' t know any of them i walk right back out . not my business not my problem . if it ' s a girl i care about i ask what the fuck is going on . cousin or friend ? if she is cool with what ' s going on and doesn ' t seem drunk or drugged i leave . if this is happening against her will i pull a gun . everyone leaves or gets shot .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

7. quietly letting customers know they can save some money by paying me cash in hand rather than paying me the full quoted amount and receive a pointless invoice on their email . just occasionally , of course !
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

8. very understandable . it helps if you can sell eggs , grow some of what they eat , and use their litter productively , but those aren ' t realistic options for everyone .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

9. our commanders does the same thing and i understand why are they so pumped when giving out orders . if you are in the middle of a fight , he  she doesn ' t really have time to type out orders specially if the group was portal bombed . so at least the people in the channel gets the right instruction so that they could react appropriately . sometimes our guild run havoc groups when we don ' t feel like joining the zerg and i sometimes speak rapidly when we are in the middle of a scuffle . it ' s not much scolding but more of excitement specially if you can feel you can wipe the enemy zerg .
   (ID: 261413214c13676b8aee2ce20a47107c4ccfe6b8)

10. well . i ' m honestly more upset that instead of getting new movie trailers during movies biggest night of the year we get digit fucking walmart commercials . like seriously behind the scenes people can only effort walmart clothes ?
   (ID: 5ea29f01c8cdade4f178fd446d00647edc5fc70e)

11. you could have said " oh yeah , cool " . instead you got defensive and downvoted me . a fucktard says what ?
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

12. bring a bottle of water . drinking means you can ' t talk and have an excuse for not paying attention so much , and then you need to excuse yourself to the bathroom anyway .
   (ID: 009af0be6850d8d1ff9d388a3c7f39f0f7727594)

13. i often wonder what cashiers think of me based on the way i load the belt . do i look messy ? are they judging me based on my selections ? the pressure is intense .
   (ID: 5481b7a3276de2b79473c4a65d5bb2506e36d79d)

14. taste is subjective , but they still suck . i do , however find it amusing that dimebag darrel was into them , so nickelback later wrote a song about the on  stage murder of dimebag , titled " side of a bullet . " the band used one of dd ' s guitar solos in it and it fits so perfectly .
   (ID: 8b9c4341d896783998a7c3485fa949b3c63cbd73)

15. it may not apply to you my friend , and i can completely understand that . if you are digit pounds you are indeed fat . that is my point . would you like others to talk shit to you all day just because youre fat and would it motivate you ? i am quite sure that at some point it isn ' t funny really . and what applies for adam doesn ' t apply to pete or julie if you understand . it is all about being somewhat respectful as fat people deserve the same respect as normal people since how people look does not truly dictate how they are . many people are probably gonna disagree because mainly they lack understanding or are ignorant and uneducated . i am not a supporter of the fat acceptance community man , i am just here to spread something about treating others . sadly , many people are just downvoting my because they are arrogant and think they can just talk shit to fat people because it would help them lose weight but even studies and sports teachers  personal trainers suggestsit it will give an opposite effect .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

16. i ' m waiting for the part where it affects you , because right now you are being offended for someone else . and the reason it was in the title was because it was clearly a joke , something that isn ' t serious at all .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

17. if you know anything about post scarcity economics , you are both .
   (ID: 3e510494aac4d4cfd98d8ee4e7b04dffd5534bee)

18. what is affirmative action ? i don  t think that exists in my home country .
   (ID: 841a375b464a5650f1c027d1c7ae73415228c6ab)

19. let ' s see , shit job , shit pay , people think you ' re pigs . you also have to see shit that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life . and if you ' re a cop in the bad parts of the black community it could go worse from there . once again the police are human beings and when they deal with enough assholes they snap , just like any human would . yes there is a level of corruption in the system , but posts like this are so damn naive .
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

20. just give it back to them
