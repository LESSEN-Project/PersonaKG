7. i used to work as a gas agent , until medical meant i couldn ' t do it any more . one of the major aspects of my job was delivering 45kg bottles . this is less dangerous than most people think it is . i can even surmise , that the reason they are doing this , is that there is not enough pressure in the gas bottle for it to run . there are two ways to add pressure . direct heat . or compressed air . direct heat is the less likely to kill you option of those two . the real question is whether they have the taps open or not . if they dont , the pressure release valve will pop and then that gas will ignite and basically create a flamethrower .

   (ID: fdf9c56e21cf61fb3b2852da66f6506ce908651c)

13. oh for sure , rote learning has its merits , but i think it ' s devalued when there is very little opportunity to experiment with and apply the " internalized " subject matter . being able to spew out chemical reaction calculations but never getting to see a condensate form in a beaker is pretty short  sighted . being able to recite the party  approved and mandated history of the world , word  for  word as written in the vetted text  book , and then think hitler was admirable , is also another troubling one . and the one that i see a lot   being able to write sentence after sentence of grammatically perfect , decontextualized " present perfect progressive " and then not being able to use it accurately where it would naturally occur in conversation or discourse .
   (ID: 5b02e2fd29e743c4c80de2b0919a03d95400c23a)

14. i understand that it helps you feel better , and that staying away from it is stressful , and that there ' s so way for me or anyone from this community to make you stop , but even though i don ' t know you , i want you to be safe , i hope that you ' re able to pass that digit day mark of no sh one day , i believe in you .
   (ID: feb4a6aeed8e7e14b0592329bd91d7933a93217e)

15. it takes over literally every aspect of your life . everything . it gets to a point where you literally have to put yourself before anything else . it can seem narcissistic to people who don  t know what you  re going through , but when it comes between wanting to blow your brains out and everything else , it  s an easy choice . hopefully

17. well , a classmate of mine has the same birthday . i always tell her it can ' t just be a coincidence that digit tyrants were born on the same day .
   (ID: b5bfc53fa7245451bad229f942e351fdc7360321)

18. i mean people sometimes name their kids after traits or values , like charity and patience , so it ' s not totally implausible that someone might use celibate . i personally wouldn ' t . a couple of google searches seem to suggest that this is not a thing .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)
