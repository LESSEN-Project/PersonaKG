6. that sounds rather tricky , because ultimatley i would think your not going to want lots of male muscle in the long run , you ' ll need a certain amount of fat to your shape . at the moment im 176lb ' s with a fairly feminine frame but im working out a lot . im trying very hard not to build too much muscle and just tone up . i dont want my biceps or calfs to get any bigger for example . i could be totally wrong but i would think you need to gain some fat , but keep working out while putting the weight on to keep it under control . if you suddenly put on 20ib worth of muscle you going to look far more masculine .

12. why does what you do in your free time have any bearing on what you do at work ? in your mind , is it impossible for someone who likes to get high to refrain from doing so at work ? if you drink beer or alcohol , how is that any different ? should having a beer at home disqualify you from driving a forklift at work the next day ? these are genuine questions .

15. i think you might find your answer by typing " digit thing worth living for purposeful " in google . if you can arrive at that intersection despite your school grades , whatever you think will destroy your soul  then i ' m confident that you are on the right pathway .
   (ID: eca32d278abf2524af02edbb3cc3041ed8b0b880)

16. oh boy lol . i don ' t fly anymore , but no i wouldn ' t ever fly under the influence of anything , even cough medicine . it would be very irresponsible for people to fly while stoned or under the influence of any substance . the reasoning is pretty obvious . you misunderstood my statement about employees . of course they should be working sober . what they do in their personal time is really none of my business although i mostly employ writers who work from home so i don ' t really care as long as their work is to my liking . my point was , if they are going to use a mind altering substance after work , i ' d rather they just smoke weed instead of drink . weed doesn ' t cause hangovers during work hours . i ' m not advocating people get stoned or drunk during working hours . you are just buying into the narrative , that ' s my point . you have these stereotypes about pot smokers that just aren ' t true , but you are still perpetuating them with zero basis in fact . there are plenty of motivated and successful people who smoke pot during their personal time .
