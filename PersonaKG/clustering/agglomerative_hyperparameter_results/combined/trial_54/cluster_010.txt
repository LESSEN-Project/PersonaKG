   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

2. did you ever talk about it ? with someone close or a professional ? i mean i was in an abusive relation once , took me a couple of years to get over the most troublesome aspects mostly because i acted like i was ok . but i ' m in a happy relation now . i ' ve just been really open about it with my partner and she knows that there are things that trigger me . she tries to help me with it . it ' s nice to have a partner .

4. parents should never love their child or anyone else ' s any less , simply because that child is gay . it saddens me to think of your struggle . i come from a conservative family , and was raised very much anti  gay , but you know what ? when i grew up , and learned to think on my own , i realized that the bigots are the true evil in this world . i told each of my children that if i ever found out they were gay , that i would be digit  cool with it . as a parent myself , let me tell you that you need nobody ' s approval to be who you are .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

7. i ' ve got scars all across my face and the best course of action is just not giving a single heckin fuck . nobody does , so why should i ? don ' t do it again . there are other , healthier ways , and everyone has one to blow some steam off , while also not being a comfort zone . best of luck uwu

   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

13. same . i know i ' m just doing it because i really want some sort of human interaction but given my current mood i don ' t want it to be with my real friends or , you know , anyone i might ever have to look in the eye again .
   (ID: 34de9309a5c02867b676757fa019c58a66bad300)

14. unless he ' s talking to this girl now i don ' t see what the problem is . nobody ever really " tells their partner everything " about their past yet everything thinks " but were different " . try to develop a little tougher skin cause if something like this is bothering you , you ' re gonna be a nervous wreck by the time you reach your first anniversary .
   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

15. well like i said , you and your circumstances . d ' you think if nothing happens tonight you ' re gonna feel less shitty tomorrow ? i hear you , i once had a casual hookup happen pretty much directly after a breakup . fun at the time but i didn ' t feel great about it afterward , but then that ' s just me . you know yourself better than i do and you seem like a person of conscience . i think you ' ll do what ' s gonna make you happiest .
   (ID: 72155748e939f50a6f3bde77aee5ae7b7c499725)

16. actually , i think its your lover who ' s leaking . keep that off the carpet , would you ?
   (ID: 20b71c431f98b1f88ec1b3e7ada79d31df65a8c2)

17. if you ' re doing it once a week , that ' s a habbit in it of it ' s own . now i don ' t know how it will affect your brain . i would just warn you about addiction . it ' s a slippery slope .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

18. in your case i would suggest not seeking someone specifically for a sm relationship . find someone you like and that you  re otherwise compatible . worry about the more adventurous sexual activities after you  ve been in a relationship for awhile and established that trust which is essential as you point out .
   (ID: 0d77404b10744947bcd2c91d8c926021d4b8650f)

19. jerry ? is that some kind of slang for moon  sex or something ? can you use it in a sentence ? is it " i ' ll do you in the jerry " or " turn around and let ' s jerry " or what ?
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

20. " riley " i ' m sorry your day turned to shit . the crappy thing about fear is that it isn ' t always rational and when caught off guard it is difficult to act rationally anyway . i had a similar experience a few years ago which helped me decide i was buying a car so i didn ' t have to wait at bus stops and i have the guy half of my land line number and the other half of my cell . to this day i wonder why i didn ' t just say no . or maybe i did and he insisted . i cast it as a lesson learned for the future . sadly he got on the same bus as me and i got got off and doubled back to another route .
