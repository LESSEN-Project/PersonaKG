5. I have a wife.
   (ID: b5e15026c378d181e66e2b38bfc245705510a727)

6. being a male i ' ve never had a period so i honestly feel it would be pretty disrespectful to voice that sort of opinion towards any female as i haven ' t experienced it myself . it ' s like someone painting a wall and somebody else comes up and says your taking a long time . how do they know what it ' s like or the problems that can arise if they haven ' t got any experience of what i ' m doing ? i choose just to be supportive .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

9. I live in shaq era.
   (ID: 4654e3a9a75835f9ff28170ddf31d5d3cf296ea2)

10. i play online vs exclusively . i ' m not saying this to piss you off , but i can poke check and stick lift all day long and hardly ever get a penalty . my poke checking could arguably be considered poke spamming i do it so much . it ' s all about proper positioning and timing for those poke checks , and never poke from behind . as far as stick lifts , they work very well during puck battles , especially along the boards . if your opponent gets possession , lift that shit right away you have to be fast and it ' ll almost always come loose and back to you . i ' m not saying it ' s perfect far from it , but if you ' re getting penalties on poke checks and stick lifts either your timing or positioning is off . go ahead and downvote me if you want , but i hardly ever get penalties for pokes and lifts . almost all my penalties are checks into the boards that ea will randomly call boarding or charging .
   (ID: 7c5209c3b827e0de0cd436466f80ce09b615606b)

11. thats cool . it does really depend on the girl . i think we all probably have little things we like  dislike about women . its not that one is right or wrong . for example i like it when i can see the impression of a girls ribs some people would say the idol os anorexic or too skinny but i like it for some reason
   (ID: 4679181760b739d302b80a7e08480575bf4d30bc)

14. One of my favorite things is chips.
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

15. i cut off reading when you said they shit in the pool then your partner eventually joins in being disrespectful towards you . alarm bells . not so much that your considering moving in but the fact that your still with him ? you should never , ever spend your time with someone who disrespects you . i ' ll be honest i ' ve done a lot of drugs in my younger years but i was still respectful and if i even attempted to shit in a pool i would probably be spoken to by my friends . it ' s not the drugs it ' s the company he keeps . and by the sounds of it him . do you honestly think he ' s going to change ? nope . do you need to move out ? yes move in with him ? i definitely wouldn ' t and i would probably leave him
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

16. One of my favorite things is squirtle.
   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

17. i ' m straight and was just wired that way . if you think sexual preference comes down to a choice , and assuming you ' re straight , when was the exact moment you chose to be straight ? what makes you think it ' s any different for homosexual people ? more importantly , why does it even matter and what will intolerance gain you ? it took me a long time to realize this way of looking at it and become more tolerant in my life , but i got there .
   (ID: 725e5a3de682f359cfb87481ec457a2f78867ef3)
