1. that ' s why i challenged him on it . i ' ve never heard it myself , but i feel like every musical niche is fulfilled by someone somewhere . i guess it doesn ' t even have to be popular , i just want to hear an example regardless !
   (ID: 3994e1d32967dee02bf170d70c0ccc2d7dbd99d5)

2. movies is a circlejerk , that ' s why i ' ve lurked movie discussion threads and noticed that comments deviating from the prevailing opinion will get downvoted , even if they are backed up with reasoning , whereas comments like " whoever dislikes this movie is a hater " will get upvoted if the movie is well  liked by the sub .

4. haha if you have not seen love death  robots on netflix this probably seems kinda crazy , but it ' s just a description of one of the episodes that i immediately thought of when reading the title .
   (ID: ecc98de1e575d7e863a2124b364b8ed586778ba5)

5. i sampled 1st chapter and part of the second . there are hints of effective altruism , but not much . also , this taylor is stupidly straightforward . one would think that utmost priority for a parahuman whose power stops working when she is seen would be ways to prevent being seen . the obvious idea is making a lot of smoke bombs , making suit out of them , igniting them all . if someone sees you , you turn into smoke  spewing teenager . as soon as smoke obscures you , you gain your powers back . once smoke dissipates , you turn into smoke machine again . that ' s the idea i got by thinking about cheats for a minute . taylor who lives this , whose life and death depends on it , would think of a hundred more cheats . she did not . i am disappointed . also , i feel compelled to ask the questions  spoilers about ending of worm  s " can taylor win ? if yes  why did simurgh choose this timeline ? why didn ' t contessa involve taylor in her path to victory right away "
   (ID: fae28587bce17296589bf92d656ad68ee32601d6)

6. you have one of the most incoherent ensembles i ' ve ever seen . gun , clothes , everything . and i like that a lot .

7. as someone who took took art way back in high school , i totally agree ! after looking closely at the painting i  ve concluded that the painter some sort of lipid .

8. yta you don  t have to be a dick about things and from what i  ve seen in this thread i feel sorry for the girl i would if said nta but from how far up your arse you  ve been on this thread i doubt her work was that poor quality
   (ID: 77ab4860c32a7084ca81fd91302df6690ce56731)

9. how have you ' s never heard of the term chook  s ?

11. i  m digit so i  ve seen some great usc and some rougher usc so i can agree with you there . however , i can  t say that my falcons allegiance has built more character than it has broken and hope of ever holding a lead in any sport ever .

13. hmm . interesting . seinfeld saved bee movie for me . if i hadn ' t been a lifelong fan of seinfeld i probably would have seen how bad that movie was . instead i could laugh at the jokes because they reminded me of the show just enough .
   (ID: 238107f17ccd21a5cb87efbd00d55a861389ba26)

14. i ' ve seen this happen . the administrators will spew bullshit like " ohh it ' s out of our power " or " ohh that ' s so and so ' s responsibility we don ' t do so and so ' s job " they come across as the victim and then go onto the news and play the " we strive to protect and maintain a safe school environment " fucking bullshit . not just preschools and elementary schools . high schools and middle schools too . i ' ve seen a staff member say and i quote " well if he ' s off school grounds i won ' t report it " over a kid that got jumped and put into the hospital . the reality is that most not all school administrators don ' t give a shit about anything but their paycheck . and if they do care about something . it ' s most likely having power over a group of minors and being able to boss them around and berate them without consequence . sorry for the rant but i had to get that off my chest .   x200b  source  high school student

   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

16. that ' s probably not google . from what i understand google will start in salt lake city proper first , then west valley . i haven ' t seen anything that says there are plans to go anywhere else yet . my whole neighborhood is having fiber laid right now . i asked a worker and he said it was utopia . i wish it was google , but i ' ll take utopia !
   (ID: 22a043d8284bd8c7c31748b5cc8c8b8efc757df6)

17. that actually helps me more than you might think , its been eating at me because even though i have friends who cut i ' ve never met someone else who does this , so just knowing there ' s someone else helps .

18. if you want a super good snare it ' s here . marshmello isn ' t very well known but he made what is in my opinion the best edm snare i ' ve ever heard marshmello  know me

20. interesting . i personally wouldn ' t do it because of my flat feet , but i ' ve seen people do it before , so i guess there is something to be said about it . what made you decide to go barefoot though ? also , how do you handle cold weather , especially cold winters ?
