4. so i had this old woman call me multiple times . a google on her number said that she was a couple towns over . i never answered the calls but she would always leave a voicemail . they all started like this .  joey , i was just calling you to tell .  and throughout the history of the phone calls i started to learn about joey  s life and the lady  s family . joey was the woman  s grandson and he was a lawyer . he met a girl during his practices and his grandmother congratulated him on it saying that she found out because his brother told her . a couple phone calls later i found out things didn  t work out between joey and this girl . sometimes the lady would call just to talk . i almost answered one time because i felt that she lived alone . i eventually changed my voice mail box from the default one to a custom answer . i specifically stated that this is not joey in the custom answer . after that day i stopped receiving voicemails . looking back on it now , i wonder what  s happened to that woman and what happened to joey . i hope she is no longer lonely and i hope joey found love . i  m gonna miss her .

5. i know what it is . it aligns with that by which i put my hope and faith into , humanity . that and i hold no reservation for superstition or a " higher " power .
   (ID: b5153b16e61f6bc5e4bf4d8db479b7093df1ae26)

6. oh i can help with this , too !  the joke is that usually people say  until i reached the age of digit  or whatever . so george carlin is setting up the expectation of a simple statement i was catholic until this particular age but then changes it to suggest that reasonable people aren  t catholic . the surprising change of direction , combined with the implication about catholicism , make this a joke instead of a simple statement . i hope that  s helpful !
   (ID: 9414b9913220ebe2601862e3001aac74ebcffe33)

7. i hope this doesn  t come across as rude but nobody here can give responsible medical advice and this is a sub for cancer patients , caregivers , and relatives . you should see your doctor with any questions  concerns . this may be a better question for askdoctors or healthanxiety . best of luck to you .
   (ID: b40d1d3ae1e77bcbdcb98e62deea24396d4b4d40)

8. i  m wondering the same thing ! i see some on the website but not all of them , they could be previous colors that aren  t offered anymore though ? hope someone will chime in on this ! this is what i found on their site  fendi 33cm
   (ID: 8d5aac58a9c3a7e883f9e90df39dc5ab7c36de53)

9. i hope you  re doing okay . i am now in your shoes , and it sucks . one of my best friends killed himself digit days ago . when all of our friends are together it isn  t so bad , but when i  m alone all i can do is look at pictures of him and think about it .
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

10. it was on reddit and someone said to some innocuous comment i wrote ,  i hope you die .  i could not see anything offensive or rude or even that opinionated in my comment . so i didn  t care . if anything it helped me . that comment reminded me that i shouldn  t take anything online to heart . if i offended or upset someone i would not like that  and i would apologise but if someone just wants to be a rude little fucker it has no impact on me .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

11. good for you . hope you get asked to work there .

14. you ' re not a failure because you had a panic attack . you didn ' t choose to , you didn ' t want it , we can ' t blame ourselves for things out of our control . i hope you win your fight .
   (ID: 68d36e5b5d26327bbb5de8de16430cc93353cbf0)

15. sleep with every men she is sleeping to tell her who is boss . i hope this is just a hypothetical situation rather than a real situation
   (ID: f4f004d4cf95fb0021d8bdc10767d5f3e74d3bc9)

16. wtf i was digit and at the begining of my studies , and i wanted to finish it . how can you when you ' re pregnant ? and when you have a baby , without a job ? what a good life for a child . also he wasn ' t my boyfriend anymore when i moved . and he didn ' t want to have a baby either . i didn ' t killed it , it wasn ' t a baby at this stage of pregnancy . now i am in a great school and i have a job and a real boyfriend , we ' ll probably have a child after the end of our studies and i hope to give to this child the life he ' ll deserve .
   (ID: 862cb85d93fa9b931c3c64cf2fd17ef592d48c50)

17. that ' s understandable , i ' m sure the pain and study are more than hard enough to deal with without him making matters worse for you . i hope you can see someone helpful soon !
   (ID: 8b7590cb8502d6abd38b320b842aa7642186b6d8)

18. aw , that ' s the same pattern as my region . i was hoping for something exotic haha . in that case , how about your luxury bulbasaur instead ? i hope you can find something of equal value for it .

19. religion will always be relevant no matter how smart we become or how advanced our science and technology become because that doesn ' t matter to people who turn to religion as a moral compass . religion provides some sort of hope for those living in hard times as well . obviously , large portions of mainstream religions today are pretty fucked up , but religion changes . so that ' s my answer without resorting to reddit sarcasm and typical " hurr durr religioius people stupid " answers . i ' m not religious , btw
