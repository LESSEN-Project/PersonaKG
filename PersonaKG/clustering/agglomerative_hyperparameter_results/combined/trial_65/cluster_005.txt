1. my kids . made me think how devastated they would be without me .
   (ID: aaee7c28c6f1f83a427cf3dccf635bb78656a19d)

2. this question just made me think of the movie sleepwalkers .
   (ID: dbef825d92ac68d9f1c82f424ece80adbf736aeb)

3. maybe . it depends on the response of the members . what do you think ?
   (ID: ac53f9ce173965984299f3686335a39bc2a5810f)

4. i think the proper analogy would be  a person who does not post  leave home won ' t get banned  mugged . the more often you ' re outside  you post , the more chances there are that you will be considered a mark  offend a mod . the more often you go to dark alleys  sb and sv , there more you risk , as the muggers  mods are more vicious there . one can give the mugger his valuables when confronted  be civil , follow the rules , and take his lumps when he and the mods don ' t agree , and then he probably wont be beaten up  banned .   x200b  see ? i too can make up loaded analogies .   x200b  i insist that " zoat asshole , zoat hissy fit " is a childishly simplistic view of the situation . to me it looks like  zoat is more active , so is at higher risk of ban all else being equal  zoat is a bit abrasive , so this also contributes to conflicts that may occur  sv and sb mods are power tripping , sb mods more than sv ones  you seem to think zoat is in the wrong and behaves childishly , completely disregarding that mods can also power trip and behave childishly .   x200b  also , at which odds are you ready to take a bet that zoat will receive next ban before eaglejarl does ? digit  digit ? digit  digit ?

6. they are a bit more athletic than lions , its true but do you think being a king is always a matter of who beats who ? tigers dont have any instinct to rule others i suppose
   (ID: 73cbf17c3a84102fdc5b18efc6bc4cacd841961c)

   (ID: 480e1d5457cca32a54c00398823abca7aae20b86)
