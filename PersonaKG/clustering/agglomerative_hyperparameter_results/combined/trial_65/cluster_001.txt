15. yes she is very close to her stepmother . you asked about our relationship , we have been in a de facto relationship for about digit . digit years now . i have been doing what i can to comfort her and be there for her . i took her out to lunch today i actually wrote this post on the drive home to take her mind off of things and get out of the house . at the moment she is ok then bursts into tears at random times so all i can do is hug her , tell her i love her and let her cry it out . when she was told she cried and then asked to be left alone for a while so if she needs some space i think she will tell me . thank you for the advice , there is a lot there to take in so i will have to read it a few times . her stepmother still might pull through and beat it , but all we can do at this stage is hope for the best . thank you again for helping me understand and giving me pointers on how to approach this .
