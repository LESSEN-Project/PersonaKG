16. i sampled 1st chapter and part of the second . there are hints of effective altruism , but not much . also , this taylor is stupidly straightforward . one would think that utmost priority for a parahuman whose power stops working when she is seen would be ways to prevent being seen . the obvious idea is making a lot of smoke bombs , making suit out of them , igniting them all . if someone sees you , you turn into smoke  spewing teenager . as soon as smoke obscures you , you gain your powers back . once smoke dissipates , you turn into smoke machine again . that ' s the idea i got by thinking about cheats for a minute . taylor who lives this , whose life and death depends on it , would think of a hundred more cheats . she did not . i am disappointed . also , i feel compelled to ask the questions  spoilers about ending of worm  s " can taylor win ? if yes  why did simurgh choose this timeline ? why didn ' t contessa involve taylor in her path to victory right away "
