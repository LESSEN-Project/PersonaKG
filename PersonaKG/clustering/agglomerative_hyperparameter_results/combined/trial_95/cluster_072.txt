2. i was nearly going to leave my comment as " other than that " but i added " one event " to try and stop this sort of response coming . in no way am i saying that winning a major isn ' t much to do in a year all i ' m saying is to say he didn ' t have the best digit isn ' t wrong just because he got that event win .
   (ID: a69486a9dd78d1ba9533599ba57eac9079ca3c8d)

3. lol , tldr . jk in reality the series went longer than he intended but i thought he addressed the issues he had ideas of where the story was going to go when he started working on naruto ' s teen years . yeah there are issues people arent going to agree with due to the fact most other manga artists outside of big series like dbz , one piece , bleach , etc . will have side stories or spin offs to cover small story holes , like how we dont know much about the other clans , or other ninja ' s development . the bs called itachi died choking on his own blood then slamming full face into the wall seriously we still dont know what killed him i ' m assuming its to escape a secret marriage . so no no series needs a reboot the artists decided this is the path i want , and if he wants to deal with any plot holes or missing information or lack of its up to the creator . like chpter digit . digit the special comic he drew for a convention to show kakashi ' s face cause he got tired of people asking about it . another thing i want to address is fan envy or fan dissapointment , its not the ending was bad its that the story was great , its very difficult to make a ending for something epic . i mean write a great digit page paper the whole body is awsome sauce , but your conclusion paragraph , your closing statement is the hardest one . no one is ever satisfied with a conclusion of a series , and almost digit  of the endings of manga i have read are not satisfying because the manga was so good . hitman reborn is a example i liked the manga , the whole time thing and the build up of the final arc was iffy , but the ending was everyones happy yipee the end , there was no satisfying hey his dreams came true , no the author leaves the ending to be open for fans maybe , to leave it to your imagination . my tldr if you want to skip to this  so shut up and enjoy naruto for what it is because this guy worked digit years on this on top of other shit and manga he has to work on . so appreciate the fact that people like the manga and he appreciates the love to give back the best he can do .

4. yeah , they do those things intentionally . in ragnarok , there are scenes in the trailer where thor has two eyes , but in the movie he has one . the trailers for iw also show thanos with only two stones in every scene , even if he has more in many of them . i actually really appreciate the effort they go to not to spoil anything .

5. it ' s ok you can ' t give digit btc but digit doge is pretty good
   (ID: ff36137e68382d33016fdf568208704ea2c16642)

6. would you believe me that this is as cheap as a metal deck can get . i would avoid crafting this because more decks are building around aggro but if you still want to you can get away with not including level up and maybe throw in some pirates or murlocs ?
   (ID: 2dcd820eac167adf18c6706f1c0a26a39eb945be)

7. no , not at all . also  professor hulk uses starks version of the infinity gauntlet to bring everyone back , captain america uses mjolnir to fight thanos , captain america finally says avengers assemble , and the combined avengers defeat thanos and his army . also , stark hugs peter when he sees him alive for the first time and peter says " huh , this is nice " . we even get a scene during the time travel sequence where the future captain america fights the past captain america . the captain america from the past says " i can do this all day " and the future captain america says " i know " .

9. they own the domain what right do you have to take it from them for less than what they want for it ? how you answer this is very important . choose poorly and i will write you off , choose wisely and i will have to side with you . there is not an in between at this stage in the conversation for my opinion of you and your argument . owning several domain names and have so so mediocre success digit , digit unique visitors a site per month with my sites i do understand . i also understand that you may want bigbootybitches . com and wont settle for bigbootybitches . us or . net or . what the hell ever . just because you want something doesn ' t mean you have a moral right to it . i think the ultimate argument i am trying to make is that just because you don ' t like something or it doesn ' t go your way doesn ' t make it morally or legally wrong . you seem to be trying to make a rational argument based on feelings . fyi that never works . but i could be wrong with what you are trying to accomplish .

10. the original question  my replies  you ' ve not seen infinity war ?

11. I live in colour tv.
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

12. i know and i agree with your point but i feel like they should not straight up tell us that i think they should maybe hint it or yust let the characters say it in some scenario
   (ID: c863a7172df41853f354be7adff4b3f9a0cb9736)

13. what do you think elon  s been working on this whole time !

14. we also have these jokes , but nobody realy cares about your haircolor .

15. that moment when your lightbulb goes " ding " we were all there at some point . i think i was right around digit cp as well of course back then cp was a lot harder to get . now that you are a bit enlightened , you will learn more and more everyday and see things that maybe you should have started about a month or two ago . i found it best to try everything on my first character , all digit classes can efficiently use stamina or magicka as the main resource , so why not max as many skill lines as you can .

16. doesn ' t it bug you that hyderabad does not have imax any more ? i am going to different city to watch this movie .

17. the only really valuable mew card is mew gold star , and even then that ' s only around  digit . no idea what you ' re thinking of

18. i agree , they were quite trigger shy about embracing some of the more overt comic conventions that they believed wouldn ' t translate well to live action .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

19. except that the kobayashi character was there at the end after verbal had told his story . yeah , but this ties in with the reveal , in my view . at the end , we see shots of all the things that " verbal " used to improvise his story like the kobayashi name on the cup , so when we actually see " kobayashi " in the car at the end , it doesn ' t confirm the story as much as it just shows one more element in this case the physical appearance of " kobayashi " that verbal had used to spin his yarn .  you think he made up the new york ' s finest taxi service story ? the high profile media circus that it entailed ? you think he made up saul berg ? you think he made up the five of them being in a line  up ? you think he made up the explosion of a ship ? well , no , i don ' t . i mean , it ' s not so much about what i think , but more about what the movie actually gives us . it gives us a narrator who , at the very end , turns out to be liar of epic proportions . you say there ' s nothing to suggest that verbal ' s story was false , but the way i see it , there ' s nothing to suggest that anything other than the events that could be corroborated by evidence or independent witnesses has actually transpired the way verbal describes it . as i said earlier , it seems completely implausible for that character to be telling the truth in that situation . he has no reason not to lie and we ' re shown evidence that elements of his story were undoubtedly fabricated , so we ' re left with nothing to base the assumption on that verbal ' s story was anything more than a tall tale .

20. with a few exceptions tv has sucked for many years now . the so called " reality " shows are not even close to being real , the so called " talent " shows suck buffalo assholes . radio is just as bad and there are so many fucking commercials it ' s unlistenable .
