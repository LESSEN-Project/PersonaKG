   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

2. i don ' t really think you can call it the type of thing that " just happens "
   (ID: 5218a6fd3b7d990775fbaa39249c20beea16f741)

3. i agree , but according to the avengers and rest marvel universe tesseract is the major source of energy with theoretically zero point extraction and helps converting energy into usable form and what they show is just a cube which just glows . invention of this tesseract by noble warrior heroes made marvel possible to create marvel universe . don ' t you think that marvel can do little better on what their stories are completely based on . or they could have chosen some different name . it ' s just my opinion , as a marvel fan , i just felt bad as the whole thing is just a fictionalizedand becoming super heroes is not possible yet . but creating an actual tesseract can help marvel to build other stories and which can also justifies current marvel movies . which can be a win  win  win !
   (ID: 498ec9e13eaa203d64a9b79260e2285867993564)

4. sometimes the us title will contain a word offensive in other english speaking countries . example  an old jimmy stewart movie " hallelujah , i ' m a bum " was retitled " hallelujah , i ' m a tramp " in the uk in the us " bum " is a derogatory word for a homeless person , in the uk it ' s a coarse word for your backside
   (ID: f024c8cde5b36a880df271cca31792d32264df2c)

5. nothing made sense before . started just going with science and wow amazing things actually make sense .  . i  m so mad at myself for forcing myself to belief in that shit for the first digit years of my life . now i  m digit and living freely and happily . i don  t have to ask religious family members questions like  but . how is that possible ? where is heaven ? if it  s in the sky why can  t we see it ?  only to be faced with responses like  because that  s just how it is .  when i ask questions about science i always get met with a satisfying response that makes sense and helps me better understand the world .
   (ID: 9d6763f3caa1ca2559f1a3c525c70ffea81a61c2)

6. i think that either extreme , in religion or atheism , is bad . extreme religious beliefs hinder the pursuit of knowledge and turn a blind eye to reason and often disrespects individuals based on their actions or beliefs . extreme atheism is at its worst arrogant because some claim to be able to know for a fact that there is no god when the truth of the matter is that no one can know for certain , as far as we know we can only guess . i have many level  headed atheist friends who have what i consider a reasonable take on god and religion , which involves denouncing the " god " that various religions prop up as the focus of their beliefs based on the idea that these are human  made representations originating out of fear , too often used as a means to control people . i also agree with them in their approach to people of faith , which is to respect their opinions and them as individuals and not harangue them about whatever they may choose to believe in , so long as said faith is not imposed upon them . no one can crawl into the brain of another individual and see the world through their eyes , with the entire backdrop of their life experience , their passion , their motivations , all that has influenced their viewpoint from their entry into this life . thus , respect is paramount , because like humanity ' s quest to learn about the why of the universe , beyond the how , no one can know every single iota and therefore would be presumptuous to judge someone based on a simple statement like " i believe " or " i don ' t believe " or " i ' m somewhere in between .
   (ID: dc123ff47fa4f2e85bbecd444342fe7d8fcb7db5)

7. that is for sure a interesting question i like to get answewd too . someone here can explain ?

   (ID: 3fb5cf32d13620677a9e3d9bd2657b8432abf31f)

11. i mean hey , different people , different opinions . i ' m not taking that away from you . i don ' t wanna force my opinions and ideas down on people that do not show signs of wanting to .
   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)

12. no , it doesn  t . but if they  re going to do it anyway to make themselves feel better , i wish they  d wipe down the fucking seat after causing the kind of grossness they  re afraid of , but isn  t there on a dry seat .
   (ID: 3f4f5511095f668b3c84312b8bfeb87b30dd8f03)

13. hate to let you know this but , it could possibly be a lot of filler in the chicken . you can buy chicken that has been mashed up , mixed with filler then shaped again like chicken breast . some restaurants buy this because it ' s cheaper , subway for example uses this type of weird chicken breast .
   (ID: 9ec4f8c81572a0a43c8d624fb459f565cd019aad)

14. then why didn ' t he make it a commandment ? i don ' t even believe in him so why should i care what he thinks ?
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

15. how can a person disagree with something they think is correct ?
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

16. i ' m a laid back atheist . you can believe in anything you want , but the second you question my beliefs or start a debate with me  watch the fuck out . not saying i ' m going to be an aggressive douche bag , but i will point out every flaw in your belief system . and by atheists that don ' t give a fuck , you mean what ?
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

17. why are you dodging the question ? do you believe dinosaurs existed ? it  s a yes or no question lol

18. i don ' t think you know what i mean . we can eliminate jesus being a human . therefore he is a alien
   (ID: 93e92e6a7d8e94b12bcd450fad136ec14436f359)
