1. lol . who ' s trying to save face . my original post was not meant to be taken seriously . other people understood that , or were less inclined to jump into a discussion with the " i know something about something obvious to anyone with a high school education   so let me ' correct ' you " vibe we all love so much around here . you also clearly didn ' t read the thread .
   (ID: 17b8a304069d7530607e28f8e04d840e28be0d3e)

2. i don ' t know what i said to deserve that random insult , but . you are right . your father was certainly a better person than i could ever dream of being  i ' m not a good person at all . and i ' ll prove it by saying that when some dusty cunt on reddit insults me for no reason , i insult her back for the same reason . so here goes  " better person than you could dream of being . " i know , but how does he feel about you ? that question compels us towards a bit of a paradox . on the one hand , he might be troubled that the apple fell so far from the tree  and even upset with himself for producing such rotten , mealy fruit . on the other hand , he being such a wonderful person might be gracious even in the face of such a colossal disappointment . so . since dick was a better person than i could ever dream of being , tell me , how did he cope with you being so terrible ? interesting to consider . which was it ? was he ashamed , or proud despite himself ? how did he reconcile his supreme goodness with the profound wretchedness of his daughter ? i suppose i ' m being a bit of a dick now , aren ' t i . but not the kind of dick you like ? i ' m certain by now you think i ' m a real asshole dick cunt . even if you wont say it . and i ' m also certain you aren ' t so bad as i made you out to be . probably , your dad wasn ' t ashamed of you . probably he was proud . probably he thought you were a great person as great as you thought he was . he knew you well . but i don ' t know you at all . all i ' ve got to go with is you randomly picking fights on reddit and telling me unprovoked that i ' m simply awful . that ' s not a good look . it ' s the kind of behavior i see from trump supporters and internet trolls . you don ' t seem like a troll so i ' m gonna go out on a limb and say you are probably the former . don ' t go searching for my blog if this post offended you . chances are you ' ll find more stuff there to prove that i ' m just the worst . for one , i posted about how trump is garbage . watchout ! i might have even called him a dick . uh oh .   x200b
   (ID: 67d52400bddd68c40eba2a37485eecb683846877)

3. what  s a niggoo ?
   (ID: dd0e84182036131d3b7cbc9bcb07384502b3c1a8)

4. or the good ol ' " how much do you charge for a pair of glasses " god i hate that one .
   (ID: 4d17a8a4d7907bba6d158e8a0b9c3504d69be003)

5. the main flaw i see with many answers is threefold . negotiating will be difficult when you don  t know the language . even shakespearean english could be a rough adjustment . depending on whom you are negotiating with , they may just take it . and , if you bring back something that appears too shocking , threatening or evil , you might meet your maker rather quickly .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

6. because you can get back at those who hate you and think you won ' t amount to anything by living to see them grow old and whither and die while you laugh in their faces living a happy life while the only thing that made them happy was ruining the life of others . and you can and do attribute to society . whether you ' re following the status quo or trying to change it or even actively go against it no matter what you are contributing . culture doesn ' t change without someone changing it . if martin luther king jr didn ' t exist there ' s a large chance that there would be even more racism thrown towards the african american people . if shows like ru pauls drag race or queen eye not exist the lgbt community wouldn ' t get the recognition respect and love it deserves . you could be the next world changer . and if you aren ' t there ' s nothing wrong with that . not everyone can be as influential as that . but , even if you arent you can still get back at those empty terrible people with no one to love and no one who loves them by living better and being happy . it might take a lot it might take a while and it will most likely be hard but wouldn ' t it be worth it to see them look at you happy and healthy while they wallow in their own sadness to the point of having to take it out on others ? their words and actions and feelings may hurt you to the enth degree and there will always be more people like that who do those kinds of terrible cowardly things but the best way to get back at them is to not become what they think you will . you can do it . i believe in you . the human will can do so much more than you think and i know you can get put of this hole that they ' ve thrown you in and look at them triumphantly as you stand atop th mound of dirt they dug . i know you can do it . everyone can no matter how feeble or weak thy think themselves to be , everyone has the strength to climb out of their hole . especially you . good luck in your journey op .

11. it ' s sad that because of my name everyone thinks that i ' m just a stupid person that is going to argue that communism is the greatest ideology in the world . but if you think that it ' s okay people have their own opinions . it ' s funny how you think that i didn ' t read the question but it ' s fine i guess . you can call me commie and tell me to fuck off if you wish . if that makes your day better
   (ID: be642743472cdef9445edc6dd55beb3c2a8a1258)

12. also none of those are questions . again  go to school . another thing  how many times did you look that one over ? how long did it take you to make sure you didn ' t make a mistake ? even though you still did .
   (ID: 3158d7c63f10e871a80f147fb47725c8714163c7)

13. they are facts as you see them . your need to mock makes you an asshole and is a mistake i am trying to correct i a way you understand . further mockery . who ' s denying the facts , anyway ? to me its not what your doing its how your doing it .
