3. immediately . it would give you twice as much time to live your life and it would have no drawbacks , if you ' re feeling exhausted or burnt out , you can lay down and relax for a while and once you ' re ready to get back to it , you can get back to it . it would also be nice on days where you didn ' t get enough sleep , then you don ' t have to spend half an hour yawning , to the point where your face is getting a little sore . alphonse always bothered me in full metal alchemist , he doesn ' t need to waste time or effort sleeping , eating or any of the other day to day crap and all he does it bitch about it . sure , he could die at any second without warning , but that kind of applies to anything that ' s alive .

   (ID: 8f17a8aa41d6f9ae6bf4690376763808f9363f80)

6. all depends on your background and motives . empathy of someone is a must . for me , as a nice guy trust me please . you need this one thing , secret tip . you need to process that every person , even at worse has had a different situation to you in the past and you do not know where , or how they became who they are . you look at yourself , and your traits and be thankful , postives overcome negatives if you think that .
   (ID: f4ccc689474985c0e4cb0900bd2a946257f83dc3)

7. i frequently do . it  s my way of saying  put a little more thought into it , i think you have the ability to piece this together on your own  .
   (ID: 642d313215c4dbadffc4be5d2f254d63d8270b82)

8. i woke up today to the sun shining bright as fuck right on my face and instead of getting annoyed like i normally would have , i thought  today  s going to be a beautiful day  . my next thought was wtf did i just say ? lol . it  s a great feeling after years or depending on something to truly be free from it . it truly owns your life . keep your head up and your nose clean !

9. I am worst person.

   (ID: dadc9911849239b0d3b98ea480d7a3be43208f42)

11. I am lonely period.
   (ID: e0420899ce262e6eda9d0771cc722037c8f327b8)

12. i ' ll admit , some days are really rough and the world can make it difficult to want to keep moving forward . but when times get really rough , i find a nice quiet place to be alone and think about how , some where out there , some dumbass is getting hit by a car . brings a smile to my face everytime .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

13. move my stuff for little to no reason . i can ' t tell you how many times i ' ve scoured the house for something that i knew exactly where i put it . it tends to happen when she ' s at work and i ' m not so i can ' t get an answer from her either .
   (ID: dc639446b154d74c8655191b5a755643abd00c2d)

14. that i ' m too self conscious and need to start giving lesd of s crsp what others think of me .
   (ID: 7e58269155b84bc057025d5066e661ba2eb934ba)

15. realizing that literally nothing in the past can be changed and nothing you can do now will change the past has helped me . i ask myself " what can i do to make today  tomorrow better ? " rather than asking what could i have done . its about re  framing your perspective , and that takes time and effort and intentional direction , but once you do it feels so much better . whenever you realize that you can make a better tomorrow , even though you can ' t make a better yesterday , it really can change your world .
   (ID: 573effd77bc41b375b82f92f6f34840f2f4dbff4)

18. who , me ?
   (ID: 9ec97fcc6f16d54d7e24ba1cdb5ebe5785854536)

19. i struggle with that all the time . don ' t do it . it seems like you already know the problem same as me just work on that with yourself . but honestly it ' s a situation  day by day struggle . good luck !
   (ID: df32c155f124e2413f811d36f780385403a5374a)

20. rock climbing . absolutely terrified me as a kid . i was too afraid to climb more than 15ft up the wall at an indoor gym . a couple years a go my friends got started doing it and i forced myself to climb to the top of the wall . after making it to the top a few times , and being safely lowered i found that i loved it ! i still get scared lead climbing , but it ' s a good fear if that makes sense .
