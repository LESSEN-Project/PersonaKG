1. its not your foult . if she just dumped you like that becouse of your mental health than she is a bitch and doesnt deserve you . try to find a woman that actually cares about you . there are many fish in the sea so dont loose hope . i hope the for best for you . sorry for bad english
   (ID: 2c1d97aa622f6ad7ec3a9aad9285dd4ec1e1f28d)

2. she should go to the hell of hell .
   (ID: cc3d4f2be41112acacb92d09090db0e1f8d7e387)

3. wonder which one thinks she  s the fat friend trick question they all do
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

4. just so i understand  you  re gay but have a girlfriend and this isn  t enough to keep up your charade . you need to make the guys you hang out with jealous by making this girl dress to show off her body . then you  re going to introduce this girl to your family and want her to dress like this again for them . what  s the plan here ? you seem like you don  t know what you want . in another thread , you say you  re coming out to your mother because you don  t have any money . you  re all over the place . any way you could just be your authentic self ? or if you  re going to remain closeted to some in your family , why march this girl around having her partake in your lie ? you could just be single .
   (ID: 5d0b750bf77c2c6e8b41ebf03caf4038a907b876)

5. i ' ve recently been through this too and the only thing i can recommend is stop to think about how much she really cares about you . if you feel like you ' ve put more effort into her than she ' s putting into you , let her go . i recently got let down by a girl i loved and it is one of the worst things , especially when you have nobody to fall onto . talk to other people rather than trying to fix something that ' s not your fault . you obviously tried to contact her , and if she ' s not responding , then maybe you ' re caring more than she is and you need to stop . don ' t give somebody digit  if they give back digit  if at all . and if you ever feel alone , talk to somebody , anybody . hell , i ' ve been kinda alone since then , feel free to dm me . but i cannot stress this enough . don ' t get stuck on somebody if they won ' t get stuck on you .
   (ID: 8a4ed3ff6aeac985870de52972da8599efd48ae2)

6. you should know that your so ' s real side . personality , quirks , temperment , etc will come out only after getting married ! you will think you married a stranger !
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

7. is your best time getting to see her again ?
   (ID: 990ad26ccc25b114c7f512fc1c83b02e54b79e2a)

8. dont hit girls ever , not even if your being attacked , just avoid them . thanks grandpa
   (ID: fd9de666ca1e952a2f9c7367d60476a6d4b8b996)

9. probably turn into one of those guys that want everyone to see it because they did and it was beautiful . it would just take a few years to start getting people to look unless shes ripping off blindfolds
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)

10. the unfortunate thing with being human is that despite our radical free will , we can only choose for ourselves  not others . i ' ve been through young love and know its inexplicable potency . however , first love won ' t necessarily be your best love . in situations like this , the more you try to force things , the worse they will become . a few words of encouragement about your sexuality  gay and lesbian relationships occur among many species of animals in the wild . there ' s nothing wrong with what you ' re feeling or who you ' re attracted to . i think what makes people uncomfortable about it is that it inherently presents a challenge to the privilege heterosexuals have and are generally unwilling to reflect critically about . although you don ' t want to break up , try to stay strong . the best thing you can do is let her know that you love her and are there for her if she needs you . i wish you both the best .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

11. she is passive beyond belief and will never tell you that something is wrong .
   (ID: 1ab4a61fa2bafda0a2f05eb20a92c419c1c93284)

12. post some nsfw pics of her using her name and we will all upvote them and then you can get mad at her because all us guys are hot for her .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

13. i think we ' re in agreement ? or by ' yep ' did you mean you would stop loving your mother for money reasons ?
   (ID: 0cd5284a49d41ed5d0b33c24b5c7a84017aa9737)

14. what are you even talking about ? a drunk girl can say yes to intercourse and still be considered rape because a drunk woman can not give consent . it doesn ' t matter how drunk the guy is he is a rapist under most definitions of rape . thats a really jacked up definition of rape in my opinion . i can find sources but you will just down vote them too .
   (ID: 35eb47890f8874bbb988ec8308ba762f8377b3b8)

15. no you weren  t raped and it  s sad that people think what happened to you is the same as getting attacked . forget gender , you were in your house with your girlfriend , and the only reason people think is because you were tired . get real kid . your not a victim , you just need a nap .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

16. well my friend you sound like a worthy gentleman . is this fair lass of yours isn ' t ready for the snorlax then it ' s her loss . sloth is the enemy of greatness and if she continues to drag it along , you certainly deserve better . apologies , i ' m so drunk that my atheist  heathen ass may have just quoted the bible . nonetheless , the point is the same . if she keep stringin ' ya along , you deserve better mate .
   (ID: 50e37e2011f73f739f76098c3c746e27b8422fd7)

17. must be all the beauty products she made him bring home last season . i kid , she looks great . i did kind of think it was funny when she called chantel ' s family image conscious or materialistic or whatever , considering the whole tv , laptop , entire suitcase full of beauty products , etc she demanded pedro bring to her . look , no one hates the family chantel more than i do , but you aren ' t perfect , lady !
   (ID: 85a05d28a3a638ea67074ae6793644f5f667c9f3)

18. careful she ' s a wolf in sheep ' s clothing . if i were you i ' d run now . i saw the last one at the end . it wasn ' t pretty .
   (ID: 5344621c1ec41719d7e9e7b0b20e03cbb602774a)

19. dude , if you have an attractive so , let her show that shit off . you should take it as a compliment when other people want to fuck your girlfriend . if you really can ' t handle her style , then maybe she ' s not for you .
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

20. i suppose i have some perspective in a way from your girlfriends point of view as i think my girlfriend has similer feelings as i ' m still close friends with a guy i slept with the guy and i where friends long before i should add and it was a one time thing i know it kinda makes her uncomfortable so i try to take in to consideration her feelings about hanging out with him such as i would be with him alone but shes okayish with it because she trusts me .   x200b  so i guess what im saying in your gf case she must feel pressured by her ex into keeping contact and feels terrible about it , i say just try and support her as dealing with abusive ex partners can be a rough experience
