1. sounds like you need to go on a journey to find yourself . if money is tight go to your local jazz cafe or something and do some poetry . remember , you are only human so let out what you are feeling
   (ID: 2dcd820eac167adf18c6706f1c0a26a39eb945be)

2. once you start catching yourself in the moment of being over  emotional and realize the contrast of how badly you overreacted , coupled with how much easier things are when everything isn ' t tied to emotion , you look at things already expecting to be calm and skip the dramatic part
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

3. knowing that i let somebody other than myself down
   (ID: 6212c082850f067a67618ad2a3b9f8ed336590f4)

4. nta . your parents blamed you for something you had zero control over . you were pissed and rightly so . your mom needs help and should have gotten it years ago . your dad should have gotten help too .
   (ID: 2e369dc21156ed2b443bc09084e27c8acb516093)

5. well , i hope that you ' re still here . those friends that your referring to , those aren ' t the type you want to have . if they don ' t like you or your interests , that ' s their lost , not yours . if you don ' t mind me asking , why does your mom want you to move back in ? you may call her narcissist , but aren ' t all parents , in a way ? i would suggest you call her . if you kill yourself , it could destroy her . i wouldn ' t know , but maybe she wants you to move back in because she likes having around . maybe she needs some help , that is if she lives alone .
   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

6. yes it is but adding the maoi from another plant in the tea makes the high last hours not minutes . and you do it multiple times in a week . this allows you to break through the fun aspect and take you to a place in your mind that can have life altering aspects . watch dmt  the spirit molecule . it ' s an interesting documentary on netflix . edit didn ' t realize it was a question . apologies .
   (ID: 30572ac5982532854b2ead41285ed9bbaba6d654)

7. i feel like it depends what you use it for ? if you use it just for fun and  or as a little treat for yourself , then no . but if you ' re using it as an escape from shit like " negative emotions , " then you might . i was always told to be responsible with pot and that it ' s best not to resort to using it if i ' m having a bad day . because then the day might come where you ' re having a really bad day , and you try to find your pot , only to find that you ' re out ! you ' d have no idea how to then cope with your emotions and would be , in essence , " addicted " to it . honestly , i feel that the only exception to not using pot to deal with your emotions would be if a doctor prescribed it to you for that reason .
   (ID: 661cbd631caa9db4ab702976879371243802e35e)

8. diagnosed or nor youre hurting yourself so yes it  s a disorder im so sorry op but know that you don  t suffer alone there  s a bunch of subreddits here with girls like myself who go through the same thing as you . wed all be happy to talk to you and help you work through this . i  m here to listen if you just want to vent more , i get that face to face therapy irl can be intimidating . but you made a great first step in talking to them about it ! even if your mum and friends don  t know how to help you . and are you too young to leave home ? maybe room with a friend or something ?
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

9. basic self care of hygiene , drinking water , and feeding myself . on a really bad day , just hopping in the shower and washing my face can help a lot . i also watch a lot of stand up comedy and cuddle with my dog . trying to get outside for a walk helps a lot , even if it ' s just to the mailbox and back . i also personally am anti  meds for myself , no criticism for others , but i do take vitamin d because that is the most gentle and natural antidepressant .
   (ID: 022767076c8e9ed224fa7eeaf7db901f4f85512b)

10. do extreme steps to stop yourself from gambling . that ' s the only way now . if you really have the mindset to change , go way way extreme . ban yourself from casinos , websites , or anything . cut your internet . find a therapist . call addiction hotlines . ask a friend , family for help . this will only get better if you make moves . i suggest do it now while your in the ' zone ' of making a change in your life .
   (ID: a3bc874aed8bb8421b25930723a7210bcd9b2aec)

11. im not sure i am the best to give advice . but i have always been told there is a slip , and a relapse . you can recover from a slip if you really want to .
   (ID: 51e06ea43809bd7f43c9c3b13a19193236a72570)

12. my psychiatrist says i have ocd tendencies along with aspergers syndrome . i don ' t know if i actually have ocd or not but from my experience i also get these impulsive thoughts . " i liked these girls when i was a young child , do i still like them now ? " that ' s basically my worry , i ' ve been an adult for a few years and i worry the same . " why won ' t these feelings go away , i don ' t want these feelings and thoughts . they were okay when i was younger but not now ! stop it stop it stop it ! " my psychiatrist says sometimes we have trouble shifting from developmental thoughts to adult thoughts . he also said to be in the present moment more . i don ' t want these thoughts , i don ' t want these feelings . i really think i have " harm ocd " but we ' ll have to see what my psychiatrist says next session in digit weeks
   (ID: f9d3bf7ce779e854aa865f12a7dfaaee14a65cfa)

13. i feel your pain . i was told a week ago that my wife has wanted a divorce for over a year . it hurts like hell when one minute you think your life and relationship are going well then the next minute you find out your partner does not want you anymore . it no doubt crushes your world . and i know what you are thinking and feeling . everyone keeps telling you the same things , and they are the right things but you don  t want to hear . you believe that there has to be someway to stop this and correct , but we can  t . the heart loves , hurts , grows and loves again . we just can  t control it . so good luck with your situation , we both know our lives will get better in time . take care .
   (ID: 3cd64a42c43aaba8bcfe70482cd19250f58de2f0)

14. one of the biggest errors our little human brains make is assuming people we know are the same from day to day . many people do not understand the episodic nature of depression . i strongly encourage you to mention to a friend of parent something like " this may be out of left field , but between you and me , i ' ve been feeling kind of blue lately . i know i don ' t show it , but i guess i could use a little extra support at the moment " say it in a way that feels like your voice . saying it out loud is scary , but surprisingly therapeutic in and of itself .
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

15. you can be on your way of hitting rock bottom and nobody will warn you . people will view you as human filth , but nobody will say anything . in their eyes you are past redemption . ask yourself if your life is on a good course .
   (ID: 53aa6c267ff5eccf891e178786d41ca5df80a5de)

16. well the solution to that is obviously to join groups on the internet that cause you to constantly sit and stew in that disgusting state , instead of participating in groups that would facilitate the positive changes you desire . also , it ' s important to repeatedly make whiney little bitch posts over and over asking the same crybaby fucking questions of strangers . oh , and make sure that you vilify anyone successful so that you can avoid the pain of knowing you ' ve been fucking lazy your whole life . call em " chad " , and socialize with others who do the same , so that you never actually successfully change . that way you can dehumanize them . hey , asshole , what the fuck do you want people to tell you that you haven ' t already heard ? how about you go to a mental health professional that gives a shit about you succeeding ? and in the mean time , you stop visiting your pathetic asshole incel subs that want nothing more than to keep you exactly where you are . why ? because if you change , that means they could have changed , and didn ' t . stop hanging out with fucking losers . losers infect others with the disease of being a fucking loser . go check out those dreaded " chad " subs dedicated to fitness . see how they talk about life and goals ? compare that to you fucking losers . then compare their life to your shit life . do you think that maybe they ' re right and you ' re wrong ? get off your lazy fucking ass already . god damn it . hire a personal trainer . hire a fucking head doctor . stop going to incel subs . this isn ' t rocket science , asshole .
   (ID: 029f5b503d15f7a11f4a0300f77d88f29e5c7ed5)

17. i totally hear what your saying ! i ' m a bit older then you but i have experience these things . they weighed on my more than i even knew . one day i decided to say " fuck this , i ' m taking control " i was on the verge of hating both my parents and there problems and barely spoke to them . so i just started to be nice to them started to pretend i care . i realized they are just fucked up humans and i actually started to feel bad for them . i ' m not saying you should do what i did  do . but i want to tell you there is hope for a change in the future . try not to let it define you and get you down . i wish you luck
   (ID: dc0783c6951122c6edfc85430901cf133c146b32)

18. well , my mom thinks that i am depressed due to my lack of faith in god hence the title of my post , and that the cure to all mental illnesses is found in prayer , but i smell bs on that a lot of people do , really . she usually gives sage advice , but not this one . it almost drove me out out christianity for good due to the absurdity . thanks for the book recommendation . i ' ll check it out when i have the time . and yeah , i ' ll try to talk some sense into my parents to allow me to see a doctor . i ' ve been worried for far too long , and it ' s driving me insane .
   (ID: afb250d177d47ce6467dfa3414d91e9e07eec6c4)

19. i  d say talk to other enby people , they may have a similar experience . it may help you find yourself . ultimately , though , it  s you who  s gotta take the information given and figure yourself out .
   (ID: 12803a9aad224d0537b68ab83a6cdc6a45d3160f)

20. well what ' s it like living with that ?
