11. telemarketer . if they can sell well , it would be pretty simple to have a low level secretary scan the approved calls and type out the critical information . consulting , if they have extensive previous experience in a field , reviewing projects can be quite valuable . public speaking . people will hire him to talk about how he overcame is hardship even though he only overcame it because people are willing to pay to see him talk about overcoming it . kind of a self fulfilling prophecy all for the entertainment of others by capitalizing on his disability . basically a modern day freak show with better pay , to put it in less politically correct terms i am sure there are other jobs that can be handled depending on exactly his level of disability . does he have any slight motion in extremities ? has he learned any systems for people with his disability like eye tracking or other controls like head or breathing based or speech based computer controls ?
