1. i usually have to wait in the human line because either the kids or the husband has already eaten some of whatever we are buying and if we go to self serve i ' ll have to call over the staff member anyway to amend the " incorrect item weight " error .
   (ID: c0cbd0e097375f98ad98ec291f836a39d55e02c1)

2. used to work at tb . changing your order to only beans or fresco style is super easy and employee are supposed to make your food however you want it . the only issue i ' d say is that when there are a lot of changes on multiple items during a rush it can get overlooked on the food makers ' order screens and you might get something you didn ' t want or not get something you wanted . food makers learn to make the items a specific way and it can be difficult to alter what is actually just memorized movements . i was never bothered about people asking to change the ingredients in the digit years i was there .

6. One of my favorite things is skillet.
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

7. in asian cooking there is no universal brand that is good for all things , most brands become famous for the digit or digit sauces they make and expand into other sauces which they make not so well . also consider ingredients differ from country to country so for example thai rice flour is different from korean rice flour and different from japanese rice flour although all being just called " rice flour " on the package because the rice they eat is slightly different . this is the same with sauces for example chinese black bean sauce is not the same as korean black bean sauce . so if you truly want to know how to cook asian food well , you have to first have authentic regional asian food cooked for you . then you can try to replicate it yourself by experimenting with sauces and whatnot . that said , you can mix and match and have it taste good to yourself , just don ' t feed it to some korean girl and expect she won ' t spit it out in front of you .

15. i feel like with many a pizza , if you use wonderful ingredients the pizza will be fine . the difference between fresh and canned pineapple , or breadt an upscale local ham or oscar mayer . i try not to go to places that have hawaiian pizza on the menu because i am a pizza snob and selling hawaiian pizza shows that you dont take pizza seriously and wouldn ' t be inclined to use wonderful ingredients in the first place . but what ' s a deluxe ? mushroom , onion , green pepper , sausage , pepperoni ?
