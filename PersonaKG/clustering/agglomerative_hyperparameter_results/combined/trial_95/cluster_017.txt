   (ID: b301c9554f2e76b5eecf80851921ba7c198de59c)

2. start by not giving a shit about what other people think of you . do what you need to do for yourself . learn to say " no " more often without the repercussions of other people ' s feelings . the rest will come naturally .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

   (ID: 472084017072e7ced5fed0827bae57ba801d9b7d)

6. yasss , i ' ve been asked out by girls twice big pp energy and said no both times . it ' s not even all about the girl tho one time it was just about where i ' m at and weather i want to be in a relationship at the moment . in terms of physical appearance i honestly can only think of two girls i even know of that i like okay she ' s not that cute . the rest are all cute , still wouldn ' t go on a date with digit  of them though just cause of differences in personality and all that . girls don ' t have some magic power , but neither do guys . asking anyone out is a chance . saying that however i still think girls should start asking guys out more . not under the assumption they will definitely say yes , cause they wont . but just because who should guys be the ones always asking girls out .
   (ID: ced909c5cb6ff0568a08e4114fa46116da622fa1)

7. i imagine a good relationship , and i think about all of the happiness that will come from a relationship . i mainly feel like society doesn ' t accept me , based on how i look . it ' s frustrating how people don ' t look for personality in relationships , and i have a good personality . it just , sucks .
   (ID: 82bb111e2180a2ffb997b74ab504aa538034feab)

8. oh , and it happens to be my bday which is funny .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

9. bad break up ? if so you got to let it go . if not , then go outside and explore somewhere where people are accepting , like a sports bar or social clubs or something where you can add to peoples conversations
   (ID: ba0e9130abfdb05aa7eedd989650338802035edd)

10. part of it for me was actually losing some weight . i realized that even after i lost like digit pounds , i was still able to find parts of me that i hated and i didn ' t really see myself as more attractive or beautiful . it ' s kind of like you think this one thing is going to solve your problems , then you get it , and you realize that your thoughts about your body aren ' t really about your body so much as how you choose to see it . there are still things i want to change about my body , but i ' ve learned to be more gracious and accepting of what i look like either way .
   (ID: 573effd77bc41b375b82f92f6f34840f2f4dbff4)

11. i ' d say start with the oldest generation going towards the latest . but thats just me .
   (ID: fd112b0116b574aa5911af63529dca9683e5f6eb)

12. it depends on the evidence . if you  re a millionaire but they catch you in the act and on video with eye witnesses then a lawyer can  t do a miracle . but normally a case rests on less certain facts . the state will use their own experts to build a story of what went down . if you  re rich , you can afford your own experts to present an alternative story . the other aspect is how much time your lawyer has to devote to you . if you  re poor , your lawyer might get all of digit minutes to work on your case . if you  re rich , they can devote months to it and explore every little avenue available . if you  re really rich then you can make a donation to the political campaign of the da and get offered a lenient plea deal .
   (ID: d8e39e092041fc01f24bedce425d10f55bd2a764)

13. late to the party , but i always feel i set myself up for failure from easily fixable issues like lack of effort because i don ' t want someone like myself to be successful .
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

14. if you just met them like at a party ,  tell me about yourself  is a perfect opener that allows people to take it where they want . if you have developed some rapport , asking about people  s brothers , sisters , and parents  remember their names , and if they sound positive , ask what that relationship looks like  would you say you act more like friends or are you the protective sibling  . if they sound negative , venture elsewhere or play it safe and ask something more open ended like ,  who are you closest with ? who do you tell stuff that nobody else knows ?  the provocative questions like that last one is a gambit and can either turn people away or build intimacy quickly .
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

15. except that you don ' t really know your limit until you reach it . and most people do that at least once .
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

16. i have no friends and i am not in a relationship . my parents will inevitably die so yeah , forever .
   (ID: 9d1b3fafafa63d6ec9712c98a0c16b4cc697d112)

17. no please . you do have a place in this world . you may not know it yet but you will find what place you have in this world . you can ' t reach it if you ' re gone .
   (ID: 016485853897f1b9f422dd4da7d83e7e4a5261b0)

18. legally , yes , you would have to be paid for the hours that you worked , regardless of when you step down . typically though i mean , i don ' t know what kind of job you have you give your employer two weeks ' notice before you plan on taking your last day .
   (ID: 0804200f8083dc053afb8aa8f228fa4025950bd5)

19. " be yourself " and " always be the same " are two radically different things . you can , and in fact you should change , not only as life passes , but depending on where you are and who you ' re with .
   (ID: 9a13b21f54717da1499379b5cb0e991e82d4c90f)

20. been there and it wasn  t worth the time . the impact it has on you when you like and are not  liked  back is really negative . save your own time and feeling and withdraw .
