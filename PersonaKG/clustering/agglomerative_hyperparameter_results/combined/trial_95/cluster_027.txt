Total from this dataset: 446

1. damn , he really is self sabotaging . elitism and hate seem to be all he can focus on , like it ' s all he wants to focus on . i ' m not sure he ' ll be able to even look at therapy , but don ' t give up hope . keep going , and you ' ll maybe find results .
   (ID: 4e0f41bc85f51f64d9103c2a165328ff6329dea1)

2. definitely nta but your bf is because if he can ' t respect someones boundaries  consent than that says a lot about thew kind of person he is . i really don ' t think you should have kids with this guy and while i don ' t want to get all up in your personal life ' do you really want to be with a guy who doesn ' t understand consent and the meaning of the word no ?
   (ID: 1df1bd07e28c0df73bd865f8cb447d7c8f1bd4d3)

3. if you decide for now you want to stay , marriage counseling as someone else mentioned , but find a new counselor . if nothing changes after a bit of this , then what i mention below . i think there are some options . as much as i think you should just leave , i know that ' s not easy as you have emotions and children together . if you had to think about your life in digit years being this same way , would you stay ? i think if it ' s a no then you should leave .
   (ID: 345fbf1e655edda9a5f8099ba480dfe0a7a0bd47)

4. malok must go out of his way because that ' s all i ' ve gotten these past weeks . undying mind too , oh fuck that guy .
   (ID: a73b0dda35d389b4f74e47db6574e0f71738b683)

5. god yes that was a typo . either i  m an idiot or my autocorrect is an asshole . i  ll edit that now . thanks for pointing it out . i  m glad your friends and bf are so good to you !
   (ID: b1f9e512a76d2c07b1eae248bca4e0bf140d4bc8)

6. wow i am so very sorry he dropped that on you like that . i ' m sorry you are feeling the way you are . but it seems like he genuinely did care for you and that he wants the best for you . judging by the note it seems like he is being respectful to you . to be honest when i first opened the image i was expecting some horrible words . but they were gentle , kind and sincere . written with truth . give him that . don ' t demonize him for your own sake . i ' m sure this is a big shock for you . maybe he just said you weren ' t intelligent to throw you off and be more mad at him . maybe something is going on with him . i don ' t know what to make of it . but at least he didn ' t rip you a new one in the note . and you will heal . i promise you will heal from this .
   (ID: 9981a65782780477b53d712e936b6997a4092240)

7. knowing what you like isn ' t selfish at all . i know i ' m pretty much just a sub . my partner is a switch . some people are only dominant , some only submissive , some are switches , and with that some are still more dominant or more submissive or are only dom  sub in certain scenarios and the other every time else . it ' s like sexual orientation , your wouldnt be selfish if you were straight , or gay , or anything else , and your definitely not for knowing that you are a dominant and don ' t worry , not all guys are dominants there are plenty of submissive and switch guys too
   (ID: 3019ca7bd07e9287b998767b6d0eb22d6049a635)

8. oh man what a prison scenerio , you got punked in front of everyone , now everyone will punk you . you gotta beat his ass down 5x harder than he hit you to get back with a little extra . even if you get beat up at least you dont look like a coward . or  its just highschool and no one will remember in a few days . he was obviously trying to impress someone so it has nothing to do with you personally so you can be the bigger man and walk away , dont give him the satisfaction of retaliating . if it occurs again i would ask him why he did that . if he has a reason , try to deescalate the situation and find common ground . if hes just a dick and doesnt stop , resort to the first plan .
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

9. my mind is blown that either of you are able to even spend that much . you ' re spending 1k a month on " frivolous " stuff ? unless he ' s not contributing to your joint account or you suspect him of cheating , leave it alone .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

10. how this hell is he better than lebron ? you gotta be kidding me .
   (ID: b5942acb07bb8a74e4924ef75fa70edb4f626161)

11. it  s time to put on your big boy pants and grow up . you are now legally responsible for all of your actions and decisions . and you are not helpless  learn the value of an education , the real cost of living , consequences of unsafe sex , and that social media is not real life .
   (ID: 0d77404b10744947bcd2c91d8c926021d4b8650f)

12. according to the wife , he hasn ' t stopped getting it 4x a week . it ' s the timing thing , or on demand she ' s having an issue with .
   (ID: 9dc145263dd1a50db0f9af555000e486f0939a54)

13. find other things you like to do . volunteer at an animal shelter , pick up a new inexpensive hobby , start exercising regularly . whatever you do , don ' t let yourself have too much free time , it ' s easy to get really down on yourself when that happens . take that time to work on yourself and your life outside of your career during that time . that way you are still moving forward .
   (ID: 3adf883c491ca030d52ee22ed62e166c87ed0d5e)

14. the very fact that you  re expressing you don  t know is reason enough to know you  re not ready .
   (ID: ac1ceb388a2e170941cb682c48398cacc87c5019)

15. few men can resist swatting a woman ' s ass when presented in that manner ! lol . i see what you mean about the difference between wanting and needing submission . i hadn ' t thought about it in those terms . i think you ' re in a much better place than you realize , though  you ' ve grown confidence and you ' ve clearly thought through your emotions and understand yourself pretty well . you know you have a weakness , and you know you want to overcome it . your miles ahead of most people , and you have what hopefully is a promising relationship with a guy who won ' t push you back toward your old behavior because your relationship isn ' t based on a bdsm dynamic or even a common interest . and if he agrees to give you a light spanking now and then , so much the better !
   (ID: 0d77404b10744947bcd2c91d8c926021d4b8650f)

16. you are absolutely right . the question should not have been asked , but it was . it was asked to trump . you are not going to see questions like this one asked to hillary , bernie , or cruz . the media only targets trump with these questions because they know a lot of people after hearing the answer will get emotionally irrational and start hating trump even more . think about it for a second , if i hadn ' t commented to your post you might end up walking away from all this actually thinking that trump wants to throw into prison those who get abortions .
   (ID: adc3a5cfebc17d4df8b27d363588dd0bb2a7265c)

17. i kinda get the feeling that if you don ' t take this advice there are going to be a lot of things in your future that you won ' t like .
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

18. no . if i wanted to have sex with others i wouldn ' t be a bitch about it . be direct . i ' m not feeling it , or i want something fun or different . or better yet if your not happy , leave . don ' t fuck with trust .
   (ID: e4fb833c981bca730eb26e161a8c64f302e44d49)

19. okay he is being a little unfair by saying that it won ' t work , if you haven ' t tried it , neither of you will know . and also , if it doesn ' t work , just go back i know there are financial complications with that , but mental health is always first . you can always make more money , you can be un  sad if you know what i mean . sometimes it ' s jot about physically being away , but mentally being away . one great thing i have with my current partner we ' ve lived together and apart several times  very unreliable with money haha we can sit with each other in silence and it ' s okay , or just say " i ' m not feeling talking or doing anything " i know it ' s hard because when you love someone you want to be with them , and it feels like you ' re being mean if you don ' t want to be there all the time . but it ' s normal . try and give yourself some more attention , when you look after yourself , many things in life fall into place . your whole brain restructures , certain things become unimportant etc etc
   (ID: 87d1924873eb8926aac7c71d1a563d7d2d1cabbd)

20. that is disappointing . you did everything you could and he still treated you like that . you ' re right , you are much better off without that kind of shit in your life !
