1. there are some foods that need to be cooked that are otherwise toxic , quinoa for example . the ' cooking destroys nutrients ' thesis , although often true is irrelevant . you can eat eat a greater quantity of steamed broccoli and recieve the same amount of micronutrients as a smaller quantity of raw brocolli
   (ID: 85ac769b0cb349e567cb91e8109645bd1ac28b9f)

2. yeah maybe but power lifters and yogis dont carry themselves as crossfitters do . and they don ' t bother you with health advice or what to eat , or what to wear , or how to lift properly should i go on ? maybe they are worse where i live .
   (ID: 14bd1366b004b74cfd8c9cb269849740d12cff80)

3. I am 3m max.
   (ID: dd5faa5a5f52546a048b117b380f01fc0bb80bfe)

4. I am heavier smoker.
   (ID: 5c9dd67e95ee5403b2bd9a6848c017674d46396b)

5. i get pressure and soreness in my sternum . gerd presents itself in many different ways , do you notice these symptoms after eating ? or when full ? shortly after eating ?
   (ID: f14ea91df683dc236b3ffe5956871b69581e71d3)

6. you can do it . mind over matter . don ' t like that evil plant control your life . everytime you get a craving ? light up a j . that ' s exactly why i never started smoking , just trees for me .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

7. i ' m a picky eater . by choice , not at all . have i tried " new foods " only with every fucking annoying person who thinks im simply refusing to try something new . no , this isn ' t new , i ' ve taken " just a small bite " enough times with enough people with enough different foods to know i don ' t like it . i very clearly know what tastes good and what doesn ' t taste good to me . i shouldn ' t have to try it in front of you to appease your weird obsession with what i consume . if it ' s unhealthy , so what ? if it ' s the same shit , so what ? you don ' t have to eat it . i enjoy very spicy foods and digit  digit those same people who judge me for being picky sure shut the hell up when i ask them to try something spicy . " i already know i don ' t like it " oh , you don ' t fucking say . i haven ' t seen you try it . this kind of mentality is troubling to me . labeling people negatively for not being like you . your post could have been so much better .  everyone has preferences , i get that ,  i have numerous friends and family who won ' t learn to cook or put in any effort  whatever , adults can eat what they want   eat what you want not , i ' ma whine and complain about something irrelevant as what others eat . don ' t like immature people , quit associating yourself with them . but you know , usually people share common traits with those they surround themselves with , you definitely got the immaturity part . i could counter your whole entire dumbass paragraph but i ' ve vented enough .
   (ID: 3b13182e9a13b392bb9f89990f71d9043459e21f)

8. don ' t worry about it , it ' s just my shoes .
   (ID: 98f9b074f3fba12c7403be7000f77b6a560c5a02)

9. the first week can suck . it gets pretty easy after that though . the body is a pretty amazing adapter . i only eat digit calories these days , pre  keto i was . probably near digit   . though you have to get used to being a pain in the ass when you eat out " is that breaded ? can i have it without ? " good luck !
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

10. i don  t think you should go around making fun of the way people look or their weight . that being said ugly is ugly and obesity is unhealthy . if you  re comfortable with yourself that  s great you should be . but you should also put forth a little effort
   (ID: d78765bdf49a3df577dd2523ce864393d4d0d2c9)

11. you know what they say about big feet
   (ID: f4588f2a476206e602fe5b84647a1e777eaae604)

12. you are getting someone  else to kill for you for fun . vegan food is nasty but you didn ' t kill an animal to get it . you are killing out of preference rather than necessity . do you have a problem understanding words ?
   (ID: 98df62eadd0a0c80a6084d5e352985209b46cce9)

13. but we shouldn  t say that being obese is okay as a society , but if you want to stay fat thats your choice but you shouldn  t spread fake ideals
   (ID: 23df46bdba3eb265d08b02c9ec5f365cf45ae5fd)

14. i disagree with the notion that  fat shaming  is a bad thing . or shaming in general . being morbidly obese is something that people should be ashamed of , and they should be working to better themself . i think what people don  t understand is how to shame , you can promote a culture of hostility through shaming yes , but also a culture of progress . i lost a lot of weight because i was tired of feeling bad about myself for being overweight . if i had listened to people who say that i shouldn  t worry about it i could have died from a heart attack or who knows what else . people should definitely love themselves regardless of their weight but if your telling yourself or other people that their weight isn  t a serious issue that they need to get a grip on your not helping them reflect on their terrible choices that led to the issue .
   (ID: 350ebf5f22b005c6fa011b8241361bb7184ec8d5)

15. thank god you said this . i have some really embarrassing questions for you . i sincerely hope you answer them because i really want to know .   x200b  as it stands . i ' m digit ' digit and digit lbs as of wednesday . i ' m probably down to digit or digit by now since i eat less at home than when i work . i don ' t exercise at all , i basically stay naturally healthy because of how i eat . usually less than digit calories a day with at least digit g proteins , vitamins  supplements , etc .   x200b  i plan on having kids with my fiance and worried that i might get fat . i used to be digit  digit lbs before i met my fiance but worry that having a kid will destroy my ability to sit on my ass all day and watch tv and play ps4 and waste time on reddit and eat whatever i want and still be digit  digit lbs .   x200b  i don ' t want to exercise . do you think it ' s possible to lose the baby fat with diet alone ?   x200b
   (ID: 85ada8069a64aa3ed39736f565e8a9ceed369acd)

16. I am vegan.
   (ID: a168763c82b90dc18ccbbd57533eec2e49d17dc7)

17. there are a lot of doctors . but nearly every person in every developed county is on the internet and boy howdy a large proportion of those people live to share uninformed opinions about a variety of topics , such as medical conditions . you can read one side of many failure stories on here . please stop generalising .  insufferable egos ?  based on what  your anecdotal evidence . sure there are people in every profession with attitude problems , but being a doctor doesn  t by any means make you insufferable and egotistic . are you implying that specialising is bad ? i don  t understand what you  re trying to imply with the statement  talk about specialising  . and honestly . if you  re going to a doctor who you don  t like , and who you don  t think is good , because you think she  s cute ? you  re just a fool . but that much was already obvious .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

18. your mind will want to give up and quit long before your body will actually give out . often times , you  ll never reach breaking point with your body . unless you  re lifting a car . but you will always reach breaking point with your mind . even if lifting only digit lbs . strength is learning to tune out what the mind believes cannot be done and focusing on the task at hand . if you focus , tune everything out and believe  you really can move mountains . if the thought  i can  t do this  slips into your mind , even once , it will kill all momentum and make that a reality .
   (ID: f9074998a5afc016e8779c3abcabf220d4ee8eb6)

19. what ? you and your friends and family are just have extremely poor diets .
   (ID: 88c65ad9c962da115240776d5aa110748286db73)

20. like seriously when you ' re older you will regret it wasting your teenage life on things like that . you should be worrying about your weight when you get older . instead of taking things into your own hands i know it is obviously hard but tryyyy to tell somebody about the bullying if you haven ' t already and get help to demand that something serious is done about it . i ' m sorry if i ' m being ignorant towords you if you get what i mean .
