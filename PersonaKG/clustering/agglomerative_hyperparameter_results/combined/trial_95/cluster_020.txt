17. you are hidden during snowball , therefore you are invulnerable to everything . to stop snowball you need to preemptively bkb , regardless of blackhole positioning . i believe that by casting at the max range of black hole , there is still more than digit units behind you so that tusk cannot walrus punch you

19. it really makes customer support queries much faster . i find it way more useful than some of the banking apps i use , because all the text and information is automatically saved . you don  t have to go back and forth with different systems and phone numbers and juggle all the information as it  s all there .
