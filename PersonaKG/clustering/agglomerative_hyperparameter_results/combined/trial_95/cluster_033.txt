1. yea i don ' t like it either but it just makes sense early on .
   (ID: 480f3d8feb42f76cdfa6ea3a1dfffaf98bf91060)

2. i  m so confused , it has not been delayed why does everybody think that ? i don  t think the site ever even said spring where you guys think it did . i could be wrong , correct me if so
   (ID: 09ceeb62f2a165a9c38283d43984e8e6f6f5580e)

3. well . what i ' m trying to say is , niantic could of done something really cool for everyone that showed up and surprised them with something special like a shiny nidoking . next time they have another event advertised for a sticker . no one may show up .
   (ID: a1ba9b657b043ce2934cc0ae7b42c0a0bf3ba2fa)

4. i actually agree with you on this . however , some reposts are desperate attempts to get karma . for example i have noticed on many subreddits that if someone posts something that gets thousands of upvotes and comments . within the next few hours , days even you will see tonnes of reposts of that same post by so many people . i mean come on that can ' t be a coincidence ? i don ' t like the unoriginality in that and i feel that deserves criticism .
   (ID: 44544d02ee07c96b8d593f9252059c899c993d61)

5. i hate my life , i threw my controller somewhere and cant find it since i had my eyes closed out of rage . i hate that stupid game . when you die in adventure you should drop your junk , and flux shouldnt even be classified as junk
   (ID: 11afef34c365bb84fac03c7ec8de5b06e6c54b1c)

6. well yeah . with other groups i have clear favourites but i think ill not bother with bias ' and just love em all .
   (ID: 4679181760b739d302b80a7e08480575bf4d30bc)

7. great and that ' s your preference i however like to support the content creators i watch , so to each their own
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

8. as of right now i haven ' t unlocked the sjogren inertial factory and the digit slug so it ' s not fair to put them in the list . funny cause the annihilator really works with me . it can hip fire people down from stupid ranges while not requiring the same accuracy as the digit slug i play on console you see . sure you need to reload often but that ' s where having a strong sidearm comes in ! in my experience the m1917 trench carbine is great at flanking large groups of enemies but not a whole lot else . i think it deserves b tier for that . the problem with the rsc smg is that it doesn ' t do anything particularly well . there ' s no reason to pick it over any other smg or shotgun even .
   (ID: 46cde0a7d09b0d21cec2da281fda676d6950da60)

9. they say the best weapon is the one you never have to fire . i disagree . the best weapon is the one you only have to fire once . that  s how dad did  that  s how america does it , and it  s worked out pretty well so far . find an excuse to let one of these bad boys off the chain and i promise the bad guys won  t even wanna come out if their caves anymore . i give you . the jericho   iron man  digit
   (ID: b2c623940e1acb4e269cab1c8f1920e03da9e429)

10. loot boxes and microtransactions . i ' d much rather pay for decent dlc , or even just a more expensive game up front , if it meant i didn ' t have to deal with all this monetization .
   (ID: 42817db6a2880fe4df5d65636e25385c67c89bb1)

11. well there is a supermoon at the moment but damn it ' s closer than i thought it would be
   (ID: 5c7a23731c46d9c75722023d6108cb45a421fb75)

12. thank them , especially with an avengers movie . they drop a hint about something that ruins the movie for me , i won ' t want to see it , and i typically don ' t sit down to watch a two hour movie without first finding out what half the plot is .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

13. i agree . once the achievement hunters get their aps , everything will be back to somewhat normal .  the only real bad thing about leagues so far are the pve commanders . yeah , there ' s a ton of them  but on the flipside , they probably really want to help . it just so happens they get overwhelmed with all the things they need to do . they may have been used to running with their guild then decided to try it out on the server . i once commanded our guild run in wvw and it ' s really different when you ' re working with your guild and when you have pugs with you . with your guild , you know what they are capable of so you always know what to tell them . with pugs , there are a lot of probabilities with them  are they upleveled ? because they might not survive the first clash . are they here just for the karma  xp  loot ? then they won ' t follow instructions if you tell them to " stack " , " blast statics  might " , and so on and so forth because they would be like , " whatever man let ' s get this over with "
   (ID: 261413214c13676b8aee2ce20a47107c4ccfe6b8)

14. hey , that ' s okay too . play however you choose to play . the only thing that matters is having fun .
   (ID: 88c35221745da41b29ff5b9f921026de5ccbb6c0)

15. the problem is a closed source company trying to make a buck on something that should be free , aka open source . i could understand if it was something like fedora where they charge for support , but not paying to host what they otherwise get for free . that is a model that we have seen fail time and time again . ms never learns from theirs or others mistakes .
   (ID: ef02e812d417ba40d4b3e2f97601e54e4a68c5c5)

16. to be fair this is what the community has complained heavily about since release . is this not what they wanted ? no sense in complaining about it how it is now if you were complaining about how it was before , as you  ve asked for these changes , specifically .
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

17. my laptop is very capable of gaming i run many new games at 1080p 60fps or above reliably and some at the max settings like rainbow six siege . recently i  ve been hitting 80fps  in pubg as well so i don  t know where you got that from . and many youtubers are sources say it  s a great gaming laptop for the price
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

18. what a bunch of savages ! they should be locked for a term not exceeding digit years .
   (ID: 97a1e3bde7814932f6d6aada58082a95182f230c)

19. i ' d be lieing if i said you ' re wrong . they want the " wand " big time !
   (ID: 54d8d3056c8f47c31e118e652b57922cf96c4876)

20. yes it is , and i enjoyed tfa very much and look forward to what is in store for these characters . however , i am bored of the deathstar and deathstar like devices . i mean come on digit of digit movies use it . please find a new plot device .
