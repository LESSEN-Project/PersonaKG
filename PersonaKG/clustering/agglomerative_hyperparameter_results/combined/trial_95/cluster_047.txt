6. ooc  i will be using updated genjo , but i won ' t be using any of the peto stuff , that would be too easy . genjo  digit  " i ' ll apologize in advance , but i cannot allow you to use the girl for nefarious deeds . if you choose not to cease on your own volition , i will be forced to protect the girl as well as anyone else who will be harmed by your future deeds . " genjo didn ' t like violence , but he wasn ' t going to let the boss harm roro . this situation had become a choice to the monk . a choice to leave the boss unharmed , but risk the harm of roro and others  or to harm the boss , but save many many others . for now , neither choice needed to be done immediately . the third choice was for genjo to be harmed in order to protect everyone , this , was the best choice for the monk . using his jet systems and swift movement , the monk vaulted up the ramp , over the boss , where he stopped in the doorway . his arms spread outward , genjo blocked the door so that the boss couldn ' t pass . it was clear that he wasn ' t so simply going to let the boss go , but it was also clear he had no intention of harming the boss , at least not yet .  " if bringing harm to someone is what you need , then you may harm me . but once you ' re done , i ask that you leave the girl and forget your plans to extort the medicine from lina . "

8. i hear you . but it ' s not kill you in an instant . that would be fine actually not to get too dark for you  it ' d suck for everyone who cared about you . but for you it ' d be fine . i used to tell myself that when i rode a motorcycle . i ' d either roll cool or get killed in an instant . neither happened . what happened is i got hit . and spent years in and out of the hospital in more pain than i ' d ever imagine so the lesson is  be careful and appreciate what you have . because you could be driving to a family thing and someone in an incoming lane could be texting and bam  heat , euphoria and lots of pain .
   (ID: ae0b5b35ef79984eec810d26abc05e9a757ae0ca)

16. i understand but it seemed that your question didn ' t make any sense . a cop will give you a ticket if you break the law even if what you ' re doing makes sense as is safer than following the law . a cop will give you a ticket if he doesn ' t know the law or is having a bad day . your question doesn ' t matter , hypothetically or not . you do the best you can and try not to break any laws . sorry if i became outraged because i really wanted to understand and answer the question and really thought that i had , and it frustrated me that i didn ' t .
