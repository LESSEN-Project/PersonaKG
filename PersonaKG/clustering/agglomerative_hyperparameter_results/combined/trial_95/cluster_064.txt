11. well , generally to change roommate arrangements you don ' t need to appeal to any official policy . my university ' s housing department pretty freely acknowledges that roommate relationships can be tense and at times getting out of the situation is the best solution . imaginably if you had any evidence of him stealing your silverware he could face some sort of negative consequences . a lot of people are surprisingly passive  aggressive and horrible at asserting their concerns in a productive way . dorm living is supposed to help remedy that type of thing , but it doesn ' t seem to . what he ' s doing in regards to your girlfriend is incredibly out of line , i commend you for not kicking his ass . since it ' s between semesters now is your perfect opportunity to move to a different dorm or have him removed from your dorm . i would not hesitate to contact whatever office at your university deals with student housing concerns .

13. i ' ve personally witnessed over digit baofengs being tested by fcc specs , the only ones that fail were the fake models sold by amcrest  foscam , and one seriously abused legit model . that means the legit models have a digit . digit  pass rate . it doesn ' t fail because your ignorant opinion says so . oh some doucenozzle completely screwed up the testing in his " lab " with equipment not certified to spec , no commercial verification , a quarter mile from a tower with commercial repeaters , and somehow the radio is what fails ? sorry i ' ve seen all those so called " spurious emission " pictures and videos , every single one that " fails " these baofengs do so because the tester is a complete moron running the test in a way to make them purposely fail , or only tests the worst of the fake models they bought for  digit from foscam  amcrest or some unknown model uv  5xyz from a no name seller . go troll somewhere else kiddo .
