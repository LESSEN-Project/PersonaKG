Total from this dataset: 443

1. i disagree to start off , kids have to do pe without choice of what they do until their second year of middle school at least from what we had and even when they finally get that chance to pick what pe they have , their parents may force them to do the sport they want for them . it isn ' t until highschool though that they can finally free up that spot in the day to have what they feel would better suit their future , for me and others that would be jrotc , and for others it would be ag or welding . once you get to highschool , you are responsible for choosing your career path , which can lead to a long day full of classes that will help you succeed in your chosen path , but you still have to complete core classes that take up valuable periods . adding another required class like pe for all four highschool years would rob the smarter teens and young adults their chance to experiment with what they feel would help them or to just make the day go by smoother . imagine having only two or three choices on what your aloud to do during your school day , most students won ' t actually use or even remember some of the things that they learn in their core classes because they will never use them in their jobs  careers . most band members have to drop out of band because they don ' t have enough free spots to do the things they love , imagine in your case i ' m assuming you enjoy sports that you had to drop out of the sport you loved because you have to do something else that someone else though would be important to you . do i think people should get exercise every day ? yes i do , i believe it ' s very important to help you succeed in life , but it should be reserved for after school when you have done the thing nessisary for your future path .

2. my mum taught me to lie to my dad about how much she spent on clothes from an early age . he knew we were lying and never challenged it . not sure why she insisted on lying about everything she bought , my dad couldn  t have cared less . nice memories
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

3. i use to do my homework straight after the teacher handed it out before she got to the last person so it was still in school time . i aint wasting my own gawd damn time !
   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

4. if they spent one more second looking around before asking me where something is , they would find that what they  re looking for is literally right in front of them .
   (ID: 3fb5cf32d13620677a9e3d9bd2657b8432abf31f)

5. you can ' t change it . people are always going to make jokes that you disagree with because offense and humour are both subjective . the best you can do is ignore it , because pointing it out will make people laugh at you instead of changing their ways .
   (ID: 009af0be6850d8d1ff9d388a3c7f39f0f7727594)

6. yes , i feel like people will think i am so gross if i go in the toilet and don ' t flush . i have no idea why i have the feeling that people care so much . lol

8. oh no . sorry about that . it used to be like that with my family too we celebrate evening of 24th and during the day on the 25th until i told them i have other people i wanna see during that time as well and now i can leave when i want
   (ID: 9721da66d978b8a2541ec60ba070b6fa9121482d)

9. dang that sounds like a tricky situation . i also have a shitty sister but she ' s not on drugs . just a serial bad attitude to everything , causes dramas because that ' s what she lives for . makes life tougher than it needs to be .
   (ID: d1e274dbfcf8ed1af55bb50c57e00046b961b6fd)

10. that ' s true , you can be assured that the kid will only have your vices and no one else ' s .
   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

11. accidents happen , but i follow a personal rule . if the toilet '  clean on arrival , i ' ll tidy up after myself out of respect . if there ' s already piss everywhere , there ' s no way i ' m putting my hands in another guy ' s piss .
   (ID: 68d36e5b5d26327bbb5de8de16430cc93353cbf0)

12. i avoid it if i can . i ' m going to fuck up with all those eyes staring at me . what if there ' s a good looking chick in the crowd ? my idea is going to be stupid and she won ' t like me . i took public speaking in college and that didn ' t help . the teacher didn ' t know how to teach and just told me what not to do . gave me no instructions on what to do when she critiqued me .
   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

13. fix the fear . they just have to be shown nothing is scary . good things should be happening . treats and whatnot .
   (ID: 23436d4a3b029dec718d52bd8f69b7b3bb78dd25)

14. people like that are really toxic , i personally think the best thing to do is stay away .
   (ID: 83ed088161a0acc5bb20774e9e10435e55e88737)

15. most of the time the  sass  is unintentional and  talking back  is often just asking for clarification about what i actually did wrong and trying to explain my point of view .
   (ID: fa9acab3fbd86b1f64e6380ef31b49912dae0c74)

16. i wouldn ' t . i would store it in a baggie and through at a teacher
   (ID: 79fc72ea72532d39a039ecb4e47a630a601ff4a8)

17. yta and the fact that even after being told explicitly why thousands of times and hearing your brothers feelings , you still think you  re in the right , only proves he  s better off without you in his life . you  re homophobic , your fiancee is homophobic . telling someone you love they can  t come to your wedding because their existence would bother other people is just about the worst thing you could do . just because you are  nice  about it doesn  t mean you  re a nice person . god forbid you have a gay kid .
   (ID: 280643182527d573e119c7952a08fea10d62edd8)

18. i still never finished my highschool english report
   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

19. she gave both of them the exact same treatment and even tried to get him to hang out at a different time . how is that playing favourites ? he doesn  t get to kick someone out of the friend group just because he  s not comfy around them anymore . everyone else is still friends with her . it doesn  t matter that he was around first , she  s here now and has just as much right to have friends as he does . it sucks that he missed out on game night because he didn  t want to see her , but that  s his problem , not op  s .
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)
