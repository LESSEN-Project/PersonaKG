1. raw , deep and fire infusions remove scaling for flat damage , they are good fir builds that dont want to invest the required stats . if you want dark or fire damages but with scaling use chaos and dark gemsthey scale with both faith and int and are really good for max level builds . lightning gems buff weapons with lightning damagewho would ' ve thought and add a faith scaling that only affects the lightning damage . good for pure faith builds but bad if you mix faith with str or dex bc buffs work way better . crystal gems are the same thing but for int and magic damage . blessed gems adds the faith scaling but only buffs damage already on the weapon , but makes you recover hp over time . really good to put on a shield to gain passive healing . simple gems are the same but for int and passively recover fp over time . a thing to note is that you cannot buff weapons infused with these gems so they are only good in certain cases , like a fire  chaos dagger for parries .

2. my duo is incredibly good on combat pro , and id say he is better than me on builder pro . you just need to adapt to combat like he did , he pretty much knows by nature what buttons to press . usually on cp players tend to misbuild and panic . i can say you do definitely make less mistakes on bp . if you think your building is good just work on your aim . being the best builder doesn  t mean you are the best player

3. I own a challenge.
   (ID: a69486a9dd78d1ba9533599ba57eac9079ca3c8d)

4. the timing can be a little tricky , but i like threatening roar much more than waboku in penguins . if you flip on your turn you have better access to nopenguins effect in my opinion . if your playing online , i would recommend mathemetician , dumps nope , and gets you a draw if it is destroyed by battle . it ' s very nice when your running threes , and it ' s also a pretty good creature swap target .
