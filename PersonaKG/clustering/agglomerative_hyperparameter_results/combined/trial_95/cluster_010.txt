3. she acted like you took up sooo much of her time whining about your poor baby . no . this woman is a cold lizard . she gave you the minimum and you are victim blaming yourself ! sorry . she sounds peeved that you are so sunk in your grief that you  ve forgotten the planets revolve around her ! well screw her . you are grieving your baby . what was her name ? where is he buried ? and what did she look like ? these are all such basic questions , for god  s sake that she could have asked ! because they mean something , and like any parent , you want to share your memories of your beloved infant . and you deserve to .

7. it is pretty gruesome most of the time . sometimes it ' s like far away shots where you can ' t really see anything but you know they ' re dying  dead . i ' m not sure why other people watch it , but for me it made death more real , if that makes sense . as someone who has never actually seen someone die in real life it has been informative . before i watched some of those videos it was like " oh , that sucks " when i ' d hear on the news that someone got shot , stabbed , in a car accident , died in a fire , etc . after seeing those kinds of videos i take more of a pause after hearing something like that . i take the moment to mourn a life that ' s been extinguished , and be thankful for how fortunate i have been . but that ' s just me . though i will say , i can ' t watch the ones with kids . i saw one video with kids and even now i want to vomit .

9. i ' ve seen it countless times , and every time it ' s " god , that ' s so sad . " it ' s this one in particular that gets me . likely because this happened when i was still young .
   (ID: 5ee4d4a98d2da62835d0e63abf8fe5bbfa95111b)

12. on my way to watch a football match . the attacks happened at about 3pm uk time if i remember rightly . it was the strangest atmosphere at any game i can remember watching , so subdued .
   (ID: 4420123abde71e42df266171d2bcb8a90afeed93)

13. maybe they should . how do we get them there ?
   (ID: d8333858181db719e67785c4ac2aa01282861e93)

14. yeah , i agree . but the point im raising is , if we can imagine a easier life like we think animals have regardless of the truth behind it , why can ' t we have it ? i mean we are really powerful and can practically have our world shaped anyway we like . why not a way that is easy to live ?
   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

15. even reading about that scene tears me up and thank you it ' s not that polished if you look closer lmao
   (ID: 2834b254700cedfb96641229b712899b4d697418)

16. i want us to be different from animals . as naive as that may sound . i don  t want us to operate on who  s the luckiest , who  s the meanest , who  s the most aggressive . i want us to operate on our empathy for one another . that ability should set us apart from animals . humans should not be actively fighting for their right to be animalistic . you should want to be as human as possible and look out for your fellow man . when present with this question , my question is the opposite . why do you feel that healthcare isn  t a human right ?
   (ID: f18b19a52bbf1505af84d01563a51626d4ae363f)

17. none . i think it ' s ridiculous to cry over the death of someone you don ' t know .
   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

19. animal abuse , because if you think its ok to do it you will get murdered within digit week . note  i love animals
   (ID: 4beccb79954eaf4ba6b69b6ac31b148b48f4f579)

20. the moose attack is what taught me to fear any and all large animals . probably explains why i feel so unnerved near horses  no antlers , but they could still wreck my innards in an instant .
