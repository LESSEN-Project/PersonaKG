   (ID: dc1fd340b3e0a603d715d06c129c512b8197c37b)

   (ID: 2904e4959568457dd43970d8388e42064d7c7d34)

   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

   (ID: c1e8a543083ba89c9353a25d98386cffe1addefc)

5. the issue was that he jungled non  stop regardless of . well , anything whilst also coming up with a terrible gpm . of course jungling and farming is a high priority for am but you want to be pushing waves more than hitting neutrals .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

6. could his terrible decision making and chronic lying and inordinate greed and hate mongering not infect every aspect of life in america ? i will stop talking about that guy and will actually stop thinking about him forever when he is in jail where he belongs . frankly , the fact that a person could commit this many freaking felonies with zero repercussions and still have people saying , " ew , can we just stop talking about him " let alone actual supporters denying that he is a con man and a criminal are a lot more remarkable to me than the fact that his behavior comes up every time the topic is " something stupid " or " something evil " or " something that needs to be changed  fixed " people who actually like america should be talking about it more . it will already take decades for us to repair the damage he ' s done so far . so yeah , he might come up in conversation proportionate to his impact on the world . if you would rather live in a place where nobody feels safe offering their opinion on politics , you could move to china .
   (ID: 54097549786e78808b0d9772bb36b401b5761588)

7. One of my favorite things is guys with more volume over rbbc/boom.
   (ID: 9c2d2fde31927b8cc3bc419049de8844ca720cb9)

8. cause trump would think of funny names for them like " beto the creepo " and " bad touch biden , " steal their thunder at every turn and make it hard to take them seriously . p . s . i didnt bother thinking up a name for bernie because hes too old to make it to digit .
   (ID: e91d4ec377d82dfdf21d71b4dc685a96ed60ea3d)

9. wayne is a recluse and walks with a limp . media spin to keep him relevant .
   (ID: 48904bae9572d5f97c653c59290dc9496ef8eed4)

10. deoxys . i feel like in real life he would be really versatile , be able to transform accordingly to situation in battle
   (ID: a04ffec23ab9c2af8d4ac433e06db2b5d1b4bf9b)

11. i see things a bit differently . no doubt your dad would appreciate a higher end and therefore more expensive turntable , but as an unexpected gift from his child , either of your options are priceless . go to the top of your budget and if your dad particularly likes audio technica , go with the best you can afford . i don  t know what other equipment you already have , but make sure that you have a pre  amp or integrated amp with a  phono  input or else keep enough money on one side for a suitable phono stage . good luck .

12. naw , it ' s doubtful . his wife also works there , and she is both gorgeous , and keeps a close eye on those he hires as his secretaries . in fact i am pretty sure it did the hiring . besides , if he was going to cheat on her , why would he pick someone who looks so similar ? i just wonder how a guy who has digit kids doesn ' t know what it sounds like for the woman to give birth . like during the call for example , towards the end , he was amazed that she knew what she was doing , and she laughed and told him it wasn ' t her first time  he knows full well we have digit children at home . he ' s here for supper at least every few weeks so they can go over work while i take them out for some quality time .
   (ID: 720bf2762acb0f756492e6e40ae840126dae87ce)

13. it ' s not really shepard anymore , the shepard ai has much bigger priorities than talking to an old crew now . everyone would think he just died during the crucible firing .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

14. i ' ll look for some of these myself . gakkou gurashi looked pretty promising and i still have k  on ! as a back  up , but i ' ll look for some more .

15. so my cat , franki , recently came down with a pretty severe stomach virus . the vet gave me some anti biotic drops to put in his food but when i  d do that franki wouldn  t touch it . so , the vet suggested using a small dropper tube to insert the medicine directly into his anus . the first time was absolute hell , my cat fought me the whole time but once the tube was in and the medicine pushed out he seemed to calm quite a bit . well the next day he was acting strange , he has always been an independent cat , rarely coming around , never wanting to be held , but as i sat on the couch he started walking back and forth meowing and rubbing my leg . he then went and jumped up on the table where we  d done the application the night before and meowed louder and louder until i decided i guess we will go ahead and do the medicine treatment . this time he didn  t fight me though , and when i inserted the tube he closed his eyes , stretched his neck , and let out a noise that can only be described as a moan of pure ecstasy . maybe the medicine made him feel better , i supposed . that night he slept on my bed curled up right next to me , which he had never done before . for the next week he  d do the same thing every day , meow on the table until he got his  fix  . but then the medicine ran out . even though i had no medicine he  d still cry and beg for it , i thought maybe if i insert it without medicine he will realize it doesn  t make him feel better anymore and forget about it . well that was digit weeks ago and he is only getting worse . he walks around me all day with his tail up presenting his rectum and trying to entice me . he is demanding insertions more and more often . yesterday i caught him looking longingly at the turkey baster . when i sit he jumps in my lap purring and rubbing me affectionately . it was then in horror i realized my cat thinks i  m his gay lover , and that i  ve been sexually pleasing him for weeks now . needless to say the sexual tension between us is palpable . how do i let my cat know that i  m not gay , but still like him as a friend ?

16. spoiler this makes me think of jason segel at the end of episode digit , season digit , of how i met your mother . what was he going through to produce a scene like that .
   (ID: ccc20fb024de820a5ad1bfc4117d69d6b7c3a6c9)

17. true , but if joji does play frank one last time for this , he can  t do the voice for long since his throat got damaged from doing it for a long time , he also won  t do comedy since he said he was done with franks comedy
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

18. that ' s true . i ' ve been killed while ducking as well so , you ' re right , he should ' ve been able to kill the gunner at some point even if he had been ducking .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

19. nope . you do know the president can just declassify everything he deems fit . if you think mueller is going to pull a fast one on trump , well i ' ve got some magic beans to sell you
   (ID: 648934b37b725276c14d737331453b5050aee063)
