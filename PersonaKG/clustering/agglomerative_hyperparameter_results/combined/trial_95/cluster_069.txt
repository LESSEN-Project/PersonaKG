8. finally , my time to tell a story . a long time ago , we had this one pizza chain in germany that let you create online accounts and you would receive a free pizza every three to four months but you needed to order something at least once . funnily enough , that order could consist of a coupon . add to that that creating accounts is fun with google , because you can add " . " to the mail to create a new account , but the mails still go to the normal gmail address without the dot . and i am not sure i remember right , but i think everything behind an underscore just didn ' t count too , so you could create example  01  , example  02  etc . mails . after a couple months of sharing that mail account with friends , we got digit  digit free pizzas every day . so yeah , we enjoyed abusing that exploit to get cheesy pizza .

9. does conspiracy track dropouts ? the app takes their reliability down , but that ' s it .  is it possible to report players for signing up and immediately resigning ? nope . you cannot do it anywhere that i am aware of actually . most places including conspiracy rely on a reliability system to make things civil . whether your system works is another story .  why bother signing up ? conspiracy ' s wonderful quality in being shiny , sleek and easy to use means there is an extra horde of curious onlookers who just want to install the app , hit play , and then . spend weeks rather than minutes playing a game . lots of folks can ' t understand that or care about reading the rules , so they just uninstall the app and disappear .

13. whenever i scroll past this i always think it says ' fantastic bright red cancer ' so i always double take and then read ' acer '
   (ID: 063ff05b3364c41fa72065634c0e90854c7272a4)

14. that is possible , but it doesn ' t mean i didn ' t really appreciate it , yet also feel a potential pang of sadness for having my own self esteem questioned for said appreciation for those who have called out reposts . i think i will always upvote those who think i missed their point .

20. they have thieves posing as admins preying on anyone that gets there attention . if you text on the board and say you ' re having a problem that ' s all it takes . here is an example how it starts out  i copied this " hello " deleted account , digit . digit . digit digit  digit i am xyo network admin . i understand you made a purchase and yet to receive your tokens right ? ' the next thing she did is offer a discounted purchase because of my trouble . bait i fell for it . she asked for my email , and i gave it to her . fool she sent a link to a page to get the instructions " for a deal because of my trouble " and i followed through . idiot it ' s an identical site with a bad deposit address . italics they will follow up in a few minutes to say everything went fine but your coins will be delayed several hours . so you don ' t panic immediately
