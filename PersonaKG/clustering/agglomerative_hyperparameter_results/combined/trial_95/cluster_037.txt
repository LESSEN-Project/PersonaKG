1. if your estate is insolvent everything you own doesn ' t cover the amount of debt owed then the estate is sold to cover what it can and the rest goes away . if your beneficiaries want to keep things , maybe a house or a valuable car , i ' m sure they can " trade " with the creditors for these things , but otherwise the beneficiaries won ' t get jack , and all your shit will just be sold off to pay the debts . edit for an example  i ' m poor and don ' t own much of anything . if i were to drop dead right now , the bank will get the car i ' m financing through them , unless someone decides to take up the payments , and my student loan debt just goes away .
