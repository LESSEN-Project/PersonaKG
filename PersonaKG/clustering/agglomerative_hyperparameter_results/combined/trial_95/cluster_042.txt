   (ID: f9f34c53011c38bf18b297061e7ed0a73cfc6eb5)

4. wow this must be one of the most arrogant things i ever read . so basically you are saying that grrm and d  d are not good enough story tellers plus us hard core fans are too stupid to pick up hints in the show unless you the leaker god start a discussion about them in order for us to be prepared for the bad writing and wouldn ' t get it without your help ? how many people did you just insult with this arrogant comment .

8. i highly recommend getting the nathan drake collection for ps4 that has the first digit games on it . you can decide for yourself which is your favorite but they all have a lot of great moments and it ' s worth playing from the start just to see how nate  elena met .
   (ID: a18adc4ad3b28b34dfa3063a1c77566b8681a79d)

9. if you don  t enjoy it and find no meaning from it at all from reading the book twice , then why are you attempting to force yourself to enjoy it through people who did ? if you didn  t like it then that should be the end of it , no ?
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

12. i was thinking plasma bursts from the sun . it would cause the burning without the radiation . i was originally thinking it could be gamma ray bursts  but there ' d be so much radiation there ' s no way anyone would have lived . but i also find that it ' s a trick question  it doesn ' t matter . that ' s all in the past . all that matters is surviving right now .
   (ID: 30506e41c4121e1e7573a25d4985de191de679c9)

13. scariest moment was in dino crisis . i had the volume turned up so i could here the click click click of raptor claws on the floor . the part where the t  rex head busts in through the window scared the fucking shit out of me . creepiest moment was in manhunt . at the end of the game where you face piggy , or pigsy or whatever the fuck that freaks name is . anyway i was sneaking around the room , staying in the shadows all ninja like . i waited there for like five or six minutes hoping pig boy would walk by but he never did . so i decide to move to another room , just as i am about to step out of the shadows and become visible i catch movement in the corner of the screen and ol piggy came walking out of the shadows along the other wall and left the room . he had been in the same damn room with me the entire time . i had a huge cold chill run down my back because i had literally been just a hair away from walking out into the open and him seeing me , and thus raping my ass royally . plus that dude looked creepy as hell .
   (ID: 7ebdc00c75f6f836557e13d39a9efb279ed2ef7a)

14. blood meridian was actually where my research landed me . sounds like a great read . as for the other two , do you think having seen the movies will rob some of the experience ? obviously the books will be better , but will knowing the story beats sap any of the flavour ?
   (ID: 9cfb696c79a211a1c5a060dfb2265f65983eeeec)

15. My books is a song of ice and fire.
   (ID: 18e18998471794de2ee0ded08a5f57a45a336e24)

16. for me it was oregairu , when i first watched i was at a point in my life where i acted very similar to the main character , and i hated that . the main characters actions never did anything but make me dislike the character , when i finally realized how similar i was to the mc i decided i wanted to be more positive and get better at making friends . while now i don ' t have a lot friends , i do have more than i used to and am a generally happy person . i think that if i never watched that show i would be much less happy with who i am now . tl  dr  oregairu made me realize the reason i wasn ' t happy is that i hated the kind of person i was .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

17. i think it would be cringy , they might be able to make it m if they just did a bunch of really dark hive stuff , but gore and language isn  t always good .
   (ID: f8a8648f114c1dd8984a809bd49816978d9970c0)

18. no . why would you ? would you read the last chapter of a book if you haven ' t read the rest ?
   (ID: 5147e830e7cfa538d6990a8699ad6462b57cfb52)

19. hercules . it ' s hard for me to sit through the movie now , nearly every line in the entire movie is some sort of mythological reference or joke . great movie too .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

20. when you ' re the only one in your first grade class whose favorite novel is frankenstein , it dawns on you that you might not be normal .
