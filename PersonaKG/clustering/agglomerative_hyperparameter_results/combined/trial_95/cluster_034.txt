20. the fact that he is threatening you is very worrisome . if it ' s your house , you need to get him out before he starts to act on those threats . even if it means having the police come escort him . if it ' s his house , you need to just leave . go stay with friends or family . at this point , your safety should be top priority . also , if he threatened you and then went immediately into sad pup mode , it sounds like he ' s trying to manipulate you . don ' t let him . manipulators will say or do anything to get their way . and when it stops working is when the violence starts . you might have to keep the pants on just a little longer to boss him out the door ! but i hope everything works out for you . good luck .
