19. by that logic , we shouldn  t allow driving at all because it increases the risks of harm to people and people  s pets . it is already being worked on self driving cars to minimise the potential of crashes . here is a article about that  dough i do understand what you are trying to say , i would still just do rules like that because still , it puts the animals in danger . earlier you said that weed lessens the aggression , but sooner or later other drugs will be legalized where they do make people more aggressive . that is the problem . by just having rules like that it would atleast prevent a few drug users to buy pets , which is better then nothing wouldn ' t you say ? sure it maybe just prevents digit drug users from buying pets , but thats better then nothing in my opinion .
