   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

2. i just think it ' s a crack pot idea . like the shows are separate , i don ' t think it would be " cool " because it ' s random . it would just confuse people who never watched westworld .
   (ID: 8a45584f421735874a74f108ab7578f85dee40cd)

3. just leave a picture . people will understand .

4. thank you ! if it happens , i  ll be sure to get you a picture .
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

5. from how i read it , the guy just wants a few guiding tips on how to get better , lets face it , there is literally zero assistance . hopefully tutorials are next patch ! but on the other hand starting out , it ' s difficult to know what is what without external resources .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

6. can this get more attention ? i want to see this in best later on , thank you !
   (ID: c50479206ad2428ecdc02592a82261c4f2ae30a5)

7. thanks , it all seems pricey . i hope she goes down the " patreon girl " route . that would e very interesting
   (ID: 4ffb044c26007ae2bade7d602b40fcd747aae147)

8. i was waiting for this to come up . i knew there had to be a documentary about ny taxis and uber . do you remember or can find the name of the one you watched ? i ' m genuinely interested . i do not live inna place even remotely similar and i have taken precisely digit taxis in my entire life , so i am genuinely fascinated by this whole topic .
   (ID: aa8abed66c32a0519ab922c1a606563d97de28fc)

9. try this one . hope you like it !
   (ID: a7cc693c08ec25a5aeb346572b504a32001418a5)

10. this is exactly what i have been thinking for a whole lot of time !
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

11. i like the lange immunology and microbiology review book . explains immuno very well i  m a book nut , but not a textbook nut and you get some important micro out of it as well . good questions at the end of most of the chapters as well . just my . digit
   (ID: 4751dd6f6e1bc0e55d1193f8d9e0a104d87e9e98)

12. emailing would definitely be your best bet . your wording of the email i extremely important , and i  ve been told by my research mentor that a majority won  t answer you . you have to keep on emailing not spamming them , wait a few intervals of time before emailing again
   (ID: d9ec7752117a31823171b7cfc56b1cf267be53df)

13. in a word  no . writing is tiring for me and the number of stories would push the thread well into tl  dr territory . i ' ll keep writing these and posting when i can and if you don ' t like it you can just not read them .
   (ID: 4d17a8a4d7907bba6d158e8a0b9c3504d69be003)

14. my thoughts on them , while not having seen them , is that i probably won ' t watch them . documentaries are supposed to be even  handed approaches to complex situations , but often end up being propaganda with a little egalitarian flavor . i have absolutely nothing against vegetarianism or veganism or pescatarianism or whatever , just documentaries with a mission .
   (ID: df28c2a39b633ca418192316a199668289382292)

15. try to advertise as much but in a nice and respectful way on big trending channels where you ' ll most likely be noticed , i do the samei don ' t really ask ppl to sub to me but they do tho and i ' ve gotten almost digit subs already in a few months , also try to make content on what ' s popular right now and add as many tags in the desc of your videoif you add really many tags your video might even become the 1st shown for a specific search
   (ID: a443986595c715cd541cd3925619cb6f1e8ada83)

16. i just wanted to say thank you , to you and everyone involved , you guys are amazing and i love your work . question wise , if you could cover anything in the marvel universe , what show would you make ?
   (ID: 81d70b67b241a70f23e355cf7b40f5e937ce7cb9)

17. didn ' t know it was netflix show  movie . i do see their ads on youtube , but not for this . my curiosity has been piqued , however so i will probably track it down .
   (ID: 2266c34274940e2ea1a22a3dee5a3cbcdad25f53)

18. i like it . btw , can you recruit a few people ? need to get started , to draw in experts .
   (ID: e1cfe7e3bd4f78988caf9c6fd043691888e401c8)

19. thank you for answering and i don ' t mind the flak , especially if some others learn something and maybe can lend a hand . you have my upvote and keep and being strong . i suggest to all to visit the above subreddit and meet with your fellow humans !
   (ID: 4972a31c1a3df007d761e27a613a3b6a99c3a0ca)

20. i like your idea , ill create some art around this
