13. i ' ve tried but don ' t really have the patience for it . the whole point is to take a moment to remember the dream before starting your day . if you wake up to a dream and your mind goes right into planning the day , you ' ll forget it quickly . dream journals help by preventing that and also help you to recall more of the dream . the more you recall your dreams , the more you ' ll remember them . it ' s a cycle that you need to keep doing . but that why i don ' t need a dream journal . i already remember at least digit or digit dreams every night . the other major advantage of a dream jounal is to be able to look through your entries and pick out the things that are most common . you can then take those things and make them a trigger to go lucid . for me , one of those triggers is a full moon . if i see that i instantly know if it ' s a dream and can take control .
