2. everything in life is scary , but think of all of the higher paying jobs that come with a diploma . if i were you i ' d try to think of it as a new adventure and you could always go back home if it ' s to much for you to handle . either way i wish you good luck
   (ID: af0c660bb723d5afb410ddb2f8b9e5f271ae2703)

3. i get you , but how about we take it from a metaphorical angle , rather that lateral ? for example , you would metaphorically go hell due to angry masturbating over indecent images of cement . why ? hell i don ' t know what but that sure is a strange fetish to have there is no way you ' re getting into metaphorical heaven acting like that . right ?
   (ID: 39ba9a65a55c27b50eef7c5cecbc66cc866c4a4c)

4. silly string attack ! also , a senior chose my costume , and i was a fucking sumo wrestler . i ' m a girl . silly string is hard to get out of long hair , and i knew that from experience . so guess what happened . the world ' s longest shower !
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

5. there are several reasons why people prefer to use audio . these are a few . 1efficiency  cuts down on cpu 2creativity  there  s a certain forward motion that comes from printing it and moving on . 3originality  you can work with audio in lots of ways you can  t with midi . this gives you a lot more options in tailoring your sounds or running it through other samplers etc . 4transferability  if you give it to another engineer , you know he  she is getting just what you intended . 5quality  to be honest i can  t speak with great authority on the science but my intuition tells me you probably get less aliasing errors with printed audio . freezing , stacking , etc . all of these achieve number digit . if your system  s bogged down it  s a no brainer . but in in my opinion , it takes about the same time to run an offline bounce or commit as it does to freeze it  s a bit longer but fast so why not capitalize on all the advantages ? hope this helps !
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

8. money . your credit score probably . not paying yourself until a certain point down the road . appealing to partners  being adaptable but also stern . you want to be able to change to make it better but you don ' t want to be too flexible otherwise it looks like you aren ' t prepared for it . you also don ' t want to burn bridges with people because that can haunt you , and it ' s easy to do so by showing a plan to a lot of people in your area and getting rejected . how you ' re going to get people to listen to you . budgeting , how you ' re going to outsource some things , does it have the option to be scaleable ? among other things . edit  keeping in contact with those that reject you and revisiting them again when you ' re doing better than before , when it ' s not just a plan but you ' ve acted on it and this is what can happen with the potential for more . also , with your whole time focused on the start up , figure out a way to support yourself financially . you might have to cut down a lot . this will show a lot of people commitment and not just that but it might teach you a lot of valueable skills like resilience and resourcefulness .
   (ID: a3811395c0f6d89e991295b692a54743e657581e)

9. I follow politics.

11. if keeping your mind and hands occupied is helpful to you like it is me , you can make that work for you . learning an instrument is an amazing way to keep your anxiety at bay . and unlike games , you will gain endless social benefits and confidence that will help you tremendously !
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

12. find money , hide it and pretend i wasn  t aware everyone was missing and pretend that i have always been saving for a rainy day .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

13. decide that you want something and put some effort into it . even if it isn ' t worth while long term , working earnestly towards a goal can alleviate that feeling and help you realize what you are capable of
   (ID: 2b53241b2b7d7e4ce58f4e39589b18bda4d0d5d2)

14. well , if memories could be restored and uploaded in the new brain , that person could live some of his life back again , finishing whatever they had left before dying , or just because they have the money , and don ' t want to die yet , to learn about cultures faster and shit . like a hard drive that you can manipulate but then you can restore it as how you got it . i dunno man , i ' m pretty drunk .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

15. life would be a lot shorter , therefore you would have less time to do things . you mayaswell make the most of the time you have and do the things you ' ve always wanted to do , no matter how risky they can be . e . g bungee jumping
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

16. forensic psychology seems like the perfect fit for you and i think the extra schooling would be worth it to work in a field that mixed two subjects that you love . the fact that you already have experience in both psych and law gives you a great advantage , especially for graduate school . i  d say that keeping your options open is a great plan , but shooting towards your goal in forensics sounds like it would greatly pay off !
   (ID: d9ec7752117a31823171b7cfc56b1cf267be53df)

17. that the secret about wealth you can do a lot of nasty stuff to get wealthy but once you are you just need to fade in the shadow start a charitable foundation , put a sizable fraction of your wealth in it and your family name will eventually be restored to respectability . your wealth will quickly recover and sore to even higher level and with respectability come political power not really for you but for your heir who will be able to enjoy the wealth without any shame . am not talking rich or millionaires that small potatoes . wealthy is intangible it a zone that start somewhere between multi  millionaires and bill gates . lucas does not fit that mold properly he never did anything wrong beside screwing over a few actors and the prequel fiasco . so that make his charitable endeavour a lot more important .

18. whatever i want then i can become a murderer and it hurts no  one now

19. have you ever heard of opposite action ? what option you want to choose or what you feel like doing , do the opposite . i ' m like this too . i ' m trying to do opposite action but obviously it ' s not too easy , but i have things i need to change , and i can ' t help myself if i keep doing everything the same . breaking a habit . i ' m struggling right now .
