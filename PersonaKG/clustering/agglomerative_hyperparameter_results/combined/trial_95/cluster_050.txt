1. that ' s my fetish .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

2. i m sent much of a talker . my ex used to ask me to call her a bad girl . she would say things like " what are you gonna do to me " " i wanna feel your balls slap against my ass " i want your fucking cum all over me " she said this almost everytime " am i a bad girl " . and " oh my god i ' m so fucking wet " she was very vocal another girl was more directive during sex saying things like " let me sit on your cock " and i want you to take me from behind . i did used to like to stop mid sex and tease my cock on the edge of her pussy and whisper into her ear things like " do you want it " " tell me you want my cock " " beg me " until they said those things i ' d just keep teasing them
   (ID: 4ffb044c26007ae2bade7d602b40fcd747aae147)

3. what  s it like having tits ? is it more of a hinderance ? because being able to turn any man on just by showing them seems . unreal
   (ID: 1497e82ba6e08f938dadf0885a6fd8051c0758d1)

4. guy here . because its always followed with a " why " and that leads to more conversation they don ' t want to have with you .
   (ID: b5f9b695867ef3b560a4fe7610f75e43b62809f6)

5. it ' s just a locker room . you are making things way more complicated than they should be
   (ID: bd005ac438966eb1f8d6de10fcb1bb6fd4565782)

6. this is good , because i look just like ww1 you . at least two people would also compare you to me .
   (ID: 2168250be01c43791f88e7c8ad875c0396307047)

7. no way , and i don ' t recommend anybody to date someone who has a carbon copy of their personality . i ' d prefer someone that is a good balance for my weaknesses for instance i have a useless sense of direction and can be stubborn often . i want to date someone who will make me a better person , not who is a mirror of myself .
   (ID: 65e18a8843fe1a6d644e4fe6a3b227426a6b9103)

8. okay even digit months would be a good waiting point . to think that you need to have sex after a few months of dating is ridiculous . i wonder how many people have fallen in love with a person and they get emotionally and mentally connected to a person because of sex and that relationship ends up not lasting and mentally fucks their head . same reason why most people have trust issues in relationships and are afraid that their partner is going to bang someone else . also there were digit , digit , digit abortions globally in digit digit  of the global births . majority of those abortions were of young women that couldn  t financially or mentally take care of the child . there  s a reason why it  s better to wait til you  re married or until you  re grown up enough because sex is meant for recreation not for fun and making each other feel good which obviously this generation has forgotten .
   (ID: f8dc0ff928f07f3c544894b03ad92f5944e13321)

9. nauseated . is this some fantasy of yours as a neckbeared ?
   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

10. not a woman and i can say yes to this . when i talk to someone i look at there eyes and when they move , cant help to trace the direction . while cleavages is just below the face , id say its pretty damn obvious
   (ID: ea4bfffa24eb7289b7b7bdfe0eded204916c7fd9)

11. i don ' t think someone ' s sexual orientation affects how they relate with their parents . i ' ve always been super close with my dad before and after coming out . i don ' t think i have a different relationship than either of my straight siblings .
   (ID: 183a5eea32f2c73a87c734920d3188862433e411)

12. preventive medicine . no more mammograms for me !
   (ID: f82f3baec2974026f7aecc84e871be136212e237)

13. not if your education sucks and youre on internet to try and make others think a big penis does the job . lmao don ' t worry , most people saying this are arrogant or uneducated .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

14. she is violating the child ' s body by having it torn up and sucked out of her . she is using the child ' s life as a sacrifice to her convenience . yes , slavery is always wrong . in a perfect world this wouldn ' t be a problem in the first place . but in the real world i choose the lesser of two evils . taking an innocent life to prevent your own suffering is wrong . please be intellectually honest and stop using the fringe cases as an excuse to justify the common occurrence . they are definitely worth considering , but even if they were justifiable , it doesn ' t mean the others are . i am pretty sure i have heard every reason that pro  choice advocates have for abortion . and so far , they don ' t change what i see as a very simple truth . it is always morally wrong to take an innocent human life . and , though you are free to disagree with my view on morality , i can ' t think of anything worse that one person could do to another . saving innocent life  saving bodily autonomy .
   (ID: 0dc000fb7dee9665369f1cbde3eeaeb51cd0c052)

15. why do people care so much about sex ? i can pleasure myself and don ' t have to be nervous about disappointing someone else . edit  why do i always get downvoted when i don ' t understand something ?
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

16. a male ? where  s your cleavage ? where am i ? what year is it ? on a serious note though good job !
   (ID: dd0e84182036131d3b7cbc9bcb07384502b3c1a8)

17. i relationship is a commitment . i guess it isnt just women but people today want the benefits of the relationship without the ups and downs . also women expect to shoot a man down who has been courting them and have the dude treat them the exact same . i wouldn ' t treat anyone as well as i treat my wife .
   (ID: d6e89a045ccd97a556ff87527d8a08a8e3c89fc1)

18. what on earth is a fwb relationship ?
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

19. what ? nobody views rape as part of the assimilation process . are you nuts ? let me guess  you  ll say it  s left wingers who do right ? i  m more central but can assure you that nobody who is sane thinks that rape is cultural  because it happens in every culture  including your own .
   (ID: b4052c69cfd7bf0df0101b2dcc97fc007ad28841)

20. you not gonna flair it nsfw , you can clearly see some hangage
