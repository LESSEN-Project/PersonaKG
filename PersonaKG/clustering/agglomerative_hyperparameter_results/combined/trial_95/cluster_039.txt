   (ID: 30572ac5982532854b2ead41285ed9bbaba6d654)

8. nta judging by the fact you could pay off all her debt , plus buy her a new car it was obviously a decently large sum , that i agree with you i would not just randomly hand out to a girlfriend of digit months that you do not live with or are engaged to . maybe you could of helped her a little if you really wanted to , but you have no obligation to give her that money , or justify how you spend your hard earned money .

   (ID: dea1673e29d00bc1a88d1c231b63981344044a2e)

15. nah . i don  t think it  s really that big of a deal for her to go back and grab a couple of things while you are ringing up groceries as long as you  re not already done scanning and other people including you aren  t having to wait several minutes on her . on the other hand , i don  t think you were necessarily in the wrong . i mean , i understand your reasoning . if it is something that bothers you , you have the right to voice that . it  s probably something to bring up in the car on the way home or at home and not at the store , however .
