8. if it isn ' t on your contract , you ' re not getting it . this is the most important thing to remember . if your recruiter promised ranger school and you don ' t have " option digit " on your contract , you won ' t get it . if you haven ' t shipped out yet , its not too late to back out . even after you get to basic , you can still get out . i know people who figured out that they weren ' t cut out for military service , talked to the drill sergeants , and got an entry level separation . they don ' t make it pleasant , but it happens . tell people not to send packages . you ' ll have to open them in front of the drill sergeants , and you ' ll be punished for any contraband don ' t try to sneak a cell phone in . it ' s not worth it . for the love of god , keep your weapon with you at all times . if you ' re sitting down , make sure the strap is wrapped around your arm . drill sergeants will try to take it from you , and you ' ll be punished if they can . you ' re all going to fuck up . even if you do everything absolutely perfectly , you ' ll still all get punished for whatever the drill sergeant can think of . they ' ll find the smallest thing wrong and punish all of you for it . physical fitness is very important . if you can ' t pass the apft , don ' t even try to join until you get in shape learn the ranks before you go in

18. you ' re staying strong mate , good to hear . it might be unnecessary to reward yourself ' cos you ' re doing so well anyway , but you could always treat yourself with something like a massage , pamper treatment or the like . your way of rewarding you , if you think about your winnings and the fact you ' re not pissing your money away on booze instead like we all have , i reckon it is well deserved ! not your thing ? ziplining ?
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

19. thank you so much for answering my questions ! i have some follow up questions . regarding the shower situation , in the navy , are you allowed to wake up earlier than your peers to shower or does everyone have to shower at the same time ? like , can you wake up earlier , quickly shower and get dressed ? so while most are asleep , i ' ll avoid having many people surrounding me ? open showers aside in boot camp , will i go through any other situations where i ' d be openly nude among my peers ? or is everything regarding medical  etc . you will have privacy ? i don ' t mind being " known " if it ' s one or two other professional doctors  etc . but i ' m worried about that when it comes to other cadets .   x200b  when you say steady supply of t , do you mean at home or physically with me ? thank you again ! i truly appreciate it !
   (ID: 3510b342268f3bc4c3f1e402201d7c565dfb7648)
