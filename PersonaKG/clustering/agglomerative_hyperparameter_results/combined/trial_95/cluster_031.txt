15. yeah no shit if you suck at driving and break traffic laws that ' s illegal . i ' m saying that for most people a couple of drinks won ' t make them drunk enough to not be able to drive correctly . drinking and driving isn ' t some black and white issue where the second a drop of beer hits your tounge you can ' t drive . obviously if you hammer down a fifth of vodka you can ' t drive home . but unless you have no natural tolerance , having two drinks over the course of an hour and driving home is a perfectly fine thing to do
