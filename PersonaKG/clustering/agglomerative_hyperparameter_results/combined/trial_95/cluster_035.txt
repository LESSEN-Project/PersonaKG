1. you know what would happen you said to all of the billionaires " hey big bank account boys i ' m going to need to you to hand over everything you have so that overall you ' re only able to be worth digit million dollars " they would say " alright let me just get that to you right after i move all of my assets to another country that ' s not going to steal my money and possessions that i earned , oh wait a minute now that i have my assets and myself out of the country you cant tax me and you ' re now losing millions in tax revenue "
   (ID: feb4a6aeed8e7e14b0592329bd91d7933a93217e)

2. the guy in the red hats balls would be well out of play . how much is this really teaching people ?
   (ID: 9284af9896fed617d56596c55fb3ff4e8a4c8dde)

3. like i own the xs and i taught that the price was worth it , but i was upgrading form the se , tbh the only person that know that answer is you grinning  face  with  sweat
   (ID: 87173aaf55980a77c94bd30c851c39fb0b52ff2e)

4. i put this in vacuum to have an easier fight to determine . if the brits and norwegians intervene i could argue that the russian could launch far more than digit tu  22m ' s and digit mig  digit ' s , they could launch digit times that and launch even more kinds of aircraft . then i could launch all remaining submarines of the northern fleet along digit aging tu  digit bears armed with even more stand  off missiles . let ' s just say that if this fight is not in a vacuum this would be a total clusterfuck with hundred of aircraft on each side along dozens upon dozens of subs and surface combatants . little counter edit to yours  well , what would be the point of making this thread if no one knows where the enemy is ? if i didn ' t make the scenario this way the winner would obviously be the first one to know where the other is . this is  whowouldwin afterall . maybe switch the virginias for another sub ? i honestly picked random subs for each side since i don ' t know much about subs , i like surface vessels a lot more .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

5. i don ' t consider it a waste . at the risk of sounding ignorant , budget has no impact on how i grow . my personal grow is my hobby and stuff i want to do like plant manipulation or literal pet projects . if i get the right seed combo , i could make potential f1s that yield ungodly amounts per ft2 . if i get the wrong seed combo , i just made a new genetic that none of my friends have . so to me , that sounds like a win  win and not the loss  loss you want to present it as .
   (ID: e978c4c5dd931b8985b65369abe1ef855c833aa3)

6. but why ? they obviously deliberately designed it to be bumpy . i for one like it .
   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

7. listen i ' m pretty sure this is how we prevent every robot uprising scenario that movies have shown us , so i ' d say it ' s a worthwhile use of air and time .
   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

8. i felt the same way in the past . but maybe the fact there is no objective point is a good think ! you can choose to do something or absolutely nothing .
   (ID: cae6d1fb1a818280e66de4a71148560d2d217d70)

9. i leave them on cause i like to carry people and when i put up posts on discord or the destiny app so people can message me so i can help in comp
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

10. i own a meat company , we sell steak chicken seafood and pork , we set up big circus tents in the parking lot of the malls , when i don ' t have enough business coming in , i go drum some up . but why does it matter what i am talking to people about , or what i am selling ? all that should matter is , is it illegal , or is it not ? i have all of my required health permits from the state of tx . but this health permit obviously is not good enough for every single incorporated city who has a city council , who can make up any kind of ordinance that they feel it ' s like making that day .
   (ID: 4d69affb6415148eda5d5103b282ce15476169d5)

11. did you ever stop to think that some of us might want a massive explosion to wipe out mankind ?
   (ID: 9789fadf3a050c71c64ca7e31c4857fc9094d643)

12. and make youtube the platform everyone wants it to be . twitch thots will no longer be a thing . and everyone gets monetized no matter what unless you ' re extremely racist
   (ID: 5be7ef463c3ba0c7a9c255bd9769c5f638d2b805)

13. they might be mistaken for antifa and get run over again . too much of a risk tbh . plus , you can show your disapproval online on a website made specifically to tell congress howbstupid their idea is .
   (ID: 9a96ba583f43f670f5797ea5031052161bf613cf)

14. i just don ' t understand why anyone would want that instead of physical keys
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

15. i have the same question , they are useless
   (ID: 0cfe15b45fa033fe460b061d1625e4bb67bab696)

16. because you don  t wanna our all your apples in one basket amirite .
   (ID: 787f4a3fe31691883105c973a6b8e3df9df1436e)

17. my favorite conspiracy theory is that if we keep dumping that stuff into the water it will turn the frogs gay , mind you some frogs change their genders .
   (ID: 8cdbf7ed2ace2eeed8bd2b0e2e86001342f83a1f)

18. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

19. even as a bucket list , they literally have about at least digit ish months to figure out a situation for their kids or even longer since returning attendees get their tickets in november so in my opinion there is no excuse honestly . i mean i understand if they only have like one day to figure it out  they don ' t want to miss the event that badly but several months ahead ? come on .
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

20. that actually sounds like a good idea . the only problem i see possible is where do they go for work afterwards ?
