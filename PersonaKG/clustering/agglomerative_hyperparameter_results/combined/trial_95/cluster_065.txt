1. my problem with quidditch is that as a sport it makes no sense , because catching the snitch is worth too many points . nothing the other players do is likely to matter . as a plot device in a book so that the main character can be special , it works fine , as an actual sport , it ' s retarded . it would probably be fun to watch the first couple times just for the novelty factor of a sport people play while flying , but after that i ' m guessing it would get old .

8. hockey , it  s such a chaotic sport . players are on the ice for digit seconds and you  re basically reacting to the puck until you see a good shot . it  s hard to shave points with so many variables
   (ID: 18e18998471794de2ee0ded08a5f57a45a336e24)

9. portkeys are a fairly common spawn if you have inventory space , just walk around a bit and they will come . as for the map , what you see is what you get . depending on how active local players are , there may be a discord group where you guys can get organized and share nest locations , ideal grinding spots , etc .

17. shakeyjake is dead on . eventually , you ' ll be able to feel a bad throw coming before you even let go of the dart and its the worst feeling ever lol . last night i was playing and as i started my throw , i knew nothing good was going to come of it . i had screamed " you fucking idiot ! " before i even let go of the dart . there is a connection with your eye and your motion that will develop , and it comes from repeatedly throwing with a smooth motion , the same mechanics , and confidence in what you are doing . it sounds like you just started playing , so it definitely will take some practice . good luck
