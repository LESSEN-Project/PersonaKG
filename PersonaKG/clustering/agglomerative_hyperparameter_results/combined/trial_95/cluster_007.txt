17. crap , i like playing support characters because i am not too great at gw2 when it comes to playing against people as it is my first mmo and i don ' t even know if my builds are any good . the server i play on is henge of denravi , when i play , there is hardly ever anybody on because of the time difference . over the past month i have not been playing gw2 as much because i have hit a wall . i do love jumping into a zerg as a sup gaurd or just tailing a small group i don ' t enjoy pve much since i have run all the dungeon paths multiple times , farmed the crap out of world bosses and getting my ass handed to me in pvp over and over isn ' t appealing . the only thing that has got me coming back is my guildies and doing living world because my so likes living world stuff so we do that together . i have the nbn where i am so latency is not an issue for me tbh , but i spent most of my time playing on an adsl1 connection with an average digit . 5mb speed , latency was a killer . but now the only issue i have with being able to play the game is the constant drops in connection , it ' s not my pc or internet connection either , if my so is playing at the same time she usually drops a few seconds after me . have run a tracert on the hod ip address , it always seems to time out around the 40th  43rd hop so there is nothing i can do about it . because of the drops i can hardly play let alone compete lol .
