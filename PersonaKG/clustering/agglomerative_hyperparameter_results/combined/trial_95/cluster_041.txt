   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

   (ID: cbed067932829315de162cb512843a4f6b1083b7)

14. you know when you ' re trying to open a garage door or something and you have to spam the shit out of your button ? i ' d love to see the same option that uncharted digit has , in the settings of that game you can change it so that you can just hold down the button rather than spam it . honestly sometimes my thumb just cant move that fast so i have to hold the controller in an awkward way just so i can spam the button with my middle finger , the whole ordeal doesn ' t add anything to my enjoyment of the game , it just annoys me .

   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

20. ah , well in this case i ' m not sure , sorry ! i guess what you want is a way of speeding up the responsiveness of actions , but unless you actually had a system to play with and test ideas i don ' t know how it would actually behave .
