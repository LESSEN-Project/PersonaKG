18. thank you for your words and your reply . it means a lot . i don ' t have any pain , but i think as of recently two weeks or so i probably lost some sensitivity . my ring finger lays against my middle finger just a tiny bit . at the same time , i also haven ' t been using my right hand  wrist to it ' s full ability so perhaps i haven ' t aggravated it as much as possible with what it ' s physically capable of . being scared isn ' t helping it though and i think is what caused the finger  touching . idk . it ' s kind of " tucked in there " , both my doctor and my surgeon told me i lucked out with it . i won ' t get it out myself and i ' ll follow up with my surgeon . i had a ct scan yesterday , i think i will call right now and inform them that whatever they see in the images is bothering me more and more and i don ' t think i can wait until march . sldkjsldkcx

20. that day wasn  t really that bad . the day where everything went wrong . i was just and average person  well above average . having the ability to change certain aspects of your personality based on what you eat is definitely not normal . yes , that day was okay . i  ve never eaten that much food in my life . i ran out of things to eat . i started to think about doing things i never should  ve thought of doing . that guy walking down the street looked happy . he looked like he was having a good day . boy did that change . it was an impulse . a gut reaction . i guess after eating all that food i became a hungry slob . i became what i ate . that man seemed so innocent . it  s not my fault i killed him . it  s not my fault he tasted so good . but now i  m going crazy . i can  t get enough . who  s next ?
