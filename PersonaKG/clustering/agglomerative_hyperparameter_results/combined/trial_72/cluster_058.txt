9. if i look at the architects i ' ve met  heard speak who have been somewhat successful , they were contrarians for much of their early careers . they did something different and found a way to stand out , and customers followed . i suspect these people knew very early on that their vision was different , and just dove in and made that sacrifice . as much as it pains me to say so , this is sorta the theme of the fountainhead . few books laboriously make the point about how bad most architecture is and serves up visceral contrarianism in the form of a crypto  flw biography . i ' m willing to bet that mockbee knew his shit smelled like flowers , or just didn ' t care . if you ' re that sure of yourself , then fuck everybody else and go for it . otherwise , architecture is just another job , and one that isn ' t going to pay that great . engineers , software , health care , those are the last jobs in the west that will bring reasonable salaries . the middle class is shrinking , find something that stays at the top of it .

10. just relax . masturbating is supposed to be fun . how could it ever be fun doing it the way you ' re doing it ? how is it possible not get off from your own mind creating things and scenarios , that you sexually desire ? i ' m just gonna say " bullshit " everyone loves daydreaming about sex . so if you can ' t turn yourself on mentally  don ' t enjoy doing that , and you also don ' t like porn i call bullshit again why the fuck are you even trying to masturbate ? are you sure that ' s what you ' re doing ? i ' m just fucking with ya don ' t get all butthurt now lol of course you can ' t orgasm . in order to get " off " you first have to learn to get " on " masturbation is a natural fluid process , one that shouldn ' t ever take this much effort . you ' re fucking yourself from fucking yourself . stop it .
