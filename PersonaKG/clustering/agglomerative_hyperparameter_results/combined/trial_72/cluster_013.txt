18. want to make it even more creepy ? all milk is breast milk . you just usually drink milk from some random other animal that wasn ' t even meant for you . then we all think of ourselves as being better than that digit year old chilean kid who was found nursing on a dog . wtf humans ?
   (ID: 650ba9cdaca39ad1c1fe5e6348b11afb4d8e7a0f)

19. sure it ' s avoidable . kids can be very reasonable if you know what you ' re doing and address the problem correctly . let ' s say your young child does something wrong , and you spank them . do you think they really understand what they did wrong  why it was wrong , or are they suddenly behaving because they ' re afraid of being spanked again ? fear based discipline like that can often create kids that are better at hiding their bad behavior around authority .
