   (ID: 417f107ec53971c82b0d9bb8ee79067ec512bdbb)

10. if done right , a collection of vignettes can be incredibly engaging . suttree by cormac mccarthy is a prime example of this , or steinbeck ' s cannery row . one of the things that makes it doable is how the vignettes tap into the reader ' s humanity  there is something they can connect with . i think it ' s a cool idea . who cares if it ' s the in thing right now .

   (ID: 20b71c431f98b1f88ec1b3e7ada79d31df65a8c2)

15. i hope this doesn ' t get buried in here . having kids is so hard . i wouldn ' t say regret . but after digit kids , oldest is digit and youngest is digit , it has been hard . they have had situations and problems that are not the normal problems . what ' s even harder is , the grandkids . you raise your kids the best you can , being all stressed out and stuff . and they have problems that can not be helped . one of them is mentally  emotionally disabled and has a bad life and wants to bring in digit kids to the mix ! and , as a grandparent , you can ' t do a thing about it ! you can help your own kid , but not your grandkid ! not if the parent doesn ' t want your help . tl  dr   you think having kids is bad when they are young . when they get out on their own , that ' s when you really worry .

   (ID: 0861712f8592c280471770109eb434101eb06dca)

17. if u say ur attractive i  ll take ur word for it . do guys ur age ever ask u out on a date or try to get ur number ? i  m not sure if this is actually true , but it seems that attractive girls don  t get approached very often because they are intimidating
   (ID: f8f6a1dd8b47dc3239c55ec87aa3bbd108a04a43)

18. go and be supportive . say nothing that would be upsetting to them . that ' s what friends do . a funeral is not the time or place for you to express your views . it ' s not about you in the least .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

19. this convention isn ' t limited to tv , and screens come in more aspect ratios than digit  digit and digit  digit . so one number doesn ' t at all carry the info you need .
   (ID: 85e68ffba559022a8ce29c88ef3f2121dc076426)
