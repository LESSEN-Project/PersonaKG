8. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .

13. ive done camming and it didn ' t seem like my relationship was that different from those around me . it was just a fun , well paying job where i happened to masturbate !
   (ID: 29b9b56e163cbfecbc98e83c436b436aca056a8c)

14. i searched random duos in fortnite , i teamed up with a girl not real name linasomething . we reached like 5th place which is pretty good . she then added me and we proceeded to play . and we played and played . eventually i got bored with her , i wanted to play with other friends me  hey i wanna play with some friends okay ? her  no me  what ? her  please stay i played with her one more match and then i just left . i don ' t know if she means it or not but she has been saying i love you for some reason . digit days later i wanted to stop playing with her , so i wrote her a short polite message " dear lina . bitch i ' m tired of yo clingy hoe ass , i ' m tryna play with friends but you fucking just want me to play with you ! sincerely kal . " she started saying some bullshit then i asked her how old is she her  i ' m digit me  no you ' re not her  yes i am me  look , i don ' t care how old you are but if you ' re underage i can ' t be speaking with you probs bs her  it ' s okay we can play me  don ' t lie , how old are you ? her  digit me  it ' s illegal for me to play or speak with you her  byeeeeeee me  finally . her  byeeeeeee i blocked her .

16. yta . come on dude , you didn ' t even have to come here to get the answer . joking or not , if you were on your brother ' s shoes , would you like to be dogged like that ?
   (ID: 2e369dc21156ed2b443bc09084e27c8acb516093)

17. i hope you find the love you deserve . you ' re definitely more aware of the fact that fast moving relationships , are enticing at first but maybe not the most rewarding . here ' s to the opportunity for a better chance next time . everything happens for a reason
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

18. so essentially , it sounds like you , as person and subject , were made the topic of a conversation between your girlfriend and one of her friends . unless they ' re plotting your death , which i would consider a fair reason to be upset over , considering you ' re in a committed relationship at least until you get more mail from your ex with one of the parties involved , you don ' t have a damn say in the matter . people talk about people , a lot . especially the people they know , like you . especially about the events that transpired between them , that have become the history of their lives , like being cheated on . if you ' re so small a person , that you can get overly suspicious and suspectful , that you can ' t tolerate the idea of your girlfriend , digit at worst , bitching about you to a friend digit at best , explaining what an ass you are then you sure as shit don ' t deserve to be with someone who is willing to forgive your cheating on them .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

19. agreed . learning how to manage relationship conflict in early relationships is one of the most important life skills to practice at that age . i usually start with asking questions to understand why exactly the teen is upset . i then rephrase that in a way that states what the teen wants to happen , " so , you wish he saved a seat for you next to him at football games " and then suggest they tell the person and ask for the thing they want , " i want to sit next to you at the next football game . will you save me a seat " teens relationship problems often stem from difficulty verbalizing what they want to happen and expressing that need . to be fair , most adults are not so good at this either .

20. I have a girlfriend.
