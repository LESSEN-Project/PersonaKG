   (ID: 4f26e00e0769f7123ce8a1a0d11a5e285c445ec3)

4. mmm . yeah . this discussion can quickly become a can of worms . i have a family friend who is a pastor who knows many people christians who are gay that wish they weren  t . i understand that it  s not a choice for everyone statistically speaking for some it may be a choice , but i doubt that they would make up a significant proportion on the one hand i wish to rebuke the way your parents responded . if your recount is accurate , they did not respond in what i would consider a loving , christlike way . they sound as if they are bound to the  lawlike  aspect of church . seeing christian life as a book of rules to follow , things which must be met for salvation . on the other hand however , the bible is pretty clear about homosexuality . please understand that i am saying this from a place of love as a christian , not with the goal of putting you down , or shutting you out . paul refers to having a  thorn in his side  digit corinthians digit  digit  digit . the way i  ve always read this and heard it read as is that there was something in particular that he struggled with . something that was continually a trouble , as indicated by the imagery of the thorn . when a thorn is stuck in your side , it is a continual pain . it hinders movement . it  s always there .  therefore , in order to keep me from becoming conceited , i was given a thorn in my flesh , a messenger of satan , to torment me . digit three times i pleaded with the lord to take it away from me . digit but he said to me ,  my grace is sufficient for you , for my power is made perfect in weakness .  therefore i will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses , so that christ  s power may rest on me .  digit corinthians digit  digit  digit , niv i tend to view this as paul discussing his thorn , his struggle , and that everyone has something in particular that is a struggle for them . is it possible that for you , this may be your thorn ? it appears from your post that it is an issue for you , a struggle , something which you wish you didn  t have to deal with . i don  t know if i mentioned this before , but i  m young as well only digit and do not have the answers . homosexuality isn  t a struggle for me either but i do have some other struggles with things such as pornography , so i can  t claim to have all the answers here . homosexuality is a really difficult issue because of its inherent perceived connection with ones identity . often people assume that if you disagree with homosexuality that you hate the person . this isn  t the case  or rather shouldn  t be the case . jesus was proof of this . he hung out with people who were perceived as unclean . he hung out with prostitutes and criminals ! does that mean he approved of what they were doing ? of course not ! but he chose to stay with them and spend time with them rather than rebuke and abandon them . this is how we should approach homosexuality . i  m getting a little sidetracked here , but my point is that the bible does not condemn people who are gay , but rather those who knowingly have homosexual relations i . e . sexual ones and continue to do so when they know they shouldn  t . i know that  s a tough message . but the key point here is that it condemns the action , not the person . jesus offers forgiveness . yes you may be a lesbian . you may be attracted to women sexually . you claim that it  s not a choice . that  s okay . the issue lies in following through with these desires again , please understand this comes from a place of love , not condemnation the good news is that it  s possible to live as a gay person without falling into a homosexual relationship . i mean , i  m straight and overall not being in a relationship is fine . yes there are times when it  s hard . i fully understand that . it  s difficult because we live in a society that actively encourages  even idolizes  romantic relationships , sex and sexuality . it is difficult sometimes . but it is possible . if all else fails , you said you  re a minor but hinted at being able to drive or something so i assume you  re somewhere between digit  digit ? , and you  re at an age where you are growing . your interests may change . i know of plenty of people who struggled with issues of homosexuality , being trans , etc . who fell in love with someone of the opposite sex when they least expected it . it might happen , it might not . either way , you  re not alone in this struggle . there are many christians who actively struggle with homosexuality . it  s not an isolated issue . yes , your parents should have been much more careful about how they reacted . it sounds like they  re linking their perspective of the actions of homosexuality with you as a person , without seeing that there is a difference . again , i  m not sure how helpful this is , and am getting somewhat sidetracked . has this been helpful , op ?

5. i didn ' t change the poem , i switched the lines to be backwards so it could be read like the pretty poem . if you need to reference the original poem for a reread , it ' s right

7. i understand digit  . you are not the asshole . you ' re just a working man who wants to be happy . you don ' t have to want her dead though , but i understand why you would .   x200b  talk to her about separating . because of her drinking . it ' s a valid thing . you don ' t want to be a caregiver for the rest of your life , do you ?
   (ID: 85ada8069a64aa3ed39736f565e8a9ceed369acd)

8. it ' s probably what is the job that you are doing that could be the problem . my mum says it ' s a luxury to even have that and she work a digit  digit job with lunch break and she is fine . maybe it isn ' t the hours that may be affecting you , maybe it could be you hate your job i would like to know what is your job and how are your co  workers or boss makes you feel uncomfortable . just to clarify , i am no position to give you the best advice because i ' m a teen who have no experience working . but i have asked my mum and gave reasons why . i ' m not saying you should quit although that was the option she recommend . i still say maybe try to meditate or find a job you prefer doing before you quit .

10. thank you ! it  s honestly very dehumanising . i want a breast reduction but i now feel like men only find me attractive because of them and not because of my face .

11. not really . i keep in touch with some of them who work with me in the same company and or plays games with me . other than that , i don ' t think they liked me enough to remember me anyways .

12. if everything in the post is true , how come you don  t already have a bf ? like seriously tho
   (ID: ba6e9b4e1f123022ebad3ecf22065f969929a346)

13. you shouldn  t need motivation to take care of yourself . the body you have now is the body you  ll have when you  re digit . treat yourself like shit now and enjoy a miserable second half of your life .
   (ID: 642d313215c4dbadffc4be5d2f254d63d8270b82)

14. didn ' t mean it in a negative way . just to point out you must have no idea what people will do to get high and how low on ex addicts priorities paying people back can be when your literally rebuilding your life from the ground up . go to any rehab step digit is taking care of yourself .
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)

15. agree  don  t change yourself , but do open yourself up to make small talk with people throughout the day . grocery store , gym , anywhere you  re around people . good luck op ! don  t rush it !
   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

16. break ups almost never end well . i was in literally the exact same situation as you except i started having doubts about digit months in . i didn  t do it until a few weeks after our year anniversary and it made things so much worse for me . i should have just done it when i first thought i should . you have to just sit her down and say listen i don  t think things are working out or something along those lines . it  s best if you just do it if you  re having doubts . p . s . i have no idea how to do the flair either lmao
   (ID: ad898f238b3dc29e08e2e0d1ae1f284c2c13604e)

17. then you really are as stupid as i suggested at the outset . they are completely accurate and they are about digit times more useful than your nonsense because they ' re the meat and potatoes and nobody gives a shit if you could add digit tomes of ands , ifs , or buts to them . " meat " is not a complete description of steak and " vegetables " is not a complete description of salad but those are the main points you think of when you see steak or salad on a menu and an adequate description of the difference between them for you to decide you feel like having one a lot more than the other . and all i asked you , was the difference between autism steak and retard salad .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

18. i gotchu bro . you may be asking yourself , oh no what do i talk about ? when approaching a girl . no worries ! as another user mentioned , get on board day is a great opportunity to meet a girl that has a similar interest as you . you dont have to tell a joke or have some jaw dropping awesome first line , you can literally just ask  how long have you been into topic ?   what is your favorite thing about topic  keep in mind that not everyone will click and if it doesnt , dont tell yourself that youre bad with girls . i promise you that there are guys you could try to be friends with and it wouldnt go so well either . why ? because not everyone is going to click , i promise you that i wouldnt click or be friends with almost digit  of the guys in my classes if we tried to be friends . it  s just because people are different . so don  t get down , go out there , be confident , be yourself , and if you fail , get back up , dust yourself off , and try again ! you got this ! p . s . none of the bad interactions will matter in digit years when you  re as happy as can be with your s  o good luck bro

19. what do you think ?
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

20. the thing is not to be too picky . now i ' m not saying just date and rando guy that can ' t get his life together , but bea bit open minded you know ? not everyone is going to be digit  for you and there are always going to be flaws . you already have a lot going for you and congratulations to you that too .
