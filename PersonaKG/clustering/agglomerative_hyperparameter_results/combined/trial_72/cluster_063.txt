16. story time ! i used to be a hardcore minecraft fan back in , i dunno , digit or something . spent hours on that game . i remember playing the demo version of mcpe from my cousin ' s ipad . i fell in love instantly . i ' m a huge nerd for books , so after i found out about this website called " wattpad " , i decided to combine my two favorite things and read minecraft fanfics . looking back now , most of them were pretty bad , but for a digit year old , it was the shit . everyday i got off from school , i would log in and read till i grow bored . then , i met this guy named " radishologist " who wrote minecraft books , and surprisingly , his story wasn ' t terrible . so yeah , i decided to give it a shot and before i knew it , i couldn ' t stop reading . he made three books in total , and i read them all . on his third book , he asked his followers if any of them would like to be part of it . i was thrilled , and i quickly pm ' d him and gave him my character . it was pretty terrible . cliche name , cliche backstory , etc etc . but for a kid , it was the best thing ever . he agreed , and i became part of the book . i remember smiling like a doofus everytime i would read chapters with my character ' s pov . made me a little a proud about myself . after a few months , he posted another chapter . he said he was making a kik group chat for people to discuss about minecraft and stuff about his books . i didn ' t know what kik was at that time , but i found out . told him i wanted to join and he added me to the gc after that . we called it the " radish community " there , i met a lot of people . many of them were from america i live in the philippines , so it was pretty hard to fit in . eventually , the community grew and grew , and i started to feel more comfortable around people . i remember bragging to some of my classmates how i got " friends from all over the globe " and shit . they never really believed me though hahaha . i became close friends with a bunch of them . especially that radish guy . it was in that community where i had my first online gf . it didn ' t worked out , of course . had digit more online relationships after that , but ye they ended up badly . but we had fun . we talked a lot everyday . i also remember him hosting a bunch of " kik comps " where we do challenges and shit and the winner gets a follow from him on wattpad . i was a moron , so i usually just goofed around and never really won anything , but we didn ' t care . we were having fun . that was digit years ago . our chat ' s still alive , but a lot of guys left . radish dude and me still talk , but not as much . he doesn ' t write books anymore too . his wattpad account ' s still functioning , but barely . he stills logs in from to time , usually to give announcements , and the occasional updates , but that ' s about it . i follow him on insta though , and he ' s pretty busy with life . he ' s gonna go to college in a couple of years so he ' s trying to enjoy his senior years . we used to be huge . like digit  people gathering around and talking about minecraft and shit . now , we only have like digit people left . i left the chat once or twice , but i kept returning . couldn ' t left them behind . ya ' ll could argue that " online friends aren ' t real friends " , but this guys , i grew up with them . well , not technically , but they ' re a huge part of my childhood . i just hope that we can actually see each other in real life someday . haha , actually , one of us suggested that we should do that after we graduated college . ironic since she ghosted away after that and never really showed up anymore . i still talk to her on instagram , but it wasn ' t the same . todd , ana , salix , jazzy , glitch , leo , rebel , thomas , karim , aj , collin , andrew , basically anyone who were part of this , especially todd aka radish guy , if any of you are reading this , i just wanted to say thanks . thanks for everything . i know , i say that a lot but i really mean it . yeah , i act like a douche sometimes , and you guys probably think i ' m nothing but a heartless memer who shit on other people , but deep inside , i ' m really thankful . those comps , those memories we made , it was awesome . i really hope we ' ll still keep in touch , even if there are only like digit or digit of us left . wherever life takes us , i hope we ' ll still remember each other . thanks for being part of my life . i will really cherish our friendship forever .
