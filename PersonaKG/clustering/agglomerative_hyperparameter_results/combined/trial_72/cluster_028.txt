   (ID: 1f3e82e13d88ba22fce8ba80102ccc24b3880ae9)

3. no . what i  m saying is check it if you do have intercourse . it  d be even better to not have intercourse if you don  t want kids or cannot afford the expenses , that makes sense . if you cannot afford kids yet get pregnant , you knew the risks and took them , you should have no right to kill the baby .
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

5. in places with no rent control is it very easy to end a tenancy agreement . the landlord is being civil and giving you more than enough notice to find a place and move out , i suggest you do . there are much more underhanded stuff a landlord could do to end a tenancy agreement purposely for example , entering in your unit without your permission and guess what ? they won ' t be charged with b  e , the only thing that happen is your lease is over .
   (ID: 9ec4f8c81572a0a43c8d624fb459f565cd019aad)

   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

9. there was a family from near where i live who was renowned for having really bad personal hygiene . like you ' d say their surname and everyone would wince a little . one time i went to the shop and in walks one of them . never met them before then so i wasn ' t sure if it was true , but it was . it took a lot of self control not to gag . never before or since have i met somebody with the capability to stink out a whole shop . i felt unclean taking the bottle of juice that was in there out with me , like the smell would have leaked through the bottle and into the juice somehow . as soon as i got home i took a shower . i ' m not sure if there was something wrong with them , or how they smelled so bad but holy fuck . i have full empathy for any health problems that may have caused that complete and utter stank but please , stay the fuck away from me .

11. actually happened to me . my coworker offered me a xanax out of the blue in front of one other coworker . i told him i wouldn  t take it in front of the cameras then the other worker said we should go in the back where there were no cameras . so we go in the back room , things happen then we come out and don  t say anything . next morning i get a text from my general manager asking me to come to her office once i got to work . she tells me she  s  heard of drug use in the office  . thankfully i was able to pass it off as ibuprofen and our gm was insane and got fired two weeks later . really worked out in my favor but man that was scary and i easily could have been fired in my field .

12. an old radio control model airplane kit . it was a kit i had sought for years and they were extremely rare . today , i doubt there is a single one left . i had wanted to build one and fly it for close to a decade . the kit was brand new in a mint condition box . it was an estate sale for an ww2 veteran and his widow was obviously still quite shaken by his passing . she had marked the kit at  digit . it was a collectable kit and worth close to  digit , digit . she had no idea . i forced her to take  digit for it . that ' s everything i had on me at the time . she was crying and her kids were crying when i told them what it was worth and forced the money into her trembling hands . i did build it and flew it for several years . i retired the plane and donated it to a local vfw in the mans name in digit .

15. i know but can you imagine that that one month actually resulted in death ? i mean digit month ? that ' s serious . even if op was exaggerating on the total time , one accidental hit could kill him or give some type of crazy condition . so jailed for life or take the high road and help her get past the pain ? maybe it ' s just me .
