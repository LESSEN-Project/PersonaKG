1. absolutely speak to your therapist . you trust them . they will help you . you need to get yourself out of that relationship for your safety , physical and psychological . this is not a one  off occurrence .
   (ID: 93fee667f85cc0ee55e2451cc1a83efc0b764ef4)

2. you did you think it was black when the title says  fat  ? or did you just here it on the radio not knowing what the title is
   (ID: b32e61b9c04e2d8927d5e2ded327d2379ec3a1a6)

3. i can  t tell if you talking about fighting or . something else
   (ID: dea1673e29d00bc1a88d1c231b63981344044a2e)

4. used to be fire hydrants . he ' s since gotten over them .
   (ID: a889137e92d54250452d24f74138b0bffb6e1146)

5. that is true , i wouldn  t advise living with rentals or renting to friends because  living with  less privacy friends  you put your relationship at risk i don  t know too much about this subject but i do know , as long as your price is equal to , or above the mortgage , you should be good . if you set it up so that the cost and payment are equal , it would be stagnant for the time being but this is where the location and development comes in . when the contract is over , if everything goes exactly as planned rare , you can then sell the property for more than what you paid . this will allow you to grow your budget and upgrade from there . you can avoid the damages and problems by creating a very clear contract from the start , and have them sign it and you both get copies of it . that way both parties know what you are getting into , the rules and consequences if the contract is broken . of course this takes much work and knowledge , there are other ways to stretch your funds this is one of them .
   (ID: a77a8bcaa391d8b6584d32e6ad243e71297d7258)

6. i thought the same exact thing . we should ask him
   (ID: 0501bf1e5cd313190bb4590a1c677057b15a6e47)

7. ex who treated me like shit and cheated posted something about me on social media and got her friends in on it . usually that is way too immature to acknowledge but i was so pissed i responded on in a clever way about maybe if she wasn  t a immature dumbass she wouldn  t be on her 3rd year trying to get into the same school and still hanging out with high schoolers . she immediately deleted the post and blocked me . yes , i now see she was trash . idk why i didn  t before and i know it was low but gaddamn i went through too much with her to go out and end it without a blow .

8. my situation is extremely similar . what ' s the person in questions named cody ? if so i think we might be talking about the same person
   (ID: 5be7ef463c3ba0c7a9c255bd9769c5f638d2b805)

9. timing when to buy a home is difficult since it will obviously be a long term investment . i think you should gauge where you are living to determine if you have confidence in your city and county first . if you do then go out and buy a home that you like and can afford at the best possible price for you . trying to timing the market for a home is just not worth it .
   (ID: 9ec4f8c81572a0a43c8d624fb459f565cd019aad)

10. when having sex with my last girlfriend startet , i also had this problem digit or digit times . my problem is that sometimes my boner would disappear a soon as my girlfriend took her hand of my dick . i found out that this is linked with stress , at the beginning it was harder because it was embarrassed by it and my girlfriend startet to think it was about her body and she is unattractive to me . with even more pressure now it hasn ' t worked out again . because my ex girlfriend got really emotional at this point , i needed to tell her the truth . this was definitely the decision that ended this problem . because i already knew that it wasn ' t a problem with my body . i already feelt comfortable getting sexual with her . but as soon the point of putting on the condome comes , the slight fear overcame me , that these erection problem will lead her to believe she isn ' t sexy to me , which she struggled enough with at the beginning , because of her beeing digit years older . next time we startes having sex , my erection was there until the short moment of putting on that comdom . again i was worried about all the things that were talked about it and i stell feelt a little bit of embarrassment . and she did exactly the right thing , she calmed me down and just continued the same was we did before the condom . and it took some time again and we gave each other time and arousel by foreplay until the problem didn ' t accrue anymore . after that day it never happened again . i do see suspect some parallels with your post . and i can only suggest to you , if you want to have a chance of having sex with him , forget your plans . sit down with him and i tell him that it is ok for you it doesn ' t work out with penetrativ sex . by taking away stress factors for him , you make it way easier for him to hold his erection . also non penetrativ sex can be even more fun and it can help him to feel not so stressed before sex , when you can give him the feeling , of you beeing happy and satisfied . it would be pressure for every guy , if his girl is rarely in the country and on that rare occasion erection problems arise . knowing that you definitely want to have penetrativ sex is extra stressful . i think he knows you wish for that . and surely would like to fulfill it to you , but try to help him get more comfortable first . when you both try it viagra his stress won ' t be dissappearing . he will get depended on these for sex if you don ' t get rid of psychological boundaries first . when they are gone , you will be finding way more sex in the future .

11. you need to be assertive about this . the template for an assertive statement is " i feel  when you do   , and i wish you would    " in this situation you could say " i feel sad or maybe uncherished , neglected , abandoned , or lonely ? when you don ' t get to know my family , and i would like you to come to thanksgiving dinner and talk to them " please learn this and use it . it must be said calmly and conversationally without expectation of changing his behavior . you are clearly stating your emotions and the behaviour of your ideal mate . if he still refuses to change his behavior , then you should decide if you can visit your family without him for the rest of your life .

12. i mean he has a point  when kids are crying and stuff to their parents because they didn ' t make the playoffs they are being kinda spoiled . i just don ' t think that it is rooted directly from getting an end of the year trophy . there are probably other parenting issues there .
   (ID: 89c3606d2dfc5d2a2da97fb49ddc1894f8bf330f)

13. funny you should mention that because i ' ve just came across his instagram account . i quite liked it the idea because , as a player myself , i got it where as my mrs , who doesn ' t know a spade from a club , wouldn ' t have a clue what that meant . however , my vision is more about targeting poker first and scaling up to a designer brand which has a subtle poker reference which everyone could potentially relate to it ' s simple . i ' ll do some more research but thanks for your comments i appreciate it !

14. i can  t mind his name but the guy who heads a movie studio and he  s on the run , you think he  s going into circulation ? america is built on bribes
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

15. i can understand why you ' re uncomfortable but i think the term rape gets thrown around too much sometimes and this is one of the times . would this have been such an issue of he didn ' t cum in you this time and just did what he normally would do ? i think the issue is more of him just not being careful about pregnancy not about the sex itself right ?
   (ID: 55d99e57acfb093e867404de8e889dc93f4be138)

16. prove him wrong then . i don  t know the entire situation but at the end of the day if he  s your dad , he loves you . whether he can physically show it or not .
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

17. my apologies . i read fiance and for some dumb reason i thought ' her ' instead of ' him ' . oops , isn ' t the first time something like that happened and i ' m sure it won ' t be the last . lol
   (ID: fe374743dd856c29f2117723cef01c1fdc3b3b5b)

18. my neighbour has paranoid delusions . he believes that every move i make , is some part of my elaborate plan to do him harm . he , " caught , " me going out at digit pm the other night . in reality , it was because i had to post a letter . in his mind , though , it was because i specifically timed my exit to coincide with him putting out the trash . he confronted me , f  bombs a  blazing , and demanded to fucxing know what my fucxing scheme was . he puts me through this shit every other year or so . anyway , yeah , it ' s hard to explain that posting a letter does not mean i give a single shit about him putting out the trash .
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

19. not to be a debbie downer , but it ' s not a hero move . it ' s the right thing to do . if someone else does otherwise , they ' re just scumbags
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

20. i thought invited friends do not have extra keys . i sent him an invite but he is leaving thursday for camping trip . i want to make use of his invite since he is leaving . so how do i un  invite him ?
