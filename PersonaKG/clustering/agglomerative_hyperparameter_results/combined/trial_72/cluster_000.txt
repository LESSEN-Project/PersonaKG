7. we all go through this . what eats us up the most is not knowing something but when we do get the chance to find out the truth it always makes us more sad and miserable . so it  s the force that protects us from self harm . yeah of course we want to know the truth so we feel better about ourselves but i . the end it just sets us back and we are left there with the knowledge that our ex did not find us up to their par anymore . really who gives a shit ? they left you , time for you to prove that you are better then them and live your life . live the life you always wanted to . fuck that bitch haha . go have fun and do you .

13. it does take a while for your legs to get used to shaving . however it ' s not as simple as grabbing a razor with your shaving gel , there is a greater amount of skin care needed . it will be difficult at first because your skin is rough the most important bit is moisturize , make sure do it several times a week , as the skin becomes softer the shaving becomes less painfull and you get better result . exfoliate  shave  moisturize

14. i don ' t believe so . lemme explain , everytime you remember something you are remembering the last time you remembered it . slowly but surely degrading that memory . our brain would only be able to hold onto the good and bad , the exciting stuff . also when you die you do experience a dream like sequence where your almost relive your life , but it ' s not the same , it would be weird like a dream , inaccurate and inconsistent . it wouldn ' t make sense and with the combination of lost memories it would probably confuse you and ruin you but nobody will ever know for sure .
   (ID: 93e3d10c1d0bffae76c0adb5d9a96d6abf1aade9)

17. hey man death is inevitable and honestly why would you skip that time that you can use to be happy . do what you want to do and learn to work alone . but be careful cuz you might become antisocial which is not what you want . i don ' t know what are you interested in so try improving yourself in that , find people that love the same thing and meet other people . just enjoy your life while you have it . there are milion things that can kill you right now , will they ? i don ' t know . nobody knows , but that ' s the point of life to go and see what will happen . set a goal in life and fight for it .
