1. well i liked it . but then i have been replaying the game this week !
   (ID: 6778aa4e3cf401044823c475db231fc0b1d0ff4b)

2. i play on ps4 aswell . i ' d say considering there is new building sensitivity , id put that higher and lower my actual sensitivy . it would probably be easier for you to aim then . also , you want to really change your ads sensitivity to the right spot , it will help you a lot . ads means aiming down sights
   (ID: 41fc1b2c09d5a16a25f120edde55b2a6e2e54e29)

3. you complaining about free rewards ? it  ll get better and more competitive as you grow within the game . i assume your still very new at swgoh and are clumped with people who are probably not that into it the same way you are .
   (ID: 480f3d8feb42f76cdfa6ea3a1dfffaf98bf91060)

4. oh i misread , i thought you meant you wanted to be either a grizzly bear or a silverback and whichever one you are you fight the same animal as an opponent . carry on , i dont think you ' ll have much luck on finding the other opponent based on region but id pay to see it
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

5. i like these events too , a bit of challenge for the shards , and when you do get the characters to digit  you get some zetas as a reward . and i also agree with you , they should be farmed both there and elsewhere .
   (ID: a304d2b10646e73686547edafa852cc87a894eb5)

6. i don ' t even have friends to play it with and i still enjoy fallout digit a ton . expressing only that opinion , i get mass downvoted . i don ' t understand . am i not having fun correctly ?
   (ID: 215e84ecea95592e4d8f3f8e0619a61b503078c3)

7. zerg herder i assume that means i run in large groups of players ? i did for a few weeks oh about a year and some change ago when i first set foot in cyrodil . i don ' t think i have been in a group larger than digit in about digit months or so . i prefer to stay away from large scale conflict , not because that ' s the cool thing to do , but because i like being able to swap bars . and since you know me so well i ' m sure that you have checked my alliance kills vs my time played very little time in comparison to most , you know wife , baby , job . those can be time consuming . i don ' t want to have a dick measuring contest over a game , so i ' ll walk away from this . brandonbadass you are an amazing and skilled player , i am trash and i use the best armor sets currently available because they make me competitive .
   (ID: 837b9a4e21703cdb7da723a44b91b0582031c386)

8. we all kind of rely on each other to be honest . i play all roles and i feel there should just be more respect , and more competency between them . healers keep everyone alive yes but a good tank stops everyone else taking damage . without the tank you would be equally screwed . likewise good dps will kill things so you ' re not fighting a war of mana . they should interrupt and stay out of danger . what i am trying to say is that everyone should work together , show some support and learn your class so you can adapt quickly . as soon as one of these digit roles thinks they are more valuable or don ' t have to try as hard the whole thing fails .
   (ID: cda2027ff011b74a04f79a766c8e8da339eb1f0b)

9. well if your team doesn ' t need you anymore after you use your ult , you did something right .
   (ID: 417f107ec53971c82b0d9bb8ee79067ec512bdbb)

10. one question  where was i cocky ? and not everybody is oh so nice like you . how much you want to help some , they will ignore you and go on their own to die 1v3 . yes i wish everybody was like you , but unfortunately that ' s not the case .
   (ID: 37afe6aed6f5a2677e6ebd0e4e168a560dc96061)

11. the actual final fantasy digit was horrible . the one you are thinking about is actually digit . yes , they can be good . but what is hurting the industry currently not digit  years ago are non  innovative assembly lines games that just get turned out once a year .
   (ID: c018255fd73fced873eb4897821cd82620ba8fe2)

12. ok , i understand that comparing completely different games isn  t the smartest thing to do , but sorry . minecraft had battle royale game modes on servers far before fortnite was released . and in minecraft , you can choose if you want to play battle royale or do literally anything you want in creative or have fun and dangerous adventures in survival . the closest fortnite has to that is the garbage  creative  mode where you  re limited to a tiny island , whereas in minecraft , the world is infinite , and the only limitation is your imagination . so , thank you for this fun little debate , but in minecraft , you can do the same things you can do in fortnite albeit with the use of mods , and so much more . so i believe the superior game is minecraft . but that , however , is just my opinion .
   (ID: 657111ddaa0e710ba768a3b9132b927482be7955)

13. i bet we will see at least one raid as a show of force in the next few weeks .
   (ID: c21f8d5819115eb61914aa55dbbc727a12117bef)

14. is your twitch name notsimplyshad ? two ideas off the top of my head , and they are not great ones . simpletons shadlettes
   (ID: a4cf7bd5112d789bb0b45477a071f936cf9b4ba7)

15. yeah to be honest once you have run through the game a few time the early part of the game is easy . hell until you get to the dlc it  s pretty easy . not to say the game is easy cause it  s not ! i  m guessing you summoned a hunter who knows what he is doing . i personally like to make builds and hang out around the first digit bosses just cause it  s fun ! good luck and happy hooting !
   (ID: d5ff87b3b0a008d93a655ee4d43e9da3b5db7984)

16. at random . i am usually busy , so i simply cannot predict when i will have the time . you could follow me on furstream , but you ' d still have to be online .
   (ID: bf371725cb05580378dda9b1fdb005417049b32b)

17. it  s true that it is kinda a waste of time anyway , the problem is that instead of having fun wasting my time i just get depressed
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

18. from your pics the 38mm looks far better . if anything , the 42mm looks a little too large to my eye . but really , don ' t worry about what other people say . you ' ll be the one looking at it most of the time so buy something that you ' ll be happy with .
   (ID: 2e34fbd58bc49726f7e8c74b8ea82513ca226ab4)

19. oh i know , i played destiny digit . and d2 is way more fun , who knew that when you actually have a purpose for mowing down millions of aliens it  s actually more fun ?
   (ID: 2657c8854c93e48c0bab9764c7904833e823cac9)

20. i like it for this , ' cause you need a bit of skill to use it in pvp
