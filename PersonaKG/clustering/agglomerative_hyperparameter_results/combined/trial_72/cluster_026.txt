1. sounds like it is doing you good . both of you . despite how  shallow  some people will think it is , health and weight are an issue in a relationship . no one wants to see someone slowly kill themselves , its absolutely defeating , especially when they refuse to listen at the cost of losing their loved one . so i personally at least think the choice was good and it shows that its going well for you both . i hope you can get back together .
