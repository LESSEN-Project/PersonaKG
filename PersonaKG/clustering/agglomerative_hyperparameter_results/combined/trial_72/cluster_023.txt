1. they purchased the rights to franchises that already had massive die hard fanbases i . e . marvel comics , star wars , then they commercialized the hell out of everything and turned them into billion dollar industries . what were once stories are now just products at this point . like a proper home cooked meal compared to a mcdouble and some mcnuggets
   (ID: 0264eec5f9f9a43d83f3a82c46341e90961fa3b8)

2. you don ' t need someone to look at them . i used to work busy season and for people like you i would enter all your info in a similar program , we don ' t spend time looking for how to maximize your tax return cause the program already does that . it would take me about digit mins to enter everything in and we would charge you at  digit . that said , we only did this for clients , client ' s family members or people referred by clients , not just anyone off the street cause frankly the work is not fulfilling for us nor is it valuable to you . we are much more useful helping with a whole package accounting service where people who have companies have us do up their financials , and have us plan how to pay themselves to have the lowest tax when it comes time for filing . for you everything already is what it is so there is not much an expert can do .
   (ID: 9ec4f8c81572a0a43c8d624fb459f565cd019aad)

3. the majority of us are proud of you ! because a dream home is worth it . that ' s why you save up and work hard , to get the things you want . you ' d want to have a nice comfortable life outside of work hence the dream home lol .
   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

4. i think that ' s normal to adjust what each of you give in function of your incomes . with my boyfriend we made some calculs with our incomes and we give the same percentage of money for all the month . so when we each give our part , we have the same percentage of money left on our accounts . i don ' t know if it ' s very clear , but i ' m giving you an example . let us suppose that we need digit  for the month for all common costs rent , food , internet , phone , etc . if bf has a salary of digit and i a salary of digit , it means bf brings digit , digit  of incomes and me digit , digit  so i ' ll give digit  and him digit  . we implemented this system when we decided to live together so we ' ve never argued about money . so you ' re making a good choice , money is the first arguing reason , it has to be well thought .
   (ID: 862cb85d93fa9b931c3c64cf2fd17ef592d48c50)

5. I own a school.

   (ID: e1d1404c2d4f1c884debe976d40ee13df3959fcf)

14. why does what you do in your free time have any bearing on what you do at work ? in your mind , is it impossible for someone who likes to get high to refrain from doing so at work ? if you drink beer or alcohol , how is that any different ? should having a beer at home disqualify you from driving a forklift at work the next day ? these are genuine questions .
   (ID: 74058c90ada3aae7a59703064acbf3ced38f3681)

15. i ' ve always been poor and i fucked my gs ' ing program in the ass hard by being crazy as fuck but also controlling that crazy . you gusy say " dont go crazy , violent , etc " thats cuz its assumed if a target does that its over . they dont want someone who can keep it in control . they dunno wtf to do anymore so they " default " on a lot of things . dumb ass mother fuckers .

16. damn . i took four days off once . it was supposed to be five but my boss made me work one of those days .
   (ID: 24d2489761902de9148fe06d43ec8d7e34c8e35b)

17. i think that there is a trade off being a public persona and private persona off of camera . one ' s disguise has to be really good or the pressure to be constantly ' on ' can get to even the most seasoned celebrities . i think it would suck to be constantly hounded by people  but if done right then people would think you were cool no matter what for no reason . really it ' s a double  edged sword with trust and complicated social dynamics based  out of trust and exposure .
