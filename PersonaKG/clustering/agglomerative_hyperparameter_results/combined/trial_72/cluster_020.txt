14. i mean it  s certainly possible just seems super unlikely to me . really a one trick pony company as solarcity probably isn  t going to take them there , and sure some of them tend to do good but just like other car companies there will be a ton of competition and to me it also seems pretty unlikely we will see a completely electric car world unless there is massive improvement in battery life and charge time . even so there are tons of other car companies . i mean we will see just seems a bit of a pipe dream to me , suppose we will see though . i mean if tesla completely eliminates all other car companies and electric cars take over the world we could see a multi trillion dollar tesla in digit  digit value , but even still it  s not  my kids will thank me later off my tax return  kind of money .

15. well first of all nootropics aren ' t medication . they are mostly just useless bullshit marketed at young males . but anyway , you didn ' t ask for life advice so here you go  coinbase is the easiest way in my opinion to buy bitcoin since you can use your credit card to do it , it ' s basically instant . there are other alternatives , but coinbase it the one i ' ve used for myself . coinbase and this is also true for similar consumer focused alternatives , i ' m not shilling for coinbase here simplify the process of managing your coins so you don ' t really need to know or think about the block chain or a bitcoin wallet . you can basically treat it like an online bank account . but it does not protect you from being scammed . bitcoin is designed to be untraceable . it ' s not actually untraceable but it ' s pretty damn difficult to trace a bitcoin payment . which means once you send a bitcoin payment you basically have no idea who you are sending it to . the fact that you bought the bitcoin from coinbase using a credit card does nothing to protect the second transaction which is sending the bitcoin to a stranger . you need to question why this person wants to take bitcoin and aren ' t offering a more common alternative . this doesn ' t necessarily mean it is a scammer , some people just like bitcoin , but it ' s a red flag and using bitcoin leaves you completely unprotected from fraud .
