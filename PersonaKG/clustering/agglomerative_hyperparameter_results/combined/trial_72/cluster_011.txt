1. i would not unless you have a great relationship with your boss otherwise they will think you ' re bluffing and just let you go
   (ID: 3bc536069edd6aa052ced5b6ea5f69eefae07cb7)

2. omg . murder and war are just examples of the flexibility of human morals . i knew some idiot would get wrapped around the axle over some inconsequential minutia and miss my point . it was simplistic to make a point . morality is completely relative based . mistakes are made when i apply my morals to your situation . fuck , people , get out of the fucking weeds . op wasn ' t asking about specific moral issues just morality in general . goddammit .
   (ID: 06f2b7a65e600f531fbc47a595626f329ee413a4)

3. believe whatever you want , i ' m clearly not going to change your mind . i don ' t think you understand the fact that people can be serious and humorous in one video . you do you . whatever .
   (ID: b6c3e540255084641f0e148a3992d9113c560f0b)

4. so you thought a hyoothesis put forward by some of the great physicist like victor stenger and michio kaku who look at it from a scientific point of view , was bullshit , and you think you figured it out by just thinking about it ? this is part of the problem . when people believe shit for no reason . if you want to put an argument for the theory , the literal very least you can do is reasearch what it is . because i actually have read aboit the simulation hypothesis , and it has more to do with the physical pripertues of the universe than anything about the human mind or what we do .
   (ID: 00b878c3a1ec656c05e2872b35fdccfcfda3baac)

5. well , i don ' t hate pugs , they are not responsible for it . but i do hate that humans made something like that .
   (ID: 9006d58872586db3bb808208616fdc9c3dff694b)

6. you say that , but without offering a solid counterargument or addressing any supposed flaws in my argument your position doesn ' t have my respect or interest .

   (ID: e059f82a0624202d909920e56dd76f76efa711d2)

9. except for my very first post where i said lgbtqwhatever , because that  s what those napoleons like to be called , please , show another one of my post , where i was arguing ? i simply stated what i strongly and firmly believe . now back to people , who like to suck dicks , being fuk in the ass , licking each other  i don  t care what they like to be called and what they think they are . they are mentally ill people to me . i could make myself more clear .
   (ID: 77770aa98878bbc6909e1c6f872ebb6803362fc5)

10. by the simplest and most accurate definition , it ' s a particular act that you personally sexualise more than just about anything else . it doesn ' t have to be innately sexual . just like sexualities and , closer in relation , fetishes , nobody knows why fantasies exist . but there is speculation that the reason they remain fantasies is because people rarely see themselves participating in real life .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

11. " why did i just type this incoherent bullshit , and why can ' t i stop myself from posting it "
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

12. in objective reality , herding children into groups of thirty and having them close their eyes while they pretend to psychically communicate with a deity , does not do anything at all to prevent gun violence . it doesn ' t really do anything at all , period . it ' s pure political posturing and religious exploitation of children . i completely agree with this .  also in objective reality , instituting reasonable , nuanced , and tested gun control policies is strongly associated with reduced firearm  based violence , homicide , and suicide . these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . this statement is technically true , but misleading . let me quote relevant part of scott alexander ' s essay   " gun violence " is the wrong category to use here .   suppose that you went to your doctor and said " i keep having headaches in my bed at night "   your doctor says " you should sleep on the couch .   you ask your doctor " and that will solve my problem of having headaches "   your doctor says " no , it will solve your problem of having headaches in your bed "   this is a bad solution , because although the problem was phrased as " i have headaches in my bed " , the real problem is just headaches . if we get rid of bed headaches at the cost of causing exactly the same number of couch headaches , that ' s completely useless .   " gun violence " is a category much like " bed headaches . some criminologists very reasonably propose a " substitution effect "  that is , if someone wants to commit murder , they ' ll use the most convenient weapon they can get your hands on . if that weapon gets banned , they will substitute the next most convenient weapon , and so on , rather than just deciding not to commit any more murders .   so suppose there were digit , digit gun deaths in the united states . the government bans guns , it is miraculously successful , and gun deaths go down to zero . sadly , by a total coincidence there are also digit , digit more knife deaths .   this would not be a good outcome , but if we ' re looking at " gun violence " , we could hail it as a victory  " gun control reduced gun violence levels to zero ! our plan has worked ! hooray "   so if we actually want to look at effectiveness of policies , we need to be measuring something else , like the total homicide rate . another wordy essay from scott alexander in which he spends a lot of time analyzing studies of gun control efficacy and comes to the conclusion that australia  style gun control , if implemented in the us , will probably , maybe , tentatively , reduce deaths somewhat . maybe .  these gun control policies don ' t revoke , deny , violate , or impede the exercise of your second amendment rights  if you ' re a mentally sound , non  violent person , you ' ll be able to get a gun to use in whatever safe , legal manner you choose . i am not a usa citizen and second amendment is not relevant to me , actually .  when you consider objective reality , there is no argument . there is no debate , except over the details of the gun control legislation that we ' re going to enact . if scott alexander didn ' t remember to consider objective reality , then his advice isn ' t worth consideration . frankly , scott alexander ' s analysis is much more nuanced than " there is no argument " claim . there clearly is an argument , and pretending otherwise is delusional . if you have specific rebuttals of points made in the essay , i want to read them . claiming someone does not consider objective reality does not constitute a proper argument , though .   x200b

13. there is truth in the madman ' s words , they say , and wonder if he is mad or wise , and the answer may be both or neither . allow me to inquire as to your focus , what is it you like to understand most ?

16. once again , start little has managed to evade law enforcement by bribing the judge and threatening his children . he  s friends with the head of police and has , on several occasions , committed tax fraud , sexual abuse , and invasion of personal property . he sold drugs not only to adults in desperate need of therapy , but also to teenagers and disabled children . this fucking rat picked mostly black neighborhoods on purpose not only to feed the stereotype but also to , as he said ,  eradicate the fucking blacks .  amidst unsocial behavior , dishonesty , racism , criminality and a personality that would only fit the devil himself , this piece of shit hypocrite rat is also the head of the klu  klux  klan , the official american nazi party , and he controls several brutal prison gangs that has together taken the lives of several hundreds of unsuspecting and innocent humans . it  s not only that he lets people kill for him , it  s also that he has gotten his little rodent piece of shit paws dirty himself . he shot a black man that was trying to protect his family from the racial slurs he used against them , he lured a mother of two into a forest and brutally murdered her after raping her in the most degrading way possible . he cut her open and dug into her flesh while screaming   this stupid cunt isn  t going to reject me another time .  as wanderers reported . not only that but they could also hear him say ,  her pussy could be my new rat hole .  while laughing vigorously . and as if all of that wasn  t bad enough , this embodiment of evil also drowned a child in a well since he ,  couldn  t listen to his fucking high pitched voice any longer so i made him meet his fate .  i just can  t see how all of this is still overlooked and glossed over by the government and how this piece of shit is still allowed to walk as if he had never done anything to anyone . i  m literally shaking with anger and i  m about to collapse when i think of all of the things this white piece of shit has done . i want to drown him in a bucket full of my own cum while pulling out each and every single one of his rat fucking hairs . i want to crush his little bones and smash every one of his little teeth one by one . i won  t be able to contain my anger if i ever see him just one more fucking time . i will run him over and take a shit on his corpse . i  ll gauge his eyes out and piss in the sockets . i will perform cpr on him so he stays alive for a little while longer to experience even more pain than his tiny little rat ass has caused . just his smile on tv is enough to make my blood boil and make me phantasies about cutting him in a thousand tiny pieces that i will scatter across the graves of his loved ones . i will cut off his ears just as he did it to that nice old lady across the street because as he said and i quote ,  this walking skeleton shouldn  t be able to hear my exclusive voice , it  s a waste of my energy and she sould just die so i can distribute more of my offspring across the world .  just produce more children you piece of shit rat i will find every single one of them and strangle them with my bare hands you  ve done enough to this world i just want you and everyone that is just related to you in the slightest dead the only waste of energy in this world is your miserable life i will find you and i will end the sorry little piece of shit you all your life . smile in my face one more time nd i will snap your neck infront of your children just like you did it with my only son that me and my wife tried to concieve for several years just because i  m almost impotent it was almost impossible and we  re very lucky that it eve worked but you waste of fucking matter ended his life and told me that it was only a matter of time you ruined my life and i will end yours no one can help you anymore your days are over fuck you stuart little i will be visiting your grave every day so i can spit on it and pour my dogs vomit over the flowers your family placed im going to make their lives hell after your death with every little detail i can ruin about their days . i will piss in te apple juice i will throw my litter in your yard im gonna pop your tires and throw dog shit at your front door you  ll be sorry for everything you ever did to anyone im gonna make you regret everything especially that one time when you thought it wuld be funny to throw shit at my wife who became permanantly brain damaged because of it i don  t know how you could be worse of a fucking human but wait you  re not you  re just a fucking mouse in human clothing i bet you need to get specially fiitted clothes because you  re such a tiny little piece of shit your dick isn  t even digit in . at least make an excuse for it it  s not possible for anyone to be such a pile of trash you must have mental issues i hope you die gruesome death i hope you get run over by your own family please just end yourself i just don  t fucking
