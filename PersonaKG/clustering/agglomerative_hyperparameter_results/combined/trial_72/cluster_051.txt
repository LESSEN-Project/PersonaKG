   (ID: 9c2d2fde31927b8cc3bc419049de8844ca720cb9)

4. you  re not wrong , but please drop the phrase  mentally handicapped  from your vocabulary . there is often this idea that people with cognitive disabilities are unable to learn , so there  s no point in trying . or that discipline is mean because they won  t understand . it  s very much false . ideally , one would begin by teaching them on the same level as anyone else , and then , if needed , lowering the bar a little at a time until they reach a point that the learner can succeed with some effort . setting the goalposts too low on learning i use learning in the broadest sense possible , not just academically does no one any favors .
   (ID: 3f4f5511095f668b3c84312b8bfeb87b30dd8f03)

5. i can answer this despite being an english speaker . it ' s because you haven ' t been taught that cuss words in other languages are just as bad . we never snuck around our parents to say " mierda " , unless of course you ' re spanish , so yeah . it ' s just that it wasn ' t drilled into your head like it is with your own version of the word . like americans using bollocks

   (ID: d1e274dbfcf8ed1af55bb50c57e00046b961b6fd)

7. exhibitionism . there ' s an old saying that guys want a good girl that ' s only bad for them . i don ' t think that ' s reasonable , i ' m just more turned on by a bad girl . i want to hear her talk about doing things socially questioned .
   (ID: 2a43fd1ba18ed201f563f660a853be569ebb3917)

8. tactics ? i always get quality medical care . no special efforts need , being sick or believing i might be sick is all it takes .
   (ID: 067b7441373b7dfebd4b068272381804c26fe6dc)

   (ID: 833bc208589bf538daebb1a7e14d70fa8a3b7808)

14. being excited when you see them . i read something on here about it and it makes sense  they will start to feel happy when they see you and show that without possibly knowing why .
   (ID: a3811395c0f6d89e991295b692a54743e657581e)

15. omg ! so everday when i go to school i have this teacher . hes my social studies teacher and lets call him mr hardy . everyday he always tells us these wierd and awful fake jokes and facts . he says things like ' the earth is flat and oh ! heres a good one . water is wet . its very annoying . hes one of those people who go on the internet and believe litterally anything .

18. i  ve learned its about matching energy . if they  re upset and boisterous about it , match it . if it  s more of a somber rant , be quieter in your response ex her   i just can  t even believe she  d do that ! it  s crazy !  you   yea thats super fucked up !  her   im just really down right now you know ?  you   yea , it do be like that sometimes .  if you constantly try to fix the issues they come at you with it makes it seem like you  re trivializing their problems because , in their eyes , you  re saying the answer is obvious . everyone wants to just vent now and then and having someone reciprocate your feelings feels better than answers sometimes .
   (ID: e9bd2e5a75b03c2a8d39168be58f6bed5ed6ff39)

19. upon parking my car , my co  worker chimed in with " watching you pull in makes me wish your dad pulled out " my parking job was fine , btw . we just roast eachother at every opportunity .
