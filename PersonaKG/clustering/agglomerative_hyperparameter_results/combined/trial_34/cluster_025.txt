   (ID: c1c3bee034ba3e70e4bd22d7987533e43f2b424b)

2. absolutely go with him . good odds on what he ' s offering is better than what i have now . bonus  if it sucks there , too , at least i had a transitional period of hope before business as usual .
   (ID: 2988ee1cd7a2bcf8e2d215c795ee2d06a985665a)

3. i know what it is . it aligns with that by which i put my hope and faith into , humanity . that and i hold no reservation for superstition or a " higher " power .
   (ID: b5153b16e61f6bc5e4bf4d8db479b7093df1ae26)

6. i hope she shocks the hell out of you and knows sign language im in college learning it and it is one of the best things ive ever done for myself . hearing aids ideally arent a big deal but im curious so i wonder , do you have photos of you wearing them ?
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

7. " hope you find the one cause it ain ' t me " . i have been reeling from a break up with my ex fiance in this kind of situation . it gets easier , now you must focus on finding your happiness without that person because they don ' t bring you happiness . root your happiness in things you do for yourself , not in the emotions that other people give you .
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

8. i mean that seems like the best way to do it and not want to kill yourself by the end , but i ' m glad it turned out this well and i hope that you have a good day
   (ID: feb4a6aeed8e7e14b0592329bd91d7933a93217e)

9. religion will always be relevant no matter how smart we become or how advanced our science and technology become because that doesn ' t matter to people who turn to religion as a moral compass . religion provides some sort of hope for those living in hard times as well . obviously , large portions of mainstream religions today are pretty fucked up , but religion changes . so that ' s my answer without resorting to reddit sarcasm and typical " hurr durr religioius people stupid " answers . i ' m not religious , btw
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

10. my parents are abusive shits . i hope they die already be .

   (ID: 841a375b464a5650f1c027d1c7ae73415228c6ab)

18. yes she is very close to her stepmother . you asked about our relationship , we have been in a de facto relationship for about digit . digit years now . i have been doing what i can to comfort her and be there for her . i took her out to lunch today i actually wrote this post on the drive home to take her mind off of things and get out of the house . at the moment she is ok then bursts into tears at random times so all i can do is hug her , tell her i love her and let her cry it out . when she was told she cried and then asked to be left alone for a while so if she needs some space i think she will tell me . thank you for the advice , there is a lot there to take in so i will have to read it a few times . her stepmother still might pull through and beat it , but all we can do at this stage is hope for the best . thank you again for helping me understand and giving me pointers on how to approach this .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)
