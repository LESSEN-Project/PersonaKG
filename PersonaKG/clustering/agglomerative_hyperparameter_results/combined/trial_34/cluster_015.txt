9. i am i suppose . i just think it  s a bit disrespectful in the first instance to post pictures of someone that to me look to be taken with their knowledge , for the internet then to judge whether or not she  s healthy . she might be perfectly healthy for all we know . i believe there  s an element of people using health as a means to justifying their resentment .
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

14. i believe it gives you a little bit more time as you still have enough time to walk under them before your timer is up and you can log out , and they would have to pathfind to you which takes longer than someone standing beside you . although i guess you could just barrage them and run while logging , i dunno .

15. but you ' re expecting the outcome of making fire and trying to achieve it . if you had no concept of what it was or where it came from , why would you believe you could make it , or try to ? you know it can be made by friction and other sources . they apparently only know it comes from lightening . and they can ' t make that , so they have no reason to try rubbing sticks together .
   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

16. it wasn ' t a mistake . what about america ' s history leads you to believe when they slaughter innocents it ' s an accident ?

   (ID: c1d25617a1246516c7145552a8766d09f4816240)

20. i understand that it helps you feel better , and that staying away from it is stressful , and that there ' s so way for me or anyone from this community to make you stop , but even though i don ' t know you , i want you to be safe , i hope that you ' re able to pass that digit day mark of no sh one day , i believe in you .
