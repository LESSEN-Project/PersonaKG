1. this is why he is getting more volatile , he sees you growing stronger and therefore less dependant and submissive . as others have said , do not get into counseling with this man , he will use what he learns against you . as part of your plan , see a lawyer and discover what you need to do to prove abuse . my ex accused me of child alienation , and i spent lots of money and digit years paying lawyers trying to prove otherwise . consider asking for supervised visitation . even if he has not actively harmed your child , with anger issues it ' s only a matter if time . call family , former friends , and close acquaintances and tell them you are trying to leave him , you ' ll be amazed at the support you will receive many already know he ' s abusive and are waiting for you to recognize it . he counts on you believing you are all alone , prove him wrong . feel free to contact me , i know what you are going through and i will help you as much as i can .

4. i stayed trying to help her and be the supporting spouse , the suicide attempts , the anger , the lashing out , the never being good enough , the weeks of abuse and then the apology and the same pattern over and over again . you can only for so long go about questioning your every move and how will it get thrown back at you . i was hurt and hurt to a depth that makes therapists cry , i forgive her , she is ill , am i still hurt ? yes from time to time . yes it does feel like those digit years were ripped from me .
   (ID: 02e4b90101e07338b4251209256c01652a022c5d)

5. well if you knew exactly which neurons were responsible you could trace the signal to the exact nerves where the " signals for consiousness originate . that then narrows down the work significantly , then all you have to do is make sure the nerves pass the 40mv point  and i feel like we have many ways we could do that . i mean it just inhibiting electricity right ?

9. pretty much all the time but it quickly turns to dysphoria and depression . i tend to find its more about who they are , how they carry themselves , what they wear , especially if its something i can identify with , rather then whether i feel there pretty .
   (ID: 2e1439e8eb18b181a69a66cc4c1b2dc22ce774f0)

   (ID: 8285a776fd60b145ed2afc145cdf2b926b93ed8b)

19. who said anything about cutting calories ? i said eating . once . a . day . eating once a day doesn  t necessarily mean you  re cutting calories . it depends on what you eat and how physical you are . i assumed the op eats something high in calories and fat for that one meal which if you eat a meal with those characteristics you will hinder any weight loss efforts but the op said they  re not trying to lose weight so it  s irrelevant .
