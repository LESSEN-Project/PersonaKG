1. I'm interested in depression and anxiety.
   (ID: f0bbaad5859eeb6263167cb895c64b86a48638ee)

2. i have issues with this . why is a blind person using a pencil . why are they trying to colour something . are they drawing something ? if so what are they drawing , does it look like the thing ? or is it like in the episode of becker where jake sculpts a woman but it looks kind of like a blob , until he explains that it is how she feels ?
   (ID: 8360c6d04ba11da7a727532482d78505e52a4150)

   (ID: fdf9c56e21cf61fb3b2852da66f6506ce908651c)

5. woodworking man . go pick up a stack of free pallets , and you can tear them down with an hour and a hammer . after that , you know you have free wood , so even if what you make is crap , it didn ' t cost a dime . make a shelf , box , whatever . if it ' s something you ' re into , it ' ll grow to making cool stuff . and if you ' re not into it , no harm no foul , didn ' t cost anything but a few basic tools if you don ' t have them hammer , drill and circular saw will handle most everything , and are cheap online  craigslist . good luck man ! hope it works out

   (ID: bfe383e709c2236b3ebe70cb079877dd420ac82b)

8. in my limited experience  it ' s best to set boundaries clearly , but one issue at a time . you walking up to her mother and saying " you need to back off " immediately sets you up as the adversary trying to cut her off from her baby girl in the most important time . you ' ll be treated that way from that point forward . instead , you need to talk about the individual things with your wife so you have an agreed stance the next time they come up with your mil . it ' s way less likely to lead to war if you can hold your wife ' s hand and speak up for her saying ' we ' ve decided it ' s best if it ' s just us and the medical staff in the delivery room ' , ' we ' ve done the research and want to do x ' , etc . than if you go in by yourself and try to lay down the law to a mother about her child . you can be the one to make the statements , but they need to be phrased as joint decisions with your wife ' s clear if silent support . if your wife doesn ' t want to have those conversations alone alone , that ' s fine . her part becomes to deflect , i . e . " we ' ll talk about it next time we see you " , or just not respond when the mil isolates her on an issue . her backtracking or bargaining alone will kill any progress you make by standing strong together . talk to her about that , too . also , congrats and good luck !

15. your bf should not be entertaining other girls , especially if he knows it upsets you . if he won ' t respect your wishes then you need to leave him . you can ' t just magically get over it if it hurts you . it ' s going to continue bothering you and it sounds like he ' s going to continue doing it . i know leaving someone you love hurts , but trust me , you ' re digit , you are gonna thank yourself for leaving now and not waiting till you ' re digit . do you wanna be in a better place in digit years or do you wanna stay with someone who makes you feel like shit ? it doesn ' t matter how many things are going good , he doesn ' t respect you .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

16. the president is telling you we need to go to war . does congress do everything the president says ?  you do not yet have the information about how gwb got a briefing in august that it was going to happen and ignored it . the president is not the only one who gets briefings . the democrats are on committees that get most of the same briefings . they have access to top secret information that you and i dont have unless you are getting e  mails from hillary clinton . they knew what the president knew and they did nothing either . to vote for war and then say bush lied is a fucking lie . they are as responsible as he is . im willing to admit that bush was pushing for war and was wrong to do so , but what you cant to is hold those democrats responsible for letting a war happen that they should have prevent if it was such a bad thing .
