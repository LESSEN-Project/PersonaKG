6. depends how urgently you need an extra merge for scoring purposes . if this gets you over some arena tier threshold or makes it a lot easier , i ' d say merge . but as you said ,  digit merge doesn ' t do much in itself so i ' d say fodder her if you really want to do that build .

   (ID: 8031d2235c5c79aed4436e575113c1efb8fbe777)

9. i  d like to think of men as more than just a monthly income . i  m not saying they should get the final say , but not giving a shit about their feelings on the matter is incredibly disgusting
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

10. that  s a tough situation . i say go for it if he  s being toxic enough to cut both of you off for something like that . my friend talked to me about it and we spoke about it for a bit . i  m mainly just not looking forward to the first couple times we all go out and hang out together lol
   (ID: 82b1cc976e9cc8f0d95b0d28452197c9a2b333d2)

11. and i just said it depends that  s why i used the word potentially on what you  re eating and how high it is in fat , calories and carbs . if we use the algorithm you used but let  s say the meal you eat is a double cheese burger , large fry and desert with a coke once a day . and everyday you eat meals like same fat and carb intake that that balance out to digit and your  expenditure  is digit . you will gain weight because of the foods you  re consuming . different foods break down differently in the body . if eating one healthy meal a day was the key to weight loss everyone would do it and digit  yikes of americans wouldn  t be overweight . multiple factors involved .

12. exactly , you ' re not here to entertain me , but this post was meant to entertain whether or not it ' s for easy karma is a different matter . this is the first time i saw this , and judging from all the up doots , i ' d say i ' m not the only one . nothing is original because someone is always going to say it first , all that matters is how and when you do it .

13. culture is a big reason why burgers are so big in the usa . it wasn ' t always so . in america ' s early days trout , chickens , turkeys were more the staples . even then they were relative luxuries goods  grain , corn , amaranth were what you used to feed the family . burgers became popular for a few factors after ww2 think levittown , americana , post war middle class convienences it is like when people say ' starbucks has mediocre coffee ' very few people order a straight black coffee  you ' re paying for the experience , the personalitzation , an affordable luxury . and then mcdonald ' s  an assembly line restaurant  that specialized in burgers . now that the novelty , luxury , personalization has worn off ,  trends have moved on , whats left is the product itself . that being said , there are some very few places that can make a good buger worth ordering . although i have a lot more fun making my own  fresh ground beef , actual vegetables not the pale mcd ' s kind , actual purples , reds , yellows , greens some delicious sauces ketchup is gross and a brioche or sesame bun from a local bakery so have my upvote

14. just ask her if she wants to break up . simply asking has better outcomes , you let her know that you aren  t happy with the situation and giving her the chance to say yes or no lets the relationship end smoother and with less hard feeling than if it comes to a point were it is too much for either of you .

   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

17. if the foundations of your house crumbled , would you just say  fuck it  and remain there ? if you live a while away from the jobs , borrow the money to buy a secondhand bicycle and ride it to the nearest town , and to see your friends . the littlest steps are often the biggest . you  ll get there , i know it  s difficult , but you can get it .
   (ID: 0f6c6c4bd3531c7f028b4bf901123522dd67c300)

18. but when i tell people this , they say i wasn ' t alive then so i don ' t know what i ' m talking about . i ' m smart enough to know debt is bad grandpa .
