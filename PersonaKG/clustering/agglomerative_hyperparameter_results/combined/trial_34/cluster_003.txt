1. makes sense . just funny how all ' s i did was make an observation which is most likely correct and instead of either acknowledging it , or moving on , they have to be so salty for some reason .

2. . how did you do this
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

3. see , it is weird for me because i know it is good for me and that he was emotionally vindictive but some parts of me just miss components of our friendship that only we had and none of my other friends have shared since . it only makes me more upset because i think he genuinely did treat me poorly and i hate how he always convinced me that it was my fault i felt that way . it was just some shit . it also took a pretty serious fight to separate us , but a part of me is still wishing i could fix that and be friends . maybe that says something about how i perceive myself or my friend group ? i dunno . i could go on but . comment section lel

4. two or three times a month i dream about very dirty public restrooms , or stalls with no doors , or toilets up on pedestals . these are extremely vivid and realistic dreams and i remember several details about most of them . i didn  t know how common it was until my dad said he had the same dream , so i did a google search and it turns out it  s fairly common . something about being insecure and vulnerable .
