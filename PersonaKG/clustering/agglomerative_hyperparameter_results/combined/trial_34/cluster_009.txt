13. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .

   (ID: f0cc6658fb97955562b5f1b7845c6141dd2eefdf)

18. i always assume they are not chasing but getting caught in the air currents of people running away . when you move fast there is a tiny area of low pressure behind you and they sort of get caught up in that . walk away slowly and they don ' t appear to follow unless you ' re eating something they want

20. sorry , you want to work backwards because you haven ' t provided a real answer to your own initial comments about what the existing frameworks don ' t provide " the tools aren ' t there " yes , i ' m asking you to give me a framework for an example , so i can look at it and see where i would run into a roadblock . i ' ve looked at several and at the end of the day i decided making things custom would just be easier , especially for future development , i ' ll know the ins and outs . i gave foggy answers because i don ' t want to say exactly how my stuff works i ' m sure its nothing unique but as of yet i haven ' t seen it anywhere so better safe than sorry lets say i want to back  test my strategy on btcusd , my strategy involves gathering abstract data . i want the backtest to provide a report listing the trades . on those trades i want to have columns showing the temperature of london when the trade was " executed " , as well as a picture of elon musks most recent tweet . i then use this data , to train or usually just manually studying . now , that ' s not actually how it works but as an example , that ' s what i need . if you know of a framework that can easily render images for each trade along with providing generated comments to go along with those trades , that i can then take and seamlessly take it into a ml environment and train it , i would honestly like to see it , it might make my job easier .
