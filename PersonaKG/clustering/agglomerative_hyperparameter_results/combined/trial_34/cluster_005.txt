19. i wish i were joking too women dont tend to talk about how a loss feels or how it ' s not just a loss but more like the death of a dream . " be lucky for the kids you do have " is not a consolation in any way .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

20. i watched this when i was digit shortly after i saw forrest gump and i was struck by how similar the films were . each tells the story of a unique individual ' s life throughout history and the women he loves . however where zemeckis is overly sappy and a bit to hookey , fincher makes a much more subdued version with a whole lot more nuance . both pitt and blanchett give stellar performances and i wish we talked about their performances more . additionally , this is a lot more visual than zemeckis ' s film with blanchett ' s gazebo dance scene being a real highlight of fincher ' s visual style . all in all i like this a lot more than forrest gump and i think people deserve to give it another chance .
