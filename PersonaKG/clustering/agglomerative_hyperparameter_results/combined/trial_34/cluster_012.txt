   (ID: 6f3d93754035383ba31c7eb4503265c62893fa84)

14. the entire point of the game is to kill people first lol . if they don  t notice said people who are entirely in your fov like you said they should be at a deserved disadvantage . like you said , this is going nowhere .
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

15. if the type of collaboration that you are missing is in her job description , and she ' s not putting in the effort , then this is a simple job performance issue and she needs to be reprimanded like any employee any where who ' s failing to do something he or she ' s supposed to . but something else might be going on which is cultural . if her department  role has never been clearly informed by a superior or by official company policy communications that collaboration with your department  role is a required or encouraged thing , she might not be likely to do so . having worked in a vietnamese company made up of expats and locals , everything is very compartmentalized and different departments have different line managers , and collaboration with other departments happens not as a general work culture , but when specifically assigned by the boss . and this is something i ' ve observed in my experience , but hesitate to apply to all vietnamese , but yes , as others have posted , there could definitely be a " why should i do your job " kind of lack of motivation going on , too . especially if you ' re based in vietnam and earning 3x your vn co  worker for doing a job that might not be that much more difficult or important than theirs .

18. dude ' s an idiot . " i ' m out to prove that i can eat shit for cheap , so i ' m going to buy the most expensive vegetables to prove my point . it ' s like saying you can ' t afford a bmw so you might as well take the bus .
   (ID: 7911b1d92de80b0e1abd4e2a29e4f762a8a2908f)

19. lol what are you going to say ? just straight up ask  what are your views on feminism ?  you think a guy that wants to have sex with you is going to say  oh i hate women  ?
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

20. i agree but you can ' t really expect him to give us the whole story he wants encouragement and if we tell him not to and his parents do to then he ' s going to doubt it its def a biased post but in the end its probably going to be better for him than then keeping him from it entirely atleast he ' ll know why he should have now rather than just being told he shouldn ' t
