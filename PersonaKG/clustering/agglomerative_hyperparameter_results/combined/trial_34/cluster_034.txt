1. there  s def been more funny , but tedy bruschi  s face on first take when stephen a had one of the biggest fuck ups i  ve ever seen killed me and is something i will never forget .
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

2. its not common but i have seen a few myself , and unfortunately as far as i  m aware it  s unusable
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

3. the fear of spiders is not something humans are born with , it is something you learn . if your parents always start screaming and crying when they see spiders , you ' ll learn to think spiders are scary . dogs also don ' t have an instinctual fear of spiders , so they would have to be taught to fear them too . most dogs aren ' t afraid of spiders , so they don ' t have a born fear of them either . but i ' ve seen dogs that are afraid of spiders , and their owners are always afraid of them too , so it seems they can learn it too .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

4. hey guys , great place you ' ve got here . something struck me , and i decided i need to go ahead and grow out what i can and see where it goes . most times i ' ve had some degree of facial hair , but anything of beard caliber seemed a far off dream . then i figured , " why not " any tips ? also , and this may be an odd question . based on what you guys see here , could you link me to a picture of a beard that looks similar to how you ' d anticipate mine coming in ? just figuring since you ' ve guys seen many beards start off here , you can kind of read where it may go to a degree . edit  my plan is to let it grow at least one month , sept . 1st .
   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

6. i was gone just to sleep and ive only seen memes that are talking about locker memes . i have yet to see an actual locker meme and it is driving me crazy
   (ID: 41ecb08cd807b953da29a82cba9ddfcf32745fc3)

   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

8. there are a few groups on fb that i follow . morale patch classifieds is a good one . you get to see how crazy some people get with their collections . i  ve seen specific , rare patches sell for  digit . it  s insane . haha . i mostly buy pdw , phil swanson , destination zero , trail toys , etc .
   (ID: 2cc106beadb9cde22175338488da9efb20933748)

9. is it really ? because everyone i know who  s seen me do it looks at me like i  m an alien .
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

10. when i was digit i got a ticket for riding without a seatbelt because the cop claimed he had been watching , and my dad disengaged the park before my belt had clicked . i had no job or anything so digit  was a big deal , and the cop looked like the most pathetic , sweaty , airwaster i  d ever seen . clearly hadn  t issued a ticket in ages and just had to get his quota up .
   (ID: 8df56ee782672f11aeb0f19bf7978b1b1c04e678)

11. you don ' t think that ' s ever worked before ? i ' ve done it myself in an apartment unit and that worked , and i ' ve seen growing up these guys across from where i lived they were blasting their music at night , my neighbour yelled at them and told them to turn their fucken music off and bam the music went off
   (ID: 564c5b4efd54586fbf212727e2071f5ddadabb82)

12. former hotel manager here . this for sure ! managers are held under such high scrutiny in this industry and can be seen as relatively disposable . a positive review for a manager that had to give a service recovery could go a long way for them . also , as a gold member , the hhonors desk is your best friend . they will often go to bat for you should you have issues in the future .
   (ID: 2988ee1cd7a2bcf8e2d215c795ee2d06a985665a)

13. marvel movies , i  ve never seen a single one and i guess it  s too late to start now
   (ID: 589a27cacaffb5126785db9f91c141a3cea2daae)

14. in what way was it clear that he had assistants feeding him information ? i ' ve never seen his live show but i know he has been under intense media scrutiny for his entire career . if he was cheating in this way i can ' t help but feel he would have been publicly busted for it .
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

15. yeah i  ve usually seen it from middle school , but looking back at what i saw i still think it  s f  up . but you can  t change people  s ways on this sadly
   (ID: d9e6e1ecc09dc9affbcc8ccb0191ff241370a782)

16. thanks for giving me a well thought out answer . it ' s just strange because everyone i knew got a job , if we liked it . great . if we didn ' t . we quit . i ' m not that old digit so i ' m not trying to pull some " back in my day " reasoning . it ' s just that i can ' t get over the sense of entitlement in some of the interviews i ' ve seen .
   (ID: 46ebabd043d7d3e7a17fff03489569373a3fe5d4)

17. thanks for the rec ! there ' s honestly no reason i haven ' t seen this or the handmaiden yet .

18. tbh i never even seen that until you pointed it out
   (ID: 41ecb08cd807b953da29a82cba9ddfcf32745fc3)

19. interesting . i personally wouldn ' t do it because of my flat feet , but i ' ve seen people do it before , so i guess there is something to be said about it . what made you decide to go barefoot though ? also , how do you handle cold weather , especially cold winters ?
   (ID: bfc2e9a6e5f84327293fa1a1fd0287066782bcec)

20. you should have seen the terminator . and the institute has no control over their emotions , they are self aware , not even knowing they are robots  synths , and they are just like ghouls , they don ' t age .
