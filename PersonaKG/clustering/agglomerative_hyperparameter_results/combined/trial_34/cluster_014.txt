6. she ' s only snored while i was conscious at least every few months before , last few weeks have been rough . i just sleep on the couch if it becomes a big issue . that sounds rough i guess , but i actually sleep at least as well if not better on the couch than in bed . i made sure to talk to her about it and make sure she knew there were no hard feelings and it was just a practical matter . i never start out there , and make a point to spend time talking to her and the bump before she goes to sleep every night , we just agreed i can bail if i need to .

   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

14. thank you so much for sharing . honestly the fb groups made me wonder if i wasn  t worried enough about keratoconus . it made me question if i wasnt taking keratoconus serious . post referring to  how much do you miss your life before keratoconus  were really there to bring people down no lift them up thankfully with comments like yours il realize like im not the only who see keratoconus as something that sucks but i also making sure it doesn  t control my everyday life .
   (ID: 01d4ddab8cb9e73e5e85941c592482da1b3c6bcd)

15. google anything you are not sure about , every little thing . digit  of the time you find the answer . it seems like common sense but most people never do it .
   (ID: 20e44d996799f8bb3fe89546818050bf021f4be9)

16. this is a very smart looking app . a few things that stood out to me as a software architect  i ' m not sure whether the iap unlocks this but it would be quite nice to be able to swipe back from full screen images like you swipe from everything else . it ' s especially a speed bump when using a phone with the right hand and not being able to reach the top left x one  handed . i ' m quite sure you have a bug in your comment folding . some comments fold gracefully but some fold the ops name too and then make it reappear below the fold which is a bit disorientating .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

17. sure you dislocated it ? it has to be pushed back down so it can pop back into place . i had to go to hospital .
   (ID: 2ad50e702ea7ef4cc62a34ca116f658d564c0474)

18. identifying as a tortoise is not enough , you would have to undergo the nessecarry surgery to become a transtortoise . i ' d recommend talking to your doctor about this . or , if you ' re quite sure if this is right for you , you can talk to some real transtortoises .
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

19. i ' d say lie about it , your idea of having to pick someone up at the airport is a really good viable excuse given that it ' s the holidays , people may be flying in at weird hours , etc . the one thing i would say about lying though is that if you guys post pictures or run into any coworker ' s or anything while out they could catch you in the lie . i don ' t know where you work so i may be totally off base in saying this but i work retail too and it ' s not ever , ever busy that late at night , even on weekends . if you ' re a good employee i imagine they wouldn ' t be too mad about letting you leave an hour early , you could always start by saying " oh can i leave an hour early i have a prior commitment " and then if they ask you could give the excuse , you never know what they ' ll say before you ask , really . you could even make sure to do extra work or make sure your work would be adequately covered by those already there before you ask .

20. tell him you love him . of course , not in the homosexual way unless you swing that way but make sure that he knows you care about him , considering you seem to be the only person he has .
