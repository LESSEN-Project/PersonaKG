9. that sounds like you have some really tense fingers , no idea what would help with that . my best guess would be to pay attention to your hand while you play and see if it gets super tense , and if so relax a bit . otherwise visiting your doctor might help

13. the judeo  christian god is an absolute of everything we consider desirable , to the extent that it is unattainable and conflicting , all powerful , all knowing , and all loving sound good on paper , but conflict with the presence of evil polytheistic religions tend to have gods that celebrate human characteristics and imperfections . unfortunately , gods that celebrate human characteristics like partying , drinking , war , and sex aren ' t good for " controlling people " everything good is attributed to one god , everything bad attributed to our humanity .

20. i understand , i was being facetious . it sounds like he genuinely trusts you and you him . if getting this off your chest will relieve the stress it is causing , i say go for it . obviously include how much this has weighed on you even though nothing happened . if things between you and your boyfriend are as you describe it seems it would be a nonissue .
