1. what ' s the thing with pickles suddenly ? i am confusion
   (ID: 7e58269155b84bc057025d5066e661ba2eb934ba)

2. hcgator digit points digit hours ago it depends . are you parents immigrants ? if so , you are more likely screwed . this . you are super screwed if they are immigrants . usually they hold the closest value to the homeland . though my parents are immigrants , they took it slowly when i brought home my african american gf . it ' s a culture thing i am sure you are aware of . how close are you to your parents ? can you joke with them ? have a heart to heart ? here ' s my story , i joked with my dad about having a black gf , he threatened to kick me out of the house . until that is , i kept on joking and telling him this , " this is america , this is what young people do now " eventually he got it and when he met her , he loved her . they would sit and talk and being immigrants , they have stereotypes they would cook her fried chicken and slice watermelon . so they went from being rude racists to polite racist . really though , they literally asked if she is coming so they can make her " people " food . my gf took it in stride , she loved my parents and thought it was hilarious when the chicken came out .

   (ID: 64ee30820164d5febf4618f35085fd26a3387cc9)

4. there are several reasons why people prefer to use audio . these are a few . 1efficiency  cuts down on cpu 2creativity  there  s a certain forward motion that comes from printing it and moving on . 3originality  you can work with audio in lots of ways you can  t with midi . this gives you a lot more options in tailoring your sounds or running it through other samplers etc . 4transferability  if you give it to another engineer , you know he  she is getting just what you intended . 5quality  to be honest i can  t speak with great authority on the science but my intuition tells me you probably get less aliasing errors with printed audio . freezing , stacking , etc . all of these achieve number digit . if your system  s bogged down it  s a no brainer . but in in my opinion , it takes about the same time to run an offline bounce or commit as it does to freeze it  s a bit longer but fast so why not capitalize on all the advantages ? hope this helps !

5. I am computer.
   (ID: 98df62eadd0a0c80a6084d5e352985209b46cce9)

6. well even if that ' s the case , it ' s sort of hard to just take control  analyze your own subconscious without professional help . this was like a few months ago . i guess my biggest fear relationship wise is becoming that father in the movies who is so thrown into his work , that he never makes time for his family which causes them to drift apart . this could be something else or just something petty . i mean i won ' t tolerate something that ' s obviously worse like cheating or something but i ' m not sure how to " fix " my issues in terms of attraction unless professional help is called upon i guess . i think it could be way worse though .
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

7. big baseball fan here  the scene in " digit " where the opposing manager is just giving it to jackie robinson , calling him all manner of horrible things .
   (ID: 2bb956084cb9bf79f58345d6cf6beca98e76bbb4)

8. because i  m just trying to get to where i need to go and don  t care about making eye contact with random people . why do you care ?
   (ID: 8cdbf7ed2ace2eeed8bd2b0e2e86001342f83a1f)

9. snap out of the loop and start approaching . i understand how you feel about everyone feeling tired after work . but , you could be the make or break in someone ' s day . consider a party with your boss . everyone is shaking his hand and being all professional . and then you walk in and treat him like a normal person , and bring in high energy . he will like you and respect you for being real and treating him like an actual person . others will see this and start doing the same . break everyone out of the loop . just because everyone else is doing something doesn ' t mean it ' s taboo to do something else . take risks . now do the same thing in dating , break everyone out of autopilot . change what is perceived as normal everyone doing their own thing , to approaching . you will definitely get shot down more though , since some won ' t be in the mood to talk .
