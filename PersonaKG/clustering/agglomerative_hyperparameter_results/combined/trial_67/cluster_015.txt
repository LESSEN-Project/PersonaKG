1. ps i love you . the best critical review i read about it was  " go see p . s . i love you , or you could hit yourself on the head with a meat mallet " that describes the movie perfectly .
   (ID: 1b4a970a63450e21b56e1d38502b30aca032cd3f)

4. well , i have studied but am not proficient with japanese candlestick patterns , chart patterns , i am starting with tape reading , i am trying to learn market cycles , applying the news , correlation between forex  stocks , i would like to learn options and the mathematics behind it . ah , i know what you mean . so , i actually don ' t really know all of that other stuff either . i know the basics , not the terminology . once you understand what the candles actually " mean " then the names and specific " patterns " mean very little . i feel just a basic knowledge of the candles will suffice  but i know concepts nothing i can actual trade with on my own . i really work hard and i put forth the effort  work . i am doing this full time and have some savings to weather the storm while i learn to trade on my own . i would start by finding a basic strategy and then working to improve it . i would say half the battle is just getting " into the zone " or as close to it as possible . there ' s a great book ironically named trading in the zone , by mark douglas . if you ' ve been working this for a bit it would probably be a perfect read ! a lot of the topics went over my head the very first time i read it , after re  reading it though it was completely different to me !  i am willing to switch to one software like e  signal which will do both . i would love some help ! i also want to continue onto python  algo trading afterwards . that ' s the direction i took , i really enjoy it ! i ' m currently trying to focus on scalping , having a go at bitcoin ! this is my progress for the past few months . feel free to dig through the twitter if you want to verify those trades , digit  of them i try to post on twitter to avoid appearing fake lol . cause that was the other thing i was going to say . i would say digit  of " classes " out there are useless . the most important things i ' ve learned are probably things i ' ve picked up from the more legitimate books out there and just digging around online , doing my own research . fooled by randomness is another great book , also algorithms to live by . more concerned with algos i ' m also trying to get a discord going that focuses on productive discussion , not just useless news and fluff . if you want a link just lemme know ! i love to help answer questions , i love all ideas , you never know where good ones can come from ! if you asked me where to start , i would say start with a digit ma , see if you can trade off just using that . then find out where and " why " some trades are good and bad , just build up from there

   (ID: 46cb5d4fcb97f49dbe3224c149f50ac2d9f7f509)

7. i don ' t find little mermaid dark , to be honest . at least , the version i grew up with had a nice ending , or bittersweet , at the very least . so yeah , everytime she walked it felt like she was walking on needles , and her sisters traded their hair for a knife that she could use to kill the prince , but the prince she fell in love with and the girl she lost him to were nice to her . they were so nice , especially the other girl , that she willingly let go of her love for the prince and allowed them to get married and live a happy life . she also turned down her sisters ' offer to be a mermaid again when she stepped off the boat to become sea foam , there were these guardian angels  fairies that rescued her and made her an angel . she ' d be allowed to pass on after a set amount of years of being a guardian angel to children . if a child does good deeds  laughs depending on the version  i grew up with the good deeds , years would be deducted . but if a child is naughty  cries , years would be added . i always tried to be good for the little mermaid , when i was a child .
