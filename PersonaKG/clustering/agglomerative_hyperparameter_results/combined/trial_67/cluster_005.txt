1. the problem you have here is that you ' re in the mindset of " a big company will come along a steal my idea " the fact is this . if you ' re idea is so great sell it to me . if it ' s that good i ' ll pre order now !
   (ID: d45001f1fdd37cda488cfddffabec23e83ee7b7e)

2. i ' m on my cell and too lazy to find links . basically he hated star wars , star wars fans , and anything that had to do with star wars . if you google it you ' ll come up with a plethora of examples . iirc he gave a kid an autograph on the condition that he never watch the movies again at one point .
   (ID: 238107f17ccd21a5cb87efbd00d55a861389ba26)

3. i usually have to wait in the human line because either the kids or the husband has already eaten some of whatever we are buying and if we go to self serve i ' ll have to call over the staff member anyway to amend the " incorrect item weight " error .
   (ID: c0cbd0e097375f98ad98ec291f836a39d55e02c1)

4. maybe . maybe . maybe . i can  t art but i sure can write ! so i guess i  ll just describe the dress then ? it would be really poofy but not so much that it doesn  t disguise his body from the neck down . it would be white with gold highlights running along it , with translucent gold shoulder pads with the askr insigniasymbol ? inside them . the veil would be white with touches of purple to match who he  s marryingits bruno . and also a gold bow on the back . i think that  s a detailed enough description incase anybody wants to draw it ! just credit me for the design please !

5. being treated nicely isn ' t what everyones after , some people prefer someone who ' ll challange them . whether it be intellectually or spiritually or whatever . lots of people are also still searching for what they want . someone might think they want excitment rather than someone who ' s more chilled and later find out they were wrong . there is also the possibility they just don ' t want you and thats it . idk its not an exact science . last possibility assuming you haven ' t made a definitive move on her is they think you ' d make a move if you wanted to and have given up on their end . if you think this is it , just try having a chat with them and say your piece . it ' ll happen or it won ' t but its better to have a answer i hope you enjoyed my ted talk
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

6. follow your dreams . dont fall in line because you have to . if you got hurt at work be careful as fighting a workers comp case is absolute hell but if there is proof you were hurt at work they  ll pay you . at digit i had nothing to show as well , at digit im finally kind of getting a grasp on life . its tough and unforgiving so you must be the same way . i know people on vandwellers i believe it is that could help you make the most of life while living out of your van .

7. don  t wait . it sounds like she  s been pretty candid with you but it  s really easy to fall into  she likes me so i  ll just hold on .  it  s not the healthiest route to take . though it might not be your intention  and you may not even really be aware of the effect  you  re putting a lot of pressure on both of you by deciding that this is going to happen someday . it gets uncomfortable for the other person to know that someone is essentially putting life on hold for them  it gets frustrating for you to put your life on hold for something that is not a guaranteed outcome anyway . be her friend with no expectations . live your life , see other people . maybe things will come together for the two of you , but also maybe you  ll end up finding someone else who is unquestionably right for you .
   (ID: 3f4f5511095f668b3c84312b8bfeb87b30dd8f03)

8. i don ' t have an answer for you . but i do know i ' ll never make the mistake of inviting our guy friends over after a meal at a brazilian steakhouse again !
   (ID: c28c39847d1ec88851aadf063f6e8baf4594b35c)

9. you  re wilding out . that is normal , fact is he  s forthcoming and is telling you when he  s hanging out with his girl  friends . you have to look within yourself and ask what is the source of your anger , truly . do you really trust him ? are you jealous of his friends ? etc . most people are just jealous or insecure , nothing wrong with it , but see if he is willing to introduce you to his girl  friends and maybe that  ll put you at ease .
   (ID: b5cc14fd703a97548093b4e06f7e3e92575b80b9)

10. how awesome for you ! congrats on the initial weight loss and your new baby boy . you ' ll get back down in no time . keto is amazing !
   (ID: fe374743dd856c29f2117723cef01c1fdc3b3b5b)

11. if you ever find yourself in " that situation " think of me , and how disappointed i ' ll be in you . you better straiten your self up boy . i ' m counting on you .
   (ID: bd005ac438966eb1f8d6de10fcb1bb6fd4565782)

12. thank you so much for answering my questions ! i have some follow up questions . regarding the shower situation , in the navy , are you allowed to wake up earlier than your peers to shower or does everyone have to shower at the same time ? like , can you wake up earlier , quickly shower and get dressed ? so while most are asleep , i ' ll avoid having many people surrounding me ? open showers aside in boot camp , will i go through any other situations where i ' d be openly nude among my peers ? or is everything regarding medical  etc . you will have privacy ? i don ' t mind being " known " if it ' s one or two other professional doctors  etc . but i ' m worried about that when it comes to other cadets .   x200b  when you say steady supply of t , do you mean at home or physically with me ? thank you again ! i truly appreciate it !
   (ID: 3510b342268f3bc4c3f1e402201d7c565dfb7648)

14. my jnmil ' s sister who is a way bad jnmil , once talked to me for an hour the night before my wedding about eating special k only until i started to see the " worms come out " , so like a special k cleanse . because it starves the worms . worms need meat !   . i will add this to my arsenal because god knows i ' ll have to use it .

   (ID: 4126a6a9d5a548a6bed5e0c4992792b1c10f2b92)

18. see i disagree . defining anything as hate speech is the same slippery slope of censorship . i don ' t think the owner of the company , shareholders , or board  members should be able to violate someone ' s first amendment freedom of speech or self  expression . i may not agree with what you say but i ' ll fight and die for your right to say it .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

19. its from mashiroiro symphony , i don ' t remember the exact quote , i don ' t care , but its something to the effect of  having pets is scary because you know they ' ll die before you , but when they do its important to remember the fun you had while they were alive not the pain of losing them .
