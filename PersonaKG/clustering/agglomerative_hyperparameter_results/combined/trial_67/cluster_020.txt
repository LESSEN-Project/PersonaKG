18. sorcerer was my first choice and i have never looked back . i have tried all digit classes out , but always found myself coming back to my sorcerer . i re  rolled my attributes  skills and race vs leveling a new toon to use stamina instead of magicka after a year of being a magic sorc . i have to say that both magic and stam sorc are very fun and by far my fav class overall . ultimately it will be up to you and your personal preference . your play style will  should dictate what class you play and enjoy . i myself am aggressive and offensive sometimes too much so . i have a mageblade and enjoyed it for a time . sneaking around ganking  picking off the weak ones is fun . i think magic night blade is in a tight spot right now in pvp but things change with every update .
