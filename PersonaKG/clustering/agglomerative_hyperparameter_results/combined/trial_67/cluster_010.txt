1. obviously i don  t know your bf personally , but just buy him some new sandles and tell him that you saw them and thought he would look good in them . i don  t know many guys that would have hurt feelings over their gf not liking their sandles . we live to impress the women in our lives . if my wife said she liked one shirt more than another you can bet your ass i  m gonna wear that one . i think your bf isn  t going to make a big deal out of it . just don  t say  your feet are ugly in those shoes  and you should be good .
   (ID: 59c651a5c06af5a1be40c3866fad09e7ac4c78f2)

2. it . can actually , i ' ve never thought about that .
   (ID: 5173a1d5475490650d7365b2c2b2f2c579d33099)

3. I own a thought.
   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)

4. as he stated it ' s a timeloop but would mean its like ground hog day except its in years i thought thst with time if you left your spot you ended thst line and then creates a new parallel universe
   (ID: da770212ea31887c4be30925213eff0dc5d8687b)

5. i was very careful with power washing my fence . i didn ' t want it to splinter . then i thought about it . who cares if there are a few splinters . wash it and stain it . don ' t walk on it with bare feet . oh wait it ' s a fence .
   (ID: 18e685ff1edd3998857c41d19f982fa88f95cec8)

6. i ' m not sure what you are imagining there . i really don ' t have anything else to say to you intelligent or otherwise . you posted what you thought and i posted what i thought . i have no desire to argue with you , which is why i said " we more than likely don ' t have anything more to talk about " and moved on . i ' m sorry if i deprived you from arguing with me if that was your intention , but i didn ' t start this thread to argue , just wanted to hear what other people ' s experiences were when it came to gays discriminating against gays is all .
   (ID: 0d3d136fd15476f8c62c2f90566b0d8af0c2caca)

7. interesting concept . i always thought fear was the enemy of productivity . but maybe it ' s discomfort .
   (ID: eb338cca8f5e87e4b6e5d369997ab6dbebf241c5)

8. actually i ' m really sad i thought of this . it ' s just awful . who would want to go through that with the cast of any typical movie ? no matter how attractive a given actor is , there ' s always that one scene where they visit their parents or something . i couldn ' t do it . limiting it to just human adults because , just because , the worst character cast to have to fuck would probably be the silence of the lambs .  shudders
   (ID: 80ae19b9093d92fad153af508f37fcd7cd9340ec)

9. it ' s always a thought . like  what would happen ? what would people think ?
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

10. gta v can be pretty easy going if you have no interest in completing objectives . i know a lot of people who just like to goof around in that game since they are not too involved with gaming . i always thought it got old pretty fast but they never seemed to think so .
   (ID: 0c93ab3ec35cab16ded3445fcca7b6045c1dd147)

11. what if hell is a planet ? planets have super extreme conditions , and there are fires that burn hotter than our own . i ' ve always thought it was a planet
   (ID: 8ea8e4a00c3f2a64096e00bdbba0247e580cdb17)

12. yeah , i ' ve thought about this a good bit . the only thing i can figure is that for women ' s bodies , i have neither attraction nor familiarity . for straight people , the people they are unattracted to can hardly be very gross , because that ' s what they themselves are . then the people who are not what they are themselves can hardly be very gross , because that is who they are attracted to . not all gay people are disgusted by the opposite sex ' s anatomy , but we never had them in locker rooms with us , nor do we have any instinctual desire to be physically intimate with them . i almost want to say it ' s similar to that " eewww " that you have  are taught as a little kid when you see any two people kissing . not everyone has that , but a lot do . in my mind , being disgusted by the bodies of the opposite sex then is not necessarily entailed by being gay , it ' s just what kinda ends up happening because nothing ever drives is to get over that childish disgust .
   (ID: 80ae19b9093d92fad153af508f37fcd7cd9340ec)

13. i can agree to that wording . my answer is still the same , it was perceived to be a  pagan practice  and like all other  pagan practices  was labelled an abomination . the very thought of paganism to early jewish societies was met with equal parts rage , equal parts disgust .
   (ID: c637d1bdb57c374d26802ca6ff7ebf3084477147)

14. no i thought this was real life . i don ' t know the difference
   (ID: e807b18e05d35f02282740d90e8c63546558b267)

15. true , i know some people that had troubles with it so i thought might as well see if anyone on here needs it .
   (ID: 4eddf833981a5600b4abc53d564950e97ee755c4)

16. a lot of people complain about this episode because they think it  s specifically geared to appeal mmj fans . truth is , you don  t have to know about it at all to find the episode entertaining . i thought is was pretty damn funny
   (ID: cbba33bde970dd57ea65378793409285d5501f7d)

17. take all the conspiracy theories you ' ve ever heard and logically analyze them for a set motive of money , influence , power , sex , and control . apply the scientific method , and realize that they are all true , except flat  earth , aliens , and that last entertaining thing you watched on youtube when you fell asleep while it was recommending videos . the ones that are true are scarier than the ones that are complete poppycock , and everything you thought you knew of american society , finance , and entertainment , is a lie  what ' s really terrifying is that with all of the control put into place with censorship and obscuring the real scoop we the citizenry are in the darkness of ignorance when it comes to what the farmer does with what he sees as his cattle and loose stock , so to speak . money , power , sex , and control are terrible metrics for how society should be governed , and that ' s why we are at a crucial point in human history if we want harmony in human systems  or an abusive control mechanism that extracts all of what we would consider our lifeforces for money , control , power , sex , and struggle .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

18. ah , okay , i thought you were arguing that you should basically always always take the role even if it would be a terrible fit for you .
   (ID: 390a1aaf064a34c57ef69579a32d85ce7df95253)

19. i thought he was great in ' meet the parents '
   (ID: f4588f2a476206e602fe5b84647a1e777eaae604)

20. yes , for sure . i couldn  t do that either , but it was a thought i had .
