1. yes , and i think it ' s generally an unhealthy identity thing to boot . not enough gamers take a step back and consider if a objective will really help them enjoy the game more . for example , right now i don ' t even begin to bother with the puzzle rooms on lua , because i don ' t want to play myst . i don ' t do plains because i ' m not keen on fishing simulator digit . if the occasion arises where i ' m in a mood to enjoy that sort of thing , i ' ll do it . ivara is another good example . i see complaints from people that spend hooooooours farming for her . my question is . why ? if you don ' t enjoy farming for her , do something else . eventually you ' ll get her , or you ' ll get stuff to sell to outright buy her . don ' t waste your precious time on crap you don ' t like .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

2. I use programming.
   (ID: 76442d997e7f64c10223aeac0f4ff8af70ff9dde)

3. i used to take a couple hits from our gravity bong before going to work but it made for awkward interactions in the mornings . i would space out more often or forget what i was saying mid sentence . i had to stop to avoid drawing suspicion and just to function better .
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

4. success doesn ' t have to translate to money . i always think if you work hard you ' ve earned the right to play hard . if you ' re bored , try focusing on a skill that could earn you money .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

5. being in apprenticeship and doing a job about your studies . so you study , you work for good experiences and you have a wage .
   (ID: 862cb85d93fa9b931c3c64cf2fd17ef592d48c50)

6. I use programming.
   (ID: 95acb2ca6e2c4b0e43ae1565f6eb3f529105e156)

7. i agree with all of that . i take every minute of comp time and vacation time . unfortunately my basic job description is physical presence . i wish i had the ability to take care of business as quick as i could and then be home but it ' s not in the cards for me right now . at least these raffles pass the time .
   (ID: b8a837337ecbafd4a4c170d8fad76bd3de102f09)

8. great work but do you think you could have done it in half the time if you had eaten clean ?
   (ID: 7542c8a6be5a118bef67d9539deb69c131fb4fbc)

9. i  ve seen seasonals work only 3hrs a week so as shitty as it is , you can be scheduled to work very minimal hours if any at all as a seasonal . and yes , gamestop would hire you for just one shift a week .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

10. you  re welcome ! saw the update , congratulations ! what  s the position for if you don  t mind me asking ?
   (ID: f296ca909e75f5e7a28f054f4937f3c6eccb6a56)

11. not necessarily , i  ve noticed that as long as there  s communication the manager is willing to work with you . however , since we have so many people on our team holidays is usually the  you have to work your scheduled shift  type of schedule .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

12. i work for gamestop , so that alone should tell you enough .

14. I use design.
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

15. i work night shifts , so i essentially do this all the time . the only difference is i care enough about my job to actually make the store i work for reasonably clean for customers . but mostly , i sit on my phone or chat with my coworker on obscure topics like religion , the meaning of life or government  controlled child bearing that i couldn ' t talk to anyone on the day shift about .
   (ID: 9d1e879011bb23fa9a0cff4c99a536feb2705b86)

16. maybe try to subtly come off that you really want this job , but not like you just want the money , more like it ' s your dream to work there and that you ' re willing to do almost anything to work there .
   (ID: 661cbd631caa9db4ab702976879371243802e35e)

20. the experience is really with the sittewalker , not rover  it is like uber or lyft for dogs . if you are great , your clients will rave about you . i am very sad my rover dog walker is moving  she always sent " rover cards " with a photo , bathroom update and even a map of their walking route .   x200b  don ' t be like my old dog walker who was in and out the door in digit minutes for a " digit minute walk " many people have cameras and won ' t tell you they do .
