Total from this dataset: 8

1. ask him if there ' s anything he wants you to help him with . i ' m sure his doctors have given him plenty of information . diet and exercise are part of the usual therapy prescribed so maybe you can partner with him on one or both of those . you can ' t force him to do anything and sometimes suggestions aren ' t that welcome but support usually is . if the idea is his .

2. it ' s definitely him . he ' s an alcoholic . looks like he ' s struggling with trying to control it , but he should probably not drink at all anymore . probably a hard thing for you to do , but you should tell him to get help or you ' re going to leave . it ' s only going to get worse if he continues to drink
