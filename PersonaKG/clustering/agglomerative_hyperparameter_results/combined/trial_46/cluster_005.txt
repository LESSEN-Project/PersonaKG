2. i feel like that might have to do with the quality  nachos arent a gourmet food , but i feel like if you were to try making them at home the meat would certainly be better than most anywhere that serves nachos stadiums , arenas if you still enjoy soggy , meatless nachos after accounting for ingredients . then thats cool , healthier too

3. i  m digit  sure that this is nothing more then a well intended attempt to  spice things up  also , i read some reviews on the stuff , there are lots of ladies saying really good things about it . from what i  ve read , it is supposed to intensify sexual experience for the women who use it . hey , think about it . all of the stuff in there was for you and your pleasure . it was stuff that you like , along perhaps with something that he thought that you might enjoy . consider how it is advertised  actually copied and pasted from ads for this product  like a virgin makes it feel like the first time ! works so well , you and your partner will feel like you  ve travelled back in time to your first encounter . like a virgin is an alum  based tightening cream that can tighten the vaginal walls making penetration more pleasurable to a woman and her partner . the tightening of the vaginal walls may increase sensation during penetration ! as married couples , we go through so many things together . we confide things and discuss things that we would never tell anyone else ! i don  t know if you read all of these posts , there are so many . i hope that you see mine and realize that the poor sap fell for a clever marketing scheme ! the product is marketed toward women , with promises of enhancing a woman  s sexual experience . don  t feel sad , he just wanted to get your rocks off .
