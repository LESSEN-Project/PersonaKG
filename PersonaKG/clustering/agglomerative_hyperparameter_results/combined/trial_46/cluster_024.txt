4. sorry if this is true , this is really sad . do you actually know what your mom died from ? your post makes it sound like it was just you and the body the whole time , like no one else ever saw your mom ' s body . we ' re police contacted ? or did you really just wake up , see her dead , and think the best thing was to just throw her in with the luggage ?

6. no you wouldn  t have lost your child through something like this but it can be viewed upon in a negative way . put things i place to make sure it doesn  t happen again but don  t sweat it , we  ve all had close calls .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

7. yeah . sorry about that one thing i did that one time at that place . it was a rough year for me too and . and . i just couldn ' t keep it together any more . you deserve way better than these pricks doing those things .

11. shit . that ' s a terrible thing to happen to you so young . if it helps , you ' re getting internet bro hugs from me . you should know that you ' re an absolute hero for talking her out of it . even if she ended up doing it later , you still gave it your all to save her . most people go through their lives without ever saving someone else ' s . most adults wouldn ' t know how to do what you did . you are a legend .

12. i ' m sorry she is treating you like this . as for the  digit comforter . is that something you can afford .
   (ID: 74cc8b596c27cbe385709690baaf3b68f39b3915)

13. and that ' s why i refuse to have pets . really sorry for your loss . i lost my cat of digit years digit years ago . i grew up with him , he was my brother . it ' s been digit years and i still wake up crying from time to time when he appears in my dreams . a little advice  don ' t turn to alcohol . i spent the next digit months after that blacking out daily and odds are my liver will now kill me before i ' m digit .
