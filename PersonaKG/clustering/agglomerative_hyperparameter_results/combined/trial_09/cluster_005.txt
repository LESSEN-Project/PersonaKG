1. i hate that . " pick yourself up and go . " don ' t you think i freaking would if i could ? people that have never experienced true depression have no clue how bad it sucks . i believe my mother to be the worst offender .
   (ID: 2cfcabf07be1420284c0b650fae1643abc6e2bc4)

2. forgive the ignorance but i don ' t believe i ' ve come across the weekly poetics yet , i mean i know there is a cap but . it sounds like there is a weekly reward quest .
   (ID: df5213e759ef279850d575577da3967d8f71679c)

3. all of you guys are assholes for telling me this is fake . i sooo wanted to believe that you could not only own a kangaroo as a pet . but take it to the fucking store !
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

4. if transmitting the data in real time is too expensive , why not have a redundant system that jettisons a black box when impact is imminent . i don  t think it would that difficult to implement in this day and age . might be easier to find than when it  s possibly under two miles of water .
   (ID: 7e155e58dbfbdb78d094711d4ddb65ae5ef94fba)

5. so you thought a hyoothesis put forward by some of the great physicist like victor stenger and michio kaku who look at it from a scientific point of view , was bullshit , and you think you figured it out by just thinking about it ? this is part of the problem . when people believe shit for no reason . if you want to put an argument for the theory , the literal very least you can do is reasearch what it is . because i actually have read aboit the simulation hypothesis , and it has more to do with the physical pripertues of the universe than anything about the human mind or what we do .
   (ID: 00b878c3a1ec656c05e2872b35fdccfcfda3baac)

6. i see your point , and not to be disrespectful , but atheists don  t believe in god or jesus , right ? and they wake up every morning , drive a car to work and hopefully enjoy it , they find good parking spots and they find a bathroom when they need to pee , do you know what i mean ? they don  t believe yet they get the same treatment , and i know god loves everyone but that  s not the point . i  m not asking god to part the red sea , i  m not even asking him for money ! the most i ever asked him was for my family to get along and stop the arguments , that was years ago and to this day he hasn  t delivered .
   (ID: 0e6a43754a1dcb5e74789d829e04eccdbba7129f)

7. that i no longer believe in god , that jesus was the son of god , and everything i was taught in my mormon childhood . i still live with my parents and my family doesn ' t go to church anymore , but they still believe in all of that stuff . my dad tried going back to church and my mom hasn ' t because she said it was too boring . nothing makes sense to me the older and wiser i get , and i start to question the legitimacy of it all . it ' s my personal beliefs , and i do not want to spread the message that religion is bad . i have no problem with religion whatsoever . people can believe in whatever they want , but religion is not for me and will never again be .
   (ID: 4917a362688355621979e016028f58dbf7f3ac7e)

8. i stand by my assessment . you gave the server money you otherwise wouldn ' t have , and your intent was to convince them to vote for a particular candidate . i understand your position that it was a symbolic gesture , but i don ' t believe you can separate that out from the fact that you did give them money . fortunately , it seems i ' m in the minority on this not unusual for me , so you should have nothing to worry about .
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

9. i ' m not a doctor but i believe opium is in its own category of opiates . i don ' t think it ' s considered a depressant except in higher doses . kind of like alcohol . in addition , opium then is not nearly as refined as say heroin . maybe there were other items being smoked . from personal experience i had back surgery like digit years ago . if i took one opiate painkiller i was pain free , calm and chatty . more would make me tired .
   (ID: 30572ac5982532854b2ead41285ed9bbaba6d654)

10. so many talk about climate change because it ' s cool and do a couple of meaningless actions that make them feel better about themselves . if you truly care then don ' t have kids , that has a real positive impact on climate .
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

11. same . it ' s pretty much the only reason why my mom refuses to believe that i ' m actually trans .
   (ID: 7e58269155b84bc057025d5066e661ba2eb934ba)

12. keeps people not asking questions . if you believe the founding of your country was just , you ' ll do anything to protect that .
   (ID: fbed02b3d7caf00e8d1533f452f8951cf390df73)

13. because we know , for a fact , that pot is not as bad as the commercials want you to believe it is . meth is every bit as bad as they show , they don ' t even have to play things up .
   (ID: 9a13b21f54717da1499379b5cb0e991e82d4c90f)

14. yeah , show people blackadder or a bit of fry and laurie and they can ' t believe it ' s the same guy .
   (ID: 58245e8d537b9e7b6d76cc6a9919ea776e4ef6f0)

15. i believe a year and like digit months or so
   (ID: d9e6e1ecc09dc9affbcc8ccb0191ff241370a782)

16. while i like the grand notion of basically forcing certain breeders to become virtually extinct , this may fare better for the other side . many people don ' t want kids and still can ' t get sterilised because they don ' t have kids . kind of a paradox . a really dumb one . some who end up with kids end up resenting them . i believe if those who truly want this treatment can get it , a large portion of bad parents would be eliminated before the deed is done .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

17. donald trump . can  t tell if he  s incredibly stupid and other people fall for it cause they  re stupid too . or if he  s a master manipulator and just feeding the idiots , gotta believe it  s a little of both
   (ID: d636d8bc8fb2d3a1ea5a2a256cca15dd7f35a058)

18. believe whatever you want , i ' m clearly not going to change your mind . i don ' t think you understand the fact that people can be serious and humorous in one video . you do you . whatever .
   (ID: b6c3e540255084641f0e148a3992d9113c560f0b)

19. i ' m really sorry if this actually did occur , but it ' s just too thathappened for me to believe this . this reminds me too much of the stuff deviantarters with mary  sues post about their characters . maybe it ' s the format . maybe it ' s the fact their dialogue is just so basic this it pretty farfetched
   (ID: 28e24cb71e2c0068fef35890d39022b686e4215d)

20. i agree . if it makes her happy and doesn ' t negatively effect anyone else , let them believe what they want to believe !
