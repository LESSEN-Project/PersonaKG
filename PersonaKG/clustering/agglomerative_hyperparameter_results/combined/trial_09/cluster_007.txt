4. watch precure . it  s super underrated compared to stuff like sailor moon and madoka magica and that saddens me . also the community is really chill compared to ahem others on the internet . sadly there is no official way to watch it on a platform like crunchyroll , as far as i know , but i  ll leave a link to the kissanime page for the current season
   (ID: 6f88a57b804dffb05f07ee78e02223947d9055aa)

9. right , i ' ve been out for the past week and be really really struggling with some self harm . just managed to pick up today and less than a quarter gram later all my triggers just melted away and i ' m able to focus and actually get things done and feel good about myself . any doctor that tells me that my marijuana doesn ' t help me is a biased jerk .
   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

10. its a whole different animal , its probably the easiest part , really . if you ever want to skype about it id love to !

17. damn , this is a really hard question . honestly , my most beloved lipstick is one i don ' t even really wear , mac fleshpot . i hate the way nude lips look on me , but for some reason , even the fact that i have it makes me happy . however , my most worn lipstick is mac heroine . i love it . so , my favorite is up for debate really .
   (ID: 1b90fe7ac45d325859956bedb446558d1a1d6bfd)

18. you really think someone would do that ?               just             go             on             the             internet             and             tell             lies ?
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

19. you can ' t remember because you ' re supposed to be focusing on your life now and growing spiritually . a different life teaches you a different lesson . like you can ' t go into the future if you ' re stuck in the past , if you get my drift . past lives good to learn from so you can see where you ' ve been and what you ' ve learned thus far , but you don ' t need to remember them . it isn ' t vital to your life now . little kids can remember them because they still have some of their memories from the other side , but they gradually lose them over time . that said , it ' s entirely possible to remember your past lives , and pretty easy with the right instruction . it took me a while to figure it out , but if i can do it , someone else definitely can . it might be your first incarnation , but if you ' re curious about a past life , ask yourself these questions  is there a time period that really interests you ? perhaps a specific culture or food ? or maybe a odd passion you ' ve had since childhood that you weren ' t really exposed to ? from what i understand , we don ' t have to reincarnate . we ' re pretty much free to stop at any point .
