13. the best advice i can give to you is to either talk to your friend , let them know how you feel and give them the chance to become aware that their behavior is bothering you , or do nothing and slowly back away from the friendship . i am in a similar boat myself . as friends we should be able to voice our opinions and concerns within our friendships and not worry that the other will become defensive or misinterpret our motivations , but sometimes it just doesn ' t work that way because of bias or prejudice or just plain ol ' human error and that ' s when it ' s time to step back . good luck !

16. speak for yourself , zombie . i don ' t see how what you ' re doing is any better than what this chick is doing . in fact , your vanity in judging and thinking yourself superior is one of thr worst sins out there , if i ' m not mistaken .
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

17. good , just browsing reddit . just got the christmas tree up not too long ago . personally i don  t like putting ornaments on them as i think it makes them look ugly and people think i  m weird because of it . is your christmas tree up yet ? if so , what do you have on it ?

19. eating smaller amounts isn ' t the hardest thing in the world if you eat the right stuff . things you " can ' t live without " you will still miss most likely but will find other wonderful things instead . rip pizza eating right in a controlled environmental is easy , eating right elsewhere is hard . so the restaurant put fries on your plate even though you asked them not to ? not an excuse to eat them . meat is awesome forever . ok i knew that already but it ' s still true .
