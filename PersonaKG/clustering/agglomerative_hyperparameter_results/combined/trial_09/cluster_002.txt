1. not said , really , but vocalized all the same . so i was sitting on the bus on the way home from high school , and over the years , you come to know most of the other kids on the bus , by name at least . so one of my bus  bound acquaintances in the grade ahead of me , let ' s call her claire , at the start of the bus ride starts laughing about something . now as claire was sitting directly behind me and allegedly having just been told one hell of a zinger , the laugh was loud . loud enough that it really hurt my ear . my first instinct was to reel around and produce an equally loud , pitch perfect imitation of said laugh . claire just looked me dead in the eyes and said " wesleyrobertsimpson , i did not appreciate that . " i ' ll never forget that moment , nor forgive myself for it . tl  dr  never genuinely insult somebody else ' s laugh , you ' ll never forgive yourself .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

2. i  m really open to anything , preferably something light  comedic and from stage . i want to do something that is not over done . the only requirement is that the piece is not something overdone , for example i wouldn  t do something from meryl streep just as her pieces are constantly being used by students similarly , i wouldn  t use a monologue from a chorus line . i want something that my professor hasn  t seen before or something rarely done .
   (ID: 589a27cacaffb5126785db9f91c141a3cea2daae)

3. i like mispronouncing benbatch conedersnaps name . see the creativity people have .
   (ID: 6710bef520e10a3963d2983d4b36ef411e442f22)

4. no , they are not flushable . if the box says so , they are lying to try to sell more tampons , though i ' ve ever seen that on a box . tampons are literally designed to plug and soak up liquids , so they do that in the pipes too . " flushable " wipes are not supposed to be flushed either , they do not break down .
   (ID: 32963b268f862205bfe0776470d7730e54b581ec)

5. i  m confused . i  ve seen  better  players than you not get the stick lol . did you actually run anything or was this just a big  fuck you ?
   (ID: 4126a6a9d5a548a6bed5e0c4992792b1c10f2b92)

6. it  s very uncommon to find it in restaurants i don  t think i  ve ever seen any . however , if you come back to france and have a kitchen where you stay , head to the nearest supermarket in the frozen section and you should easily find some !
   (ID: 272bbd1e0746915faf3405ae9c33485b5967ca9f)

7. yes but it  s so rare i  ve been on here since the start and i  ve only seen like two and that was months ago . after some research it  s a very very rare drop from somewhere , hence why i thought it would in the dev room due to its scarcity
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

8. i  m digit so i  ve seen some great usc and some rougher usc so i can agree with you there . however , i can  t say that my falcons allegiance has built more character than it has broken and hope of ever holding a lead in any sport ever .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

9. i ' ve seen it countless times , and every time it ' s " god , that ' s so sad . " it ' s this one in particular that gets me . likely because this happened when i was still young .

10. the only thing i ' ve seen to link to youtube was my faceit account which i did for ecs . i just posted a video on steam so i never looked into it for that achievement .

   (ID: 5481b7a3276de2b79473c4a65d5bb2506e36d79d)

13. i ' ve seen lots of cover  ups , but this video is new to me ! i do intend on getting a sleeve someday when i have the money to do so . some of these people incorporate the scar as part of the art , but i would rather just totally obscure that there ' s even tattoos there . i have keloids on my leg though , which are harder to cover . still thinking about what to do with those

18. so it wasn ' t really a sex scandal , but just the year of the pedos . not digit , but digit teachers at my school were arrested for some kind of sex with children . so the first was just some coach touching up on some girl , and that was the first month or so . this happened twice with different teachers . then the theatre teacher who had been with the school for many years , and someone who i was pretty close to , was having sex with child prostitutes and would handcuff them and pay them extra to be quiet . we found handcuffs in his van once , we were on a road trip , but didn ' t think anything of it . lastly , and this might be the worst , but there was a teacher who not only won teacher of the year , but was having sex parties . okay , so i bet you ' re wondering how he was able to got kids to go to his house . well they weren ' t exactly his students , but members of his church . he would invite young boys from his church over so he could play games with them and get them naked . this is just from the teachers . that ' s even all of the weird shit that ' s been happening at this school . i ' ve seen and heard so much and it still surprises me . i ' m just glad this is my last year here . if you want to hear more that happened just let me know . i ' d love to tell more that happens here .

19. i ' ve always thought that the creators must ' ve had to been geniuses to appease everyone with this show . i can see the tumblrinas on it . hell stephanie is basically a transgender , it uses " them  they " pronouns . you already know garnet is a lesbian . the crystal gems mostly being women are probably pleasing the feminist . i ' m hoping to god that they don ' t treat s . u like minions with awful memes . i ' ve already seen the fat logic , " fat is beautiful " things with rose quartz saying it .
   (ID: a73b0dda35d389b4f74e47db6574e0f71738b683)

20. nothing is more american than family drama . don ' t know if it ' s exclusively american , but this is the best tagline i ' ve seen this year .
