6. yes , i think you should if transitioning is what you want to do . your primary goal should be self preservation , and keeping your dad happy shouldn ' t come before that .
   (ID: 08122a9a2a4681e85c950e276210d33c3d0a8f96)

   (ID: 44477e54e9e15675b9ad5c3be02b0440724c674b)

12. i don ' t speak to her at all and she lives in another state so it was fine . my parents told me she wasn ' t happy about it but i never heard from her at all . i have no regrets about it .
   (ID: be9f60605270d73ac3a4e5b587575b1f65df15f5)

13. i ' m not an expert , but here ' s my armchair take on it . i think the brain really can shut down . zombie mode , if you will  a cycle of bad stuff happens so much to a person that they go into auto  pilot and just sort of exist out their days . i assume that the chemicals do stop working like they should  at least the balance of them isn ' t working . it ' s like why you shouldn ' t try heroin  the initial rush of endorphins knocks your brain chemical levels out of whack , so that you will never be able to experience happiness again afterwards without it . in a similar theme , depression probably lowers your endorphin levels down so far that those moments of sad , sad familiarity with melancholy music and memories is just enough " happy " so that brings you back to them . i don ' t know enough about anti  depressants to say how they work . but i do know that when i ' m in a grouchy or sad mood , i drink my st . john ' s wort tea . it works for me , and i can push forward through that . does it make me happy , or fix the problem ? no . but it stabilizes me , and puts me back at a stable level so that i can work on getting out of my pit . good luck to you , hon . maybe try some st . john ' wort ?
   (ID: 53c827dc263721b97d54bc4c972350c3a1b57856)

14. hon , you need to think about yourself here . i know that can be hard , especially if you ' re a giver by nature , but it ' s true . if you don ' t feel safe , comfortable , and respected in your relationship , you won ' t be truly happy . and that may not seem like the end of the world now , but it will in time . eventually , bitterness and resentment can start to grow and you ' ll find yourself hating the person you once loved . if you don ' t think you can be happy dealing with his bipolar disorder , it ' s ok to move on . it ' s better that both of you find partners you can truly be fulfilled and happy with , even if it means going through some pain first .
   (ID: 87dcb06b0e31b35730fe93ce7dcbef85e6078b40)

15. suffocation . i  d be happy to demonstrate for you ?
   (ID: b5511d022d9aa43868b3f1a7ca2e4368d861570c)

16. no , you felt the price was fair . that ' s literally that matters . the value of an item lies in what someone is willing to buy it for and what someone is willing to sell it for . things don ' t have intrinsic value . could you have paid less for it ? maybe . the cheapskate in me wants you to get the best deal you can . but ultimately got what you wanted for what you felt was fair and you are happy .
   (ID: 5146a89965a734a4d1ec9ec9145abae872a4569d)

17. i post pictures of my cat and people say he  s cute so it makes me and him happy
   (ID: c5e877ff3be5d3571f5fe899f55887a6f608ee98)

18. why do most people always want more ? what is it about some people that they need bigger and better ? maybe it just depends on what makes you feel happy ? people often compare with others but are you really happy if you have a bigger car then the neighbours ? are you happy if you have to work lot of hours and don ' t have much time left to spend on other things ? maybe if the job really makes you happy . for me , i feel happy when i feel the sun , walk in nature , see butterflies or hear birds sing and i am really feeling happy with my husband and our dog . but only you can feel and discover in life what makes you happy . don ' t contain yourself like every other book on the shelf empty pockets will allow a greater sence of wealth  eddie vedder
   (ID: 5aededa7a015b7de42517f31af4906619ef79726)

19. well in that case happy cakeday . let ' s see if you are here for the next one .
   (ID: d6e89a045ccd97a556ff87527d8a08a8e3c89fc1)

20. if it bothers you that much , think about it more like this  your parents are rich , you ' re not . you don ' t have to take their money if it makes you uncomfortable . if you ' re old enough to move out go for it . tell em you want to succeed on your own merits , then try it .
