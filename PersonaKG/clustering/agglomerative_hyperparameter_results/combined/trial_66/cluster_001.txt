Total from this dataset: 4494

1. what is something you  ve done that you would never tell anyone ? anything along the line of that i hate , i see it often enough and usually see the same responses
   (ID: 89a759866debf6704efa0f603c1b9c4476abd731)

2. on your third date , hump him awkwardly at a phish show . it ' s the only way .   x200b  raves are a special thing . i wouldn ' t bring someone around who made me feel awkward a third time . and there ' s nothing wrong with keeping looking for someone who has long term potential or at the very least is more compatible now !
   (ID: eace5bb8fae91afe15af3966cf6b9189772fe2cc)

3. you will be different to me . typically if you still can cry its good , its a way of getting shit out and dealing with it . for me it got really bad when i couldnt anymore , felt like a black hole spawned in my chest . if you think you might have a problem see a psych , digit or digit sessions should give both you and them enough info to work out if you just need to chill a bit or if you need helpnworking through things . remember that it could also be somthing you dont even see now thats impacting you . it was the greatest decision of my life and i highly reccomend it . a good way to start would be to say how you feel , someone reccomended therapy and you thought it might help . they ' ll point the conversation the right way after that .
   (ID: 780d6e7552c6f0b7fa762436db554e83cc133bb8)

4. thanks for telling about binaural noises it did really help for the first time in weeks i was able to sleep peacefully .
   (ID: 825a08e404a7e2db2fd9fc73052f89b0d2f148bb)

5. it ' s not ok , and yet men being violent to women because they do things like ask to be spoken to respectfully or decline to have sexual intercourse with a man is so common that pretty much every woman can tell you about a time it happened to her , it ' s often dismissed with " boys will be boys " or " she was asking for it . violence isn ' t ok , but when women are violent to men , it ' s usually to protect themselves and when men are violent to women it ' s so often because men have been taught that they aren ' t supposed to control themselves . like i said , every time i ' ve seen a girl kick a guy in the nuts , the guy was being a shit . meanwhile , every time i ' ve seen a guy physically assault a girl , it was because the guy was a violent asshole who didn ' t like being told " no " so , until we come to a time when every single man has a story about being kicked in the nuts by a girl for no reason while very few women are every assaulted , it ' s a meaningless equivalency . guys being kicked in the nuts for no good reason simply isn ' t the epidemic that girls getting assault for no good reason is . if you ' re getting kicked in the nuts that often , you should consider that either you ' re behavior is awful or your friends are , and make changes accordingly .
   (ID: 54097549786e78808b0d9772bb36b401b5761588)

6. i mean hey , different people , different opinions . i ' m not taking that away from you . i don ' t wanna force my opinions and ideas down on people that do not show signs of wanting to .
   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)

7. same at the other movies with superheroes , nothing against it , just not my thing
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

8. late to the party , but i always feel i set myself up for failure from easily fixable issues like lack of effort because i don ' t want someone like myself to be successful .
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

9. you don  t know how unbelievably happy i am that someone thought of it like that exactly as i did
   (ID: dea1673e29d00bc1a88d1c231b63981344044a2e)

10. wow , i have literally never done that .
   (ID: 79be9557b3d70396e049eaa975227b5e203bb8db)

11. due to a motorcycle accident , i have a huge scar across my head i was wearing a helmet . i was really self conscious about it and it stopped me from interacting with others . you have to just say fuck it and put yourself out there and let the person you ' re interested in make their decision . don ' t try to cover it up and just let the world see it . there is no way you will be concerned with it digit  of the day every day and pretty soon you will come home and realize you didn ' t even think about it all day . that will be the end of it .
   (ID: 3319add5fded9e9b6e45fcb1340aaf52d39da50e)

12. it ' s not only russians . there are a lot of groups like albanians , servians etc . that are portrayed as villains and that is because it is known that there are mafia groups in those countries .
   (ID: e059f82a0624202d909920e56dd76f76efa711d2)

13. it ' s not like you get to start over if you choose no . you don ' t really have a choice .
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

14. i myself am gay and i agree somewhat . most other people i encounter who are gay always let you know it within first meeting them , and with the men , usually act very flamboyant . i don  t want to be seen as the  gay best friend  so that  s why i  m very quiet about my sexuality . i don  t want that to be the only thing i  m known for , and it  s annoying when i try to get a date and everything about them is stereotypically  gay  . pride parade is something a little different , though . the lgbt community has been judged up for so long . this is their way of breaking free . let pride be , i say . i like it .
   (ID: 6c99329e90a867248b7cd3a376f1a2fd57ae3994)

15. my mother was an only child , she said it was very lonely growing up as an only child and she always wanted a big family . i have digit siblings , after seeing how expensive it is raising a child and all the other drama that goes with having digit kids , i think it is insane ! i personally would like to have two kids . maybe three .
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

16. one of those inflatable bum doughnuts to sit on for the first couple weeks .
   (ID: 392895b8f4f938fb4e2bfae6551b901dccf33ac2)

17. no hate towards bigger people do you just say whatever fits your agenda ? just ignore things you just don ' t want to see ?
   (ID: ba841e2486d1df5b5baefde5ead0636c7c03c79c)

18. i know what the worries are but where i am confused is how i go about all this with her . do i try messaging her ? let her come to me and if she doesn ' t , just move on ? i feel like not saying anything to her after we finally go out would be rude .
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

19. i ' m not always happy but i ' m really trying . i always tell myself " if you can ' t change the situation then change your perspective "
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

20. this this and this . do your best to change it for her . make her feel like it  s not a bad thing and there  s no reason to feel bad . try your best to erase that part of her past . purple  heart
