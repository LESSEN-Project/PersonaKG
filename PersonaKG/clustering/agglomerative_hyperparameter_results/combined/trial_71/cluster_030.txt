7. going inside a home will be fine , i can  t picture japanese people saying no to that . however the sock idea mentioned on another comment is really good and would show your hosts a lot of respect . as of the tatamis . i  m sorry but i think it  s a no go , the crutches would surely pierce holes in them

8. yes , travel would be impossible unless you were rich . why do you think no one would maintain them ?
