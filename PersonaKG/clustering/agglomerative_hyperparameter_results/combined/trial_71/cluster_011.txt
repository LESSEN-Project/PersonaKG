5. yup ! because apparently people kept asking her why her teenage daughter had e cups . omg ! i  m so sorry to hear that my aunts have said the same thing about me . i absolutely hated going to parties and literally avoided all social events that required women to dress in fancy dresses because nothing would fit me and my mum would literally humiliate me at every store . and to make matters worse , my aunties would always say things like  ugh , why does your mum even bother trying to find you dresses that fit ? you  re hopeless . start saving for a reduction
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

   (ID: dc639446b154d74c8655191b5a755643abd00c2d)

   (ID: 6ea82786a74ccdc85dc1fddd809a575aa4e4efcf)

9. i can ' t even imagine . it ' s beyond me how she could be such a supporter of mental health but still turn around and do something like this ?
   (ID: b6c3e540255084641f0e148a3992d9113c560f0b)

   (ID: b6c3e540255084641f0e148a3992d9113c560f0b)

15. she ' s in town for a music festival . she would have to want to see me for whatever reason for me to be able to see her , and i ' m not leaving my house . i ' m going to work , i ' m going home , and that ' s it  i still think of her often and fondly , but i fear i might have made too much of an ass out of myself here , and no one would believe me in my ' pervasive delusions ' that i knew her , and was close friends with her at one point or another in our youth . i purposely don ' t go anywhere near her for fear of being labelled a stalker , or a fixated human being because no one would believe that i knew her and i blew my cover super  hard for about two years . she ' s got a famous boyfriend , they seem close . i ' ve got the wreckage of a marriage and nothing but free time , but i ' m going to just commute to work at some upscale mall , and go home . we used to split our meals because she couldn ' t afford to eat when she was busy trying to make it big , and now that she ' s big  i ' ve seen her around , but i ' m not going out of my way to create any kind of turbulence in either of our lives because it wouldn ' t be right , and i just wanted a friend and companion . i think of her often like a companion because she was who i used to meet at coffee shops and take long walks with on the beach . she was the one who showed me the chirping that the local harbor ' s stone circle makes when one claps in the center of it . she showed me around my own town , and she was who i took on my first serious date . we had wine with dinner , and the waiter never carded us . we used to get each other into all sorts of trouble , and that dynamic wouldn ' t fly well because she ' s very high visibility and i don ' t exist because i never made the effort to stand out anymore than a regular guy in a small town with a penchant for words . i ' m a coward . i spend my time here dreaming of clouds in her coffee , and making love to her like i used to  i will not reach out .

16. title is a bit misleading , a better title would be something like  why dokkeabi  s call doesn  t go to voice mail
