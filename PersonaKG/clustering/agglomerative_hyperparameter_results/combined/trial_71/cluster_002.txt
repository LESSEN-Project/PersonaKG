3. this post is too long , but i know exactly how you feel . i grew up in a similar situation , but i had digit older sisters ranging digit  digit years older than me . first you ' re an idiot for letting your mom drive drunk . you should have at least worried about the potential harm towards others . i think my parents weren ' t nice to me as a kid because they wanted to prepare me for the real world and ive come to appreciate it . life is going to be much harder on you if your a male , so you should be able to handle it . also wanting to be a musician i tought myself how to do everything and knowing that my parents wouldn ' t pay for my school no matter what i majored in , i spent digit years getting an ok paying job first . i know you don ' t want to hear about me though . my advice is digit  psychiatrists are witch doctors , dont waste your time of money . digit  distance yourself as much as you can from your family and live your own life .
   (ID: cbed067932829315de162cb512843a4f6b1083b7)

   (ID: 68698bd86019a86cb34a8b2e28c6324727011b28)

9. i have nothing against people studying what interests them , but i don  t have much sympathy for people with these degrees who complain about how hard it is to find a job in their field or how nobody wants to pay a lot of money for someone with a liberal arts degree .

13. as a teacher i must fuss at you for apologizing for not knowing something that you are trying to learn more about . this is a fun helpmefind , because we ' re all learning something !

15. that ' s why i decided to go into computer science . it ' s basically a sure thing . there are corporations out there who need programmers and the skill shortage isn ' t threatening to go away any time soon , so it ' s a good industry to go into . however , i ' ve always loved telling stories , which is why i love to write . i ' d probably write superhero stories and horror stories . they ' re my favorite genres as well as two things the public never seems to tire of . thanks for responding .
   (ID: 17d6f5fb6fdd1b0ceedb5ec118276bdbb72a462f)

16. but you said you were respectful to the teachers , don ' t you think part of being respectful towards them is doing the homework they assigned you to do ?
   (ID: e6c4a2b8e8c999b54ade342babc3d7b48868cc6d)

17. all you really need to do is answer some questions , and i urge you to meditate and  or think really hard about what you come up with . no expertise required . is there a period of time in history that keeps your attention ? do you really love a certain culture with no idea as to why ? are there any interests you ' ve had since early childhood that you may not have been exposed to ? perhaps a totally irrational dislike for something ? any reoccurring dreams ? sometimes , the obvious is right under our noses lol .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

18. i had a gaint panick attack in the middle of class and everyone was looking at me which made it worse .
   (ID: 825a08e404a7e2db2fd9fc73052f89b0d2f148bb)

19. that ' s life man . its seems scary , but the worst thing you can do is nothing . schools and the like will make you feel like your life will be wasted if you make bad choices , but that is a lie . pick a career that you think you might enjoy and if it sucks do something else . because tons of people in your situation stop their education and end up missing opportunities .
   (ID: 2fd27f1218d4f8b9cf90988522a560a50a304dfc)
