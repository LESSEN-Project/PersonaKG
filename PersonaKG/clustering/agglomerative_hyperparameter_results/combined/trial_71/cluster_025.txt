SAMPLE STATEMENTS FROM EACH DATASET:


--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 6

1. people paid you money for a decision you made . no one forced you to make porn . so you do owe fans at least the content they paid and clicked to see . if this sub helps them find it , then that  s what you owe them . if a real actor quits , they don  t get to take down their movies or shut down fan sites that get in the way of them living a normal life or changing career paths . that said , it  s not a big deal to me . i understand you couldn  t hack it and would rather just give up . we  ve all been there with a job . if you ever make a come back , you  ll want the social media infrastructure in place eg this sub . i  ve seen girls quit and come back once they re  discover how hard it is in the real world to make this kinda cash . also , you should know that shutting down a sub is meaningless . another can pop up . and anyone can still google their way to your naked body . what you need to do is file with social security for a name change even if you didn  t use your real name , but especially if you used your real name .

2. the furry thing is weird , but its no reason to bully someone . if your friend really enjoys making music , they ' ll just get better and eventually that skill will make them more popular . i don ' t think you can fix this by telling anyone , the best thing you can do is be there and stick up for them .

4. the only thing i would do is say  hey what  s your favorite song of theirs  and if they don  t know i would totally encourage them to check the band out . unless it  s nickelback . fuck nickelback

5. this is the hardest thing to deal with in this day and age . this kind of stuff has happened to me and what i did was tell twitch and stuff like that . they don  t listen to creators now . it  s super difficult .

6. you should respect the membership i used to have and let me still use everything , despite no longer having the membership . failing that , you should respect me and come up with ways i can still use everything but for free , and fuck all your other members and your ability to make money  i ' m more important .
