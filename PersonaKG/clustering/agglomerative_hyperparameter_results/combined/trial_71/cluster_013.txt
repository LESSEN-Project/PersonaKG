20. the reason the different categories exist is because some pets they don ' t have the time or interest in making the necessary animations for them to overrides , every pet that they don ' t make the animations for become followers instead . i do wish they ' d stop releasing new pets as followers because they ' re universally ignored if they can ' t be used for overrides , but hey they ' re a lot cheaper to produce and pad out the content so jagex likes them .
