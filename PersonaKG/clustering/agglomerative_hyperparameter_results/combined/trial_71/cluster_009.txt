10. i ' m still kinda young to have one but . i got bored by regular porn so searched weird stuff . i always liked the idea of being dominated cause i was mostly commanded by my parents . most of porn looked rough and just weird . i heard about femdom but that looked too painful . but i always liked to make someone happy and i liked loyalty . but then there was a weird video and i was like " whoa no way " and stopped liking the idea . some time later i found gentle femdom community on reddit and i liked it . the idea of making someones life easier and better and for that getting love and care sounded like what i wanted and it looks like this is my kink . i guess that ' s the story .
