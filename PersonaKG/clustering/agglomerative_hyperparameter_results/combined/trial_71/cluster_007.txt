1. they aren  t all bffs . not sure why you got that impression , but it isn  t accurate . characters from different houses don  t know each other unless you recruit them and even characters in the same house sometimes don  t like each other . most of the fighting occurs between your chosen house and brigands  thieves  plot relevant bad guys , not other houses . you do fight the other houses , but going into more detail would be a spoiler , so i won  t . however , i will say that it doesn  t feel like a cliche high school anime . the most cliche part about the game is the mary sue protagonist imo , but i  ve seen differing opinions . it  s a good game .
   (ID: c418fa452eafbca022ce1c49b521d4574aa77cd1)

2. i absolutely agree with all your points . especially about letting the kids wander away . but i love the show for the zombies . need more zombies ! on the flip side , i do believe that the characters really are a pathetic group that don ' t think rationally . i suppose after their world is turned upside down with so much death and destruction , they don ' t think , plan , and " survive " as well as we do in the comfort of our living room chairs . but the drawback to that as a drama series is that i lose sympathy for them , and start not caring what happens to them . in fact , i start waiting for them to get picked off by the zombies and start cheering for the undead . one thing i noticed was there were a lot more dead people this time , and they were quite rotted away  dried husks . i understand people rotting  bloating , but would they be so dried out ? atlanta is not exactly a dry desert environment . has the zombie invasion been going on for that long ? as for the radiator hose , i had an old chevy vega that broke a hose on a cross country trip . i fixed it with hose tape but it would only last digit miles before it broke again . so yeah , once your hose is shot , it ' ll keep disintegrating until you can replace it . but what bothers me , there are so many abandoned vehicles on the road , couldn ' t they switch to something better than an rv ?
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

3. why didnt you just gave a fuck about your parents worries and bought that damn miner .   x200b  and also , you are still single , we are working on that project a bit longer then expected .   x200b
   (ID: 9425493e0ea7469367495f8e5947330e536cafa9)

4. aha ahh . stupid women . no good sir it is not inappropriate at all to say that we had a child because , " we " your partner and yourself did have a child .
   (ID: 8e425f2be5b1012969ff4827fa2372423ba47972)

5. make the most of the time you have with them . cherish the little moments . my dad plays harmonica and is really good . i always thought it was weird but the older i get the more i appreciate it . it  s not my cup of tea but i know one day i  ll miss hearing it . life is short and you only get one chance at it so make the most of every day .
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

6. i went through three different relationships in middle school , all of which i really didn  t even try or want to initiate . i have no idea how my dumbass digit  digit year old self was even attractive to them , because i did the cringiest shit and didn  t even care . my sex drive didn  t really kick in until digit , so i really had no interest in these people at all . i literally just dated them to get them to stop annoying me . i guess confidence and apathy work on preteen girls , i guess ? fast forward to me now , the contributor of digit  of pornhub  s ad revenue . oh , how i wish i could go back .
   (ID: ba19f1817c5dfde741b0e3387f4c8902b125e2c5)

7. itt everyone has parents that yell at them for trivial things , proving that we ' re all in a matrix and a part of the hive mind
   (ID: 7d84a169d4ddae2aee36640f218ff2b5b534792d)

8. don ' t do what your parents tell you , but do what you think is best for you
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

9. how old is your dad ? also , do you have a boyfriend ? rolling  on  the  floor  laughing
   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

10. i ' m not sure how much it has to do with the time and how much it has to do with who your parents are . kids around me were doing plenty , i just had an overly controlling parental situation .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

11. it ' s no longer what you are but what you identify as . can that apply to everything ? can i identify to the ceo of the company when i get in the office tomorrow ?
   (ID: 750329d9f0f06f064c23bff94a5536b6068811e8)

12. this is a truly horrible situation as a single dad i can ' t imagine what i would do if i lost one of mine . my heart goes out to you .
   (ID: 1afb7597077681179430af152997f04fd73ba0ee)

13. when you have a child , the child would not get a say in being born or not . he  she will have to face the world and all its problems purely because of your decision . when you make the decision not to have a child , that ' s the end of it .
   (ID: 8f22657eff8a2d9aeade346926843c63f2a21e0a)

14. what if you marry someone else later on . would this change ?
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

15. baby on life support , doctors ask us , " what do you want to do "
   (ID: de5db66359e6314e9bac24fd9a10ec1d49584c4f)

16. some people are raised in a fashion that they never developed the want to have kids . instead they see it as any other decision in life and look upon its downsides . usually they end up turning away from it
   (ID: 38a7a6f66912b8e8858311b8973e2751454e04a9)

17. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

18. since you ' re asking this ill assume your digit or younger . sleeping with her friends might work , but it ' s a stupid idea i learned the hard way . if you ' re in the friendzone doing anything else will be a waste of time .
   (ID: cbed067932829315de162cb512843a4f6b1083b7)

19. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

20. having children weather making new ones or adopting used ones makes no difference in the grand scheme of things . none . i ' m order to say fatuous have to know ahead of time what each child will accomplish with their life and weather or not they will be a contributing member of society or not and since there ' s no possible way to know than trying to fix it with no knowledge of the child ' s potential is pointless .
