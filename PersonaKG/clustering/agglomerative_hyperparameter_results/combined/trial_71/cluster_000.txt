1. that would be me ! the first one i ever read was ' it ' in middle school . couldn ' t sleep without the covers over my head for weeks , was afraid of all drains in my house but read everything i could of his after that . just finished rereading ' the dark tower ' series again . love his books ! edit  did anyone ever read anything by his pseudonym , richard bachman ? ' the regulators ' scared me and disturbed me more than any of his other work i ' ve read . i actually didn ' t keep the book and i keep almost every book i ' ve read .
   (ID: 45bf5c8227b94451beff1dce1059d0d2c683c40c)

2. no shit you look like a girl it  s cus you are one
   (ID: 8cdbf7ed2ace2eeed8bd2b0e2e86001342f83a1f)

3. how does this even happen ? unless it ' s a medical thing , you ' d think at some point they would be like " yeah . i ' ve got to do something "
   (ID: ae0b5b35ef79984eec810d26abc05e9a757ae0ca)

4. i think you should correct your behaviour . if your first thought when something happens is " im completely faultless " and then after everyone else says you ' re the asshole you still seem to think you ' re in the right . yta taking out your anger on others and racist comments are never valid . dont kid yourself
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

5. god i loved that scene , oddly one of my favourites in the mcu . the camerawork was incredible you just felt so grounded in the moment
   (ID: 5fa74a7d6a70c6f2f8a149864f494ac72eefd3e4)

6. I am owner of this subreddit bergbaycolony.
   (ID: ac53f9ce173965984299f3686335a39bc2a5810f)

7. suppose someone breaks into your house , the average time for police to arrive on scene is around digit minutes . in the uk it ' s about 40min , and they don ' t have guns to protect themselves or you . that being said , a lot can happen in digit minutes read article below as an example . there are over digit , digit , digit people in the us . we are the 3rd most populous country besides india and china . there is much more of a chance that there will be more crazy people in our country due to the population . if you look at history , the holocaust and ww2 was basically started when the nazi regime had citizens handed in their firearms . you make this sound very simple , but it ' s not . you ' re just saying theoretical things that would work if done absolutely perfectly . it would take billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands man hours . just simple imposing heavier restrictions is bs , and i ' m a liberal . private business is highly monitored by the government and local police to make sure that they aren ' t selling to local gangs or people with mental illness . to stop mass shootings it would mean that we need a perfect society with not one person with mental illness . humans will never be perfect , therefore it is impossible to have a perfect system .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

8. well , i ' m approximately the same weight , and it took me about digit hours to come down completely .
   (ID: dfcca9c384a4fff7bbeb3cd1fb2f40aacb47fd7e)

9. little house on the prarie , andy griffith show , the waltons . just regular good ol lessons about life . how that you have to struggle and suffer through things sometimes and not have anyone to ' save ' you . and you learn to be a better person because of it .
   (ID: 613ad5d5b0144c86404a7d899ddbcd89ab6c82fb)

10. yea i don ' t like it either but it just makes sense early on .
   (ID: 480f3d8feb42f76cdfa6ea3a1dfffaf98bf91060)

11. blowing up cargo isn  t griefing i disagree . in my opinion griefing is defined by the community of a game . most people agree that destroying cargo is griefing , that is the majority in the community , so by that logic destroying cargo is griefing . now ofc you don ' t have to agree with my statement considering i do not agree with yours too . now if destroying cargo is something that you can do , then it becomes a simple question of morality . you are able to " sacrifice " someone else ' s happiness and effort for momentary relief , sure go for it . don ' t get me wrong i don ' t judge you for being a bad human being , but not everyone is seeing it like me . would you say you agree with my statements ?
   (ID: d650356549ff32c6bfb797b13c80b5a0d715da36)

12. it  s been like that for awhile , the god given rights for guns and there wasn  t a lot of gun crime until like the 1980s
   (ID: d8cee140a4390453e428cb54c1081da2859d7998)

13. yeah i would have apologised too . i guarantee he felt more embarrassed than you . strangely enough i would have had a moral dilemma of even mentioning that the drink was forgotten .
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

14. thank you for your answer . that ' s interesting how yours kinda sticks with being with other people . i scared a new acquaintence of a friend , i went from a feminine state to a strong masculine state during a conversation and my body language changed . as it ' s going to . normally my gender " feeling " isn ' t so far down the spectrum on either side but it was that day for some reason . she thought i had been " possessed by a male spirit " and i was like " yeah . my male side . it ' s still me . happens " but honestly i wasn ' t sure if it happened to others thru the day too or if most people just wake up with what they feel that day . so i appreciate that yours can also change . i feel better .
   (ID: 7fdfc2063b89c8be6521566a61aeb5bf9497d47e)

15. i was gonna be that arsehole , but you beat me to it . i love your tattoo , op , but every time i see a heartbeat tat on here i wonder why people don ' t get an actual ecg tracing done  not doing so will forever have medics driving you nuts by pointing out your dodgy rhythm
   (ID: bb79791c3753a1fc8ece696b3835b0f59ddccc90)

16. i only specified how i prefer an anarchistic perspective to that of one based on a government . i don ' t believe you understand that anarchy doesn ' t mean a chaotic setting based on some hunter gatherer scene you have set . i stated myself an individualist anarchist which because i am sure you do not know is as followed as per reference of wikipeadia  individualist anarchism in a nutshell the concentration on the individual and his  her will in preference to any construction such as morality , ideology , social custom , religion , metaphysics , ideas or the will of others . the rejection of or reservations about the idea of revolution , seeing it as a time of mass uprising which could bring about new hierarchies . instead they favor more evolutionary methods of bringing about anarchy through alternative experiences and experiments and education which could be brought about today . this is also because it is not seen as desirable for individuals to wait for revolution to start experiencing alternative experiences outside what is offered in the current social system . the view that relationships with other persons or things can be in one ' s own interest only and can be as transitory and without compromises as desired since in individualist anarchism sacrifice is usually rejected . in this way , max stirner a german philosopher  often seen as one of the forerunners of nihilism , existentialism , postmodernism , and anarchism recommended associations of egoists . individual experience and exploration therefore is emphasized . the egoist form of individualist anarchism , derived from the philosophy of max stirner , supports the individual doing exactly what he pleases  taking no notice of god , state , or moral rules . to stirner , rights were spooks in the mind , and he held that society does not exist but " the individuals are its reality "  he supported property by force of might rather than moral right . stirner advocated self  assertion and foresaw " associations of egoists " drawn together by respect for each other ' s ruthlessness .

17. ask if people are subed to pewds on askreddit make memes that are related to pewds and something else and place it on the meme page of that some thing else and last but not least send everyone subscribe to pewdiepie via whatsapp
   (ID: 4ae54d4dcad6354406284af9bc07ffc708ce92a2)

18. not exactly , trumpsuki heh represents in the game ' s second act , she just becomes a jerk . trump is also a jerk . i dont know what made me think of that .
   (ID: 420a86ecfb9d645349db591746d0cdeba4b68f37)

19. one of my favorites . have you heard the anthology version ?
   (ID: f1de014324cb88a1b3dcf89a60ca1d8f5e29db03)

20. perhaps you should learn what money is and what , by asking for more free shit , you ' re asking from those americans that pay taxes .
