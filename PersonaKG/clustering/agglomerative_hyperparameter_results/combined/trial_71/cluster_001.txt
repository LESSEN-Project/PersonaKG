   (ID: 9b58219d8f43f5aa6e34770c7b9c7896c88c8fe7)

   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

9. the thing i ' d love to see that hasn ' t really been done right is a business manager game . i ' d prefer a restaurant sim , but instead of making it simple and have dexterity type controls , i want it to be a normal " manage " style gameplay , but you ' re dealing with buying food orders , hiring employees , creating a menu out of your food items , pricing your dishes , marketing  advertising , etc .

10. the first digit harry potter games for pc were good , but after that everything went to shame . can you imagine nintendo making a game about the triwizard tournament ?
   (ID: c378ee827fb7d26c7ea685ec1dc451bf264b0151)

11. look up ygopro  devpro online and download it . it is a virtual version of the game , and i believe the percy client has an ai mode that you can test decks against . then i would lurk around the sub a little to see what people are playing , pick something that piques your interest , and start from there . warning  cardboard crack is an expensive and addicting habit , and devpro has cost me a fair bit of sleep after discovering it

12. how about that nintendo direct ? anyways , after spending a good digit minutes or so trying to get that text some of you guys have on your flairs , time for some muscled men beating each other up while turning blonde , robot girls who may or may not be legal , and more . it ' s time for toonami , let ' s do this !
   (ID: a63ea1e6bf1e972229635648a0b3371aeddb4f3d)

14. i don ' t see a superman game being challenging enough considering how over powered he is . i would go with beyond game .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

15. thanks guys i guess i am doing the dlc . i have a feeling i will regret it if i don ' t . guess my hunting has not come to an end just yet . there are more beast that must be put down .
   (ID: d5ff87b3b0a008d93a655ee4d43e9da3b5db7984)
