1. what kind of a salary are you looking at ? the interviewer wants to know how well you can assess yourself , and whether you ' re going to a legitimate asset to the company or a drain .

3. i dont think anyone goes into the field of social work with salary maximization in mind . as a business major i recall others mocking the social work majors at graduation . " oh what a bright future they have " , they mockingly said . it was funny at the time but i ' ve come to learn those in the field are truly helpers inherently . some are even empaths . dont think so negatively . if one therapist turned you off try another . god knows the field is packed . good luck .

7. it depends with how much experience you have or what company you  re working for and location . if you were to go through the union , starting out as a  helper  you  ll be making  digit an hour and every year you  ll get a dollar raise until your digit  5th year . after that you  ll be considered a journeyman and be making anywhere from  digit   digit , then i believe after your 8th year you  re eligible to take a test to be a master electrician and be making  digit  digit an hour . like i said it depends on the company and location . i know a master electrician that makes digit  180k a year . it  s a really good trade to do . you can start your own company , do side jobs for extra money on the weekends , but not really suppose to do that when you work for the union , and if you plan on building your own house , it  ll save you quite a bit of money being able to do the electrical stuff yourself .
