11. have you ever been to a party ? it ' s common to film someone in those .
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

12. never happened in train but once in local bus . i had no idea what i was thinking . i live in india so the bus was loaded with bunch of people . so when i gotta get out for next stop , i have to squirrel threw the crowd , that takes 2mins . so calculation got wrong . bus waited for another min so i can get the hell out of the bus on the stopped seemed very funny to all guys in bus .
   (ID: 2fa786bde9d7f9b2d3a93476f3298d77041fdb1e)

13. is it really ? because everyone i know who  s seen me do it looks at me like i  m an alien .
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

14. i would think that you don  t do it to a random person . maybe some you know .
   (ID: f031a6829326f9097d63f90ad77c7cac6d8319bb)

15. i think that there is a trade off being a public persona and private persona off of camera . one ' s disguise has to be really good or the pressure to be constantly ' on ' can get to even the most seasoned celebrities . i think it would suck to be constantly hounded by people  but if done right then people would think you were cool no matter what for no reason . really it ' s a double  edged sword with trust and complicated social dynamics based  out of trust and exposure .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

16. so i ' m not the only one this has happened to ?

17. so when you see a pop star with ear plugs in would that literally be a live feed so they can head their own voice as they are singing ?
   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

18. i assume they masturbate if they feel the urge . if you are an a list celebrity , you can ' t just hook up whenever you want because people will know who you are eventually .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

19. i ' m black . i use it on white folk when they ' re angry . i hard r them before they can do it to me . freaks them out .
   (ID: 6735159236fd8a4634f1974d6eba7f027dbd1aa7)

20. its not common but i have seen a few myself , and unfortunately as far as i  m aware it  s unusable
