1. you ' re a pretty cool dad . sounds like your kids had a good time , which is the most important part . thanks for the spider  man review .
   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

2. i know it ' s not a camera , but if your friend uses any kind of slr already then you could get him a lens which may be more usable in the long term ?
   (ID: e2865528dd17e86320ca523d3db462efa29e7ca7)

3. something that relates to a talent or a goal of theirs , especially if it ' s a little bit beyond them . for example , if they like drawing , get them some really nice pens or paper , so they feel both validated in their craft but also inspired to do more .
   (ID: df28c2a39b633ca418192316a199668289382292)

4. its maybe cheap but my buddies once got me a leaf  shaped ashtray and i absolutely loved it . maybe something like that as part of the gift would be nice ?
   (ID: 932561c7cc5f0c280d4b6b0c7824dbd5aed5f350)

5. you can get the back embroidered to say " proud dad " or " best father " or something like that to avoid anyone getting butthurt on him having it . the nex can do it or a shop in town . if you know any prs they may be okay with doing the embroidery for you .
   (ID: 7632dd7ebcb664bfada5fff420a436f42e3721d5)

6. you can tell him that you appreciate that he wants to get you somehing he thinks is nicer but you like the one you already have . maybe say you ' d rather that extra money goes to something else you ' ve both wanted to fix or change instead .
   (ID: 7632dd7ebcb664bfada5fff420a436f42e3721d5)

7. yeah , this one came from craigslist and i could barely contain my excitement , the spec is really good for the price ! it  s certainly fun to be a nerd
   (ID: 7bd4f8e2f55f684df651b44f2faa8769031fc782)

8. hearing condition , that ' s like a superpower . what comes to mind  a rare comic book from one of those series that costs extra where it ' s like off ebay . idk hard to say what he ' d like from this post since you list a lot of interests but then say you ' ve gotten that category of stuff before . looks like you haven ' t said dvds tho , so maybe like some sort of expensive star wars pack
   (ID: b30983a02e6c6ad80a50a521eee441b9f454a5e9)

9. why are you putting on make up and dressing up nice ? what ' s his name ?

   (ID: dc1fd340b3e0a603d715d06c129c512b8197c37b)

11. did you ask to come straight home ? i still say it sounds like he ' s a compulsive shopper . have you looked into shopoholics ? does he listen to you in regards to other things , or is it just shopping related ? like , does he know your favorite food , book , movie , etc ?
   (ID: 87dcb06b0e31b35730fe93ce7dcbef85e6078b40)

12. yta . he wants to do something special with you and you made fun of it . appearntely he ' s been thinking about for a while . i wouldn ' t like it if my so joked about me trying to do something nice and special with them .
   (ID: 2e369dc21156ed2b443bc09084e27c8acb516093)

13. a compliment . it ' s been said before in this subreddit i believe  you could give someone you don ' t usually to a compliment and they are likely to remember it for years to come .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

14. you ' re not an asshole but he totally is . he looks like a spoiled child . he should understand your situation and help you rather than asking you a ton of gifts . does he have a job ?
   (ID: 862cb85d93fa9b931c3c64cf2fd17ef592d48c50)

15. " the hell does this guy want ? " . and i ' m apprehensive .
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

16. that ' s a pretty cool present . the best part of buying a gift for yourself , is that you always know , what the rerecipient would like .
   (ID: 93aef5ab9bcfb13e4085ecbd6b6948845a9ec03b)

17. what exactly does he want here ?
   (ID: 5b8ed03bdff11aec4ed3a2ed4e122a505bf937dd)

18. not at all . you ought to establish that , however , just in case he has taken it as ' this is a romantic date . '
   (ID: 5d032deb25ff976c97c846d4d1073b0e71b447a3)

19. an old , heavily done up woman in her 80s told us that  if your man ever gets in a fight with you , don  t accept flowers . don  t accept clothes . get jewelry . cuz you can pawn it after you leave his ass .
   (ID: 45768598053a5b3cdf1e6e286b99114b7acf5f3c)

20. i see things a bit differently . no doubt your dad would appreciate a higher end and therefore more expensive turntable , but as an unexpected gift from his child , either of your options are priceless . go to the top of your budget and if your dad particularly likes audio technica , go with the best you can afford . i don  t know what other equipment you already have , but make sure that you have a pre  amp or integrated amp with a  phono  input or else keep enough money on one side for a suitable phono stage . good luck .
