1. i  ve got digit and i already can  t wait ! best of luck with wedding planning  your vendor search !
   (ID: 2ab410cb3dc233b072c65fa9acc3c6323d05914e)

2. i ' m digit  would love to cosplay . i ' ve seen some online images of costumes people have made  it looks so amazing  fun . something like elizabeth from bioshock infinite or elsa from frozen . but i ' m probably too old to start  would probably be called mutton dressed as lamb if i dressed as these younger women . i have no idea if cosplay existed when i was in my 20s in the early ' 90s when the internet was a noisy slow dial  up affair , but if it did i wish i had known about it . it looks so fun . especially steampunk . i ' d love to go steampunk . but at my age i ' d probably look ridiculous .

3. that sounds awesome ! i think we ' ve decided to do a regular ceremony  reception and just cap the guests at digit . my mom was trying to throw names of more family members and it was stressing me out so much , so we sat down and made a list of people who had to be there . making the list really made me more calm about the whole thing once i started imagining it in my head . good call on not diying too much ! i actually just watched a video about why you shouldn ' t diy more than digit  digit of your wedding and it really changed my mind ! originally i was planning on doing so much which was also contributing to the stress .

4. i think digit middle names is fine  i draw the line at digit . i think your partner ' s concerns about hurting feelings would be a bigger reason to reconsider . personally , namesakes are not my thing , but i get that they hold a lot of significance for other people . i would be cautious about using a living relative as a namesake if other people could get offended .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

5. seems like a wholesome , genuine bio and its good ! to maybe spur more interest , i would add what your favorite burger spot is as well as where you enjoy getting pizza from . someone may relate or have that in common with you and will give you a reason to ask her on a date , like if she enjoys , " digit guys " then maybe you could both grab a bite over some convo !
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

6. yes i thought of doing the survey in both ways it would be cool but first i ' ll see if there ' s enough people answering to this one or if nobody cares about it and then i ' ll probably do the one about the perfect guy !
   (ID: a74790331386859adbbd886bd045a7391e95948c)

7. i got blonde hair , green eyes and the short gene . thanks , guys .
   (ID: d51e2f0207b67be3748f59fc0b78f82cd1e47a1c)

8. can you specify what  s weird ? lol . everyone is dressing up and i  m just like idk what to wear
   (ID: 7c0a90108389e898ab80f1c7af44e170b85c6d76)

9. if you can come up with a name you both like , it would be nice if you changed it together so you have that connection even though , like you say , a name doesn ' t equal family , but it ' s a nice thing to have in common . if you ' re serious about changing your first name too , have a look at lists there are plenty online or ask around i ' m sure people here would be happy to give you suggestions . pretty soon you ' ll work out which styles and sounds you like and dislike . i ' d also recommend having a look at the top 100ish names for the year you were born and maybe a few other years from around that time as a starting point , that way you ' ll know if you want something in  keeping with your generation or something a bit more unusual .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

10. mid digit ' s single female . probably white . you are thin , probably a professional who doesn ' t have a lot of time to cook . or you go out on lots of dates and eat dinner that way . you eat organic and non  gmo but can have diary , so your not vegetarian or vegan . you just like to watch what you eat . i have no idea region , so i ' m just gonna say texas bc the beer .
