6. i work in a hotel currently , and deal with very similar people . the digit things that annoy me are the lack of  patience , understanding , and common sense . some think that everything has to be to their liking immediately or else it infringes on their lives on a personal level and they make it your problem . if something is wrong they don ' t ever think of the fact that nothing is perfect . and when you tell people something , most of the time they ask you the exact same question multiple times because they don ' t listen . it just gets annoying when it happens so commonly .

16. kim kardashian . i dont think she has said or done anything to hate her . i think that her family have a succesfull business and know how to manage it and i never saw them make a scandal appart from kim ' s sextape . the only annoying thing is how much attention they get but thats thanks to media and people bitching for why are they famous every single day .
   (ID: 28b40f8090abf393e7d7a7cf1772fb2c16d434a1)

17. yeah , my biggest is not the spoiling . i spoil my daughter a lot too , but i also make sure she is aware of the fact that what you have doesn ' t make you who you are , it ' s in your heart and how you treat people . my biggest pet peeve is the parents that are like , no honey don ' t scream , ssshhh , it ' s ok , and there is their cld having a stage digit temper tantrum in the store  zoo  park wherever and they are just so passive . drives me crazy .
