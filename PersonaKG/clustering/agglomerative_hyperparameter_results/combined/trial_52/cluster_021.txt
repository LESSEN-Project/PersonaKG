19. thank you for sharing . i ' m glad your friend is doing better . we do have a dog and we both love him very much . an emotional support dog is still actually really good idea , though , and it ' s something we will be considering once we have the space for another dog . if you don ' t mind my asking , how long was it before your friend decided enough was enough and sought  accepted help ? i ' m curious because i feel like maybe it ' s wrong of me to think more progress should ' ve been made by now ? i don ' t know .
