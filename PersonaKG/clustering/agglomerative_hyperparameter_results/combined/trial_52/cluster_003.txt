1. the correct name for this deck is psycho swap ! i played something similar along time ago , but your variation looks much more viable . with all the targets in the line up , maybe you could throw in ! one for one ?
   (ID: 46f455b780faca36116964131a4d0622c465bf7f)

2. it  s true that it is kinda a waste of time anyway , the problem is that instead of having fun wasting my time i just get depressed
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

3. really ? i wouldn ' t expect anyone to want to play on it , but sure ! if they ask where you got it , just redirect them to my profile . also , tell me how it went afterward !
   (ID: 3e1762624e55cdfb0929da3e1a1c438675e0c217)

4. also i have read a bit about whspace and tbh it confuses me , but i ' m willing to give n e thing a try , and what ' s better than going right in at the deep end ? hi  sec boredom ? not for me .
   (ID: a911ed792d3b26b115aedaee6218a4a944c38521)

5. the buildings were super simplified in warhammer , never mind the family trees and the governors and all that crap , the battles were simplified in warhammer , not saying that is necessarily a bad thing , i would say warhammer has the most enjoyable battles in any total war game i ' ve played , never mind that your king can ' t die , i ' m sure there is a lot more but i am gonna eat pasta and go to work
   (ID: b5faabfabaf04e645cf54c0d84e18989944a6d4c)

6. you know you don  t have to follow a guide right ? one thing about majority of the players playing this game is that they don  t bother to adapt , they just mindlessly play and when something kills them , they think it  s bullshit or the build is trash .
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

7. id rather be surprised ! thanks though . but out of the digit ffxiii  s what do you consider the best for you in terms of gameplay ?
   (ID: fd112b0116b574aa5911af63529dca9683e5f6eb)

8. she doesn  t really rely on being awakened . and she is very good for attack or for any sort of quests , as she gets stronger with the more souls she gets . imo there  s not many champions better at dealing raw damage than morningstar at digit souls
   (ID: 11e562551d8ce916c649db9948355e07c68fed96)

9. nah the only challenging monster is behemoth and it ' s only because of the weird mechanics . great game don ' t get me wrong on of my top picks of the year , but compared to mhgu that came out on the switch it just doesn ' t hold a candle to the amount of content .
   (ID: e82ed26542949c55066d4b6510733c7a5f847704)

10. they probably want to kill off a lot of br players so when stw becomes free , we won  t see an overload in the stw servers
   (ID: e7e9152339efadec69dc4bf98db0e9f2aeae3cf6)

11. if you think the combat is bad try witcher digit after playing it , it  s all over the place ! it  s worth it though for the story
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

12. how do i do the bronze pack method ? what players am i looking out for ? what do i sell and not sell ?
   (ID: 48e565f53f18e7fed27267c945fb81bb868c90f3)

13. awaken online  catharsis . it is the only book i will give digit  digit if you like ready player one this book blows it out of the water . the charecters are better , the story is better just everything is better . the other books in the series are super good to but the first one is just . wow !
   (ID: 9e778023eda5589ac577e3789edfd900d208edf7)

14. judging from that much downvote and how you said sf5 is better than tekken digit automatically made your opinion invalid and as such i recommend you not to shame yourself anymore .
   (ID: cd4ad4cc67fcfb39fcb1f11e52709d863f1c0215)

15. what ' s the game ?
   (ID: 04b12cbc989702ae4909382de2ac53409fddbbf4)

16. interesting take . don ' t have cls . running the squad with thrawn currently . i ' m assuming the removal of thrawn and r2 and the addition of hy and ezra will benefit the overall synergy . you don ' t really need too many damage dealers as dn removes two per battle anyways . it ' s digit v digit basically and gk never dies when i play ai .
   (ID: 480f3d8feb42f76cdfa6ea3a1dfffaf98bf91060)

17. its hilarous that this guy got downvoted for pointing out the truth . but , when you ' re drinking the bungie kool  aid . i guess you don ' t want to hear that .
   (ID: 804f1bee8d4950d83d7626539cb86d46b2848fd3)

18. depends how urgently you need an extra merge for scoring purposes . if this gets you over some arena tier threshold or makes it a lot easier , i ' d say merge . but as you said ,  digit merge doesn ' t do much in itself so i ' d say fodder her if you really want to do that build .
   (ID: 89e5ffcdc3b9c2cbc19f7274b7643ce26a8e2bbd)

19. ya that ' s basically what i got as well .
   (ID: c1c3bee034ba3e70e4bd22d7987533e43f2b424b)

20. i just got the first digit in 4k for  digit each , with all the bonus crap . everyone loves to shit on the third one but charles dance and charles s . dutton are really good in everything .
