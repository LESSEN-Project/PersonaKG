1. it was shockingly easy . like , they matched us and we were like  that  s it ?  it  s been wonderful , though . we love our au pair and she loves our kids , and it  s been so cool getting to learn about her culture and show her ours . the only cons would be that they can  t care for really young babies by themselves at all so you can  t even run to the grocery store and leave them with your new baby , and the hours they work are really limited which is good and necessary but is annoying to calculate
   (ID: 439e78cca3643ee51185b36cedaa4c3e72551ef5)

2. how difficult is it to install ?
   (ID: 718ff22055f41bd70e24ec98f0898a1526112965)

3. how about make sure what you ' re about to purchase is actually what you want to be purchasing ? it can ' t be that hard .
   (ID: ddd12abb48a0f3ffcb28acfc187dad268b34e3a9)

4. don ' t forget to post your results . there might be a wilkinson cameras or something near you too , and they sometimes have good varieties of film in stock . i ' d probably advise to shoot a few rolls normally like that before diving into home development , if for no other reason than it takes a big factor out of the process and it ' s one less thing to go wrong i . e . if the pics come out dodgy , you know it ' s going to be the camera rather than your development
   (ID: e2865528dd17e86320ca523d3db462efa29e7ca7)

5. your mileage may vary . i practiced on a friends car for a couple hours before i got my first car with a manual , i did ok at first , but there were definitely a lot of stressful moments the first month or two . hill starts were really scary , and one time i tried to start in 3rd on a hill and smoked the living hell out of the clutch . but now , a year and a half later i feel like a pro , double clutching with the best of them . my girlfriend , on the other hand , is hopeless . we have spent digit hours in a parking lot , and she still asks me which petal is which when we start a session , and can get the car moving maybe once or twice without getting fed up . i ' ll teach her eventually though .
   (ID: 9b41f9c0d7bce732d9af75c3b13bd58e9ce2a1e1)

6. when you dm , don  t be afraid to homebrew . i never once ran a premade adventure , but i  ve dmed for digit weeks now and all my players love my story . just explore youtube or your dm guide for tips on how to make it the best you can
   (ID: b2c623940e1acb4e269cab1c8f1920e03da9e429)

7. the best way i found to get people into it is you put forth the initiative , buy the stuff you need , do some reading , and kinda carry everyone through it . if they like it then they  ll start to learn  do more as you go . also i  ve never tried it , but i  ve heard using the starter set is a great way to begin
   (ID: b2c623940e1acb4e269cab1c8f1920e03da9e429)

8. you  ll go through about an hour or so of practicing the moves on the ground with the guys who will be strapped on to you , they never once talked about what to do if you wanted to back out , so the thought was never in your mind . when you get up in the plane , they  ll talk you through it while you reach altitude . when you reach altitude , you don  t have much time before they pretty much throw you out of the airplane . it was fun , i was excited to do it so i was never scared of it .
   (ID: fe5860fea6be29c69501e1a97b1240375d594aa9)

9. done all that already . have my commercial , multi , instrument ratings , and i flew for a while before i figured out the life sucks if you want to have any sort of a normal family life . it was fantastic when i was single though !
   (ID: 5603c8fcb517a4b5745afb8c3f46248974edebe3)

10. i want to know . maybe i could use it for myself . i ' m too wary to share my trust issue with my counselor hence the question .
   (ID: a35d2e75aaca32c6e87ef13f40d514b9769453f0)

   (ID: cfd691d6aeaf46cc644b0e21187d10dfc62b0bc8)

15. ok thank you , did someone teach you how to do this or are you self taught ?
   (ID: 2319e968bf60fef4f281e564c6b126147e06cc04)

16. thanks a lot , is this what i should be doing after learning chords or is there a  next step  to do before ?
   (ID: 0cd386c702105bbc1d5ff54477982a219c3af52c)

17. go for it and get a pro ! just make a list of things you know for sure you don ' t like  want .
   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

18. litterally just whatever i ' m thinking at the time , maybe it ' s just me but i always run scenarios through my head , decisions i ' ve made what ' s happening ect and so whenever i sit down been mostly writing in it while i eat lunch and just before bed  like right now i just write whatever i ' m thinking , my entry for today is digit pages already of a5 paper . part of it is just talking about a conversation i had at work and how i was being stupid , it might seem weird but writing down concerns about how i messed something up helps me realise it really wasn ' t a big deal , like at all . also just been keeping track of what im looking forward to , relationships with certain people stuff like that .
   (ID: ced909c5cb6ff0568a08e4114fa46116da622fa1)

19. hmm those are really good ideas , thanks also , i have one last question . do you know any writing apps for mobile that i can use to write on ? my laptop broke and i won ' t be able to use it for a month till it gets fixed . i mean , i could use a notebook , but i ' m more comfortable with using an electronic device rather than my hands
   (ID: ab38d3f31156c0cca1babe826c83025e8694eca2)

20. it will look a bit daunting at first , start from the start of the tutorials , it will have you make a simple thing first . this is good as it teaches you the basics of what you need . whenever it feels like it is starting to swamp you a bit , stop , do something else for a couple of hours , do something physical . let your brain rest and then come back to it . it will be tempting to just try and power through it all right now , but you will struggle to even remember the first step if you do that . most importantly keep the scope of your project narrow . finish the first idea , see how it works , and get another perspective on it . ask someone that won ' t baby you to review it , and listen to what they have to say . then come back and see if you can improve the thing . small iterations with a review between them help you grow and learn .
