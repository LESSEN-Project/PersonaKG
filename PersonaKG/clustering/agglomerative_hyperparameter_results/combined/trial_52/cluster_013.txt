1. every day , i find someone that has money , and make them give it to me . stand in line behind someone at the atm and make them give me the money they just took out . hang around at a casino and wait for someone to win big then make them give me their chips . stuff like that . and make sure that it ' s somewhere that has video cameras . i can make them say something like " here man , you take this " " seriously " " yeah , just pay it forward . and then if they try to take it back , i have video evidence that i didn ' t steal it .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

   (ID: 191aa96179821ac46f9548541f04899c2adacec9)

' cause i ' m fuckin ' stupid . i don ' t give a fuck about jail . that ' s my business . that ' s what i do .
   (ID: 380598f491e44cdd92f2ec6105505f0f439372e2)

5. depends on how long you ' ve been waiting . digit . digit  of the time , the person of front of you isn ' t paying attention because they ' re on the phone . that ' s why i do it .
   (ID: 199ca187d50b43aebb52968a5525289cb65a1520)

6. pick it up . stand around the area for an hour and so to wait if somebody would come looking . will return if somebody does . if none , then i just earned 1k for standing for an hour , not bad .
   (ID: a3bc874aed8bb8421b25930723a7210bcd9b2aec)

   (ID: 0176230ef7bd36e243dc81e1792c2941b82ea97c)

9. you still need a police report to prove it ' s not a hit and run , or that you didn ' t smash someone to death with it in the middle of the night . if its a write off you normally just get a pay out . if you try to fix it you ' ll have to pay the deductible .
   (ID: aac8075b69856b11cb4307ac267b902010d66e3a)

   (ID: d78765bdf49a3df577dd2523ce864393d4d0d2c9)

11. not a worker , but the lady behind me got upset about the bill she got over  digit and thought that she could refund it by puking it up back on to her plate . she got even more upset when they wouldn ' t accept it , and started to trash everything ! of course , they had to call security to get her out . by far the weirdest , but funniest thing i ' ve ever seen !
   (ID: 50bf4ae221ba385dca8216fc136721fbe54b1b31)

12. i always thought it would be great to dump a woman with a fake proposal . take her out to a nice restaurant , make it super romantic , and at the end of the night , get down on one knee and hand her a ring box . and in the box is a note that says " i ' m leaving you forever you cheating whore .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

13. the derren brown method  ask them politely what their charity does , whatever they say , just put a disgusted face and say " oh , you ' re collecting for that are you " and then walk off like a boss .
   (ID: 12b33309ed44732201ee2caf9b6ce9ce17552a26)

14. they usually don  t let me unless the dining room is closed . once i tried to go through the drive thru and the girl scoffs and in a snotty tone says  you have to come inside for that  . once i went through the drive thru at night and the girl says  sorry it  s just so confusing when you guys come through the drive thru  i don  t know what the hell could be so confusing about a gh driver coming through a drive thru to get the food . like just give me the food as if i were standing at the counter .
   (ID: 8386c9bc747868dc8ce5122cef952647660d1fc7)

15. always ask for a lawyer especially of you haven ' t done anything wrong . for example  cop  " where were you yesterday around 2pm ? you  " i was at walmart buying groceries " harmless right ? yea , until you find out there was a murder next door to walmart at digit  05pm and you ' ve just put yourself at the scene of a crime . congrats , by being cooperative , you ' ve just made yourself a suspect . and that ' s assuming the cop isn ' t just straight up lying to you in order to get you to say something incriminating .
   (ID: 8f7369c6ebb47df350fec663be46dfd8481ee2db)

16. people trying to bum out booze and  or cigarettes from random people are sooo annoying . i sometimes get approached outside of a train station and asked if i don ' t have some on me , usually really bad looking smelly people
   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)

17. yeah that really isn  t what happens lol , and if you read what i  d put about this information being from the uk , you might find out that what you  re saying is actually illegal over here but if you wanna tell people this then it  s none of my business .
   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

   (ID: 7542c8a6be5a118bef67d9539deb69c131fb4fbc)

   (ID: 1cb49ecc2e4fdb9752d9ca12d02f3cfc2f6659c9)
