   (ID: 2ab410cb3dc233b072c65fa9acc3c6323d05914e)

2. i wish i were joking too women dont tend to talk about how a loss feels or how it ' s not just a loss but more like the death of a dream . " be lucky for the kids you do have " is not a consolation in any way .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

3. this is a truly horrible situation as a single dad i can ' t imagine what i would do if i lost one of mine . my heart goes out to you .
   (ID: 1afb7597077681179430af152997f04fd73ba0ee)

4. i  m sorry i can  t offer some kind of fix all solution for you . it  s a tragic thing  years later and my mother  s still stuck in her old ways . the only thing you can do for them is try to be supportive . as i learned , though , some people . they really just don  t want to get better . it  s a sad life to live , and it hurts to see , but there truly isn  t much you can do . patience is key , and if they can truly find it in themselves to seek a better life , then they will  it may take days or it may take years . overall , it  s just a question of ,  is it worth it ?  do you truly want to stick around through thick and thin , then the answer is yes . unfortunately , i believe you  re already doing all you can by being a supportive friend . maybe he  s not quite as far gone as my mother was , and a family  friend intervention could at least get the wheels turning ? other than that , i regret to say that i have no advice . best of luck xx

5. i  m very sorry for your loss . i get the sense that this picture sums up very well the kind of person he was . the kind of dad that all of us guys strive to be one day .
   (ID: d12326d948c77fb593c0c928081304135cb79ed4)

6. thank you , it really means a lot because it was a decision that i struggle with a lot of the time and have struggled with a lot since now that my mom is aging .
   (ID: 699bf0afe2f1405d2208320e80156a99e90d356e)

7. honestly , i think the best thing you could do for her is surprise her with your presence on mother ' s day . that would be the best gift ever for her .
   (ID: 1b4a970a63450e21b56e1d38502b30aca032cd3f)

8. be there for your friend , love him , and stay strong with him . as conversation continues , youll find out the severity of the incident , but if you ask him something and he seems confused or doesnt remember , dont fight it or ask any further . see if he knows your name and go from there . the last thing you want to do is frustrate him with things he cant yet remember . i say " can ' t yet " because you are going to remain positive and with that positivity , over the course of time , his memory may slowly come back . god works his magic in ways that could move mountains my friend . ill keep you in my thoughts through this time .
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

9. i hope you both are ! it ' s a good feeling knowing that you have someone who cares about you no matter what and accepts your flaws . knowing you can barely talk for years while you ' re off doing your own thing , but then when you talk again it ' s like no time has passed , that ' s a good feeling , too .
   (ID: 28ecb35c880034ee5298d0c4abb71cabdafd1e4f)

10. i am so sorry about what is going on right now . i wish i could give you a big hug right now . i think the best thing that you can do right now is to keep doing what you  re doing  just being by his side . tell him how much you love him and how thankful you are that he  s still alive . your dad must be heartbroken and i think reminding him that he is indeed love is the best thing that you can do right now .

11. it ' s hard to give advice because everyone handles this sort of thing differently . we went through three miscarriages , but they were all before our first child , so for us , there wasn ' t any question of trying again . for some people , it helps to start trying again right away . some want to wait for awhile before trying again . it ' s probably best to give it some time , for your wife to get back to normal physically , and for you both to heal emotionally . make sure she knows you ' re there to support her , but don ' t smother here either , give her space if she needs it . and always keep in mind , that unless she has an underlying health problem which it doesn ' t sound like is the case since you already have two kids , miscarriages are random occurrences , and aren ' t likely to happen with the next pregnancy .

12. my gram is digit and my grandpa died ten years ago . we ' re all individuals , but her biggest complaint is that she ' s lonely . i think you could ask her what she wants , does she want to talk , be in someone ' s company , or alone ? i do worry that sometimes even when someone says they want to be alone , it ' s not always for the best as they may be just wanting to hide and be in pain alone . if there are interests of hers where she is with other people , i ' d encourage that and offer to help get her to those outings if she is unable to get there herself . i think you could make it a routine of visiting her or doing one of those activities , eating a meal or a few meals a week with her as a routine . i ' m not sure how much time you have or whether your family members have time to do the same , but you could set up a bit of a schedule .

13. im crying at this story fsr anyways , im very sorry for you and your brother
   (ID: 1b5b08f1246e450c7da09e40c81570fba378da84)

14. thank you ! its amazing but she is living up to her name . and yes i am already looking into better brakes .
   (ID: c11592c54f6061d979d11af92c6289790a5bec93)

15. thank you so much . my dad also gets worse at christmas . it ' s horrible when you anticipate that special days will be ruined by them , it ' s really hard to not expect it . for me anyway . you ' re a good person for supporting her effort at recovery , i know that ' s a tough road . maybe next year i ' ll spend the day not at home we live on the same property . thanks again for your kind thoughts red  heart
   (ID: 8b7590cb8502d6abd38b320b842aa7642186b6d8)

16. also . what about writing her a poem ? something lovely . i don ' t know if that would work but you could try .
   (ID: be642743472cdef9445edc6dd55beb3c2a8a1258)

17. glad you realize how cringeworthy that was  kudos to both of you for growing together and laughing about it !
   (ID: 634dae5dcf04e8e8d5bfd5e71c1fa8ec9713f222)

18. as cliche as it sounds , there ' s very little you can do to help him if he doesn ' t want to help himself . i ' d recommend letting him know that you know he ' s using , don ' t make any threats , but let him know that his habit is hurting you and that you ' re concerned . for the most part it is outside of your control . that ' s the beauty and the curse of free will  we can choose for ourselves , but not for others . my half  sister estranged herself from my family because of her drug use . despite multiple rehab attempts , two broken marriages , and a move across the country and back she didn ' t change . sometimes people aren ' t willing to . i wish you and your brother well .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

19. if it was this next month , i ' d likely just cry . our kid is due in digit weeks . i ' m happy not being her .
   (ID: 1cf567904675ac1ca7b5a90612e5479a5b6c9bef)

20. thank you for spending the time with your child . i wish my parents didn  t work so hard all the time because i could never see them . trust me , they  ll be grateful you were there for them because not a lot of parents are . i wish more people would spend more time with their children because it  s very important to their development . she  ll only be in your hair for so much longer . keep up the good work !
