Total from this dataset: 1807

1. you have to message first so maybe it ' s how you approach men
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

2. you  re so strong for making the decision you did though , just remember that . you  re worth so much more than the way he was treating you and you knew that  i hope you realise how amazing that is . so many people haven  t got as far as you have face  blowing  a  kiss
   (ID: 726d5aaac9472ccdcb64345cd6d082bee4eae6fa)

3. there are no kids , and i agree with you a hundred percent . it is best to end it . but it ' s hard confused  face
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

4. context matters . being around your crush is different from being around your boss . crushing on someone means that you ' re in love with them by definition . he is so messed up that he doesn ' t even know when he ' s in love  has a crush . how do ypu know when you ' ve got a crush ?  when you notice butterflies around your crush that  s probably one way you can tell you like them . this is a tautology .  you can also pay attention to the thoughts you are having also an internal experience only you would know about unless you express it out loud to another individual thereby making op  s question valid around your crush . if you  re having the thought that  she  he is really beautiful  handsome  . . . in conjunction with experiencing butterflies in that setting . you mean like when her jealous boyfriend is coming towards me to knock the shit put of me ? or when this beautiful chick is serving me a warrant ?  or  i love being around so and so  how do i know that i love being around them ?  that will help you personally differentiate between the two  butterflies because you  re nervous  scared vs butterflies because you feel love . what does love feel like ?  also never become a psychologist . . . . you  d probably make no money and help no one . like the folks at psychology today ?  it  s not very difficult to tell you  re not a psychologist and don  t work in that field by your comments anyway . digit emotional intelligence . i ' m a psychologist . i ' m always helping people with their emotional problems , looking at new ideas , and experimenting .
   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

5. compromise . you need to find a way for both of you to get a little of what you want . often time teenagers are completely oblivious to what they really need as support and same goes for parents not knowing where an appropriate line should be drawn usually out of fear or anxiety for their child  s well being you may see improvement if you take on more responsibility around the home or in the community  but that  s only a vague suggestion because i have no idea about your specific circumstances .
   (ID: 238316960c030f561912bd63e9f572a4170f991b)

6. nice guys aren  t really nice , they are almost always trying to create a reciprocal relationship . i do nice things for you  you do nice things for me .
   (ID: 32de5e90f9b453daab13fd1b4cff20b995cc5120)

7. romantic relationahips and marriage
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

8. i ' m an digit year old guy and i look digit , while i do consider myself decent looking its never really affected my confidence but i feel your pain . honestly go for it , if she turns you down then move on with your life and try to feel better about yourself . any girl who refuses to date you based on your appearance with looking younger is shallow and doesn ' t deserve you .
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

9. sometimes the simplest solutions are often the best ones ! and unfortunately yes , certain types of people abusive , manipulative , selfish , etc will absolutely take advantage of someone if they think they can . but i hope you realize that you deserve better ! my confidence used to be and sometimes still is very low . but now i mostly see myself in a much more positive light . and believe me , confidence makes all the difference . i hope you begin to see yourself more positively as well . for what it ' s worth , you sound like a truly lovely domme . you clearly care for your sub ' s needs and respect their boundaries , and those two things say a lot about a person .
   (ID: 603a231fe5a5d93e7d1121f6265baf1dcb11f624)

10. you ' re right . thank you so much . i usually never talk about my private stuff but i feel like this has to get out of my way . sorry to hear about your boyfriend , is he going to be okay ?
   (ID: 617a45b75601128e5c804bd8ca6b8e525a4aa02d)

11. it really sucks when things don ' t work out with someone you love . people make mistakes , but cheating isn ' t a mistake . you don ' t accidentally dip your dick in someone . it ' s a choice . a choice someone who fully loved you wouldn ' t make . i ' m sorry , you probably could ' ve worked things out if that hadn ' t happened . but he did it and you shouldn ' t let him get away with it . it sucks having to live without someone you love , but people make their own choices regardless of what anyone else tells them .
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

12. i did this an awful lot in high school , and in my experience it ' s like applying for jobs . after the first couple of dozen you just come to expect it , and the rejection isn ' t so crushing .
   (ID: 91d5c112de409d3216ef30d9a1c0d6a9c9f48260)

13. sorry man , but he has a gf already so you can ' t do anything about that . you need to let go and just respect his decision .
   (ID: ab38d3f31156c0cca1babe826c83025e8694eca2)

14. oh my god if his fetish has this much of a hold on his love life you don  t need to be with this person . have you told him everything you mentioned here ? about how uncomfortable and skin crawling hes being ? it  s cruel of him to expect you to change your body for his fetishy desires .
   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

15. you don ' t need them . i know it hurts but focus on the happy and loving aspects of your new marriage . you ' re incredibly strong , i wish you two the best . show your parents just how happy you are . if that ' s not enough then too bad , their loss .
   (ID: 4f350b59a80efc55c353f9527b99d8b6f4fc403d)

16. hey it  s good you  ve acknowledged you have a problem ! i don  t think disliking your boyfriends watching porn is inherently a crazy thing but the depths to which it  s making you suffer isn  t normal . do you have any trauma or mental illness history ? things of that nature can influence feelings like this . i know you said you  ve tried therapy but i would give it another go , and or make it a requirement that your bf  s don  t watch porn . some men don  t watch it in the first place
   (ID: fdfa8a07ca863e2631c049fe1f6a12483b81afbf)

17. that ' s fair , one year is a pretty common tipping point in a relationship in my experience anyway . if you feel you have truely put in the effort to address this and seen no improvement , than i think you know what to do . let him know you ' re unhappy and that you want to be with him , but his lack of attention is hurting you . if he still does not put forth the effort than it ' s time to move on .
   (ID: 0254abd776ead925b3c998e740c3ae71d2b4c6e0)

18. we ? did you really help her out ? from the tone of your post is sounds like you object to this direct help . i ' m sure many donated to both an organization to help generally and to rebecca directly . we like rebecca .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

19. ask her what is wrong . hold her . listen and don ' t try to fix .
   (ID: 08c0532c5e9b4c1272d1faf5af748d761625424a)

20. she doesn ' t pick out any of my outfits digit . digit  of the time . she just hates how masculine i dress and i don ' t want any thanksgiving drama .
