1. that ' s . fuckin gross . op , i ' m so sorry . if it helps any , i empathize . i ' m nb with significant reproductive dysphoria as in don ' t want anything to do with any of it , and my mom ' s been hounding me about grandkids since i was your age . saying it feels gross is an understatement  any serious suggestion of it makes me feel physically ill . no one has any right to determine what happens with your body except for you . if you need a proper binder , you can get them for    digit from gc2b , and they come in tank top styles that can throw off suspicion of their purpose i just recommend not letting your mom get a hold of it just in case  they are stretchy . take your measurements accurately before ordering  they ' re tight . don ' t wear it digit  digit  you need to breathe , and you can damage your body with prolonged unnecessary use . it ' ll take time probably a decade or so as per your current age for her to realize you ' re serious . all you have to do is stick to your guns . in the meantime , trans is a good community , if you ' re not there already .  digit

3. i  m digit weeks . ftm , so i don  t know from experience but everyone has told me not to forget a thermometer , a little first aid kit and for some reason everyone says to stock up on a thing called  boogie wipes  and keep at your changing table .
   (ID: b481339e58c54d903a5bef6ed58d704163f4f9f3)

4. so many questions . how did you breach that subject without pissing her off ? also , can you recommend a doc ? final cost ?
   (ID: cb8cb80756996949fe8fa5c308bb091367a0c6ff)

5. i  d also like to recommend an electric heating pad . kotex has pads and tampons just for teens , they  re a little smaller than the average pad . i believe they  re called kotex u , and they  re usually in a black  neon box . this is a really important one for dads to know  tampon use doesn  t mean your daughter has had intercourse ! virgins can use tampons too ! some girls just want a more discreet hygiene method  pads do feel a little bit like a diaper .
