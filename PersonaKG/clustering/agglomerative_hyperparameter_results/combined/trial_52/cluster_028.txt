1. but why ? they obviously deliberately designed it to be bumpy . i for one like it .
   (ID: 56f8202bdec7dd96819ad76a4bb0cbe6c88ef2e6)

2. to add on to this    many people view tattoos as somewhat of a time stamp to show how interests have evolved . my body is a canvas and i don ' t exactly love the tattoos i got when i was digit , but they are a snapshot of digit year old me . i can look at those and remember where i was mentally at that age and kinda get a piece of me back that otherwise might ' ve been lost otherwise especially growing up before smart phones , there aren ' t many photos or videos of me at that age , and i definitely didn ' t keep journals or love letters or anything else from high school . my tattoos are literally the only thing from that era that i still have and will have forever . so yeah . it doesn ' t matter that my interests have changed
   (ID: e707e3b97faf5ee7a6bc4fac3f1e296e163b3c89)

3. i know they are great but they are just ugly as sin
   (ID: a778c9b10000a3e15377e87997ef5bea46cfe33f)

4. you are a man of specific taste and i can respect that , but just so you know this isn  t a problem for anyone but you .
   (ID: 83ed088161a0acc5bb20774e9e10435e55e88737)

5. honestly i don ' t care if a cake has fondant , i peel it off but all of yall talk about it looking ugly but its really not that bad looking
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

6. i don  t hate digit , but i absolutely hate how they  ve made most of the covenant look .
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

7. i believe most of this is actually based on a stereotype . grown up people think that having an action figure or reading comic books as an adult book is cringy . this is surprising because superhero movies are racking up highest grossing movies of all time . but yes personality of the person matters too . if you find a studious type dude with prescribed spectacles having a batman figure in his room then it will give you a cringe which is totally stereotypical because other people will mistake this as lack of social maturity or heightened intellectaka nerd ' om . when a popular celebrity admits that they ' ve a goku figure in their home then it becomes a fashion  talk of the town . so yes it depends on the personality of the person .
   (ID: 5ec957438fa111872baaa0871df8459459cc2519)

8. i think it ' s more that it was adopted by some people as a symbol of white supremacy , so now anyone making that symbol could potentially be using it to mean that rather than just a generic hand gesture
   (ID: 0c9ff5f9405b3c55ee8cd256b4c912a160643255)

9. it looks like a rose , i can see how some people would like this . because they think that they are special little flowers .
   (ID: 3b45915d58b20f0e2abb6b26d4534980a5d3aa68)

10. i think the idea is to hide the piercing so you look more presentable at a job interview . that said , this would probably be more questionable than the earrings .
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

11. i would literally take any gun without question accept that disgusting thing literally why would you make something that is just that hideous
   (ID: a778c9b10000a3e15377e87997ef5bea46cfe33f)

12. it is extremely common to wear the tshirt of your alma mater . there is nothing douchebaggy about showing a little pride about your loyalties . i suggest the douchebaggery is in ops perception . why is he butthurt anyway ?
   (ID: e3524b3478c664f2c6e8b00a4341ff0a26995fbc)

13. nickelodeon animated shows are getting worse arent they ? i  m just . so confused as to why there needs to be emphasis on his kneecaps but no other details added ?
   (ID: 44eba9a0cf089ec615a77db5d42a2c01b63cb259)

14. well , sometimes we dislike something and we don ' t know why but we need to dig deep to figure out the cause . let ' s do that . tell me how it makes you feel when you encounter a woman who has piercings . are you revolted ? what thoughts go through your mind . what do you think ? maybe we can get to the heart of it .
   (ID: ddd770a31dc9c8fa4ad153c94b4c0debc20cf026)

15. its hard to convey the tone of my question . the answer was meant to be obviously , you ' re trying to impress your guy ? it ' s human nature for a man and woman to find support in each other . like the guy you ' re with should tell you everyday you ' re beautiful , you don ' t have to layer your face with products cos that shit just gets in the way of what ' s really underneath . you don ' t have to impress anyone else cos you ' ve impressed the your guy the day ya ' ll met . that ' s the reason why ya ' ll shouldn ' t feel the need to put on a mask . i know some women may not find that type of guy but ya ' ll go through so much just to find validation of something some guy can see a mile a way . you ' re gorgeous already and your ruining art by applying things you think make you look better . sigh . don ' t know why i bothered .
   (ID: 8712de543372bc5f398d43ea5b918c85efc5dda7)

16. it is bad in many moments like how the monsters look and that many characters look kinda dollish . what bothered me most were the nipples . the fight scenes still looked great in my opinion and the important characters didn ' t look worse than what you get in your usual anime
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

17. this sis literally the stupidest thing you ever heard ? someone maybe doing some diy instead of purchasing the finished product ?
   (ID: a283688fea41e1110e58705ec74d4e325e46d87e)

18. you are probably actually pretty attractive then . you want to control the controllable things haimakeup  outfit because you know you can be pretty if those things are working for you . for me it ' s more like there is nothing i can do to make me feel i look good . so better to think i look one way then to see myself and realize what i actually look like .
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

19. i think they look grabby . like they know their way around you and will grab my cock too . such a slutty girl
   (ID: 298dd327349771a27c9a14437b3b5a53d0bd9e35)

20. lol . not on the topic of coltee ' s shirt , but larissa is extra annoying this episode with these cosmetic procedures . coltee ' s annoying me too . and jay and ashley . i don ' t think any of these people don ' t annoy me any more . maybe pedro .
