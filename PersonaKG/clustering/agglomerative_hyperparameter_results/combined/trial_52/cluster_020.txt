1. yeah , i think you ' re right . my partner wrote this because she feels as though her grandmother would appreciate her story being used to get more people interested in basic homesteading  we ' ve built in beginner ' s homesteading stuff , nothing super complex . that said , apparently she had a recipe for what she called ' emergency rabbit stew ' that i really wish we could track down , and i saw myself how she could make clothes out of literal scraps . i think maybe a compilation of more detailed things of hers like that would be more useful to this sub ! we ' ll work on it .
