1. i ' ve recently decided to tackle my hoarding tendencies and purge my house of the stuff i ' ve kept most of my life that i thought i would use  look back on fondly . i ' m digit , so it ' s about digit years worth of stuff . reading old journals , notes to people , " poems " so bad i can ' t even consider it poetry , and looking at things i thought were cool , i want to die of embarrassment just from reading  seeing them . all i can think is " people let me be like this , i showed these to people , i sent these to boys i had crushes on , why ? " i want to burn it so there ' s never the chance of anyone finding it in a landfill , that ' s how bad it is . on the other hand , i have found some things  pictures i kept from other people and i want to send them to them so they can feel the cringe , too , and maybe we can have a good laugh about it .

2. thank you for you advice and kindness ! i don ' t want to throw them away but i think your right and i will . also i did turn it into a piece of art because i thought it would be waist of such beautiful things and i thought it was a little funny to do so . but it has to at the least be a reminder of such negatively and a bad experience .

3. sorry man , and i think i ' ll delete them soon . it ' s just kind of like , wow my life was so awesome at this point in time " i don ' t wanna forget that feeling , but on the other hand , it ' s not healthy .

5. wow i can  t even imagine . the only thing i can possibly think is to try and burn your loves faces  childhood room or home  any thing else nostalgic into your mind while you have time . i really don  t know what else i can say , that  s terrible .
