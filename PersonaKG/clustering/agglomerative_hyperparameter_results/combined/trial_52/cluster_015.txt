3. when one enjoys a book , they tend to be pulled through it , not wanting to put it down . if you notice a young person struggling , bored over a book , they are not enjoying it . figure out a game they like , and find a book that follows a similar character on a similar journey . if they like kratos , sit them down with some greek myths or percy jackson . but give them cather in the rye and they ' ll go into a coma rather than read it .
   (ID: 0f8bca5cd80e9429ae58bb976857e3c5ab057290)

   (ID: a428ebec68dc8bb1dccfb778bb32844c5677e265)

8. just an idea but maybe write him a letter in the form of an invitation to hog warts and list the series as his school books ? you could expand it and add other " supplies " and take him to hogsmeade in the wizarding world to get the stuff like a stuffed owl or something although that part sounds like a much pricier ordeal
   (ID: 239eded9e37fe1b7388561d1e82993d15dd4fc15)

   (ID: c1c3bee034ba3e70e4bd22d7987533e43f2b424b)

13. i don  t . such an animated series requires an iq of at least digit  digit . i don  t know where you got your digit from . showing simpletons such a show would taint it . only a plebeian would ask such a question .
   (ID: 4198a967d1b0765e3fc996754ce9a3e6c7f24c8c)

14. i ' ve always been a big fan of " the shopping game " for kids . it goes like this  i went to the grocery store and i bought . and the first person names something you could buy at a grocery store that starts with a . the second person repeats the thing that starts with a and adds something that starts with b and you keep it going as long as they can . good luck , and have fun !
   (ID: 87dcb06b0e31b35730fe93ce7dcbef85e6078b40)

15. i ' d actually go with something like the lost boys . or evil dead digit . or dead alive . or shaun of the dead . i think picking something that ' s a good mix of horror and fun is a good way to ease someone in . someone else said tucker and dale . yes , that ' s a good one , too . i love to tell people i ' m having " a doozy of a day . "
   (ID: 311d770ebb499b987db7e44fdae56456f45a5918)

16. i ' d also recommend showing your friends some of the really entertaining old films i ' d go with rear window , charade , and tootsie having friends who are into the same stuff as you can be very helpful , just don ' t start them off with really obscure stuff because you risk turning them off to old stuff if you show them something like the seventh seal or stalker first
   (ID: a62b69d15e6c81a1a1acb2d0dd4bf9119038ff09)

17. try munchkin . it  s pretty simple and really funny , not to mention that there is like a card pack for any addition , like x  men , tmnt , more of just the original stuff . it  s also something that you don  t have to get really into or have a lot of people .
   (ID: 7424e4821daf78f7a38983c3e1a291ee7ce757d2)

18. i didnt . i just pulled the old " sit next to them at the movies and put your arm around them " move . worked like a charm !
   (ID: 37aa751f14bbf132fc2f76d2c2c79142318c3e31)

19. if anyone ever said they knew how to do it themselves i ' d let them , but i would always always always double check the harness and make sure they were clipped properly . after every attempt too . when it comes to safety , it takes a lot to be " too careful "
   (ID: 2e464b2732570f16afced14ab79d30fa92622627)
