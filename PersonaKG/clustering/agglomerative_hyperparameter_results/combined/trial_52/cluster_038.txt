3. i mean , he  s really good at management but he  s so busy with other people  s stuff that he doesn  t have time for our network . as for temperatures , it  s actually pretty good because most of it is audio stuff but on hot days it can be like digit degrees celsius hotter
   (ID: 7bd4f8e2f55f684df651b44f2faa8769031fc782)

4. i really enjoy my work  sometimes it ' s tough and stressful , but it ' s intellectually stimulating and i have some great colleagues for the most part . my boss also seems to appreciate me and value my input . it isn ' t perfect , but it ' s good enough . i suspect that for jobs that suck , one or more of these things is lacking .
   (ID: aa4c399e0083dd1bf730546e6c4fbd9b75104d67)

5. i know it  s not that simple but if you  re not happy , quit . i get it , it  s not that easy but if you  re just lingering around when you  re not happy , that  s your fault . secondly don  t try to pin this on the students . none of this is our fault . this is between cupe and the university . we  ve got nothing to do with it . were you in our position you would understand , just like i  m sure if we were in yours , you  d understand . most of us don  t care how it ends , we just want to finish our semester . i  m sorry that you  re treated this way , but there  s nothing that we as students can do about it for the time being . that said , all that  s mentioned here is how you  re treated like shit . in what way ? if you cared to elaborate it would help us understand a whole lot more .

6. you might notice the title of the thread is " what irritates you " so yeah . i do get irritated by this topic . word of advice  every application is online . if you show in person it makes you look bad .
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

7. i ' d say lie about it , your idea of having to pick someone up at the airport is a really good viable excuse given that it ' s the holidays , people may be flying in at weird hours , etc . the one thing i would say about lying though is that if you guys post pictures or run into any coworker ' s or anything while out they could catch you in the lie . i don ' t know where you work so i may be totally off base in saying this but i work retail too and it ' s not ever , ever busy that late at night , even on weekends . if you ' re a good employee i imagine they wouldn ' t be too mad about letting you leave an hour early , you could always start by saying " oh can i leave an hour early i have a prior commitment " and then if they ask you could give the excuse , you never know what they ' ll say before you ask , really . you could even make sure to do extra work or make sure your work would be adequately covered by those already there before you ask .

9. you ' re feeling this way because he looks like stability  something you ' re clearly lacking right now . to get your mind off of it , focus on improving your life and becoming independent . don ' t have a job , get one . have a job ? get a better one or go to school at night to expand to a new field . with new interest and confidence from self  sufficiency , you ' ll have clarity . it will help you get him out of your head and give you a foothold into success at the same time . good luck .

13. okay so this comment is a little different than the answer your looking for but it kind of fits . i worked at a resturaunt as a server and had a manager who was really mean all the time and had such an attitude problem . she would piss off the guests in my section often and let them leave pissed off to write a bad review , on numerous occasions . she would shoulder check me and make fun of me in front of people and yell at me on the floor for something that wasn ' t done by me , wasn ' t even in my section and had literally nothing to do with me . and she has left me in tears often because of how badly she treated me . she also made a lot of really horrible calls like choosing to not tell me about guests special requests and letting them get mad at me for not being prepped on how they prefer things . they ' re rich assholes and prefer their experiences where they don ' t have to communicate the way they want things . which is completely opposite of how we treat the normal guests . but i wouldn ' t know that unless she taught me that . so she ' s made me look like an idiot on a couple of occasions . one night it was really busy and the sushi chef was behind so i had to wait a really long time for a roll for an appetizer . this table was very high maintenanced and picky so they were pissed . i asked the manager to move it along and talk to the table and she ignored me . finally i talk to the sushi chef he usually prefers no contact and i find out that the lines i put in on the computer to distinguish between apps and entrees just didn ' t show up . so i draw them on the paper and ask him for the roll asap . the manager should have been doing this because i needed to get to my tables and run my food . then i tell the manager about the problem with the specific computer and how it has been giving me trouble again . it happened at random since the very beginning of me working there . she gave me a horrible response about how there ' s nothing she can do about it . it my head lady , i still have the number of the posi support team in my phone from my old management job and i know that you can fix it . again , in my head . so i ' m upset because she had no regard for the happiness of my table . had no regard for the problem with the computer that was causing a lot of issues . and had no regard for helping me out which is her job . but again , she ' s a bully . so im in a hurry i ask the sushi chef for the entree roll and he hands it to me and i drop it at the table and apologize over and over again . in my head i ' m like i ' m just ganna split this sushi roll off the bill and tell them at the end i paid for it . i wasn ' t even going to ask the manager i was just ganna pay for it myself . so then i realize he hands me the wrong sushi roll and when the entree sushis come up its wrong because he gave me an entree one for app . so the sushi chef is fighting with me tooth to nail and i ' m telling him what i need and he ' s just saying no . and in my head i ' m like how can you fight against this . this is for the customer we need to fix the mistake and talk about it later for the happiness of the guests . i tell the manager i need her help again and she starts yelling and screaming in my face about how i should know the difference . so i said out loud " the sushi chef didn ' t know the difference either . it ' s busy . i need my roll for the table there should be no arguing about it " . so i basically undermined her at that point . then she pulls me to the side to say that i have no right to fight with her , i was acting like a child and tried to threaten me with the owner . whom was sitting right in front of the sushi station and didn ' t even offer a helping hand to get the problem solved efficiently . then i ' m so fed up i start literally crying . saying i don ' t care was the owner says at this point i need the help when there ' s an issue and instead all i do is get yelled at . then she says we ' ll talk about it later . we never did . i worked there for a year and had a lot of shifts and was really good with the guests and always had compliments . about a week later i came down with the flu really bad and kept showing up to work anyway . i was literally throwing up in the bathroom on between tables for days there . i called out once because no one would cover me and i needed to get better . i even gave them ample amount of time to motivate someone else to come in . then i went to work for a couple days again . and i was getting worse . finally it was so bad one day that i had no voice was throwing up with diarrhea , had snot continously dripping from my nose and could get my swollen eyes to stop tearing . so i called out . and the next day this bitch had me fired . they fired me . i loved that place . i loved the people i worked with . i loved the kitchen crew and the guests . i have never been so sad about leaving a job . i have also never been on bad terms with a job before either . but her awful professionalism to handle situations in a correct manner for the guests directly resulted in me losing my job .

16. my main passion is also my job , or will be eventually anyways once i finish school . other than that it  s music because it  s a universal language . anyone can understand it , even if the lyrics aren  t in their native tongue . you don  t need to understand it , you feel it . that  s what i love about it . myself , i  m learning guitar and vocals .
