3. hey ! you have a to  do list to start on ! you know what you need to do . it sucks that you were sick . it sucks that you got a shitty lottery number for housing . drink some water , eat some carbs , go for a walk , then start kicking ass and meeting your goals . you can do it .
   (ID: a2ac729ecf8bc4b4e5e9971a848e76d3b574e65a)

4. for me , trying to change isn ' t enough . no one that is overweight isn ' t trying to change . they could spend their lives trying to change . the reason fit people are generally more desirable then the overweight is that they ' ve done it . our bodies are often a snapshot of the mind . overweight people often have overweight minds . someone who is already fit likely has the mind for it . discipline , confidence , self efficacy . these things are important in relationships and in life . that ' s why we find overweight people unattractive . ready for my downvote .

   (ID: 1df1bd07e28c0df73bd865f8cb447d7c8f1bd4d3)

8. part of it for me was actually losing some weight . i realized that even after i lost like digit pounds , i was still able to find parts of me that i hated and i didn ' t really see myself as more attractive or beautiful . it ' s kind of like you think this one thing is going to solve your problems , then you get it , and you realize that your thoughts about your body aren ' t really about your body so much as how you choose to see it . there are still things i want to change about my body , but i ' ve learned to be more gracious and accepting of what i look like either way .
   (ID: 573effd77bc41b375b82f92f6f34840f2f4dbff4)

11. i heard bananas are great to avoid feel sore . but yes if you want to see changes commitment is key . if you promised your self to go every other day keep it like that , and maintain it . there are days that i feel tired , to the point that i want to sleep and not go to the gym , but it was the day i go so still went all tired , took a shower before working out and still tired but did easy stuff , the feeling of accomplishment is great , and you don  t feel bad that you broke a promise .

12. but we shouldn  t say that being obese is okay as a society , but if you want to stay fat thats your choice but you shouldn  t spread fake ideals

15. you can switch . i did digit months of keto , no breaks , but right now it ' s too inconvenient , though should my situation go back to where it was i ' ll go back to it . i learned a lot from keto , how to eye  ball calories , portion control , not seeing hunger as the enemy . if you can keto then use the self control you had to not eat carbs to stick to a good calorie amount then you should be fine i ' m still losing at a nice rate anyways .
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

18. this kinda hit me home . im digit and i eat like shit , i usually always have been . recently , i ' ve been thinking about going gym , getting a part  time job and beginning to eat healthier . however , like majority of the people with a problem , i use an excuse as to why i shouldnt  such as , " it ' s not affecting me now , is it ? " . i ' ve realised now , that im being incredibly ignorant to those around me , telling me that i should begin to take care of my body more because i wont have problems in the future . i ' m going to start doing it now  no more excuses .
