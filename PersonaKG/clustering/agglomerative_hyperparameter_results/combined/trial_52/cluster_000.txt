1. wow . how did the standards drop so low , man ? story time ?
   (ID: 25a3a19690cf520ebb090d792f9aab864cc59254)

2. how much of a parody of themselves they ' ve become .
   (ID: ecc98de1e575d7e863a2124b364b8ed586778ba5)

3. i can understand that . so tom is still in denial about leaving the bandwhich i mean he probably still owns it unless mark bought him out and was talking in an interview awhile back about wanting to bring blink under his production company and let them make music as they please and all that stuff . so idk im interested to see the state of the band and were it goes on in the next few years with them if tom really does still own parts of it and stuff . kinda suck to see matt get kicked to the curb though if he comes back .
   (ID: 533870e07f5d5bb315a9e1e8278df4d123d8a887)

4. conspiracy theories . it ' s not as much a new trend , as one that has been blown up by every lunatic with a stray thought having ready access to millions of other lunatics . it ' s been my experience that two people can ' t keep a secret about where they ' re going that evening , much less god knows how many people keeping a secret like a fake moon landing , or wtc , or sandy hook , or all the other idiocies that abound .
   (ID: f7713e4cd0a5245097f9f45a1194222bda369b48)

5. this is not me challenging you , just asking out if curiosity . is this something you have experienced working in africa , or something you  ve read about ? it  s just . super depressing .
   (ID: 765135d22ccec6feceb4fa47636d721a4530a57c)

6. it was mostly just talk , and they acted like they were showing what the people want , even though a lot of people wanted pewdiepie to be in it , or the whole jake paul suicide forest ordeal .
   (ID: 3bd27d669b5f394ae490c4e17c08aca524c47546)

7. i think they ' re just not putting up with people ' s shit anymore . at this point it ' s like " i am who i am some fuck you if you don ' t like it ! " they just people to stop treating them like shit for it .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

8. interesting . but i think the ' exposing to everyone ' sounds like kind of a mean threat that would cause more drama . but i wouldn ' t know .
   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

9. yeah this sounds like a filming thing . it ' s awesome you guys are so on the lookout though , wow .
   (ID: 1d327d2812dfee71bf8ef77d36ffd5eb70efd55b)

10. the writer of an over wrought sadsack of a depressing shit show has been hired by disney ? so they have decided to go after depressed money now too .
   (ID: 570664fde0bec86b7f35fdcea9073ef88e78798d)

11. loneliness , national and international politics and reality tv dissections .
   (ID: eb736a8c6e4b69cfd870418bec35f4839b24780b)

12. the thing your typing on would of been made by people on low pay and long hours or is their suffering ok as you don  t see it ?
   (ID: bdf7e254fb732651bb0373067c57200731f7ca55)

13. probably current patch apart from very minor changes . they rightfully so don ' t want to change the meta a lot right before such a big tourny .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

14. i think the question is asking what industries you ' d like to kill off , i think you ' re taking it as an insult
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

15. i think it can be a bit sad when they leave behind everything that made them themselves before . but mostly it  s fine , it  s no different imo to dedicating yourself to your career , just the career is children . everyone wants something different out of their life .
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

16. probably . i think they ' re seeking out the youngin ' s drama
   (ID: 448fa72755c2d77f67b820a9620d09e9d4573816)

17. very good point , didn ' t think about that aspect . but the fact that op started with " being in la " makes me think it ' s for social media purposes .
   (ID: 005d28ee4e007860b869be509fe8dfdf5c402505)

18. do you think their has ever been a time when people were actually happy about it . that you weren ' t at work to see ?
   (ID: 2e30252ab6ce4c1807bb315c6103be324b841909)

19. tl  dr i ' m pretty sure no one knows what the hell they ' re doing anymore and we ' re all just trying to manage .
   (ID: bb88411b165294ddd01835e6389a8e93e9d796d3)

20. i think what  s happening is now everyone knows about the show so the typical applicant might br madly in desire of their digit minutes rather than madly in love . collateral damage is what worries me . there are people who would do whatever necessary to get on tv etc , when the shows  s over , their spouse and new families might be over too .
