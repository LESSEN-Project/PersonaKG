1. lol . he ' s in my foundry but i have read so may bad things about him i don ' t want to put myself through that kind of torment yet .
   (ID: 5078613a782f11088cff05f4503056b040cea999)

2. once i have enough coins to replace bonaventura he ' s probably who i was gonna get . haven ' t heard of anyone using him so i appreciate the comment !
   (ID: 230ce64c825c9de0874b588b6d715819e39e5610)

3. as much as i would love to be able to take him to the vet regularly i ' m only digit and my parents can ' t afford to take him to the vet even once he hasn ' t been there since he got tagged . and believe me when i say i spoil him , my parents are adamant about only giving them digit treats max a day but let ' s just say at digit he can have as many as he wants . and thanks for the advice on the cbd i ' ll try to find some that isnt in a capsule and see if it he looks better .
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

4. i have been exploring him a lot looking for things i may have missed and seeing what i can do with him , but he still feels like trash . unless someone finds some move or tech that i ' m not using or don ' t know or something , i think he will just be garbage again .
   (ID: 7cf18036f93dc6fc68e7a501c52e0ff5501b36e5)

5. aw i ' m glad you found him ! and i love the name cyrus !
   (ID: 2d26439362b22d8737b6d2a810c70fc3b9a3ddaa)

6. ok . i  ll save up for him . are any of the other faction wars characters worth getting ?
   (ID: c5b665e8ba18adb2125a557bd8ecbb0654907c67)

7. can farm him if i want to . but am definitely not going to do it  reason being i ' ve had zero use for his int version in over a year i don ' t have those teams . so gemming or even trying it out for chopperman rewards , nope , i ' m not sold .
   (ID: 7fcc718a0deaa03007701b64ad8fab54212a326a)

8. i  ll double check with him and see how it goes , thank you !
   (ID: 8d5aac58a9c3a7e883f9e90df39dc5ab7c36de53)

9. i honestly don ' t think he needs any rework , if you are looking for a counter , hold still during the duration of his drone . it ' s that simple . if you get rushed and have to move then that was probably the point of the activation of the done .
   (ID: 52733f5273fb099705b2a9e455932c48dae3d6b0)

10. happened to me as well . same exact players . was wondering what would happen if i moved them around . i have not touched him , so i don  t know if you can move him back .
   (ID: d5ff87b3b0a008d93a655ee4d43e9da3b5db7984)

11. i don ' t think you can message him unless he follows you
   (ID: b6c3e540255084641f0e148a3992d9113c560f0b)

12. i keep trying to do this but there is almost never time for me to hit him and when i try he always does a spin attack and i can very rarely hit him without him hiting me
   (ID: 2c1d97aa622f6ad7ec3a9aad9285dd4ec1e1f28d)

13. if you see below , he said he doesn ' t have any mods . so there goes that . so again your issue and his are completely different . or exactly the same  bad drivers or dying video card .
   (ID: ef02e812d417ba40d4b3e2f97601e54e4a68c5c5)

14. he ' s definitely lucky you were there when he lost his family . you also seem to be very lucky to have found him . he ' s so damned adorable .
   (ID: c3b51ad627b2162cac848c7fadd53da61827346a)

15. call him . it would mean so much to him . being in similar position , i know it would !
   (ID: 39ad1ed2bdf42527fd153f3d4be927df170fc195)

16. can it wait for a bit ? my dad ' s in the middle of some calibrations .
   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

17. thank you  cute cat . i appreciate you , have a great day .
   (ID: 4f350b59a80efc55c353f9527b99d8b6f4fc403d)

18. very cute ! why are you worried ?
   (ID: 827584bdc66e3c4749f22f0ad0a9420dc64ac2b5)

19. you did what you could . this is the only time i advocate getting a well bred puppy when you have children  it ' s the only way to ensure you know its temperament .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

20. that ' s awesome ! thank you for the knowledge . and that he is . which is why i was saying that if he had done this off the leash it would have been golden . but it ' s still pretty fantastic .
