8. happy apple , there are several thousand of them left over from the 70s in little antique stores and it literally just makes a pleasant jingle when the kid pushes it or touches it and then self balances like a giant weeble . will generally run between digit and digit bucks depending on where you live . you can also find them online on amazon or ebay but then you ' ll probably pay digit or digit plus shipping . fascinates them for hours at this age .
