   (ID: 3857340322f3015e4a24e7f6aa252884060f24ce)

2. talk to your uncle first , and then all of you can talk to your mom and convince her this is a good idea . i think she would take it more seriously if everyone talked together . good luck !
   (ID: e216f2a1e0d7d814b7ad58452ce6ac21e0b763fc)

3. go , why the hell not ? just be smart and have a plan to gtfo if everything goes south midway through . i think you should tell someone you ' re going , a friend an adviser or someone you can count on if it goes to shit . you will regret not going .
   (ID: f4e4929bb0bef09e7eb72aaccf20c2d9454729c7)

4. if your family barges in your room out of rudeness or to make shure you aren ' t doing anything , then i have the solution for you . hentai , but the weird stuff that you only jack off to when your really really horny . pull that up and your pants down then go to work on your mighty maul . when your family member barges in without knocking , look them in the eyes and yell at them to stop watching you masterbate maybe a good " this isn ' t alabama ! stop standing their ! " . bonus points if you nut while there still there . masterbating is a completely normal thing that everyone does , but it ' s not normal to watch your fam do it . so it ' s really effective at getting them to knock . and if they take off your door , then do it without headphones so that they can hear and when they complain , comment on how they " want to watch so might as well help them hear it too "

5. id tell each soul they get a chance at getting out by telling them to spend the digit  at the hellmart down the hellwayits a false hope , they cant leave . if they spend their money wisely . they can get outnot ! , and if they buy the wrong things they have to stand on whatever it is they bought for eternity . no leaving your small space , no sitting , no touching , no eating , or drinking  only talking . i make the rules if im satan ! the double edged sword here is that they are in hell and they deserve to be there . so the attempt at getting out on a shopping spree at the hellmart is ignorant , hence their damnation . if they are knowing of their hell status they might just buy some comfortable slippers and continue to act like the jerks they always were but with slippers on and pissing off the ignorant peoples choices , who are standing on potatoes and tool kits . classic hell . lol id let them fued it out while i page through hell on my helldesktop pc . if they start to enjoy theirselves id just dump some lava on them good times being satan !

6. don ' t say shit , don ' t act nervous , don ' t consent to shit unless u actually have nothing to hide , and stick to ur story like white on rice
   (ID: 472084017072e7ced5fed0827bae57ba801d9b7d)

7. get you daughter to do a short show and tell type talk . she can bring in photos , adoption certificates etc to help explain to her classmates what adoption is . you could go along and answer questions afterwards .
   (ID: e78c9eb3b69138ff8337dd896bc5bb1e02fc6559)

8. kinda of an asshole ? i can see being concerned that your film might not qualify for the lgbt festival but if it  s just about you being straight  chill . no one is going to think you  re gay and it  s not like your gay colleagues don  t attend straight festivals you would feel more comfortable at . if you  re not experienced with the lgbt community , that  s cool , but keep in mind straight people are usually welcome to any event so long as they  re nice ! you might even have fun .

9. that ' s what i thought , go and let them see how sick you are but risk getting others sick and look selfish too . i ' m not sure .
   (ID: 8797828a745ecd521e3b219ff004d26777b4f4f7)

10. i did , it was alright . your mileage will definitely vary with how into your partner you are and  or how much you like big parties . if you ' re just going with friends , then i hope you like fancy parties , else you won ' t get much out of it . if you ' re really into the digit  digit  howevermany people you ' re taking as dates though and enjoy romance then yeah it ' s pretty romantic . it ' s not cheap , though , so consider how much a formal dance setting and a fancy dinnerdate appeals to you , because that ' s about all there is to it .

11. it depends how close i am to the person . if i ' m very close and i value their happiness above my own comfort i would tell them digit  . painful as it is they are better off . get evidence if you can , they may not believe you .
   (ID: e0a46a0dc8fa303b4f52545ef88afe4d8f63943b)

12. i  m trying to word this carefully and please tell me if i get it wrong . do you think your family would be more sad if they felt like you couldn  t come to them ? they would probably find out eventually and then wonder what they could have done better . if your worried about your family i would think of that . sorry if this is worded wrong .
   (ID: 09ceeb62f2a165a9c38283d43984e8e6f6f5580e)

13. i don ' t do stand up lol , but i ' d bring friends that way you have real incentive not to fuck up to avoid embarrassment . but at the same time that could make you more nervous so it ' s up to you and how confident you think you can be up there

14. find a small spot with no stool to stand and give the bartender a  digit from the get go . chances are he will treat you as a vip and you will be taken care of all night .

15. me and my brother went to this wedding . my brother doesn ' t drink , and he was bored . so he decided he would pretend like he ' s drunk . so he sit with other digit friends on a table by the dance floor . they started yelling thing like " how does it go now " and " wait for it " before the drop on every song that the dj played . this went on for almost one hour before the three of them got bored with that as well and stopped doing it . i can ' t decide if i wanted to die or to kill them . put yourself in the bride ' s shoes , three idiots ruining the wedding party out of boredom . geez .

16. my husband and i don ' t " celebrate " birthdays or christmas . i wouldn ' t say that we " don ' t celebrate anything at all " though . we celebrate moments that matter to us , and we make memories as a family . we love nature and animals , so we take a lot of camping trips and hike . we love being by water and bird watching . we dislike being around large groups of people , so holiday shopping and wrapping and gift giving has always stressed us out . now that we don ' t live by any family we realized we don ' t have to celebrate it anymore and feel much happier around the holidays now . we still make a big deal out of our son ' s birthday for his sake , but that ' s about it .

17. the best thing to do is participate with your family throughout the entire process . that is what makes having a family meal together so enjoyable . yes , help set the table . you can serve the food or maybe someone else does that while you or another pours drinks  water . the entire idea is that it is a family gathering and all participate from start to finish . most families find that certain people do certain roles . my mom does the cooking and my dad cleans up , but just last night after the big meal , it was my mom and i cleaning up together while dad was getting an activity we had planned together . we had fun cleaning up together . enjoy being with your family throughout the entire meal and day .

18. first of all , people can dress like whatever they want . this is a free country . nobody likes sjw tumblr  cucks and nobody cares if you ' re offended . second , if a child has a nut allergy , they should just tell the person with the candy . i ' m sure they ' d be more than happy to give them something they can actually eat . finally , as someone with autism , do not engage in their conversation . that ' s fucking dangerous . i will talk about batman for several hours if you let me . just pretend to be mildly interested and politely end the conversation when the child starts droning on . that is all .

19. dude , these guys could beat you up if you look at them funny , you think they ' ll use logic and rational thinking if you actually wear colors and throw gang signs at them like you ' re hot shit ? that would be provocation and an insult in their eyes , even if they know you ' re just pretending and not actually a gangbanger . of course they could just laugh at you and move on , but i wouldn ' t take the risk lol .
   (ID: a80b8bc356414690d849369456d68876c95d5518)

20. there is a whole group of kids who like to mess with me in school . i  m too shy to say anything back though .
