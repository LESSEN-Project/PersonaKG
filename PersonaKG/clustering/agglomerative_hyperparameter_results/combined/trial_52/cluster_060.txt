6. the best thing is not to " find a trick to fool yourself into not buying things " but to look how much money you earn in one month and don ' t spend more than that . it is irrelevant how much your credit card lets you spend . what matters is how much you earn .

9. true happiness is eternal reunion with god . it is what we seek that will complete us . desire for power , wealth , possessions or other worldly things above the desire for god is the nature of sin . when we choose these things , we are misdirecting our love for god . in the afterlife , god respects our choices and the afterlife is the perfection of them . the true punishment of hell is the absence of god , the only thing that would truly make us happy . all the other earthly distractions that we choose in life are meaningless there .
   (ID: 7da53707a39963b12b6e7c5fea7a54f263d0cf17)
