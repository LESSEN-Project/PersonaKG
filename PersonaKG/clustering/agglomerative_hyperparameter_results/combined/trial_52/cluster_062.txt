3. i ' m digit  would love to cosplay . i ' ve seen some online images of costumes people have made  it looks so amazing  fun . something like elizabeth from bioshock infinite or elsa from frozen . but i ' m probably too old to start  would probably be called mutton dressed as lamb if i dressed as these younger women . i have no idea if cosplay existed when i was in my 20s in the early ' 90s when the internet was a noisy slow dial  up affair , but if it did i wish i had known about it . it looks so fun . especially steampunk . i ' d love to go steampunk . but at my age i ' d probably look ridiculous .
