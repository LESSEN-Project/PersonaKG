5. no . don ' t look through it . there are child proof profiles you can create to make sure they don ' t buy stuff online or watch porn . but that ' s not snooping . there are some things you can do to make sure nothing messed up happens . trust is important , so when you show your kids that they can talk to you about anything without you blowing the top off it , they ' ll share things with you regardless .

6. yta you ' re such an asshole it makes me angry . firstly you are absolutely invading his privacy by going through his computer , how would you like it if someone kept going through your computephone you ' d think it was an invasion of your privacy . secondly you need to talk to your children about sending them to see counsellors and such . also you are the one who needs help please dear god for the love of your son take a parenting course with your husband because the counsellor would probably agree with your son .
