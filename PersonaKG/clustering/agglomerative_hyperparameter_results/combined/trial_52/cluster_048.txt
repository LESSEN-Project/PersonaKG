1. i gotta ask how did you get a pic of your landlords wife ' s pussy ?
   (ID: 1afb7597077681179430af152997f04fd73ba0ee)

2. nta . you have explained you it makes you uncomfortable and she is not backing down from it , that makes me suspicious , especially the sharing of a hotel room . you are well within your bounds to not be okay with a situation like this , but not to forbid her from going which you apparently aren  t . she should be more aware of your feelings
   (ID: a428ebec68dc8bb1dccfb778bb32844c5677e265)

3. maybe invite her to the park ? other than that i have nothing .
   (ID: cc3d4f2be41112acacb92d09090db0e1f8d7e387)

4. dude yta she sounds like she lives alone in her apartment so why in the absolute fuck would you take all that food to your family . if you live with your family they feed you don ' t they ? and honestly why would one person make a ton of food . hmm . maybe it ' s because they want leftovers . dude if you manage to stay in this relationship you better count your blessings .
   (ID: de9f62a8114c08877e3a53460027d9810f5f3912)

5. i have a better idea . why not go and have sex instead ?
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

6. i would stuff someone in there with you . no one should be alone on valentine ' s day .
   (ID: d6e89a045ccd97a556ff87527d8a08a8e3c89fc1)

7. and when i say plans . i mean these plans would have been made way back when they were fuck buddies . as in . " hey man i really enjoy you and the sex is great . i know we will go our separate ways . but no matter what , or no matter who we ' re with . we will always fuck . deal " then some years later . boom here she is . " hey buddy , been thinking about you and how much i enjoy you . come visit me in amsterdam " are you ok with that ?
   (ID: fa749ff7262da656e34f21f4b902bd5287bf224d)

8. are you kidding me ? holy crap , i ' d take you , the kid and dogs and leave for the entire evista . or make him go stay with her while shes there also i ' d be thinking about if you want to live with thing long term
   (ID: ee2906681b3174a80cefe2bcfb40bd3a110c1b29)

9. that ' s just my sense of humour . where ' s the fun if we ' re all going to go around acting like grandmothers ?
   (ID: 04b12cbc989702ae4909382de2ac53409fddbbf4)

10. i don ' t know how i could give it to her , though . my room is the only place where the dogs can be separated from which sucks
   (ID: 448fa72755c2d77f67b820a9620d09e9d4573816)

11. i know i have no control over her life , but im going to be spending quite a bit of time there , as she is my girlfriend . and it ' s not just that i don ' t like the guy . he actually wants to fight me because i made my girlfriend mad once . i genuinley dont think she ' s safe living there with him .
   (ID: e3561bdda3e6ea0d1b0ca099b5f947cf7e037b3a)

12. this is definitely not a good idea . your points are all very valid ones , but the most important one of all is that you aren ' t comfortable with it . period . that ' s the point you need to get across . you can ' t be happy living that way , and your home needs to be your sanctuary . a place where you feel safe and secure . good luck .
   (ID: 87dcb06b0e31b35730fe93ce7dcbef85e6078b40)

13. sitting in my neighbours house , they  re unreasonable at the best of times so i can  t imagine it would be a good situation .
   (ID: c391065478603a686531cbdd50568136a5e14508)

14. I own a roommate.
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

15. i ' m single , why would i need my own flat ? once i meet some girl and we decide to live together i will think about getting our place , till then why pay for rent and all of the taxes and have to cook ? just so my friends would have another place to have parties at ?
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

16. i lived alone for a bit . that guy was a dick .
   (ID: 000804102a722a64dab51502693ae73a9773ff5c)

17. I live in with asshole guy.
   (ID: e3a7bbfa5fde0a706f721c3dc5055b3a8963f79f)

18. if i were her boyfriend and she was adamant about visiting an ex on another continent i would wish her a great trip and i would break up with her . this is terrible . she ' s not only visiting him , but sleeping in the same room as him ? and what if she gets cold ? can they cuddle " just as friends " too ? i couldn ' t handle this .
