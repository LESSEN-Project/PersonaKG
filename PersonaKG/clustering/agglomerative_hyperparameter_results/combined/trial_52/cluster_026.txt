   (ID: 58245e8d537b9e7b6d76cc6a9919ea776e4ef6f0)

3. you should have heard her speech over the weekend . i kid you not . she said stuff like there has been an orgy of spending . , the gov ' t has spent it ' s wad , then using other words like penetration . all the while someone in the crowd calling her a hottie . there is something seriously wrong with this woman .
   (ID: f76420437c1e4fb2e8ba8a9e9b0e116c7fc513ab)

4. i prefer someone that evolves with the times than an old grumpy lady that sticks to its old grumpy lady principles just because it ' s her principles . you ' re constructing a retarded dichotomy of people having to be either completely unprincipled or grumpily insistent on principles just for the sake of it . how about having incorruptible principles that don ' t change with the seasons , simply because they ' re actually based on sound ethics and reason ? when i look at hillary clinton , i do not see a person who merely changes her mind as new information becomes available to her , but rather someone who will argue for one thing today and for the opposite tomorrow based on nothing but the calculated intent to gain popularity . when i look at her , i see a gaping political vacuum , a politician without honest ideals or virtues , a teleprompter  reading shell of a human being , driven not by conviction , not by the urge to change , let alone improve anyone else ' s lives , but by hunger for self  gratification in the form of winning the biggest popularity contest in the world . tl  dr  fuck her .

6. i can ' t see how it couldn ' t be . the jacket was  digit ? i saw it reported as digit sterling from a high street shop zara i think . how many  digit jackets does she get papped in ? how did it even get in her wardrobe ? would she even set foot in a ' zara ' ? wouldn ' t her personal shopper be practically shot on the spot for suggesting it ? then there ' s the timing . if you want to make a cynical statement about journalism , maybe wear the jacket on one of the fairly frequent occasions when you ' re dead  batting journalist ' s questions in the wake of some new presidential gaffe  perceived gaffe . wearing it when she did and in that context cannot have been a mistake . don ' t forget , these people and their staff positively choose clothing that is appropriate to an event . they don ' t just get dressed and then look at their diaries . ' oh  it ' s a holocaust survivor ' s dinner  better go with a sombre suit and dark tie ' etc . ' oh it ' s a youth event  something jazzy . ' you get the idea .
   (ID: 54c02bf73569d6b7f5a88c3d841a214eee1a4d14)

7. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .
