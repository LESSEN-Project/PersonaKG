1. here you . keep this in mind when drawing . i also used to make the mistake of making the head too big . oh yeah use shapes . my biggest tip for you would be to draw something that you ' re not good at aka getting out of your comfort zone and also trying out new artstyles but this artstyle is cool too . also you should read some manga preferably one that has a more realistic artstyle such as fist of the northstar or kengan asura . that ' s how i learned proportions and anatomy . oh yeah and don ' t worry about failing with things such as perspective . art takes time .
   (ID: 22864f9484c3c6d7f8c8dac79c58ea32865eb794)

2. if keeping your mind and hands occupied is helpful to you like it is me , you can make that work for you . learning an instrument is an amazing way to keep your anxiety at bay . and unlike games , you will gain endless social benefits and confidence that will help you tremendously !
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

3. she  s a great artist . it looks just like it did in the show . tell her a bunch of internet strangers thank she  s cool .
   (ID: 6e7cd3892c49f30c5999e4b7337f95be97df0c1b)

4. it does take time . my friend helped me and now i ' m pretty good at the game . thing is my friends were exactly the same .
   (ID: 420a86ecfb9d645349db591746d0cdeba4b68f37)

5. i know that op draws really well . i have seen his watercolor and it ' s really good . what i was trying to say is getting out of your comfort zone with drawing is a good thing and it helps improving . i mean to say that op should exercise drawing the things which he ' s not really good at . i said this because a lot of the characters he draws have really similar faces and can only be differentiated by hair and such . i meant to say  hey draw something different next time . people can get bored if you do the same thing . i didn ' t mean to sound rude . sorry .
   (ID: 22864f9484c3c6d7f8c8dac79c58ea32865eb794)

6. ahh i understand , but you know why i  m saying  bad  ? because i  m surrounded by friends and family that aren  t into the art creation thing so i have to make something  good  so they enjoy it as much as i do because i love to share my work with people , also this is like the  mascot  of my brand that i  m trying to make so i  m trying to stay away from copying people because i don  t want any problems or any legal issues with anyone you know ?
   (ID: fe4ddb52a6f20437e3f3c6003b775cb72c3d048f)

7. nooice ! that ' s pretty much what i do . i can draw a mean circle ! and squares  it ' s over hahaah
   (ID: 555615a7b22f65cadd2e223e2e891e540623f3a4)

8. i apreciate that you think my art is worth stealing but i really don ' t mind . i don ' t make art for the clout , i do it to practice and get better . it ' s only one drawing , i can easily make another .
   (ID: 8f5b0c902ce9c2bf19ecdb9205cb3d9f2a7c14fa)

9. you guys are all kind of mean . there  s aways room to improve . i think it  s better than what i can draw .
   (ID: 870d9d198f856764296262192823c935f1daf781)

10. you should probably practice more if it is something you want to do though . that ' s the thing . when i tried drawing porn , anatomy came naturally to me . like . it wasn ' t hard at all .
   (ID: bf371725cb05580378dda9b1fdb005417049b32b)

11. for me , i  m not an  artist  per se , but i am pretty good at art . i just see the idea , and look up pictures to help with details . an example would be a dog , you see all of the main parts and some parts you want to add your own flair to , but stuff like the fur you have to look up online to get a good picture .
   (ID: 6710bef520e10a3963d2983d4b36ef411e442f22)

12. so what if they ' re not the highest quality ? op is proud of them and i think they look nice , so just stop being a dick about it
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

13. yta you don  t have to be a dick about things and from what i  ve seen in this thread i feel sorry for the girl i would if said nta but from how far up your arse you  ve been on this thread i doubt her work was that poor quality
   (ID: 77ab4860c32a7084ca81fd91302df6690ce56731)

14. just takes practice , i just drawn a lot in my free time as a kid and now its kinda stuck with me
   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

15. " the reason you can ' t put effort into anything is because you ' re scared of being disappointed when you do learn your own ' size ' . but it ' s okay to be disappointed . once you know your own size , you ' ll finally know what you should do . and once your understand yourself , what you want to do gradually comes into focus "  digit gatsu no lion . dare to learn and courage , courage to know yourself . we subconsciously avoid things that may damage our identity or conception . but sometimes , it ' s good to delve into that and learn your weakness . knowing your limits signals room for your growth . tells you the parameters of your game , and helps you form controls for your experiment . but , if you are afraid , remember  your limits can be your principles as well . it ' s all a matter of interpretation , but you must dare to attempt learning about yourself .

16. i ' m not an artist myself , but the best advice for writing generally applies to drawing  do it a lot .   x200b  seriously , actually drawing  writing  participating in your creative outlet is the only effective way to get better at it . you can learn from other sources , sure , but in the end it ' s still you that has to draw  write  create if you want to get better at it . not everything will be a masterpiece , and you ' ll probably wind up creating something you ' re not proud of or that you feel wasn ' t as good as it could ' ve been  but that doesn ' t mean other people didn ' t appreciate it , and it doesn ' t mean you should stop .   x200b  never give up , never surrender !
   (ID: 42817db6a2880fe4df5d65636e25385c67c89bb1)

17. dude i literally just said " they ' re not the highest quality " cant you just fucking chill and stop being so childish over this ?
   (ID: ca0db6d2dfa4f61af38e432f4e9220ab11344229)

18. i appreciate the offer , but i ' m trying to learn how to do this . do you have any advice you could offer me instead ? your song is very cool . i like how it ' s pretty stripped down but doesn ' t feel empty or lacking in anything . very chill
   (ID: cb830ff94bb369e5db655e15ee074f392a52c14f)

19. damn i would never be that good at art
   (ID: 480e1d5457cca32a54c00398823abca7aae20b86)

20. you should watch the videos before you criticize , otherwise you look dumb . i don  t doubt that you are , i just think you  d like to make a good impression here .
