3. yes , travel would be impossible unless you were rich . why do you think no one would maintain them ?
   (ID: fbed02b3d7caf00e8d1533f452f8951cf390df73)

4. you can tell by the map , if there are a group clustered together far from the street than they are being hoarded . or if they say last ridden is digit days ago but last located was digit minutes ago those are hoarded . anything that says last located longer than a few hours is probably gone . you can change the search setting in the bottom right corner . i  ve gotten lucky with one  digit bird that looked like it was in a garage on the map , but was actually behind a dumpster . typically any yellow and red ones are hoarded though . if you report them as hoarded or missing they will disappear from your map .

9. off topic about this picture but on topic about the bikes do these bikes have better baskets ? like are the holes on the side of the basket huge because the baskets are useless if you wanna keep your phone or anything in there because they will just slide out . like today i used one in miramar and i had a can of iron bru import from scotland i think and it slid out the side of the basket and pierced a hole in the side causing it to squirt out this is one of the older bikes

10. they are on the menu as a breakfast item in japan . the  frankburger " in the top row , second from the left to be honest , as much as i love hot dogs , i haven ' t been impressed with dogs at hamburger shops . burger king ' s dogs aren ' t very good and neither are a  w ' s . i can ' t imagine mcdonald ' s would be much better .

11. parting them out ? it seems like the cars that sit there are really common cars . maybe they use them for parts . like a mini  junk yard .
