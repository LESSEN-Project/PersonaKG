5. you  re amazing ! i say this as a mom of two kids in church and having years of practice with them ! twins ! bless you for even coming out of the house let alone trying something new ! i have been through rcia  it was the kids that were finally the tipping point for me actually husband is what is termed a  cradle catholic  it was a good experience not only for learning but also developing some real bonds with people in the church . check the  parish bulletin  if they have one  sometimes they have mom nights which is nice to make friends  have play groups with kids of similar ages . mass is great , the community that can form around it is amazing . welcome red  heart

8. my husband and i just moved here last year . we unfortunately aren ' t as close to the congregation as we ' d like to be yet . but we ' re getting there . it ' s just that my health issues and his have gotten in the way , as well as us being able to find jobs that allow us time to go to meetings . but from what we ' ve seen , the congregation is very nice !
