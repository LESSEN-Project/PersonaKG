Total from this dataset: 1495

1. oh it is several things . the first thing you do is completely cut off all of the energy vampires in your life . try to figure out if somebody is making you feel bad . maybe they aren ' t trying to . that being said , many people are subtly abusive and you might not know that what you are feeling is not you , it is somebody else ' s toxic emotions that they have projected on to you . learn about adaptogenic herbs and supplements and start an adaptogenic stack . loneliness sometimes is just stress , fatigue or a chemical imbalance . i recommend , n acetyl l tyrosine rhodiola rosea , ashwagandha  ksm  digit , tumeric  curcuminoid with pipeline , magnesium citrate , fish oil and vinpocitine . make sure you are listening to positive people , positive music , positive messages and are engaged in plenty of self affirmation . then you want to reach out to people . being lonely means that you have to project onto others what you wish to receive so you have to give the right people your time , love and attention . loneliness sometimes isn ' t helped by being around more people even though i recommend this but is more ameliorated by improving your relationship with yourself . maybe you need to be a better friend to yourself ? do you think you should read more ? maybe exercise  jog  lift more ? do you think you should listen to more music or get out more ? do you need to clean or decorate your apartment ? do an all the above approach and remember that you can always give yourself permission to feel loved and cared for without a material manifestation to validate it ! often people feel warmth , generosity , compassion and admiration first , and then the outside world reflects that feeling . try to exercise your mind with meditation and being to dim certain thoughts and emotions . if you can fake happiness , after a while it becomes a muscle that builds over time .
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

2. but you won ' t know you ' re not feeling it . your anxiety is all anticipatory , which in this case is just you completely screwing yourself because if your worst case scenario happens and there ' s nothing , then you ' ll never be aware of it . it reminds me of when people have a bad car accident and wake up and can ' t remember anything  i often wonder if it really happened . i mean , i know it really happened , but if you go through something horrible and can ' t remember it , does it count as going through it ? trees falling in woods , and all that . maybe too much pseudo  ephedrine too
   (ID: bb79791c3753a1fc8ece696b3835b0f59ddccc90)

3. its the same as when you ' re in a really bad mood you think fuck everyone and everything sucks . when you ' re on m everything ' s bliss ans you love everything . of course nobody means everything they say , they are extremely conditioned under the influence or the drug
   (ID: af764f37d4a75bdb762464b079f842d6af0847b7)

4. it ' s you and whatever you can ' t see in a state where nothing can be seen
   (ID: 2db14c004e6ef125f85aa3678978a5718eebd11a)

5. i haven ' t been in your spot , but i ' ve been similarly low in different ways . i know what it ' s like to feel as if you have no way of ever being anything close to " normal " your low point becomes all you know , all you can imagine , and all you can accept . i assure you , though , there are always ways out . do you have any family or friends who can help you ? are there any mental health facilities near you that you could go to possibly inpatient ? it may not be significant , but i should note that foot fetishism is not your fault in any way . it ' s how you ' re wired . you just have a case of actual fetishism , not just a kink . i won ' t tell you to not be hard on yourself . i know it ' s not that simple  i ' ve been there . i want you to be aware that you ' ve made much more progress than you realize in even asking how you can change , though . the best advice i can give you as a nonprofessional , but as someone who has also been at " rock bottom " as you described yourself elsewhere , is to start small . if you try to tackle it all at once , you ' ll continue to be overwhelmed .
   (ID: 372e357e1e3acd2a4dea24aa56a5900a539a9e59)

6. it can be frustrating when people use depression to excuse all their failings . as someone who myself is in constant battle with mental health , i know as soon as i use it as an excuse it  s game over for me . i  ll join the other failed victims . so many amazing people who succeed in spite of depression
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

7. i smoke literally every day , and as a disabled veteran , i ' m about as pro  weed as you ' ll ever find . however , i don ' t think your friend is using marijuana in a healthy way . if he needs it to keep himself off hard drugs , then he has a drug problem and the weed is a part of it . your friend sounds like he ' s in a really dark place in his life , and i hope you encourage him to find the help he needs .
   (ID: 4f65e5402391c052d2d3e7a2a4d73b01ea1db203)

8. a nicotine craving only lasts for min at the time , after that you feel normal again . always remember that you just have to resist for digit min as soon as the craving beginns . and also try to avoid areas where you typically smoked or your friends do .
   (ID: e5a44ccd2ce03ba23fc6a9fd527ffc5440b8088c)

9. you gotta do what they say man if you wanna make the most of your situation
   (ID: c7b03500469d01fff7d63dc804418c265ca4c838)

10. i would definitely invest in drugstore products first so you don ' t blow too much money as you ' re just figuring things out . for foundation , i would recommend doing research on reviews of certain products you see in store . take things into consideration like  how much coverage do you like ? matte or dewey ? how long do you need it to last ? what ingredients could your skin possibly be sensitive to ? using this tatic can definitely help you find whats best for you , considering how many products are out there ! don ' t be discouraged if something fails , either . you can always return and exchange products if you so not like the product . i ' ve returned countless makeup products as of now , and it really helps eliminating products i don ' t like ! good luck op !
   (ID: 448fa72755c2d77f67b820a9620d09e9d4573816)

11. two or three times a month i dream about very dirty public restrooms , or stalls with no doors , or toilets up on pedestals . these are extremely vivid and realistic dreams and i remember several details about most of them . i didn  t know how common it was until my dad said he had the same dream , so i did a google search and it turns out it  s fairly common . something about being insecure and vulnerable .
   (ID: c0c5a7c74c41387a99afab68d3e9fe0bfab4b8b9)

12. i was summoned by mother earth a few years ago , but i actually live in digit on mars . if i only knew how to get back , although those weird dark cookies with white stuff between them taste good .
   (ID: 3ee5f4db2879b83a843467f289ac369565b8b3ae)

13. so sad you are not a ghost .
   (ID: 3171687207fd659f146afaa305fc2ad7b92ea52b)

14. this is not entirely true . it is in my case . but for the majority of people , they decide to screw around for fun and suddenly become addicted . i don ' t even have an addictive personality , i just like how drugs feel .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

15. i have both eyes , though i am almost completely blind in my right eye . for me , it ' s only affected me on little things . getting made fun of for my lack of depth perception or inability to park a car , for example . also some insecurity because if you pay close enough attention , you can see that it actually looks different than the working eye and is a little off center . but i ' ve never seen it as part of my identity or my biggest hurdle . i actually forget about it most of the time , as my working eye sees just fine and it doesn ' t affect my day to day life . i also like to joke about it , and make people really uncomfortable when they didn ' t know . interestingly , i relate to your post for an entirely different reason . for me , the thing that has always made me " broken " is my upbringing . i had a terrible childhood and the effects of it have followed me into my adult life . it effects the way i interact with people , the way i form relationships , and the way i view myself . it always feels like there is a missing piece of me emotionally and that i will never " fit in " with the people who were raised with some sort of decent support system . the same way that you relate most of your experiences to your missing eye , i relate most of mine to my family background . i ' ve built a life for myself . i ' ve got a doctorate degree and a career at a very young age . i go to therapy and i try to work on all the trauma . but i ' m never going to be like " everybody else " and that ' s something i ' ve had to come to terms with . holidays , birthdays , and important moments in my life are always going to be hard . i have great supportive friends , but that ' s not the same thing as having a family . i don ' t know that i have any advice for you , but i appreciated this post a lot . it reminds me that , even if nobody has my exact experience , we can all share similar feelings of inadequacy over different experiences .
   (ID: 022767076c8e9ed224fa7eeaf7db901f4f85512b)

16. i think about my own death constantly . i ' m faced with it everyday at work . i ' ve thought about it a lot .
   (ID: 1b15fd08311192b471933a314f66dc758a923c02)

17. if your parents haven ' t kicked you out yet , then they clearly want you to survive . that said , you are actively boosting their morale just by surviving . why else would they let you use their resources for survival ? by the way , you can put down this " i ' ll kill myself " charade , now . we all know that you wouldn ' t have posted here if you truly wanted to . you know it , as well . i ' d recommend depression if it ' s any consolation  i and most of my digit and digit year old friends don ' t have careers , either .
   (ID: f67f4ffc3afd37a9ece4ede606682407c9b920b1)

18. i dont believe anyone truly gets over their first love , its an internal battle but you ' ll eventually realize you love the idea of him rather than the person . the biggest thing i noticed is even when you were madly inlove with eachother , you were always going to him , mentally and physically . you seemed to be putting more into the relationship than him and thats not a good thing . a healthy relationship requires balance , obviously sometimes the scale is tipped but it takes you both to balance it back out . my advice is to live in the moment rather than the past . its not uncommon to miss him , frankly it would be inhuman to completely try to erase him from your memory . what you need it more balance , but for yourself . dont let your emotions and memories tip your scale , keep your new memories and your new emotions in check on the other end . meet new people , focus on your school work , and ensure you ' re traveling forward rather than backwards . he has moved on , maybe not with the best intentions but you need to move on as well . try to open your heart to the possibity of him being happy without you and you being happy without him . if you can both realise you ' re happy without one another , you will finally have some closure . a stepping stone to happiness is forgiveness and remorse . know what you did to his current relationship and see what you can do to fix it . i hope you can take something from this . best of luck .
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

19. i ' m digit and feel some of your pain . i like some peoples answers of oh just feel better thats all you need . some days isn ' t that easy . i don ' t have a bad life by any means but struggle to motivate myself to do fun stuff or even daily chores .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

20. people fear death because they haven  t completed something in their lives they want to do . find what it is that you want to do  change  start  finish you may still fear death , but you  ll find comfort in the completion of tasks
