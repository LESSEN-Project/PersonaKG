1. if you ' re looking for a good one for children i would recommend kmaa on armour rd . the sensei there is very friendly and great with kids ! adults attend as well and there are specific classes for just adults after the kids go home where you get more physical contact and work with weapons . sensei alf is the main teacher and he ' s great with kids . sensei pete is also great with kids but he brings different styles into the club and works well with running adult classes ! there ' s a lot of partner work , escaping from holds and what not . it ' s not a competitive dojo which makes it better if you are looking for practical skills on how to defend yourself

2. i have heard him take the calls of a couple gay women . i remember one was due to a custody battle with their adopted son , but they were never married . ouch . i hear dave say ,  as an evangelical christian .  a lot , so i think we can fill in the lines on where he stands on the subject of gay marriage . however , i  m sure you can take the class together , it would depend on the coordinator and if the others in the class make you feel comfortable there or not . most of the time fpu is offered at churches , but sometimes you can find one at a community center or something if that  d make you more comfortable , if you  re worried about judgy church people .
