15. don  t let other people  s perceptions effect you . why do they work digit  hours a week or whatever ? seems like an absolute waste of time as well if you  re viewing things that way . what  s important is that you fill your time with things you enjoy . life is that simple , but people love to make it complicated and project that onto people living differently than they are . jealousy plays a part in that often . do you and worry about you and anyone who has negative words  thoughts about it can screw off . i  m unemployed as well as my partner works enough for us and we are thrilled with the set up but get a ton of hate from others outside our relationship . we know what matters so we ignore their negativity and the negativity that creeps up in my own mind sometimes too .
