1. yeah like it changed to the boy somehow being alive ? sorry if i ' m spoiling but the movie is shit so it just made no sense and the plot twist was just shit
   (ID: 09635643777fe30eb3750faad0e2ea7a607f855c)

2. the overall monetization and and grinding you need to do to get some cosmetics and a few guns . if you don  t get the guns by the time the season ends you have to rely on rng from the caches . the gameplay has gotten boring and zombies hasn  t received many good updates besides the dlc maps . that  s how
   (ID: d53ad0bccb6d6f62bf1a4957708759d7b446498b)

3. i can ' t think of any , but that sounds super interesting ! let me know if you decide to create your own and i ' ll definitely join too .

   (ID: 20b71c431f98b1f88ec1b3e7ada79d31df65a8c2)

6. i didn ' t take offense , i did find it to be laughable though , worst marketing move of the year . so far .
   (ID: 95f6209d0c49920f0309625c4cec2ea88e4ae469)

7. i agree , but according to the avengers and rest marvel universe tesseract is the major source of energy with theoretically zero point extraction and helps converting energy into usable form and what they show is just a cube which just glows . invention of this tesseract by noble warrior heroes made marvel possible to create marvel universe . don ' t you think that marvel can do little better on what their stories are completely based on . or they could have chosen some different name . it ' s just my opinion , as a marvel fan , i just felt bad as the whole thing is just a fictionalizedand becoming super heroes is not possible yet . but creating an actual tesseract can help marvel to build other stories and which can also justifies current marvel movies . which can be a win  win  win !
   (ID: 498ec9e13eaa203d64a9b79260e2285867993564)

8. i don  t agree with this at all i  ve never struggled in skyrim . oblivion enemy scaling could be a bit annoying , but in skyrim ? what exactly do you have problems with ?
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

9. main character wise they are standalones , but world lore wise they are heavily linked , specially digit and inquistion . i would hold on playing dai and start with origins . i differ from the general consensus and actually like da2 a lot and think dai is just an ok game aside from the tresspasser dlc , which is phenomenal
   (ID: 127d601df381c9f971eae1e3fd42953571015813)

10. i used to be a hardcore minecraft fan back in , i dunno , digit or something . spent hours on that game . i remember playing the demo version of mcpe from my cousin ' s ipad . i fell in love instantly . i ' m a huge nerd for books , so after i found out about this website called " wattpad " , i decided to combine my two favorite things and read minecraft fanfics . looking back now , most of them were pretty bad , but for a digit year old , it was the shit . everyday i got off from school , i would log in and read till i grow bored . then , i met this guy named " radishologist " who wrote minecraft books , and surprisingly , his story wasn ' t terrible . so yeah , i decided to give it a shot and before i knew it , i couldn ' t stop reading . he made three books in total , and i read them all . on his third book , he asked his followers if any of them would like to be part of it . i was thrilled , and i quickly pm ' d him and gave him my character . it was pretty terrible . cliche name , cliche backstory , etc etc . but for a kid , it was the best thing ever . he agreed , and i became part of the book . i remember smiling like a doofus everytime i would read chapters with my character ' s pov . made me a little a proud about myself . after a few months , he posted another chapter . he said he was making a kik group chat for people to discuss about minecraft and stuff about his books . i didn ' t know what kik was at that time , but i found out . told him i wanted to join and he added me to the gc after that . we called it the " radish community " there , i met a lot of people . many of them were from america i live in the philippines , so it was pretty hard to fit in . eventually , the community grew and grew , and i started to feel more comfortable around people . i remember bragging to some of my classmates how i got " friends from all over the globe " and shit . they never really believed me though hahaha . i became close friends with a bunch of them . especially that radish guy . it was in that community where i had my first online gf . it didn ' t worked out , of course . had digit more online relationships after that , but ye they ended up badly . but we had fun . we talked a lot everyday . i also remember him hosting a bunch of " kik comps " where we do challenges and shit and the winner gets a follow from him on wattpad . i was a moron , so i usually just goofed around and never really won anything , but we didn ' t care . we were having fun . that was digit years ago . our chat ' s still alive , but a lot of guys left . radish dude and me still talk , but not as much . he doesn ' t write books anymore too . his wattpad account ' s still functioning , but barely . he stills logs in from to time , usually to give announcements , and the occasional updates , but that ' s about it . i follow him on insta though , and he ' s pretty busy with life . he ' s gonna go to college in a couple of years so he ' s trying to enjoy his senior years . we used to be huge . like digit  people gathering around and talking about minecraft and shit . now , we only have like digit people left . i left the chat once or twice , but i kept returning . couldn ' t left them behind . ya ' ll could argue that " online friends aren ' t real friends " , but this guys , i grew up with them . well , not technically , but they ' re a huge part of my childhood . i just hope that we can actually see each other in real life someday . haha , actually , one of us suggested that we should do that after we graduated college . ironic since she ghosted away after that and never really showed up anymore . i still talk to her on instagram , but it wasn ' t the same . todd , ana , salix , jazzy , glitch , leo , rebel , thomas , karim , aj , collin , andrew , basically anyone who were part of this , especially todd aka radish guy , if any of you are reading this , i just wanted to say thanks . thanks for everything . i know , i say that a lot but i really mean it . yeah , i act like a douche sometimes , and you guys probably think i ' m nothing but a heartless memer who shit on other people , but deep inside , i ' m really thankful . those comps , those memories we made , it was awesome . i really hope we ' ll still keep in touch , even if there are only like digit or digit of us left . wherever life takes us , i hope we ' ll still remember each other . thanks for being part of my life . i will really cherish our friendship forever . your pal , the  blue  droid

11. complete all kinds of snes games and find all hidden secrets and all sorts , all before the internet . now as an adult , i have to google where all the hidden exits are in super mario world . have no clue how digit year old me used to do it !
   (ID: 03bd0b4bb3465eba83e1c9a00af15f7b35f1ec6d)

12. yes bones is great , and so is chekov . i think kirk , spock , and uhura could have been chosen better . overall , the kelvin timeline is not at all what i want from star trek . too much action , and not very interesting or thought provoking . but , it is keeping trek alive , so there is still hope for better quality . my favorite of the digit is beyond , followed by digit , then into darkness .
   (ID: 47503483b65f94d9e176031a7c8a7bff26fdb36c)

13. if you don  t enjoy it and find no meaning from it at all from reading the book twice , then why are you attempting to force yourself to enjoy it through people who did ? if you didn  t like it then that should be the end of it , no ?
   (ID: e1864e983bbfa93f317cdda5086f1df7721adab8)

14. gta v can be pretty easy going if you have no interest in completing objectives . i know a lot of people who just like to goof around in that game since they are not too involved with gaming . i always thought it got old pretty fast but they never seemed to think so .
   (ID: 0c93ab3ec35cab16ded3445fcca7b6045c1dd147)

15. i do not enjoy the sound of it of course but it does give me some laughter especially because i know this fall wasn  t fatal .
