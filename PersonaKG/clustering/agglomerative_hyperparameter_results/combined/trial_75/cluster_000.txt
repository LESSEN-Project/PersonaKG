1. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

2. is there any way to take a dump on your own face ?
   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

3. honestly man , those long hard days at work are what got me through a lot . especially when you have to think about alot of things at work , it keeps your mind busy . i worked digit  digit hours a week at one point just to keep my mind at ease . theres nothing worse than sitting around by yourself , it ' s good to be out doing things . you ' ll find another girl , and you ' ll realize the error of your ways from the first relationship and you won ' t make those mistakes again
   (ID: dee1be637147c9065afbc159fbd3efc6ff54b847)

4. this is cheating . you should ' ve had a sit down , in  depth conversation with him . most likely , you mentioned it in passing when you knew he wouldn ' t be actively listening and used that to justify your actions . i don ' t believe for a second you weren ' t trying to be in some way sneaky about it . even in your post , you use the fact that " well , lots of other people do it too " as though other people ' s actions have any impact on that ' s acceptable in your relationship . you ' re married . you two must ' ve discussed what cheating meant prior to getting married . you cheated .
   (ID: 5a15ed606a86674cb48abaf9fee4375ff6bbff09)

5. similar ! i don  t care if my friends go without me but i do care when they insult me . i don  t really care who else insults me whether it be a stranger or family , but if my friends insult me i will think about it for at least two decades and become extremely insecure as a result of it .
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

6. i don ' t have experience with cheating parents or spouses , at least not that i ' m aware . i do agree with you that is wrong and harmful to both women . however , if i were in your shoes , i would have to ask myself some questions . first , what do you want to accomplish by speaking with your mom ? you clearly cannot change her behavior by talking to her about it , as you have tried that . secondly , what kind , if any , relationship do you want with her ? if you intervene in some way call the wife , confront the man , etc , you will be further alienating your mom . and lastly , can you live with this knowledge and not intervene if that is the only way to save your relationship with your mother ? if you answer these questions honestly and with great contemplation or not rashly , i believe you will know what course you should take . good luck !
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

7. thats completely unethical and if anyone found out , it would ruin his career . im not saying that you should attempt to do such a thing , but knowing that you got blackmail on him may give you the feeling of a bit more power over the situation . im sorry you had to deal with such a terrible therapist and your feelings are totally justified . perhaps you dont feel like you want to be a part of the dating scene for a while , but there are guys out there who do respect women and will respect your needs . the only reason i mention dating is because i imagine it  s easier to have s . o . you can talk to about your emotions than not . mutual hate makes for a great friendship anyways
   (ID: 0c93ab3ec35cab16ded3445fcca7b6045c1dd147)

8. while you are correct that i lack empathy , i am not a  nice guy  at all . just courteous . i don  t understand people who aren  t . and aren  t you a dude ? didn  t you just ask me if i smile at dudes in public too ? i give basically anyone who makes eye contact with me a quick smile . if they don  t return it , fine . if they actively attempt to be nasty back , i think they have some kind of problem . regardless of gender .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

9. gossiping is very entertaining if you have the right set of gals .
   (ID: cae6d1fb1a818280e66de4a71148560d2d217d70)

10. yeah , i guess i ' ll just talk to my girlfriend about it . that would be best if i think about it . this hetero  romantic thing sounds interesting though . i ' ll look into it ! thank you so much !
   (ID: 2971f819c4d7400b9fa7806434e9037b6af4dfae)

11. errr . not gonna like what i have to say , but , if you ' re only being nice to her in hopes she ' ll date you  doing things in hopes she ' ll date you , then getting pissed when she doesn ' t date you then you ' re not really a legit dude . you should wanna do nice things because you want to and they make you happy or because she reciprocates the friendship portion back as well  values  respects  appreciates it , or you ' ll resent her for what your efforts give but hers do not give back in a friendship aspect . not all girls up and leave their friends when they get a man . if she is a good friend then be a good friend back for that reason alone . if you find yourself resenting doing all the things you do because she doesn ' t want to date you , then you ' re kind of just like any other jerk in her life  she may be better off . if she treats you very nice , respects you  shows genuine friendship  thats just not enough because you want sex  a relationship then she ' s better off and you should peace out . i ' m not saying you are or are not either one . just explaining the options  reasoning here .
   (ID: 8285a776fd60b145ed2afc145cdf2b926b93ed8b)

12. this is a grump this is a grump while not so grump . any questions ?
   (ID: a63ea1e6bf1e972229635648a0b3371aeddb4f3d)

13. thanks man , really means a lot . i just want to make sure that you don ' t think there ' s something wrong with me . is it really normal that i don ' t feel any sexual urges even digit weeks after that experience ?
   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

14. it  s great to hear you accepting yourself ! that  s always the first step to being happy with who you are .
   (ID: 7a36b5607ec030b33a99723097f6d67b04c38d99)

15. take this time to learn about you . what are your hobbies and interests ? trying learning something , anything and become knowledgeable in it . that will give you some topics of conversation and help you find friends maybe girls too as you enjoy those hobbies . those guys you ' re jealous of . they probably think they are losers too  they just hide it better . don ' t be so hard on yourself !
   (ID: 0254dc2f43007419c5c3fd1e155e6bf15fce137d)

16. know yourself . find out what makes you unhappy and solve it .
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

17. making cute comments about parenting . or the men i know who are currently trying to pursue me , always talk about how much they love kids , want kids , want me and my child in their life . its like music to my ears but unfortunately for them , i ' m just not wanting a relationship at the moment .
   (ID: 91dc65ba6eef536f17becface16989de7f988dce)

18. doubt is normal , and hard to overcome . whether its you doubting her or you doubting yourself , the healthiest option would be to try . tell yourself you made the wrong  right choice and that you  ll go through with what you think is the best option . if you believe you made a mistake , make an honest attempt to mend it . if you believe it was the right choice then continue , continuing can be the hardest choice , and very painful , but if you go through and are able to move on and find someone new , i  m sure you  d be happy . so , whatever you do , be honest to yourself , doing that will help . especially in whatever relationship comes . and don  t be afraid of help , ask your parents or grandparents . they will have the most experience , and can give the most helpful advice , they know love and hate , but they also known you and im sure would do whatever they can to make you happy , which would include making the person that males you happy them  self happy .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

19. why do they want to kill their kids so bad ?
   (ID: df1ced988175856d5a5b468166271e5d777e4a3e)

20. it really is the best bet . and it really is relieving . i struggled with my sexuality for a long time until i realized that i really am pan . sometimes i  d be like , no i  m gay . others it  s , no i  m straight . then there  s the  am i bi ?  but then i was really into this trans dude so my sexuality was all over the place . i gave myself a few years to figure it out , i dated a couple people to see what it was like and i still talk to most of my ex  s , but after a while i now know what i am . i hope you find out who you are too grinning  face  with  smiling  eyes
