1. it ' s so fake , why do you care if it ' s taught ? waste of time and money .
   (ID: c978d968d1c4e9730afc6b7b09cbdd832546a06f)

2. well you might find this kind of interesting then . sympathy is logical because we can explain to you why the person is suffering or explain kindness is needed to someone going through hardship because of x , y  z . empathy is the spontaneous generation of what they ' re feeling . i honestly don ' t understand why people want  like empathy . if i ' m feeling bad about something the last thing i would want is for people around me to feel what i ' m feeling or be sad with me . to me that experience is my fault and i view it as a unnecessary burden i have cause others which would make me feel worse . but i know normal people say " misery loves company .
   (ID: df5213e759ef279850d575577da3967d8f71679c)

3. it  s not being  holier  than  thou  , all it  s doing is challenging how we think about the people around us . if you  re a good person , great ! keep on doing what you  re doing . you are the type of person the ad is calling on to call out inappropriate behavior . that  s all .
   (ID: 12803a9aad224d0537b68ab83a6cdc6a45d3160f)

4. i do not believe in the anthropomorphic view of god . i think that everything has a reason and the reason that the universe exists is god , but that god is likely nothing like what we could imagine , that it doesn  t listen to our prayers , and that there is likely no afterlife . perhaps god resides within the universal constants or something completely whacky compared to established religions . so theres a lot i don  t know or have an answer to , but i do think there is a reason that everything exists and that is what i believe . although i am hopeful that i am wrong and that there is an afterlife and some spirit in the sky that cares about us simply because its a lot less bleak then simply dying and decaying . i also have a lot if respect for the culture and morals that religions establish
   (ID: 0c93ab3ec35cab16ded3445fcca7b6045c1dd147)

5. you can call me trash , because at least that implies that someone will take me out
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

6. it ' s not even things like that that is the focus . some other things that will be banned are things like squirting , fisting , face sitting and humiliation . but won ' t somebody please think of the children !
   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

7. real world , it defeats the purpose of what you  re born with their shouldn  t be any confusion on gender when it comes to that topic . video game  i honestly don  t see it
   (ID: d9e6e1ecc09dc9affbcc8ccb0191ff241370a782)

8. wow that ' s rude anw . why do people always assume things they dont digit  sure , do they like being crap or they just want to be stamped as a smart guy ?
   (ID: e4e6a770eda3d8a5505365978baee4568affe531)

9. the only reason we have more shootings is because we have the right to bear arms , and almost digit times the population of the uk at least we don ' t have fucking acid attacks in broad daylight where police don ' t do shit and can ' t do shit because they don ' t have anything to protect themselves or civilians besides a glorified bat and a taserwhich hardly ever works . not to mention that the us healthcare system , i agree the us is overly expensive , but it attracts the best doctors based on pay . what ' s the point of paying for a doctor if you ' re not gonna wake up after surgery . the government shutdown has literally done jack shit , and is completely and utterly useless . it hasn ' t changed anything of any importance . we have the most powerful military in the world , were not warmongering , the us goes after high priority targets that european countries cannot track down because their limited spending co tributes to poor technology in comparison .

10. what !
   (ID: 3418702de52d65ee261943b207996da3e2569fd2)

11. in australia we are paid wages  salary into our bank account . and we make payments to others via internet banking transfers . why are money orders and cheques still such a thing in the u . s ? i know my post isn ' t helpful and i feel for the op but it seems like these sorts of issues could be easily avoided .
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

12. crying while laughing emoji . the most cliche way to over exaggerate how funny you think something is , when digit  of the time its not even funny
   (ID: ae9e10cc82b9b20c52f819c70c83f657724f9f44)

13. i ' d ask why would you build a wall ? do a travel ban instead . it ' d work so much better at reducing illegal immegration . go learn about what you want to change in day  to  day life before posing a solution .

14. these are the people that would be cowering behind you in case you had to use your ' assault ' weapon to protect their rights
   (ID: 0d5c70b45072ef9ffc8fb257e4775e8302391e3c)

15. i have seen it and for all we know the kid attacked him first , thenkid did show his willingness to attack unprovoked and the video only started when the fight broke out so we have no idea pf the context behind it .
   (ID: d7f47de640bd3d8659ad150b77fea8f843c60c26)

16. no . i can quote your own comment for you if you like as a reminder for the comparison you just made   according to your argument , since you and i are not changing nor destroying the system rather than put food on our table and talk to family , some psychopath who wants to be god has the duty to destroy our cites and kill thousands ? you are comparing the situation in vale to the real world ' s situation , but the situations are not comparable as there are no ancient magical beings fucking up humanity for generations . the real world the good guys are all human and the bad guys are all human . that makes a considerable difference .
   (ID: a22b82fe301caa42c89cbd71b2e3733753f695d9)

17. i  m not so sure that computers feel that way . in fact , i don  t think they feel any way .
   (ID: 841a375b464a5650f1c027d1c7ae73415228c6ab)

18. this is the hardest thing to deal with in this day and age . this kind of stuff has happened to me and what i did was tell twitch and stuff like that . they don  t listen to creators now . it  s super difficult .
   (ID: 29f3e9a3f8c02fc1b9aa346cffb8edec6caac89f)

19. if i say mods are gay , are you gonna follow me to other subs and stop me from posting anything for no good reason
   (ID: ef181804526093c6a2f6a4e0fba8b4f18fc0e775)

20. lets take a moment to appreciate how much you assumed i implied from my accusations of your implications . have fun with your lesson in reading into things
