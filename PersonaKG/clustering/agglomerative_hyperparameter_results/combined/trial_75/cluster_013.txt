   (ID: d3491a90d756046acac8c3053e9e99c3e6c231f9)

3. all you really need to do is answer some questions , and i urge you to meditate and  or think really hard about what you come up with . no expertise required . is there a period of time in history that keeps your attention ? do you really love a certain culture with no idea as to why ? are there any interests you ' ve had since early childhood that you may not have been exposed to ? perhaps a totally irrational dislike for something ? any reoccurring dreams ? sometimes , the obvious is right under our noses lol .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

6. why does what you do in your free time have any bearing on what you do at work ? in your mind , is it impossible for someone who likes to get high to refrain from doing so at work ? if you drink beer or alcohol , how is that any different ? should having a beer at home disqualify you from driving a forklift at work the next day ? these are genuine questions .
   (ID: 74058c90ada3aae7a59703064acbf3ced38f3681)

8. also , you have to a be good at what you do , like real good and  or b be very lucky and fall into the right opportunity . i ' m guessing there ' s probably many attorneys out there who are as good or better than your grandpa and yet somehow didn ' t make the big time .
   (ID: eb338cca8f5e87e4b6e5d369997ab6dbebf241c5)

   (ID: 29f3e9a3f8c02fc1b9aa346cffb8edec6caac89f)

12. your teacher actually took that as an excuse ! damn your lucky to have a teacher like that . any teacher i  ve had throughout my digit years of being in school wouldn  t have given digit shits about it and still would  ve had me write the essay .
   (ID: 48327dfb7185a727925115986b0d0501d2999a36)

13. study and actually think about the question before writing don ' t just regurgitate everything you know . importantly , spend 10minutes planning an answer and make sure you include an introduction and conclusion .
   (ID: e78c9eb3b69138ff8337dd896bc5bb1e02fc6559)

14. find a business in a similar vein not doing the exact same thing as you , but related , and see if they ' ll hand it out  make it available for their customers ?

   (ID: e8fea87ced4a86b7ba9c50ae33cf5b3dda99af88)

19. i took this question as what policy the manager should implement for themselves . i have noticed that management only does what the higher ups tell them . there is no leadership . what is lacking in most places are leadership . i ' m not in a good headspace on this topic bc of my current employer lacks leadership especially at the lower levels . our turn over rate is atrocious . i always think of the old army doctrine of " people first , mission always " if you can understand what that requires , then you are on the path to good leadership .
   (ID: 06f2b7a65e600f531fbc47a595626f329ee413a4)

20. if you show up unannounced to someone ' s residence , or their business , talking to people is considered solicitation . and even taking that into consideration , so what ? do i not have the right to be an entrepreneurial business person and take it upon myself to go out and make money , as long as i am not selling anything illegal ?
