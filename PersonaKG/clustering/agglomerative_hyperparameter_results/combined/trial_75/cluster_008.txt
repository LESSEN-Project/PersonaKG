8. i should of known that the prices for these pokemon ones were too good to be true . they are quite hard to get hold of here in the uk , so fraudsters have filled the gap in the market by flogging these fake ones . ebay will be on your side to and help you and get you a refund if you receive a fake , it is just a lot of hassle that is probably best avoided !

   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

20. i think a lot of people have fov all wrong . i ' ve been playing a couple weeks on digit fov . but now i ' m thinking that digit fov is the way to go . with digit fov enemy ' s hitboxes are much larger . i tested that out in training mode with the bloodhound . sure you can ' t see on your sides as well but on console i use a headset and feel like it doesn ' t bring that much benefit since usually enemies aren ' t on my sides . another downside is that you don ' t look like you ' re sprinting as fast but i reconcile this by thinking that you run at the same pace no matter what .
