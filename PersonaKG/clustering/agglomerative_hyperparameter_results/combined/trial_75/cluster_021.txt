1. holy fuck me ! that ' s awful , i feel bad for your uncle ' s friend . , that ' s why i feel so bad for truckers , people are assholes because they think they are faster and can get away . what they forget is that the trucks are way bigger and will crush them like a bug , how did your he handle it after ? i can ' t imagine even though in a way the guy deserved it for being an ass , it still had to affect the driver . edit  spelling

2. quora is where i got this i ' m pretty sure scott would be incredibly disturbed by the proposed strategy of size  changing to burst out of someone ' s body . i mean  by odin i thought it being okay for heroes to engage in casual mutilation was questionable but this ? from scott lang ? and you imagine him being okay with climbing up someone ' s butt ? as for messing someone up from the inside , i recall hank pym in the comics has punched a guy ' s brain up when in tiny form but he assured the thug ' s hostage when he emerged that he ' s a doctor . although probably worth noting hank is ever  so  slightly bonkers . to sum up . theoretically it ' s possible , but if you imagine scott ever doing it then you don ' t know him very well .
   (ID: 79a889fa6fb8a2c18c34d9aec95f4803861c97fe)

3. never heard of him until you mentioned him . heard about the hitchhiker ' s guide to the galaxy but never came around to read it . after reading a bit about him on wikipedia i can say i ' m now a fan of him , now comes the problem of finding the book in english since i live in south america .

13. omg wow that was super helpful ! it raised a few questions though . when did we learn about the clown organization ? like i know there are clown themed ghouls but was " clown organization " ever specifically mentioned ? also when i google " iori tokyo ghoul " nothing comes up , so who ' s that ? also when was furuta introduced ? idr him at all . oh and during the rosewald invasion arc someone with black hair turned traitor i think and turned out to be a ghoul and stabbed someone i think ? that was one of the most confusing parts and i just didn ' t recognize anyone in that scene . i can find the specific chapter if you want , but i ' d like to learn their names . also , sorry but i have amazingly poor memory i think i was able to appreciate the original tg cause i read it all in one go , where as i started tg  re back when it was only digit chapters , so could you remind me if shuu died ? i think remember him being thrown out of the building and kanae saving him ? also if yoshimura isn ' t dead where is he ? do we know ? finally , what do we know about aogiri tree besides its members ? like , why does noro have ridiculous healing powers and won ' t attack anyone ? and what the heck is eto ' s deal ? oh and we still don ' t know how  why kaneki was brainwashed , right ? and why he ' s all serious and stuff now ? he was suppressing memories of his mom beating him or something right ? again thanks so much for this lol it ' s a lot more clear .
