1. thanks for the links ! i will give it a good look .  157k is less than 773k or 249k digit your sample size is not exhaustive anyway . this is google scholar buddy . digit 157k mentions are a lot of mentions . you can also go for a more qualitative approach , and enter a library ' s medieval section . tell me what you find ! digit whoever mentions " byzantium " likely mentions " ere " too , for example . these numbers are interwoven .  you consider it to be popular it is , though you don ' t seem to know much about the subject matter to be so surprised with term . unless you don ' t speak english as your first language ? i know that in my mother languante we don ' t commonly " byzantium " nor " byzantine " . but in english it ' s commonplace . you know what , maybe you should go to askhistorians after all .
   (ID: 67ef96fb30756c49a9ffdff2579058eb2a3c1398)

2. how do you know it  s everyone else though ? i know a guy who thinks very closely to how you are currently and he blames it on everyone else and the generation . in reality he just made others uncomfortable because he was creepy and was an ass sometimes . i went through the same thing , turns out i was a bitch and i learnt to be nicer . i am not saying you are creepy or an ass or a bitch , however as someone who went through it and saw it sometimes it  s not everyone else
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

3. i like to see it as clairvoyance a fake , we don ' t know when events will happen but we do know what servants will come out and can gather the necessary mats for em .
   (ID: 0ff3db030062a58f30958a7a7b74373cf4f7cbd6)

4. lol , you are truly so dumb . i mean my lord . this is been a lot of fun , but i think you should check with your mom to see if you are allowed on reddit .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

5. if you ' re doing it once a week , that ' s a habbit in it of it ' s own . now i don ' t know how it will affect your brain . i would just warn you about addiction . it ' s a slippery slope .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

6. i would say make it so that the readers know why he ' s doing it . what ' s driving him ? for relatable . but personally , i would love to read about a character on their way to their first victory . so yeah i ' d say that ' s brilliant .
   (ID: 79fc72ea72532d39a039ecb4e47a630a601ff4a8)

7. yo what kinda life to you live that you know what your local pds badge design looks like lmao
   (ID: 472084017072e7ced5fed0827bae57ba801d9b7d)

8. with a love like that . you know you should be glad .
   (ID: a8d677a357cabd8cb6d9bfa06e041b5b173582d8)

9. well not really its the size of an ak bullet so its not like getting a . digit to the chest that would turn organs to soup . kinda all depends where it hits you and if you have armor and what kind its rated for . i have a friend in the corp and he was shot in the back with a ak and didn ' t know it till someone pointed out he had a hole in his sapi carrier body armor so its all relevant to the rifle and where you ' re shot .
   (ID: 72cfb7666d0a97ebe283c019ed67b8b62982ac18)

10. you know what , i try to fucking talk to you like a normal human being , and what do you do ? well , i don ' t wanna say because it will just encourage you to partake in your sick practices even more . so why don ' t you do us all a favor , and fuck off !
   (ID: 6692d386ab188df76448f18f0e9d59c1e6d88c50)

11. i mean i ' m the only one who will , not because i ' m interested in you but because i know that i ' m driving you up the wall and if your efforts to get the last word and provide yourself with some small win in life , and because i think that you ' re bad and that you should be punished . and because i think you ' re impotent rage and lies are hilarious . you could easily prove to me your age and your body type yet you refuse because i ' m correct .
   (ID: 744a61859eb21e8e7ed805da69133b0d07c3e965)

12. yeah its celebration but if you actually read the quote   x200b   somebody will give us a breakdown of what was happening out there without us having to actually experinence it they know the reaction will be madness
   (ID: e84ec39cf97c9609b6feb31cbaab5faf551f372d)

13. this is amazing ! everything is set for my application , all that ' s left is to finalize the digit  second video . i don ' t know why i struggle so much on that one .
   (ID: 581212399ab927ef4ad073e5e0d8d36cf5929452)

14. didn ' t know it was netflix show  movie . i do see their ads on youtube , but not for this . my curiosity has been piqued , however so i will probably track it down .
   (ID: 2266c34274940e2ea1a22a3dee5a3cbcdad25f53)

15. well , you know what they say . then quickly change the subject so that they don ' t ask you to finish it
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

16. i don ' t know what irritates me more about this , how unrealistic it is or what an awful person that woman would be if it was true .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

17. that ' s a really good start ! personally , i would way rather that everyone in the world were a few weeks prepared than that a few dudes were prepped for decades . keep it up , but make sure you don ' t let your prepping eat into financial reserves etc too much . i know people who have run themselves in huge debt to buy prepping gear , and i think that ' s kind of self  defeating . this is what i think the absolute basics of prepping should , by the way , in case that ' s helpful to you at this stage !
   (ID: 43758cbbc1bb7a8418a69b47911e24d1d2a082d3)

18. honestly i think the complaints about settings are overblown . sure , add a search feature for finding things even more quickly that ' s fine , but i don ' t know what jagex are supposed to do about it when people can ' t find the settings for combat experience when you ' ve got digit categories , one labelled skills and the other combat and both point to the same interface . if it ' s really taking you that long to find where combat experience in a list that literally says combat  experience i don ' t think there ' s much jagex can do to help you . people need to understand some games have a lot of options and that it ' s worth taking a few minutes to go through and see what ' s available rather than never delving into them . maybe if people really want a hand holding interface they should offer a streamlined  simplified bare bones with a toggle option for advanced settings as to not scare off new players .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

19. as cliche as it sounds , there ' s very little you can do to help him if he doesn ' t want to help himself . i ' d recommend letting him know that you know he ' s using , don ' t make any threats , but let him know that his habit is hurting you and that you ' re concerned . for the most part it is outside of your control . that ' s the beauty and the curse of free will  we can choose for ourselves , but not for others . my half  sister estranged herself from my family because of her drug use . despite multiple rehab attempts , two broken marriages , and a move across the country and back she didn ' t change . sometimes people aren ' t willing to . i wish you and your brother well .
   (ID: 46ad8b21d42eca2f7a4a4acacd8d9683aa9cf47a)

20. i like playing alone and usually that ' s when the course isn ' t busy and i can play two balls but i also like pairing up with someone i don ' t know . its good to meet different people and if they are better than you it puts a little bit of pressure on yourself you wouldn ' t get playing alone !
