   (ID: f4ccc689474985c0e4cb0900bd2a946257f83dc3)

   (ID: dccaef8a6226163d8d10afb2d04eb5a7babea832)

3. ahhhhh . that  s not okay . i mean i get that there are stay at home moms and all the power to them , but to rely on someone to keep you fed and clothed and then treat them like shit . i am a stay at home mom . who works a full time job out of our home as well as a part time job for a family member  s business . i might not have lunch packed for him every day , but he has food to eat and a decently clean house and love and respect  which i also have . it  s kinda sad for your ex wife tho  she hasn  t been able to let go and enjoy her life because she  s too busy being a shit .
   (ID: c28c39847d1ec88851aadf063f6e8baf4594b35c)

6. I enjoy baseball.
   (ID: 9c2d2fde31927b8cc3bc419049de8844ca720cb9)

7. yes , and i think it ' s generally an unhealthy identity thing to boot . not enough gamers take a step back and consider if a objective will really help them enjoy the game more . for example , right now i don ' t even begin to bother with the puzzle rooms on lua , because i don ' t want to play myst . i don ' t do plains because i ' m not keen on fishing simulator digit . if the occasion arises where i ' m in a mood to enjoy that sort of thing , i ' ll do it . ivara is another good example . i see complaints from people that spend hooooooours farming for her . my question is . why ? if you don ' t enjoy farming for her , do something else . eventually you ' ll get her , or you ' ll get stuff to sell to outright buy her . don ' t waste your precious time on crap you don ' t like .
   (ID: ef4c0dfc1d427eae02f9c3d660c4d80a470020e2)

8. don  t waste time arguing . you will probably say something you regret and it can dry with you a long time . save . you will need it one day . find a sport that you genuinely enjoy so exercise isn  t such a chore . wear a condom .

16. dude . so with you on this . concerts , festivals , comedy shows . i realized a couple months back that while i enjoy a great number of things that this world has to offer , i love very few things . which is why i find myself despondent at events that i  ve paid money to attend . brain  i thought you liked this band . me  i do . brain  why aren  t you enjoying yourself then ? me  i don  t know . isn  t that kinda your job ? brain  me ? psh . i  m only here for the free show , man .

20. get the cheap table . pools pool . sure it wont play great , but at least it will play . if thats all you have to spend i would stay in budget especially if you are planning on moving . even more so if you are alone and dont have other people to play with . from experience it is something that could be used a lot if you have people that also enjoy the game . i cant dedicate myself enough to run drills so unfortunately i do not play alone too often .
