2. does he not talk on stream so he can focus  avoid tilt ? very cool
   (ID: 7542c8a6be5a118bef67d9539deb69c131fb4fbc)

3. no , reddit can be productive . people using it productively is a rarity . just look at the subscriber numbers for funny or aww compared to those of let ' s say , i dunno , studytips .
   (ID: 4721143ecfe877298792b1d44e635051f5f2c84e)

4. that ' s life man . its seems scary , but the worst thing you can do is nothing . schools and the like will make you feel like your life will be wasted if you make bad choices , but that is a lie . pick a career that you think you might enjoy and if it sucks do something else . because tons of people in your situation stop their education and end up missing opportunities .
   (ID: 2fd27f1218d4f8b9cf90988522a560a50a304dfc)

5. well , sometimes we dislike something and we don ' t know why but we need to dig deep to figure out the cause . let ' s do that . tell me how it makes you feel when you encounter a woman who has piercings . are you revolted ? what thoughts go through your mind . what do you think ? maybe we can get to the heart of it .
   (ID: ddd770a31dc9c8fa4ad153c94b4c0debc20cf026)

6. im not sure if you actively use this account but , try posting this in dallas and you may get an answer . outside of reddit you can use it has tons of info regarding fishing and i am sure you can find advice on fishing around rockwall . maybe even a guide or some fishing friends .
   (ID: d9b642bbd6c09c682f252a2f49914c0d21506e6f)

7. that may be true but aren ' t we talking about cycles that peak and trough over the course of hundreds of years ? can we look at a period of ten years and say these sorts of claims are important ? i ' m being honest , i don ' t know . but i also know better than to believe the green  types have all the answers or are going to be entirely forthcoming about their own ignorances , and i don ' t like how being sceptical on climate issues has been conflated with being a climate change denier . i don ' t fully understand the scope of the problem , but i ' m willing to bet a lot of people that claim to , don ' t either  and i ' m damn sure they ' ll sure it as an excuse for their political machinations as well . all i ' m saying is that it ' s going to take some serious convincing if the eco  types really want everyone else to give up their standard of living .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

8. that  s very far fetched . you want to argue more than the face value of the comment but i  m sorry , there  s nothing more and nothing less . i know nothing about what you posted of , but have read about the social credit experiment china is rolling out and how those with low scores may not be able to fly . i would assume protesters would cause low points , therefore would disable a protester from flying on a plane and that  s why i commented such . as far as feeling insecure , i have no idea why you even assumed that much . by the way , your title is interpreted as you being sympathetic to both the assaulted and assaulters so your message isn  t effective . i suppose i should have pointed that out instead . good luck on your awareness campaign .
   (ID: 71de6d78a2a9fe7dfc17e6667ec92f75a8d4c302)

9. there were like a thousand different codes and weird actions being floated about . i don ' t remember any of them .
   (ID: 40ad6d409c1f0888bdb3dbd8d7bab47d00f3a6f0)

10. based off your first three sentences . self  entitled , opinionated , delusional douchebag . not off to a good start when trying to get others to agree with you . whatever follows will have the same underlying tone . if you accept the counter argument without rebuttal being an elitist , you decrease the value of your own argument . how can anyone have a decent " debate  conversation " with you when you admit youre elitist . if you even really comprehend what that means . i was going to break down and reply to each of your " fine arguments " but i found i ' ll only be repeating myself over and over . it seems you ' re having a hard time accepting that your generation is gone . not sure what generation you ' re from , but the points you have aren ' t even facts . you do realize that people like beethoven wrote pieces for lead violinists and orchestras . do you know alexi laiho , children of bodom he ' s a guitar god . he writes and composes a lot of the music and even teaches the members how to play it . everything from lead , rythem , drums , vocals . hes a genius . brandon small . another musical genius . does the same thing for dethklok . he basiclly is dethklok . i could name numerous electronic producers who completely produce and master all of their own music . eminem doesn ' t use ghost writers and has even produced his own beats . taylor swift writes her own songs . so your whole , everyone wrote their own shit is not something that this generation ruined . there are plenty of artists who are talented . you just don ' t like them , doesn ' t mean they don ' t exist . using a laptop doesn ' t take away from artist creativity , effort , or hard work . you ' re just a bitter old individual who can ' t accept evolution . no , i don ' t like all music created today . but considering this is all subjective i have no problem searching for something i like in the vast avalibilty of what ' s out there . i listen to everything from legit classical music , to heavy metal , to lyrical rap , to electronic , i listen to music in languages i don ' t understand . there is so much to appreciate . youre just stuck back in the " good old days "
   (ID: 3b13182e9a13b392bb9f89990f71d9043459e21f)

11. well , if a lot of people miss the same joke , then probably the joke is not really successful .  .
   (ID: 725d4aa726d6161269e6b6ff3ba37ac95ea27a3f)

12. from the point of view from a tall man with tall kids . i am digit ' digit " , wife is digit ' digit " , oldest teenage daughter is digit ' digit " , youngest daughter age digit is already digit ' digit "  likely to be over 6ft . you are who you are , give them the finger and keep walking . at some point a taller guy will come along that is not the " i need the digit ' digit " digit lb trophy wife " type of guy , but at the same time you need to be ready for it . keep up a " mild guard " but don ' t just turn guys away because their interest may seem like fetish territory , it may be honest interest . i say " mild guard " because there are plenty of fetish types out there , have a little fun on occasion but make sure you know it is just for fun , not long term .

13. " pulled " out by the escaping air i guess ? i ' m not really a physics person

   (ID: 89a759866debf6704efa0f603c1b9c4476abd731)

16. and who is doing the ' calamatizing ' ? not the good people of syria . no , it is the not  so  good people who spring from the same authoritarian bent that insist everyone conform to the grid as mentioned in the article . setting that aside . i never said calamities are a good thing in and of themselves . i merely said it induces change .
   (ID: 0f3da013abe745c83b2d4eb042abb7fd28f5e872)

17. well , what do you do instead of a job ? do you have hobbies ? interests ? hopefully you do something more than just sit at home watching tv . so talk about that
   (ID: bd723644638296cdfc92c932fca8a0e0d4cc9f7f)

18. it ' s hard for me to say , i ' ve seen fucked up shit and that ' s shaped me to the person i am today to some degree , but i don ' t know if i want my kids to see the same kind of stuff , but at the same time i don ' t exactly want to censor what they can and can ' t see , i suppose the most i would want to do is make sure they get whatever they need to get done first before they get on screens and if i catch them looking at something i might have been looking at i ' ll explain to them what it is and that i don ' t think they should be looking at it but they ' re their own person and can decide what they do and don ' t want to look at
   (ID: feb4a6aeed8e7e14b0592329bd91d7933a93217e)

19. what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? i  ll have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals , and i  ve been involved in numerous secret raids on al  quaeda , and i have over digit confirmed kills . i am trained in gorilla warfare and i  m the top sniper in the entire us armed forces . you are nothing to me but just another target . i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? think again , fucker . as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . you  re fucking dead , kid . i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways , and that  s just with my bare hands . not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent , you little shit . if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little  clever  comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . but you couldn  t , you didn  t , and now you  re paying the price , you goddamn idiot . i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . you  re fucking dead , kiddo .
