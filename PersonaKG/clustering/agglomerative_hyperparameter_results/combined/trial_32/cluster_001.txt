3. thanks for your comments , no worries at all , i appreciate your question a lot . in many ways , yes i " thank " myself for my life , in the sense that i respect myself and want to live my best life . as such , i have made good decisions , chosen my friends well and am surrounded by good people because i chose that for myself . but my gratitude goes beyond myself and those around me .
   (ID: 1b4a970a63450e21b56e1d38502b30aca032cd3f)

5. yeah , i know it ' s the hardest and worst but i simply want it . the why ? i already played a dozen worlds to where i was starting to mine iron , and this stupid black bronze has always eluded me . the most i ever managed to make were digit tools at any one given time . i refuse to progress further until i get this .
   (ID: 31a38fd064ff03f66a81cdb43afb06ce9a64e5c7)

6. i also got digit in ib which is worst of the best , unless you ' re applying to very top unis it should be fine . i think if you really do love graphics , go for it . because unis are expensive , most people only want to  can go once so do something you actually want to .
   (ID: a77eb45bf2cf0979852baa624e4a728cd8c1b85b)

7. i have no idea , but i really want to know now i would assume so , coz it ' s just like different breeds of cats or dogs reproducing together . tho it might be that the dragons are all too proud to do that , and want to keep their bloodlines pure
   (ID: 3019ca7bd07e9287b998767b6d0eb22d6049a635)

9. i agree . if it makes her happy and doesn ' t negatively effect anyone else , let them believe what they want to believe !
   (ID: fca46720f9aa154a0559b1e4d2d28cb0df46b00a)

10. yta . she  s allowed have a best friend . and you bought digit tickets . would you rather the other two go to waste ? i can kind of understand why you want her to spend more time with you instead of lucy but not allowing lucy and her husband to go when you already have the tickets is a little silly
   (ID: b40d1d3ae1e77bcbdcb98e62deea24396d4b4d40)

11. i don ' t know who needs to hear this right now , but you can literally do anything you want in your house , it ' s not illegal unless you get caught .
   (ID: a93c4b4e04523abdf134a40204e81619d6e659ef)

12. so , how do you want your milo done ?
   (ID: b29114e3d39ee1086f5eb2abbe6cbec33bc7749f)

13. oh ok i understand , but like for now at least i want a small start like let  s say digit designs you know ? but my biggest problem is that i can  t find a site that does what i want and i  m not sure who to ask if they know a good site , like i really want to do the shipping and other things by myself but it  s literally physically impossible for me to do so that  s why i need something like redbubble you know ? someone would order and they print and ship without me needing to bother with anything else other than designing .
   (ID: fe4ddb52a6f20437e3f3c6003b775cb72c3d048f)

14. to me it does because why do you want to try and understand a being with more intelligence then you ?
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

15. i use my brain too much , in other words i think about what i want to say for several hours and then end up needing to do something else before i say it .
   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

16. i don ' t give a fuck about anyone except my friends and family , which is why i don ' t want to be paying for anyone else ' s shit through my tax money . if someone who was in need came asking for monetary help , i will gladly volunteer some cash over , i always do if i have cash . i don ' t like being forced to give charity . i think it ' s theft . but generally , i think it ' s rude to kill people , don ' t do it . it ' s rude to physically and sexually assault someone , don ' t do it . just because i don ' t care about most people doesn ' t mean i ' m not considerate enough to hold a door open .
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

17. for     ' s sake , let us have advanced worldgen options to choose what things our world has . let us choose which ores the world contains , what colors the dungeon uses , what color of underground moss we want , what kind of moon we want , etc . let ' s just say that i ' m constantly generating worlds that use the new ores , rather than the old ones that i ' ve come to know and love . it ' s ridiculous how i can ' t get a single world that has the old ores .
   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

18. it ' s yours so you can do what you want . like other ladies have said , you should get it appraised , then sell it or regift it . you ' re not obligated to keep a gift , no matter who gave it to you .
   (ID: 8889ee4547e570f04696e9cc7b50124dca69b82e)

19. welp , bonobo  love just broke the internet for the day ! if you will excuse me , i will be over here drooling  fapping to all the thoughts of what i want to do with that beautiful brown eye !
   (ID: f709eec52cd0c0cff5afc1f9f3e0caa4a2797782)

20. honestly the best advice i can give is just be happy with yourself first . it sounds cliche but once you  re happy with yourself that comes across in everything you do  say . try not to focus on how you can make yourself better for other people , but how you can make yourself happy and i promise people gravitate towards you because they want some of that confidence themselves
