1. do people know which way you ' re going ?
   (ID: 17d5718d86b2560f3a04d8427f0e5fb4b969bed3)

2. if i found you in real life , i would get an ar  digit rifle and shoot your fucking brains out , you ' re probably sarcastically saying that you ' re scared . you should be scared because right after that , i am going to cut your limbs off and feed them to the cannibals , and i am going to sice open your stomach and put a grenade in there til your whole body explodes . i am going to burn the remains of your body and bury them in a secluded area so nobody finds out what happened to you . they ' ll just think you disappeared . you should be lucky i don ' t know who you are in real life , cause if i did . i would find out what city you live in and where your house is . you think you can get away with harassing me over the internet ? control your actions and what you ' re gonna say before you do so , smartass . use your fucking brain next time .
   (ID: ac16118040bd30364df28924a08320a2668f71ae)

3. i was working overtime . for the sake of the story , i  ll simplify what i was doing . there  s fast work and slow work . overtime tends to be reserved for fast work . you can tell the bosses what their overtime dollars bought . my manager brings me some very slow work . i tell her it  s going to take a long time . she says it should be the next thing i do . it  s the only thing i get done in digit hours . it literally required me standing behind her cubicle making copies for hours . we were within digit feet of each other . monday morning , she asks to see me . apparently her boss chewed her out so now she  s doing the same to me . i could have been a much smarter asshole but instead i just said i won  t bother to work overtime anymore if this is how it  s going to be . no answer from her . i got over it but now i remember to keep emails , texts , notes , whatever .
   (ID: 5d0b750bf77c2c6e8b41ebf03caf4038a907b876)

4. hmmm . i ' m going to have to add this article to my bookmarks for the same thing . thanks for the article , it ' s amazing to think about what you ' re missing because you just don ' t know about it !
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

5. you have to do what you have to do . i ' m not gay but you have to establish dominance or you ' re just going to become a victim yourself . inflicting abuse on weaker men really erodes your entire identity but you have to ignore it if you want to get out alive . either way you ' re not going to leave the same man you arrived as . i know it ' s not as bad as prison but being locked up in the drunk tank can be traumatic in its own way .
   (ID: d03d1ad154435125e19860973a5b0df5434be0e5)

6. the first time i had a panic attack . i didn ' t know what it was , i actually thought i was going to die . just beyond scary , and leads into the realm of absolutely terrifying .
   (ID: 5ee4d4a98d2da62835d0e63abf8fe5bbfa95111b)

7. for canadians i  m a conservative but compare to americans i  m probably a centrist . i describe myself as a proud member of the  here  s a fair percentage of my money , now fuck off  party . i  ll pay taxes for important shit like infrastructure , education , and health care but i don  t want my money going towards bullshit like art departments or foreign aid . i also don  t want the government deciding what i can or can  t say , or what i can and can  t do in the privacy of my own home so long is doesn  t hurt others physically . basically i  ll pay taxes , let me decide where they go , then fuck off .
   (ID: 4654e3a9a75835f9ff28170ddf31d5d3cf296ea2)

8. wow a company going a safer route to make money . look man the thing they did with star wars was scummy , and how they fucked over respawn and vis . but at this point the memes have become stale now and we ' re betting a dead horse .
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

9. well it ' s about time this happened . it ' s probably going to push rents up but it needs to be done , australia ' s housing market is out of control , needs to burst already . honestly what idiot gets an interest only home loan in the first place ? dickheads who watch too may " flip a house " shows . think they can do that too then realise how expensive tradies are ? haha . fuck em . let them fall !
   (ID: 9e8a44f7c55ebce4785906436a033b33a1ccb949)

10. i agree , too many bugs . the banning ' s and other issues have destroyed my league . the ah stuff they are doing , is going to drive away most of the rest . there has been lots of good this year , the league stuff they just did , would be great if most of the best guys from my league weren ' t gone already . and the digit promos they ' ve done so far have been quality .
   (ID: ff39f069f8b23a1fe1a55ce497714a8d205eb0fa)

11. oh you ' re still going on about something not pertaining to op ' s question ?
   (ID: 45165f29e8e7c1736ef3e4b70d312f493a62eb83)

12. i was talking more about the duration , not attempt counts . you can ' t entirely make up for the fact that classic was a slower game than retail with just skill . what about bosses who , with the current gear you have , are mathematically impossible without sufficient gear from the raid they ' re in ? what about the fact that fuck all gear drops for a digit man raid ? even if the final bosses only take one attempt , they ' re still going to take a while to kill because people will still be gearing for that fight .
   (ID: e53542ff680164cdf45964372fb47cf6a7d48484)

13. yes , that ' s why i said responsibly . red meat isn ' t going to kill you or shorten your lifespan if you do it in moderation .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

14. i ' m going to move to a larger town with my two best friends ! really excited about that
   (ID: 2cb4aa2e032749d7dca2c2ab5fbd17d2ba53bb10)

15. cheating was a sport . i would do it even if i studied like mad . i even cheat for people . i remember in my linear circuits class the guy beside me was doing poorly . i looked at his answers and seen he was going to fail . i took my paper changes to his name and sent him to hand it in while i did his . . he ended up doing better than me . still a rush
   (ID: 803d3eb0d3664275a2ad6840048dba9d4d991cf7)

16. if you interpret this as transphobic , you are braindead . the guy wrote , " hey you guys are going for this and that statement and they may be true but those are so common  place sayings , dont go for the low hanging fruit , put some effort . there is really nothing transphobic in that . if anything , he just mentioned others sayings . you are not even sensitive . you are schizoprenic  you see offenses that dont exist .
   (ID: d048a45810866f7b853972f50c2c2746bc339a21)

17. you can ' t change it . people are always going to make jokes that you disagree with because offense and humour are both subjective . the best you can do is ignore it , because pointing it out will make people laugh at you instead of changing their ways .
   (ID: 009af0be6850d8d1ff9d388a3c7f39f0f7727594)

18. maybe when it goes on sale . it will be like every other new game i buy , play for a month and then come crawling back to gta like a lost puppy . are you going to jump on rdr2 ?
   (ID: 80d504f68f5028edc4d8e5926e3a2a93b0c84d8f)

19. i watched your video , and here is my review  i can bearly hear your voice over the music , the title could do some work , maybe in your description other than promoting your socials you can describe your video in a nutshell . i like the professional look of your channel the layout , banner and the thumbnails of the other videos on your channel , also i love the fact that you respond to everyone in the comment section . i ' m definitely going to go deeper in your channel .
   (ID: 544afc73e94949100186d302e382bea6fc33beb4)

20. the movie starts in digit minutes , we  re going to be late !   don  t worry , i know a shortcut
