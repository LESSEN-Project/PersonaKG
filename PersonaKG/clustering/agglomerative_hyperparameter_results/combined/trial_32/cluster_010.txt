3. probably nothing and i ' m so sad about it . last year we found this really amazing resturaunt that we really liked but it ' s kinda far . so i had hoped to make it our thing to continue going to it every year for valentine ' s day . i also made a clay mold of my hand giving the finger and did it up all nice . it ' s like an inside joke thing and i know he would have loved it so much . so now it ' s just sitting in my room waiting to never be received by the person it was made for . minda wanna destroy it and smash it to pieces because im so mad and upset .
   (ID: 9981a65782780477b53d712e936b6997a4092240)

   (ID: f39e591889b6331bd255039773030c1b50c7e201)

9. a lot of girls and guys have their  list  of celebrities they would sleep with . most people know it  s never going to happen , so it seems harmless enough . she was trying to get you to play the game too , so it doesn  t sound like she meant to hurt you . if it  s something that really bothers you , tell her about it . i think it  s admirable that you want to be the best version of yourself for her . maybe use it as an opportunity to ask her what characteristics make her attracted to those people and whether she would like it if you had those characteristics . she  ll likely say no because it sounds like she loves you exactly the way you are and you should never feel pressured to change for anyone .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

10. surely there ' s comfort in knowing there ' s absolutely nothing you can do about the eventual heat death of the universe . it ' s out of your control so just let it be . you don ' t know that this universe doesn ' t collapse down to a single point and birth anew with another big bang . either way i ' ll be long dead so it matters not
   (ID: e982e025c0604997a6e2072eb87b9bb01bed38ae)

11. well it is hard to teach on a forum , but i  ll include the link to my company  s website . it is a company , so it will cost money , but there is a free class that actually gives a lot of insight . basically what you should do is look into schools and open a simulated trading account . that way you can practice using paper money . however , real money is much better to use if you can . you need to be cautious of following price and instead look for areas where price will turn . also , if you don  t have a lot of money to start off with , look into leveraged assets , such as forex , futures , and options . i would recommend forex to start off with because it requires the least amount of money . last , but not least , after you figure all of this out it is imperative to make and write down a trading plan that has rules and a strategy that you follow . that was probably a jumbled mess , but those are some pointers to start out . hope that helped !
   (ID: f2f78f9286caf4c9c8a5d2df66e9befe965daeb8)

12. literally shit your pants at the doctor ' s office . you ' ll get as many notes as you want .

14. jack handey v  o  if you ' re in a war , instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy , throw one of those small pumpkins . maybe it ' ll make everyone think how stupid war is , and while they are thinking , you can throw a real grenade at them .
   (ID: 2988ee1cd7a2bcf8e2d215c795ee2d06a985665a)

15. be prepared for some confrontation . learn to compromise . you ' ll really learn a lot about your significant other when you live together .
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

16. warranties for the most part are not voided unless the repair or modification you do can be proven to have caused the breakdown . that said , unless you ' re planning on really modifying your car for something specific like off  roading , track , etc , then most modifications are likely to be extremely minor and should be fine . the best thing you can do is check youtube when you come across an issue or repair , you ' ll likely find a resource to tell you how to do it . if that fails , check car specific forums , they can be a huge resource for almost everything about your car . i ' ve used them more times than i can count and they have saved me a fortune . learn as much as you can but don ' t be worried about not understanding something or feeling like a job is too big to tackle . some people are comfortable rebuilding an engine while others don ' t want to handle anything harder than changing an air filter .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

17. you should tell them that you like it . they  ll be proud of you .

   (ID: e3aadeaf18df437e62f5c1614d251bf343fd2de2)

20. this is the worst . i  ll come home with groceries and my neighbor won  t let me carry them in . not even bag with a loaf of bread . it drives me crazy
