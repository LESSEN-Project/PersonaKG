1. that  s a good article ! everything we  ve discussed ! i , too have trouble when i  m asking all the questions and i get brief answer with no question back . i literally unmatch after the third question i ask . it  s maddening and feels like more work than it should . why is good conversation so hard to find ?
   (ID: 256407c5e6c8d9342d8aabf5c9c392fc179ba9f3)

2. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

3. got it . in that case i believe ml could help and agree with the post from woodsja2 . i ' ve taken the andrew ng course they mention , and came away with a pretty good understanding of the different techniques . that said , to do this right probably requires prior experience . good luck , should be a fun problem to work on !
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

4. if you want to improve late game then join a scrim discord such as atlantis scrims . i cant really recommend anything for early  mid since i also need to work on that . ify tho
   (ID: 41fc1b2c09d5a16a25f120edde55b2a6e2e54e29)

5. i could get how a city could work on the sea , but on the fucking sky ? how much helium do these idiots use ?
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

6. i hate when people half share info  even if the news is boring , don ' t not name names or share your " exciting " news . you gotta love it when people talk about how upset they are on a public post , someone asks if they are okay , and they reply with any of the following . " yes fine babes " " don ' t want to talk about it " " it ' s private " fucking sandra .
   (ID: 87d1924873eb8926aac7c71d1a563d7d2d1cabbd)

7. i don  t know why you were downvoted for these comments . it  s okay that you  re new . when i was new i didn  t know what any of these meant  op original poster nsfw not safe for work so significant other iirc if i recall correctly imo in my opinion there was probably more i just don  t remember so you  re not alone with this . i know my account isn  t even a month old but i had to switch for various reasons . i  ve actually been a redditor for about a year . i wish you good luck on your journey of learning about reddit !
   (ID: 5042e4f4cf4f00f86836211d30b97922c92f0b46)

8. i get what you ' re saying , but i think that by not doing homework you ' re making their job really difficult , because they rely on you doing some learning  work at home so they can get through with everything they are supposed to teach you .
   (ID: e6c4a2b8e8c999b54ade342babc3d7b48868cc6d)

9. i still have to work for another fucking digit hours . it ' s torture
   (ID: 9ee9d24ef531902c3436e80a94ec700625d655c6)

10. why would someone just entering the business turn down a job opportunity for low pay ? i certainly know i wouldn ' t , and the prevalence of internships shows that people are willing to basically work for free as long as it gets them experience .
   (ID: 85bffe0bb9cbc6b9878fa42cd379cd2d4c7a27e1)

11. thanks for explaining . i can understand employees wanting to get paid for the work they ' re doing , but that seems like a really harsh punishment for just a minute or two of time .
   (ID: 101eeb53846c81b36d32c33e2b4260cb3e4ac576)

12. my favorite cover letter formula is made of digit parts  why the company you are applying to is the shit . why you are the shit . how you can own the world together . put some personality in there . if you  re a pharmacist , i know you  re smart , i can teach you anything i need you to know . what i want is someone i can work with for the next decade or two .
   (ID: a2ac729ecf8bc4b4e5e9971a848e76d3b574e65a)

13. everyone had a breaking point . a point where everything in their life is just too much to handle , and everyone is more than that can take . if this was her first time , please don ' t take it personally . our loved ones take the brunt of the storm , because we can ' t unload at work , or in perfect strangers . i would broach the subject tonight , but do it in a way that shows concern . something along the lines of , " hey , i was really worried about you last night . do you want to talk about what happened ? how can i help you the next time you have a craptastic day " it sounds like by the end of the evening she was calming down , and probably felt bad as she should about the way she was treating you . that being said , if this behavior becomes more frequent , you may need to reevaluate what ' s going on .
   (ID: 854fece503b60c994d3291263ce8495e5048d976)

14. i  m a big decepticon fan , and these guys are an inescapable purchase for me . even moreso because i  m in canada and the wait sucks , so i  ll go stateside for it online . one of the thing i think some people have overlooked is that since there are digit bots for devestator , in order to make the star math work , we see the firsts 4pt filler bots .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

15. i ' m hoping for contact lenses that would work as a cell phone . that would be cool i think and only you would ever be able to see what your doing on them
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

16. i haven ' t even started work yet and this post makes me want to scream . i wish you the best of luck with all of the bed changes and bathing that ' s sure to follow .
   (ID: 7e58269155b84bc057025d5066e661ba2eb934ba)

17. you want to leave a city in canada and go to the us ? do you know how many people leave their countries to come to canada ? i ' m one of them . what city do you live in and why don ' t you just chose another canadian city ? this is i truly believe one of , if not the best country to live in . look for work first then make the move .
   (ID: 5c7a23731c46d9c75722023d6108cb45a421fb75)

18. thats some commitment too , nice job ! i ' ll smoke one for you tonight when i ' m back from work , any excuse is better than none right ?
   (ID: 932561c7cc5f0c280d4b6b0c7824dbd5aed5f350)

19. venomous spiders should be your only issue and you say it isn ' t in the uk . lucky you ! so you are pretty much in the clear . let your cats gastric juices do the work .
   (ID: 9a96ba583f43f670f5797ea5031052161bf613cf)

20. i experience this even now . i think it ' s fine to think every now and then about your situation . it would be impossible to never think about it , but don ' t stay focused on it for a lengthy period , it ' s unhealthy . when i had a job in retail i caught the train home every night . friday and saturday nights were almost unbearable . watching groups of people your age socialize and have fun hurt bad because it would remind me how i ' ll never be able to experience it for myself . you can still find some people to hang around with , maybe from work or education . but i think we should agree that looking forward is the best thing to do
