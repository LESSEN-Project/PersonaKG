1. i don ' t know what you mean by the second part of your question . some kind of inside joke i don ' t get perhaps ? in any case , i ' ve already said too much  it ' s her story and i have no right talking about it . i regret saying anything in fact .
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

   (ID: 160325a949e5dbc41bc99b9243f0df0953ef7bd4)

4. i was asked a question i wasn ' t ready for and had to spend a solid minute or digit thinking of a response in silence . i ' ve been told that kind of thing makes you look good in a way because you actually considered your answer instead of just spouting some bullshit but i don ' t know if i believe that
   (ID: 5147e830e7cfa538d6990a8699ad6462b57cfb52)

5. i ' ve wondered about that , too . do you have to subscribe to each subreddit separately ?
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

6. you . i ' ve seen you . let me see your face . you are the one from my dreams . then the stars were right , and this is the day . gods give me strength .
   (ID: 22864f9484c3c6d7f8c8dac79c58ea32865eb794)

7. i wonder about the circumstances that lead up to that confrontation with your mom . i  m adamantly childfree , but have never been harassed about it by my family . the reason may be my obvious lack of  aww  when i see babies i  m very cold and stone  faced while others are all cooing over the thing , and my unwavering  no  when asked to babysit  hold the poop machines . you can  t force someone to like kids . why does your mother try ? hasn  t she seen your lack of interest in them ?
   (ID: 53c827dc263721b97d54bc4c972350c3a1b57856)

   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

10. wrong subreddit my dude i think you mean dankmemes they have that " funny " idea you could ' ve gotten digit upvotes over there they find that funny
   (ID: b7af56426174b182a97c67df12c64d320bf51d61)

11. i don ' t really have anything to say , but you ' ve put a smile on your face for having personal responsibility . i can ' t sympathize with the ' previously religious ' part , but for the rest , you ' re not alone . being responsible for your own actions sucks sometimes .
   (ID: b05c37d4999dc6e0647955781d5a349457a11a40)

12. you know whose stories i want to hear ? the men  women who faced death and gave their lives to give us our freedom . not these shills who pretend to be so brave with their sob stories
   (ID: 0d5c70b45072ef9ffc8fb257e4775e8302391e3c)

13. i have a ps4 also , does it crash a lot for you ? i ' ve heard that it crashes a lot for people and want to know if it ' s true .
   (ID: 114e3678c6af9d322985bb4656e33b19c03a0479)

14. i can relate , as i too have it , and have turned to hurting myself rather than others . though , in recent years i ' ve come to have a lot more self control when it comes to doing anything negative such as the aforementioned punching of walls . for me it ' s the smacking of lips and the sound of saliva moving in another person ' s  animal ' s mouth , so i often eat alone , or with distraction like a loud tv . my nfather has no concept of disorders , and as such he constantly would exacerbate the problem to the point where i actually started to claw at my arm at every meal . i actually remember being so upset that i punched a wall and broke my hand one night when it was particularly bad . i don ' t lash out like this anymore , probably due to the fact that i did that when i was digit , and since have matured , at least enough to not punch walls . i ' m so glad that after my father was out of the picture , my mother let me eat in peace . i can ' t remember when i haven ' t eaten in my room in recent years . i ' d like to think it ' s one of the reasons i ' m so happy to have her as my mother .
   (ID: 5ee4d4a98d2da62835d0e63abf8fe5bbfa95111b)

15. no , not at all . i don  t know anything i  ve done in all my life relating to a beautiful african american woman with a child that even resembles what happened in my dream last night . the community i live in has like digit people of color out of digit , so nobody i met in real life could be subject to this either .
   (ID: 6c99329e90a867248b7cd3a376f1a2fd57ae3994)

16. as someone who is bisexual and hasn  t told her parents , i don  t think it  s relevant unless you start seeing someone . i know it  s a huge part of a person  s identity , but i don  t see any reason to damage your relationship with your parents unless it  s going to benefit another relationship . does that make sense ? in my case , my friends know , my fiance knows , but i  ve never sat down with my parents and talked to them about it .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

17. ah , my mistake . i ' ve only built hgs so far so i ' m not too familiar with the rg scene . that said , i read on an old post that the rg grandpa was pretty badly designed , with tons of poor design choices , easily breaking parts etc . would any of you agree ? post in question
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

   (ID: 9a4083ece31f241c8374b733a1ef26a760deb17a)

19. i ' m i ' m canada lol . never seen a veteran or advertisement of something related to one ever . other than school .
   (ID: 83e7249cc03d41173f9e8ddb8ec1a71adef91e52)

20. yeah i  ve heard of that before , where i live it  s the freshmen trying to get seniors , but i guess it  s not that hard to believe basically putting on bets to see if you can sleep with someone
