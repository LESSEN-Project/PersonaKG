   (ID: 159a1a696667b6871cb8de2b957ac5dd05b77427)

3. i don ' t feel special for it , i wish that everyone felt that way . and i ' m sorry that i responded in a way that you think didn ' t answer the question  if you think it ' s irrelevant , that ' s what the downvote button is for . it ' s just my take on the question ' s topic .
   (ID: 0dd32da9f7e822909c258818ed313736b958a15a)

4. a relationship is difficult . you talked about it with her and she made the effort to stop what was bothering you , and for you getting over it is hard . some time apart can be healthy but trying to take her back so soon after may make thins hard for her as that was an issue you had . if you want to pursue the relationship forgive her , and try to start slow , don  t get right back into it , that can cause anxiety making things difficult for this new  early  period . of course everyone is difficult and thinks differently . but if you want to all i can recommend is to retry , you know her better than anyone here would . talk through every problem no matter how small . simply small talk helps build a connection , talk often and try to spend time outside together . no matter your choice i wish you best of luck .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

5. i am so sorry about what is going on right now . i wish i could give you a big hug right now . i think the best thing that you can do right now is to keep doing what you  re doing  just being by his side . tell him how much you love him and how thankful you are that he  s still alive . your dad must be heartbroken and i think reminding him that he is indeed love is the best thing that you can do right now .
   (ID: d95d3548a9506e48c5310c85f3b2994820405e0d)

   (ID: 76b9606d2d21bcdc24810e0215e37a6a9d45b771)

8. i wish my crush opened my room ' s door , rushed on me hugged me , and said  " its free real state " and kissed me dont you dare lie saying you never wanted that too .
   (ID: de0709ad19c458ffff0b96aab8fcfa9c40b24603)

9. i watched this when i was digit shortly after i saw forrest gump and i was struck by how similar the films were . each tells the story of a unique individual ' s life throughout history and the women he loves . however where zemeckis is overly sappy and a bit to hookey , fincher makes a much more subdued version with a whole lot more nuance . both pitt and blanchett give stellar performances and i wish we talked about their performances more . additionally , this is a lot more visual than zemeckis ' s film with blanchett ' s gazebo dance scene being a real highlight of fincher ' s visual style . all in all i like this a lot more than forrest gump and i think people deserve to give it another chance .
   (ID: a62b69d15e6c81a1a1acb2d0dd4bf9119038ff09)

10. wish my boyfriend would sleep  skype with me ! for some reason he just doesn ' t like the idea of it .

   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

14. i ' m not well  versed in trek , as i was always more of a wars fan . but spock was my main interest whenever i heard or read about the franchise . it ' s my understanding that he ' s only half  vulcan , but that he still has the option to flip his emotions like a switch , right ? it would seem feelings are internal and emotions are a physical counterpart to that , so either they have feelings all the time , or they can activate both whenever they wish . i think the whole concept is interesting . everyone should opt to be more like spock , because emotions are important for healthy living , but sometimes get in the way when making important decisions .
   (ID: 4f760107331d45dfdba746f7464dec4f0f14170d)

15. my mom , because she ' s the strongest , most awesome person i ' ve ever met and i wish i can be like her one day .
   (ID: bc8c44b6bdc162869dcaaa34272a8b4784f44b9f)

16. im digit and a recovering alcoholic . alcohol has ruined my life . most people drink so technically yes . this is something that makes you ' stand out ' but dont con  notate my words here , it makes you stand out in the absolute best way possible . maybe itll never create an issue in your life if you get drunk a few times , but looking over here from the other side of things , it only left me broke , with ruined relationships , guilt and shame . onward brethren i wish you the best outcome of whatever your life story has written . iwndwyt
