1. when it comes to story , i like it when it is more serious and dark , such as when batman kinda gets messed up in court of owls . as for characters , i really wanna expand my knowledge of superheroes so i ' d be down for whatever you guys think are good . however , i do like batman a lot as well as nightwing . how is teen titans received by the community ? ive always liked watching the show as a kid .
   (ID: b4fb8e20516a28baa38075931e9715db2375a956)

   (ID: 0254dc2f43007419c5c3fd1e155e6bf15fce137d)

4. i don ' t think it makes you a terrible human . its a bummer of a situation but if you aren ' t attracted to someone visually then you can ' t force it . i mean some people do . but that ' s usually for money .
   (ID: 0ffbddfe94023d7c5849c377e3fd6faac3ddc83c)

5. yeah it worked for me but definitely everyone has their own thing to cope and release all the stress and anxiety . it ' s about finding what works for you .
   (ID: d785eda10245445843c3355a0710d262b0d65bb9)

9. could you use the internet to learn ? have you ever considered talking to a counselotherapist about social anxiety ? i think small steps might help , it ' s overwhelming to step back and look at all the ways you think you ' re failing . the fact that you ' re getting through each day is something to be proud of .

10. i don ' t think people that are involved in the reason they can ' t shop together have a right to be hurt when other people can peacefully co  exist . the problem is them . they need to get over it and go together , or don ' t go together and stop being emotional about it . you get to go shopping with your mother . your sisters issues with her are not your fault , nor your problem .

12. digit the lady at the pizzeria said she would serve any customers who came into the shop but that she would not provide pizzas to a gay wedding . digit i seriously doubt the law would have covered her in this instance . no doubt she would have tried to use the law to cover her but i don ' t think it would have been upheld by any court . digit if she is really against gay weddings personally do you really think its right that she be forced to service a gay wedding or loose her business ? if you think its ok to force someone to do something they are morally against then i think there is something wrong with you personally . if you think its not ok for a person to make a living if they dont have the exact same values as you do , then again , i think that there is something wrong with you .
   (ID: 35eb47890f8874bbb988ec8308ba762f8377b3b8)

13. according to your logic on war america should have never intervened to take down hitler and they shouldn ' t intervene currently in the fight against isis . this right here is an example of what i am talking about when i say that you can not think for yourself . if you could think for yourself then your stance on something would stand true for everything within reason and logic .
