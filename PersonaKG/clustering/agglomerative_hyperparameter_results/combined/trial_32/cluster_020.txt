1. i almost got into a car accident . my life literally flashed before my eyes . i wondered what would happen to my priceless antique turkey baster collection . my family doesn ' t care for it nor do they know it ' s true value and might have gotten rid of it if i hadn ' t survived that close encounter with death .
   (ID: 225222aa213d7057c7af320e746ccbb2afeb2f27)

2. right after i finished ait , i got to go home on leave , and got extra time off for participating in the hometown recruiting program . one day after i was off duty , i walked across the street at the college while in uniform . usually people are polite and respectful , but this one guy walks up to me wearing the snobbiest rich kid outfit and says in the snobbiest voice ' theres better choices than the army ' i was so surprised that i didnt even say anything back . i mean , here is this rich preppy kid who has obviously never paid his own way , telling me im a scumbag for doing whats best for me . i wanted to turn around and ask him what some of those choices might be . ' go to school . ' ' on what money ? your parents may pay for your school , but mine couldnt afford it if they wanted to . ' ' get a job to pay for it ? ' ' thats what i did . you just dont approve of the job i picked ' ' well , if killing people is your idea of a job ' ' actually , im a cook . i dont go to combat ' ' well youre still helping others kill people ' ' and you have your freedom thanks to that ' so many times ive run through this conversation in my head , wishing i had set him straight . what a jackass . even two years later , it pisses me off to no end .

   (ID: d1e274dbfcf8ed1af55bb50c57e00046b961b6fd)

   (ID: 5078613a782f11088cff05f4503056b040cea999)

5. you  re so strong for making the decision you did though , just remember that . you  re worth so much more than the way he was treating you and you knew that  i hope you realise how amazing that is . so many people haven  t got as far as you have face  blowing  a  kiss
   (ID: 726d5aaac9472ccdcb64345cd6d082bee4eae6fa)

6. she made me dress in rags and basically clean all the time . i never got to anything i wanted  i was essentially her servant . i got treated horribly whilst my two step sister ' s got everything they could ever want . it was disgusting . however , it all changed one day when i go to go to a royal dance . it met a great person there , but when the clock hit midnight i had to leave ! luckily for me , however , the person i met at the dance was very resilient and searched all the land to find me . when they did find me , we got together at my step mother was punished by my fairy godmother . to this day , i still live with the person i met at the dance and life has been uphill ever since .
   (ID: 2bd0d072bfd734410249f20da9a2602d61eaaa05)

7. no ones stopping you from doing anything , it  s your choice . just know if you choose to keep trying for something in life , you can manifest it . yes it might not happen today or tomorrow , but you gotta go for it . life is just a game anyway , nobody knows wtf we  re doing . make the most of it , make it into something you  want  to do . again it  s all your decision , no one can tell you what you can or can  t do , just know you  ve got things in front of you you can make the most of .
   (ID: b5511d022d9aa43868b3f1a7ca2e4368d861570c)

8. as someone who has successfully made the jump numerous times from one unrelated job to another to another over the years , i find that employers want to understand how you can connect your previous experiences  background  etc to the job you are applying to . is there something in your background that you can connect to being a pharmacy tech ? something like " i enjoy marketing and one thing that ' s always intrigued me is the drug ads on tv which got me to doing research on medications " do you know someone in pharm tech or something related  " my friend works in pharm tech  i ' ve been researching on the internet about pharm tech careers  etc " tell that story keep it brief and connect it to the job you area applying to . don ' t just make up a story just to make up a story  employers contacting you for that initial screening see something in you  with the story you tell , they are also trying to figure out whether your story is sincere or if it ' s totally bs  guess which one gets scheduled for the interview ?

9. just gonna throw this out there but i think the older brother is gonna be ippos first pro opponent , cant remember his name but its the one who quit and got fat  they just look similar imo , have similarly aggressive personalities and overconfidence in their under trained fighting strength , its just a feeling .

15. i  m a bit late to the party here but i found both of these to be exquisite . the laptop typing is a huge trigger for me and you nailed it . the only thing that could make that better is the visual trigger of long nails , but that  s entirely a personal preference . i won  t recount what others have already said in regards to camera setup , i couldn  t put it better than they already have . being a regular viewer of your non  asmr stuff , i found this to still be in line with what i  d expect from a larkin love clip , and honestly there isn  t enough asmrotica . so thanks for contributing to that . outside the tapping , one of my personal favorite triggers is hair clipping and scalp massage . i  m sure you  ve got a long list of things you  d like to try for asmr . i  m curious what asmr you listen to achieve relaxation . there  s a few yt personalities that i  ve grown to love and look forward to listening to when they release new clips or role  plays . i  d be interested to see if we have any overlap . thanks again for being so personable and hope to listen to more asmr from you in the future .
