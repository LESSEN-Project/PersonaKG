Total from this dataset: 197

1. it ' s funny that you say that , i just compared our snoopsnoop profiles . seems like you need to take a break .
   (ID: 53aa6c267ff5eccf891e178786d41ca5df80a5de)

2. you can actually do a general psychology major , but experience in forensics can help labs , taking forensic psychology as a class and even criminology . if they don  t offer forensics as a concentration or even a class , it  s still okay . i would try more for experience , maybe shadow a forensic psychologist ? even if you can  t get experience , it isn  t the worst thing . having a general bio  psychology background with solid experience even if it isn  t in forensics specifically could get you into a forensic psych grad program , which is what really matters . focus on getting as much psych experience as possible , no matter what area if it is closely related than great ! but that isn  t a must . getting into a grad program is what matters most . you  d most likely need a psyd or phd to become a forensic psychologist . a clinical experience would look good with that , but any psych related experience is great .
   (ID: d9ec7752117a31823171b7cfc56b1cf267be53df)

3. i feel like i ' ve seen this question before somewhere , not sure though .
   (ID: bfc2e9a6e5f84327293fa1a1fd0287066782bcec)

4. i do that , but i need to remove like half of the image lol
   (ID: 9c91f42953bc8f6d2f718503a1924734b9da6acc)

5. intellectualized , damn straight . their music is top notch , but you don ' t need to be smart to like them . i hate their fanbase more than their music .
   (ID: 9a96ba583f43f670f5797ea5031052161bf613cf)

6. you sound like you are young with zero confidence . who gives a shit if he flips out . leaving him means you don  t have to deal with it . you really need to ask yourself why you love someone who treats you this way . if you really loved him , why are you posting for ways to make someone leave you ? it sounds like you don  t love him . you  re scared of him . you need to speak with a professional because a person who loves themselves don  t do things like this .
   (ID: 8ee36b7de5870d8a018edda36a1e88aee55b98f9)

7. that  s what i look like when i need to poop but can  t risk getting up .
   (ID: a7b9419fd0d77202baa763e253e9f634da5728c1)

8. yes , you need to tell someone . school nurse might help . but it may come down to child protective services . do you want to be pulled from your home and placed somewhere else ? it could come to that . is it really as bad as you think ?
   (ID: fca46720f9aa154a0559b1e4d2d28cb0df46b00a)

9. don ' t build circles , bridge them . from a career and personal standpoint , linking several social groups gives you more influence and resources , rather than hand picking and attempting to manipulate people . basically be the friend , be fair , and do your job as best you can and people will help you because they respect you . it ' s not right away or even in equal effort but they will help you when you need it . it beats cutting people down , dividing groups , and possibly being ousted from a group .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

10. you are so much more than your physical vessel . please stay , we need you here .
   (ID: 49a34e99b8a6ee0f246ab6ee16bec8f40a856dcd)

11. there ' s really no difference functionality  wise between the newer generations of smart phones . do we really need more powerful phones if we won ' t even use the to their full potential ? do we really need to go thinner instead of thicker for more battery life ? and storage is really dependent on how much money you throw at it . the only thing i see separating iphones and android phones at this point is the os and a headphone jack .
   (ID: 395865cc8932d0b3d13214bce052e8915f32835b)

12. not too many . you just need to hit the right spots . for example , one explosion would probably set off yellowstone , which could cause a fair bit of trouble .
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

13. just apply , you don ' t need any experience . you apply , they call you in , you take a test , if you pass they do an interview .
   (ID: 8f7369c6ebb47df350fec663be46dfd8481ee2db)

14. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .
   (ID: 8777ebe00a7403385686cc8962653ff5accb28f0)

15. this is gonna sound crazy , but . what if winning this tournament is a bad thing for germany ? because it doesn ' t show them where they would need to improve on the pitch for next year ? scolari didn ' t make any changes for brazil after digit . maybe i ' m talking out of my ass .
   (ID: 3fb1292a0bd26711d797fe1a61e6229794c21b68)

16. you really not comparing yourself to another when someone in your class is smarter and you tell yourself you are stupid . you are only comparing your brain to that person ' s brain . there ' s so much more to you than that one part of yourself . if you find yourself comparing just one part of yourself to another and getting down on yourself , you need to compare the whole person or at least more than digit characteristic . for example , that person is smart . but they don ' t have the same hobby that i have had for years which i have gotten so many compliments about .
   (ID: 1ebb4643f7e1e4d41ee2503d9b5d94ed0224c96b)

17. uhhhh you can just cup a fart with your hand and put it in your mouth . you don ' t need to be underwater to do this .
   (ID: b3497f72ed4462f0414951db6d9ee7aa4004b515)

18. because why would you need it , if it ' s for self defence and knife just as easily does the trick . if you like to shoot it go to a gun range . for what reasons would you need one in a home
   (ID: e9e31949fb9369b722c0967c2e5f8ec095f0b329)

19. if they  re not spending money then why does epic need to do extra for them ?
   (ID: 870d9d198f856764296262192823c935f1daf781)

20. if you need to scream . then do it , there is more room outside than inside .   x200b
