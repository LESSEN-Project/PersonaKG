   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)

4. it ' s boring , boring . served with a side order of boring . the stuff you ' ve included , involves too much , about your job , and not enough about you . get rid of your , you should message me section , it ' s just bad on a lot of levels " a nice guy in a stable job ! you should also include better photos . and smile . that half  smirk  smile thing , never really works , unless you ' re a super villain . the scuba pic is good , but a bit grainy . try to find some friends who will take your pix . outside of work .

7. yeah i understand ! it has a time and a place in my life i just made it an excessive habit and didnt treat it with the respect i should have i was a wake and bake every day into the night type of guy and i never admitted it was effecting me in an ill way because i was getting my work done and keeping things clean staying healthy but i neglected my mental state of mind living in an altered state of consciousness where i brushed everything off with a bowl just wasnt working for me anymore
   (ID: e3f34e146ce06ba2b5fc5a249c73494f93f56e86)

8. do you mean ' safe for work ' as apposed to nsfw ? if so does it have to be at work ? because i guess that would be this old guy john i used to work a sales counter with yelling " please stop ! " to an old lady walking into the show room that was about to walk over a piece of paper that had fallen on the floor , so he thought she would slip . she walked over it like it was nothing before looking up at him and starting to sign in sign language . because she was def . and therefor did not hear this old guy scream so loud his face turned beat red , and everyone that worked in that huge building heard and came over , but she didn ' t really pay attention so she didnt know what happened and no one told her lol . thats the sfw story i go to when talking to family or kids or whatever . idk if thats what your looking for .
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)

9. success doesn ' t have to translate to money . i always think if you work hard you ' ve earned the right to play hard . if you ' re bored , try focusing on a skill that could earn you money .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

   (ID: 5e646069de46abbfe6c3a4f3f3296eafe09fc9aa)

12. over all the bullshit that comes from being in a relationship with someone , especially when both have baggage and the other isn ' t willing to work with it
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

13. i know it  s needed so i respect all the workers , without them i cant go get a maccas cheeseburger at 2am . it  s justs not for me working all my life , i want to do something else where i can work in my own time . i  m being picked up as brand ambassador , so things like that
   (ID: 10f3c4c68efa9cd11f34f4a88f492c7d7e693418)

14. and i was merely saying that day after day of the same kind of work , it was inevitable that you would get some build up in those deeper nooks and crannies of your fingernails . especially by the end of the week . my girlfriend at that time thought it made me look more masculine since it showed i worked with my hands .
   (ID: a4cf7bd5112d789bb0b45477a071f936cf9b4ba7)

15. if you are trying to make witty comments , wear shirts that look nice , and make eye contact with other people at work , that is called socializing . if you are intimately touching , kissing , or attempting to see this person outside of work or work related functions then you are crossing a line . reassure your boyfriend about your attraction to him by telling and showing him . tell him gently and lovingly that he has no reason not to trust you , and you hope he can figure out a way to do that . then let him work on his trust issues . you are not in charge of his emotions . if he can ' t learn to trust you , a relationship evaluation is in order .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

16. yeah that ' s exactly what i ' ve been doing , i ' ll work on the getting the revs lower

   (ID: 011a531fc3f706d76441a0f95cc8091fd4453dd8)

18. follow your dreams . dont fall in line because you have to . if you got hurt at work be careful as fighting a workers comp case is absolute hell but if there is proof you were hurt at work they  ll pay you . at digit i had nothing to show as well , at digit im finally kind of getting a grasp on life . its tough and unforgiving so you must be the same way . i know people on vandwellers i believe it is that could help you make the most of life while living out of your van .
   (ID: 7fb221c65b0aa5e32543ead5c04838c55702107e)

19. why does this only work when you ' re alone ? i do this when other people are around . my colleagues only intervene if the conversation turns into an argument
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

20. to justify spending the money i make , i ask myself " why the hell do you work so hard " it ' s to spend my money they way i want . why do you work so hard to give someone else a comfy life ? they didn ' t take your tests or experience your stress . you have no obligation to pay for someone else just because you make more . also , you ' re not her ex . you ' re you . be you , don ' t try to be them , they split for a reason . to answer your question , i say don ' t compare yourself to someone ' s ex . you can either feel guilty , or you can go broke .
