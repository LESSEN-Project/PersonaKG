3. you don ' t know any adults who nurse to sleep right yikes ? only me . no just kidding ! hahaha lol . it ' s my wife who nurses of course but i ' ll tell her about the shortening thing . i don ' t think she times it though . we have tried the ferber method and she screamed for a couple hours so we stopped that . never tried extinction because we don ' t like the idea of it . i ' m glad it worked for you though that ' s awesome .
   (ID: 70dae4f10700534d78c70b4931932d38e3fa7df5)

4. because you were obviously born here , have an excellent command of english and you ' re an aussie reddit user , so i ' d imagine reasonably well informed and educated and likely , left leaning . i ' m making assumptions here just as you make assumptions about these people and their situation . i ' m assuming you aren ' t working because you ' re picky about what you ' ll do to earn a dollar , consider yourself above physical labour and simply working hard , seeking opportunities where you can find them . or the most likely assumption is that you ' re just damn lazy .
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

5. good point , i guess we ' ll have to figure it out when that happens
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

6. this is a really important thing to think about , and i ' m glad you ' re considering this . i genuinely believe there is far too much focus among the prepper community on extreme ' bullets and beans ' prepping , and little on general preparedness among communities . i ' ve spent years thinking about this with my prepper friends . over time , we ' ve put together some pretty interesting pieces of on how to encourage preparedness . i ' ll link them below in case they ' re of any use to you . how can we make prepping mainstream ? encouraging others to prep  how should we frame prepping ? interested to read other people ' s comments here  i think it ' s great preppers are thinking about this so much !   x200b

8. i was reaching out for a special someone  but you ' ll do .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

9. it does matter , i suggest empty stomach because you ' ll get the munchies and it ' s that much better when your on empty .
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

10. you  re wilding out . that is normal , fact is he  s forthcoming and is telling you when he  s hanging out with his girl  friends . you have to look within yourself and ask what is the source of your anger , truly . do you really trust him ? are you jealous of his friends ? etc . most people are just jealous or insecure , nothing wrong with it , but see if he is willing to introduce you to his girl  friends and maybe that  ll put you at ease .
   (ID: b5cc14fd703a97548093b4e06f7e3e92575b80b9)

11. i went through a very strange intense type of sexual abuse for years . i was basically brainwashed to be a sex slave . long story short tons if hypnosis and drugs and eventually i was so broke . with no sense of identity and tons and tons of shame . i became q shell of a person who just did what they were told . i ' ve been raped , prostituted out . tons if horrible things . i did get away from the sexual abuse for the most part however there are tons and tons of lasting effects on my identity and mentality . there are also lots and lots of pictures and videos of me . i was told that the videos had to be convincing and people had to believe i wanted to do it . i believe this was intentional so if i ever did get out it would further shame me and ruin me . all the physical and mental conditioning had specific reasons behind it . sense i escaped im a digit year old guy however i look really young due to the whole chemical castration thing i ' ve been drifting between sleeping on people couches and being homeless . i ' ve had digit failed suicide attempts from when it was happening to now . whenever i ' m in public , especially around men , or anytime anyone has any kind of control or authority over me i freak out and shut down and want to start hurting anyone and anything . i cant function . any tiny amount of failure sets me off behind belief . i can lose in a video game . or even start off doing bad and then end up doing good and winning but if anything bad happens , if i can perceive myself as not good enough in any way i spiral . i start out in ng myself in the face until it swells up or i cut myself . i ' ve done therapy , i ' ve done hotlines , i ' ve tried to do mental health programs . nothing works . their is no escape from being me . sometimes i ' ll have such bad nightmares i ' ll be afraid to go to sleep and i stay up until it ' s literally painful . anything that could possibly be wrong is . the past month or digit i ' ve been set in dying and camt even get enough money to buy charcoal to kill myself . the only reason i ' m even alive right now is because i ' m allowed to sleep on my sisters couch . however her mentality is she will not do anything that would give me a reason . to get a job . so to eat all i have are eggs and plain chicken patties with no bread . she believes giving me absolutely nothing to be happy about will just change me and all of a sudden i ' ll be functional . i cant do it anymore . even if by some miracle i was able to function in a minimum wage job i wouldn ' t be able to support myself . my sister has made it clear that if ibd ok not have a job very soon . i ' m homeless again . and if i do have a job i have to leave and move out . which in southern california is to expensive to do even if i got and was able to continuously do full time work . everything sucks . as a kid i really loved kingdom hearts . the character roxas in the game has a super shitty live and was never meant to exist . i related with him a lot . before i die i ' d like to know how the story ends simply so i can enjoy something one last time .

12. it depends , honestly . were the charges nolled because you did some type of ar  jail diversion program ? how far is your army recruiter from you ? if they ' re local just bring all your documents if you still have them . if not give them a call , and explain the situation . they ' ll probably tell you right off the bat . i don ' t have my regulations in front of me at the moment , plus i recruit for the national guard so we have our own regulations on top of the army ones .
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

13. i ' ll do it later . maybe tommorow . eh it ' s not due for another day . oh , would you like at the time , i ' ll need to wait till next morning . oh crap i forgot about doing that .
   (ID: dc1fd340b3e0a603d715d06c129c512b8197c37b)

14. you have to go to the post office . they ' ll verify the label is correct and weigh it and everything .
   (ID: 90779ea1e5aa2ec3ed3a1fa6b99a8207c0d66d3e)

15. your mileage may vary . i practiced on a friends car for a couple hours before i got my first car with a manual , i did ok at first , but there were definitely a lot of stressful moments the first month or two . hill starts were really scary , and one time i tried to start in 3rd on a hill and smoked the living hell out of the clutch . but now , a year and a half later i feel like a pro , double clutching with the best of them . my girlfriend , on the other hand , is hopeless . we have spent digit hours in a parking lot , and she still asks me which petal is which when we start a session , and can get the car moving maybe once or twice without getting fed up . i ' ll teach her eventually though .
   (ID: 9b41f9c0d7bce732d9af75c3b13bd58e9ce2a1e1)

16. try to advertise as much but in a nice and respectful way on big trending channels where you ' ll most likely be noticed , i do the samei don ' t really ask ppl to sub to me but they do tho and i ' ve gotten almost digit subs already in a few months , also try to make content on what ' s popular right now and add as many tags in the desc of your videoif you add really many tags your video might even become the 1st shown for a specific search
   (ID: a443986595c715cd541cd3925619cb6f1e8ada83)

17. i think in all fairness , i should explain to you exactly what it is that i do . for instance tomorrow morning i ' ll get up nice and early , take a walk down over to the bank and . walk in and see and , uh . if you don ' t have my money for me , i ' ll . crack your fuckin ' head wide  open in front of everybody in the bank . and just about the time that i ' m comin ' out of jail , hopefully , you ' ll be coming out of your coma . and guess what ? i ' ll split your fuckin ' head open again . ' cause i ' m fuckin ' stupid . i don ' t give a fuck about jail . that ' s my business . that ' s what i do .
   (ID: 380598f491e44cdd92f2ec6105505f0f439372e2)

18. " lola " is literally one of my favorite songs of all time . i think i ' ll listen to it right now . thanks for the prompt .
   (ID: 259e025807a2eee6eaf38242805e7dfc46aaa91f)

19. i ' ll let you know when it happens .
   (ID: 920ba0628cbea5588ecca4c8ba7f80b411ff70ef)

20. it ' s funny that you have this ego centric idea that everyone that disagrees with you is a whiny snowflake baby , and you , the one that supports a reality tv star known for being a whiny baby , are somehow the superior man . i seem to remember a whole eight years of crying when obama was in office . the media did to him much worse than what ' s happening with trump . trump is literally just giving fuel for the fire . and honestly , i think of him as a distraction from actual governing . he acts out more when important things happening . i ' m crying not from dispair , but from laughter . you think he ' ll get a second term . now i ' m gonna sit back and wait for the ' beta cuck ' insults to start rolling in
