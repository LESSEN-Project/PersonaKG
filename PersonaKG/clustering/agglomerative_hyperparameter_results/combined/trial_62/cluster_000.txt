8. i  m sorry i can  t offer some kind of fix all solution for you . it  s a tragic thing  years later and my mother  s still stuck in her old ways . the only thing you can do for them is try to be supportive . as i learned , though , some people . they really just don  t want to get better . it  s a sad life to live , and it hurts to see , but there truly isn  t much you can do . patience is key , and if they can truly find it in themselves to seek a better life , then they will  it may take days or it may take years . overall , it  s just a question of ,  is it worth it ?  do you truly want to stick around through thick and thin , then the answer is yes . unfortunately , i believe you  re already doing all you can by being a supportive friend . maybe he  s not quite as far gone as my mother was , and a family  friend intervention could at least get the wheels turning ? other than that , i regret to say that i have no advice . best of luck xx
