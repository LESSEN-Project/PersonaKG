   (ID: d34c3e58ec43e53b7d6bfdd857ddcfa727257f80)

2. jesus no we didnt need a whole other film but i thought they made some questionable choices for the last act . visually i thought the snapped heroes returning was pretty meh . it shouldve been strange leading them out of digit massive portal , instead we get t ' challa first . why ? and the whole assemble felt too spaced out . get rid of all the filler warriors and have the main heroes together and get a better run  up action scene , they shouldve used the angle that was in the infinity war trailer that had hulk running through wakanda .
   (ID: 5fa74a7d6a70c6f2f8a149864f494ac72eefd3e4)

3. i first heard about fire emblem through smash , specifically the over abundance of characters and i thought  hey ! this can  t be that bad right ?  so i downloaded heroes late digit and the rest is history . oh also waifus

   (ID: 3ba6725e8f1b7a123febfe8a266ec0dc4d054b65)

6. this is one of those people new to tf2 who thought they would like to share a video with u , so lower those pitchforks , or just a kid who wants karma , in that case , shower him in downvotes
   (ID: 5a485308ca6e36eb17d7b0fc321fcf7695f3af53)

10. true at the time i didn ' t connect it , but afterwards i thought the same thing . he sort of just disappeared . the only other person i could think of being " the american " would be brenner , but i have my doubts about that .
   (ID: 36314aee005a03517f2446ec0da2834fe0f712d6)

   (ID: f4588f2a476206e602fe5b84647a1e777eaae604)

12. i  m not talking about your initial comments , i  m talking about the whole conversation . and during this conversation , you  ve been all over the place . you  ve told me that you  re just giving me food for thought and i shouldn  t actually change what i  m doing , then you blatantly told me you  re telling me to change what i  m doing . you  ve called me apathetic , then you  ve told me i  m taking it personally . i should stop reading into your comments , but you get to interpret mine however you want . now you  re saying you enjoy disney movies , but you draw the line at writing quotes on the board . that  s not where i draw the line , and i  m sorry you feel that  s wrong . we could discuss the meaning of that song and why i specifically chose that lyric , but i  m not really wanting to open that can of worms with so many other things already on the table . what you  re not seeming get is that i  m not trying to do any mixing . i  m not making grey , as you suggest . i  m keeping the two issues entirely separate . and the definition of apathy is showing a lack of emotion or an indifference . i am telling you that i have thought a lot about my stances on these issues and am far from apathetic .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

13. that ' s definitely a good choice , timex is a solid entry level brand with a long horological history . if you ' re still on the fence , or want other options , consider what style he will use the most . does he like intricate , mechanical things , or is he more into the fashion aspect of it ? what sort of workplace environment does he work in  is he outdoors and  or working with his hands a lot , does he wear a suit and tie ? do you want this to be a watch to only put on for special occasions , or more for everyday use ? does he own any other watches ? watches are often one of the only pieces of jewelry a man will wear other than a wedding band , so it ' s usually worth it to put some thought into it , which it definitely looks like you ' re doing so kudos ! if you decide on the timex , you ' ve made a good decision . if you want other suggestions and can help narrow it down a bit , i ' m sure we here at  watches can help you out !
   (ID: 2e34fbd58bc49726f7e8c74b8ea82513ca226ab4)

14. i actually thought this would of happened already . but then no one will walk their eevees for this anymore .
   (ID: a1ba9b657b043ce2934cc0ae7b42c0a0bf3ba2fa)

15. personally i think the flavors go well together . i ' ve heard people talk about acidity being the main factor as to why they don ' t go for it and that i can understand . i just don ' t like people saying it ' s weird or the thought of fruit on pizza baffles them .
   (ID: 2db14c004e6ef125f85aa3678978a5718eebd11a)

16. this is a guy who woke up that morning and thought   what is the most pointlessly dangerous thing i can do today ? yep , i will carry a heavy , sharp object , balanced precariously on one arm through the town centre . and yes , i will angle the corners to maximise soft tissue damage .  fucking retard .

17. i thought you had to do something to wood to be able to smoke out of it safely , like when it ' s heated it emits some kind of poison .
   (ID: 5c9dd67e95ee5403b2bd9a6848c017674d46396b)

18. anytime . there ' s also the amount of alcohol he drank to consider . honestly i ' ve thought about getting a squad for my roommates over that alone . a bottle of jameson is a lot of liquor , i don ' t care how much you weigh . whatever you decide to do , keep yourself safe . i hope it goes well . do not let him back into your life after this . you ' re through with this fuckin scrub , and you have better things awaiting you .
   (ID: 81aef4a1b477688be90d95bcd1c4cce42438c660)

   (ID: ea3b9395602c702397d514c6da7049b089458032)
