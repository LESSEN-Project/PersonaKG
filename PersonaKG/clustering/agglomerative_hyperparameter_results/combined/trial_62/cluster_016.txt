1. we want to hear it so we can fix it or oh god not this again ! there ' s two types of managers and owners . sorry i don ' t have a better answer but that ' s just how it is ! i will say though that hilton holds a very high standard and that stuff will not fly for long . the next inspection they get will likely get those types of issues fixed . just always be kind when reporting issues like that . most times we would certainly want those things to not be issues but our hands are tied budget , staffing , time etc . trust me . our job is easiest and most fun when our guests are happy !

4. mosquitoes . they cause the most human deaths compared to any other living thing . seriously , whenever i see one flying around , whether it ' s minding its own business or looking for a midnight snack , i get my zapper and dart to the other side of the room . i ' m literally fine with a spider , i even held a jumping spider to put it outside , with my bare hands ! but i can ' t even look at a mosquito without trying to reach for my zapper . i just realized that i made this a confession . sorry to those who didn ' t want to hear that .

16. dude i am super glad to hear your little dude is ok . i bet he ' s happy and healthy . sorry if this question bothered you , it just kinda hit me all the sudden that like in those movies where it ' s pulled off well , it would be devastating to a parent . then again i only have dogs , but i know i wouldn ' t even be able to stand seeing that in a movie
   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

17. but my point wasn ' t that . this is literally not a part of islam . yes a woman has to dress modestly but dressing like that is for horny men that cannot control themselves . personally i respect all women decided covering their hair but this . sorry but this is not islam . this is straight up misogyny . you can dress modest without turning into a fuckin ninja . and you ' d be surprised how many " muslim " women take advantage of dressing like that . i can link a lot of articles from turkey where a woman dressed like that committed a crime

18. i ' m sorry if i was confusing in my reply . i ' m not trying to discourage anyone . i actually consume soy products daily . i was trying to convey that if you are concerned with phytoestrogens you should check with your pcp . i would also tell a meat eater the same if they are concerned with a certain aspect of thier diet .

19. wait i have another question , sorry for bugging you , but should i just say  hey  or should i open up and go straight to the problem ?
