1. i hope this becomes a big trend . its so satisfying seeing people die this way
   (ID: 8f5b0c902ce9c2bf19ecdb9205cb3d9f2a7c14fa)

2. i said digit  are failing , not useless . i hope they all become great members of society , but i am not that naive . how have you proved anything yourself ? seriously , tell me what you consider being useful to society ? how has gaming motivated you to be useful to the world ?
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

3. because they hope to pop a vessel
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

4. had pretty much the same experience on switch with the new update and it ' s especially infuriating that i can ' t unlock the gunslinger due to crashing and bugs almost unlocked him twice as well . game crashes each floor when trying to unlock the gunslinger and carrot blasphemy ' s hitbox seems to be massive when i ' m facing left . hope they fix this stuff soon although i don ' t mind having a massive hitbox for blasphemy even if it is a bug .
   (ID: 7df89b558f49c9f710c5f928f61dae67f52229c7)

5. if you ' re in your 40s or younger , there ' s still hope . i ' m working on a theory right now .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

6. well you were correct which does say something . i will say that i would hope more minorities would agree with what i ' m saying , those who have experienced the worst of discrimination are usually the most motivated to end it .
   (ID: 90779ea1e5aa2ec3ed3a1fa6b99a8207c0d66d3e)

7. you can ' t really know tbh . i hope it doesn ' t happen to me as well .
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

8. remember this isn ' t the actual list . it sucks for now , but theres always hope that something gets hit which makes the price less ridiculous . maybe after shvi the deck goes the way of qlips and turns into dark planet turbo .
   (ID: 46f455b780faca36116964131a4d0622c465bf7f)

9. although i can ' t really relate , i can imagine how amazing that must be for somebody really into horse riding ! hope you have a good day !
   (ID: 3e1762624e55cdfb0929da3e1a1c438675e0c217)

10. i hope stark and the captain survive the end game .
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

11. fuck . it ' s very likely my dream girl will not mean with me from a personality standpoint . meaning there s no hope for a relationship , so there no point in putting in effort to make love
   (ID: 2bb956084cb9bf79f58345d6cf6beca98e76bbb4)

12. if you ' re a girl i hope you get stabbed in the vagina
   (ID: 2ea109772fcc0738f65030d7584f4ec864e785dd)

13. i  m digit so i  ve seen some great usc and some rougher usc so i can agree with you there . however , i can  t say that my falcons allegiance has built more character than it has broken and hope of ever holding a lead in any sport ever .
   (ID: 7e06b6173caa339822499761ab78ee796513d9aa)

14. this is one case i really hope gets solved soon . i hate to think how many other children have been abused and  or killed by the person  s responsible for this . it makes me sick . the eggplant thing stands out . makes me wonder if it ' s a convenient choice farmer or seller of eggplants , or if it ' s a sick variation on those porn videos where women stick everything from wine bottles and cucumbers to traffic cones in themselves just to show they can , only with kids .
   (ID: ef7434997159219f750735c89670b9fc3bdad5c3)

15. " goodbye , nola ! hope that little nail selling bastard keeps you happy , this time " i just say it or think it to myself for specific reason .
   (ID: f4e4929bb0bef09e7eb72aaccf20c2d9454729c7)

16. and then they  d likely sanitise it or not serve the food . what do you think happens in a regular restaurant when that happens ? they just leave the blood and hope for the best ?
   (ID: 4345d92dae99b45255ddd6b7f7c88a7ad331da93)

17. honestly the best thing for you to do is to tell your boyfriend straight up the entire situation . i don  t think the relationship will last sadly after that because he is straight and he can  t force himself to be attracted to you afterwards , but for your own personal happiness and mental health you need it tell him and transition . but who knows he might still retain attraction to you afterwards , it is a possibility . i know how bad dysphoria can be , my partner is trans and i  ve been with them before and after their transition and they  re much happier now than they were before . i hope you too can remain friends since all that would happen is that he loses attraction . best of luck to you , be brave and you can make it through . i hope all goes well red  heart
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

18. their goal is survival of the regime beyond all else , killing the us president and killing thousands of south koreans would not be useful for that purpose . it ' s likely that they would only use artillery  nuclear weapons when they feel there is no hope of survival for the regime .
   (ID: 8d3203bd3c61b13e57c27bd43fd1be11143f449a)

19. all of the games are great in their own way but if you cried from  digit , you should go all the way back to the beginning and see how it all came together . i really hope  digit is not the last one , i would be very happy to see them do a full  on prequel about his first adventure .
   (ID: a18adc4ad3b28b34dfa3063a1c77566b8681a79d)

20. i hope you  re doing okay . i am now in your shoes , and it sucks . one of my best friends killed himself digit days ago . when all of our friends are together it isn  t so bad , but when i  m alone all i can do is look at pictures of him and think about it .
