1. i don ' t know really , however . i hope something happens , the thought of everything just ending is kind of depressing
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

2. seeing a lot of negative comments saying get help . guys , this is a game where you time and time again , without thought , shotgun blast mofos across the room . op was just descriptive and obviously has a unique play style . at some point we have all saved , committed crimes against humanity , then reloaded . to the op , optionally you can attempt to be a pickpocket expert and just take the gun maybe never actually have seen his inventory in that quest .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

3. i think i would rather people be outright with their curiosity . at bowling last week i got an arm thrown around me " so , what are you doing . he ' s french so i thought he was just having a bad english moment . " how ? i ' m good . he proceeds " no , what are you doing , how do i say this " arms flail in a circular motion . jebus just say it .
   (ID: 7911b1d92de80b0e1abd4e2a29e4f762a8a2908f)

4. i saw that movie once in elementary school , teacher skipped all the good parts including the end , always thought it was a bad movie since . even worse it was the same teacher that allowed i am legend to be shown in full
   (ID: 2e2a44cdfc726423ec202a2fe420543af441d1ad)

5. i ' ve been alive for digit years , never thought about this and thinking back at literally yesterday still don ' t have an answer
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

6. anytime . there ' s also the amount of alcohol he drank to consider . honestly i ' ve thought about getting a squad for my roommates over that alone . a bottle of jameson is a lot of liquor , i don ' t care how much you weigh . whatever you decide to do , keep yourself safe . i hope it goes well . do not let him back into your life after this . you ' re through with this fuckin scrub , and you have better things awaiting you .
   (ID: 81aef4a1b477688be90d95bcd1c4cce42438c660)

7. i thought i knew it all  megadeth cause at certain points in life ou do think you know it all only to have a curve ball come on down the line and i had no clue what was going on .
   (ID: 3cc69335d54dfe26e103753b56ad7268563823e2)

8. i haven ' t been everywhere in the world but enough places outside of the states to come to the conclusion that minimal eye contact is an american thing . a lot of the places i ' ve been the social norm leans more toward staring . i thought maybe it ' s just cause i was a tourist i get extra attention but noticed how people interact with their other countrymen . i guess what i ' m saying is eye contact is fine and a simple smile or wave to acknowledge the other party makes it less awkward .
   (ID: 109fa004cbb85f6a703624f8b4393d7d7d685509)

9. kid , expand your thinking . what would happen if everyone thought like you ? if banging chicks is the ultimate measure of success , we ' d probably go back to the time when sultans kept harems . women are humans , not trophies for you to ejaculate in .
   (ID: dfcca9c384a4fff7bbeb3cd1fb2f40aacb47fd7e)

10. i ' ve never been good at social interactions , the guys at my elementary school liked to fight people and hit them for fun , and i wanted to get along with them . i liked to run and was very fast , so i would tell the boys in my class that if they catch me the could beat me up . i thought that we were friends until one of them broke my feet by kicking it so hard and broke my glasses . i guess i would have done whatever to have friends .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

11. original post is awesome , so i thought to make it into a meme so people who dont scroll through all could see it and smile . it seems it ' s made 12k  smile so i see it as a win .
   (ID: dc1fd340b3e0a603d715d06c129c512b8197c37b)

12. you ' re ridiculous and making your whole movement look bad . do you want to know why vegans are seen as a joke to so many people ? because of the ones like you that are outspoken but can ' t form a proper thought .
   (ID: 9447b1479bba35e43476f822ef86882e0d4d70d7)

13. correct me if i ' m wrong , but i thought that this sub was for ads on reddit , not on outside sites . especially not a financial site talking about the financial success of a company . which is their job . i mean , just look at this page
   (ID: 73a501f273781aa2c0deb878ecb02dcab3a9d4d3)

14. i thought you had to do something to wood to be able to smoke out of it safely , like when it ' s heated it emits some kind of poison .
   (ID: 5c9dd67e95ee5403b2bd9a6848c017674d46396b)

15. just started my second year and my old friends ditched me cause the thought i was weird , and they didn  t have a good rep so people think i  m a douche
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

16. not hating on the guy at all , but i honestly thought he was like a one hit wonder . shows how little i pay attention to country i guess .
   (ID: 55510b17a4f0d7b5820e6f21287525ef6cd60994)

17. the title sounded like sarcasm , so i thought the truck was gonna ruin the person ' s business somehow .
   (ID: d298609ba6b9516031b9d0b9bc9217d85ce28f05)

18. haha this is my first time but it  s really a no on the chemistry ? i thought i was on to something . if none of those are right , my second guess would be digit , french and studying history
   (ID: d9ec7752117a31823171b7cfc56b1cf267be53df)

19. i don ' t know for sure , still struggling myself to be honest . but going with the same analogy , if we can all let go of a clenched fist , can we also do the same with our thinking ? there have been moments when i got so tired of thinking that i simply just let go . and in that few moments of letting go there was a feeling of true liberation . usually my mind works like this  i think of something " bad "    i tell myself that i shouldn ' t think of that bad thing but i can ' t    i tell myself i should stop thinking about stop thinking about that bad thing but it only gets worse    each time i think of anything a judge in the background says it ' s good or bad and that i should do this and don ' t do that    i get anxious because the vicious mental cycle starts stacking up into a shit storm . but whenever i ' m in the " letting go zone " , the thoughts still happen , but the judge kinda disappears . " i shouldn ' t think like this " becomes just a thought judging another thought , instead of you judging your thoughts . the best i can come up with to describe this feeling is total allowing . super sorry for the rant !

20. interesting question , actually have given this much thought . first off , this time will be known as the english speaking era . british empire , usa , all that rot  and well into india and china doing things on the world stage   but it ' ll be by the english speakers . depending on how things go right about now , our abuse of abundance will probably be our greatest shame .
