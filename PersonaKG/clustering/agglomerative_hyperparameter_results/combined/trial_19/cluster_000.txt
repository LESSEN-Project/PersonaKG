8. hey , i know there ' s a thousand other comments on here , but just wanted to say real quick that you didn ' t do anything wrong . dude sounds like a hassle to say the least , and anyone who is willing to flip on you and humiliate you online is not someone you should be wasting your time with . that ' s some immature , disrespectful , petty shit . it seems like you feel guilty to an extent , which i understand , but don ' t linger on the guilt . once it passes you ' ll realize you did yourself a favor by setting some standards of what you will and won ' t put up with . lots of people choose to stay unhappy in their relationships and that is an unhealthy way to live .
