1. you deserved all this for fucking your way into a country . there ' s plenty solutions for papers and you left the love of your life for them . you don ' t love him .
   (ID: e0c81b4b90b0c79cd330827a7fe15c4ac2958b48)

2. ben shapiro rocks ! he ' s intelligent , well  informed and cool  headed . love that man .
   (ID: 3de4b885645ecd39fdcb6a1daf410341eb118d2c)

3. huh . i never romanced tali but i figured he would say it at some point , maybe you missed it ? i don ' t think shepard ever says it first though , i remember him answering " i love you too " to most of them , but not the other way around . i guess it ' s usually the love interests who confess their undying love and stuff , shep tends to show more with actions than words .
   (ID: 9986ae9dc79e871f6701d6323d4b631234b6ef8c)

4. am i missing something here ? you love your boyfriend but hard hanging out alone in your room with a drunk guy who tried to kiss you . you stop him and clarify that this is a no go and you love your bf . perfect . but then you have him spoon with you all night as a comfort to you ? that makes no sense . but whatever . if it is eating you up inside and you really truly did not do anything , you should tell him . i mean why not  particularly since there is no longer contact with the mf .
   (ID: 6f13975ce6a8747ec3d0e2207b9ef86d80a28713)

5. i honestly love the dc now that i ' m not in a trailer anore . it ' s just a bunch of digit year olds training eachother on power equipment . what could possibly go wrong ?

8. ok love . how about the cathedral in naples which holds a vial of blood from an early christian martyr , st . januarius . reportedly , the blood is dry most of the year , but mysteriously liquefies three times throughout the year , on days commemorating his life and impact . i think that one would be testable ?

10. one where i find love
   (ID: 32b13ea4ca437349e9a1e08776a6ff36cef70328)

11. i had philophobia . i don ' t know if i still have it . it ' s basically the fear of love . i have it because of my parents . i had to watch them constantly argue . their sick relationship and the fact that they hardly ever showed any signs they loved me , caused some brain damage to me and now i usually can ' t listen when somebody is talking about love , especially very traditional love . i hate family as a unit and i hope i will never have children . also i find newborn babies disgusting because they are kinda a " a fruit of love " .
   (ID: 337350fc54133b327ce0d6d9f385f82a2a6738cf)

12. yes she is very close to her stepmother . you asked about our relationship , we have been in a de facto relationship for about digit . digit years now . i have been doing what i can to comfort her and be there for her . i took her out to lunch today i actually wrote this post on the drive home to take her mind off of things and get out of the house . at the moment she is ok then bursts into tears at random times so all i can do is hug her , tell her i love her and let her cry it out . when she was told she cried and then asked to be left alone for a while so if she needs some space i think she will tell me . thank you for the advice , there is a lot there to take in so i will have to read it a few times . her stepmother still might pull through and beat it , but all we can do at this stage is hope for the best . thank you again for helping me understand and giving me pointers on how to approach this .

19. most of your critiques  praises are based off the film ticking  not ticking your agenda . bisexual warrior queen ? lol mmkay . people love valkyrie because shes an awesome character , period . not because of her briefly hinted sexuality from a deleted scene .
