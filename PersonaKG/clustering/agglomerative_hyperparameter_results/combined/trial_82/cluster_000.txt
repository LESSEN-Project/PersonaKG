14. i quit in mid september with chantix , after smoking for a little over digit years . i stumbled once in november and lit one . it tasted like crap , and i threw it out . chantix made it easy for me . i lost interest in smoking . the cravings became fewer and didn ' t last long unless you dwell on them . the nightmares were really vivid at times , but after a while , i actually enjoyed them . i heard it was like watching a 3d movie on acid , but i ' ve never taken acid so i don ' t really know . one very important thing to remember is to eat something when you take it , and follow it up with a full glass of whatever you want to drink . don ' t just drink enough to swallow the pill or you will get horrible cramps or nauseated . make sure you take it for at least three months , to completely break the habit . also , taper off of it to digit pill a day , and then digit  digit pill a day for the last two weeks to avoid headaches . it helps . one last thing . get allen carr ' s stop smoking book and read it . i didn ' t get any earth shattering information out of it , but it did help . between the chantix and the book , i quit and i don ' t miss it at all . wish i would have done it years ago . if i can do it , so can you . good luck !

   (ID: f3192aa413ed905a2d6bc7e74ae65b23517e05a0)

17. takei ' s exact quote was  " i take no solace or joy in this man ' s passing . we will not dance upon his grave , nor stand vigil at his funeral holding " god hates freds " signs , tempting as it may be . he was a tormented soul , who tormented so many . hate never wins out in the end . it instead goes always to its lonely , dusty end .
