8. i think you ' re overanalyzing this pic , op never said anything about men or women , he probably meant something along the lines of " from ' having a penis ' to ' not having a penis anymore ' " , without mentioning gender , sex or self  identity , this is literally only about losing a dick , it doesn ' t matter if it was an operation or an amputation also this is a meme about a tv character , why on earth would you be offended
   (ID: 4cd63391f1644eb1dde02717bf6a72fc6c22acc7)

10. ah . still , if you are stabbed and then seek the person out to hurt them , i think you are probably technically violating the rule . only if you are punching them to keep from being stabbed are you in the exception .
   (ID: df28c2a39b633ca418192316a199668289382292)
