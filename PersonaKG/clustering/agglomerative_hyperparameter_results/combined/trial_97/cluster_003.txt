   (ID: c863a7172df41853f354be7adff4b3f9a0cb9736)

3. a friend of mine was being a dick on a constant daily basis after a recent event happened . like he would criticize every thing i did like how i played a game or ate food or even laughed . it bothered him so much he had to say something harsh every damn minute . but his comments pissed me off so much after a few months that one day i snapped and screamed in front of all our friends " diego you became a fucking asshole ever since your dad died " and there my moment was .
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

5. i discovered i was pregnant at digit , almost digit . just like you i want to be a mother but i want to have a stable situation to do so . i just began college so it was a really bad news . however i live in france so all is paid with the social security it ' s called like that in france . i saw a doctor and i had to do blood tests and an scan to know the stage of the pregnancy digit weeks . then they gave me a drug which provokes a miscarriage . it hurts and there ' s a lot of blood and you ' re going to bleed almost digit month after that but it ' s not that bad , a labour hurts surely more ! i was alone during the abortion because the guy didn ' t want to be involved and i never said my parents , i was too ashamed and i didn ' t want them to be disappointed by me . i ' ll maybe tell them one day . don ' t feel stupid , you took the birth control , you just didn ' t have luck . it ' ll be okay , your boyfriend will certainly support you during this event . you ' ll never forget but you ' ll know you made the right choice and that when you ' ll be ready to have a child , you will offer him a great life .

7. really try to take advantage of your degree , especially if it ' s something that still interests you . only work where you can increase your value  knowledge . developing the habit of consistently giving your full attention  mental ability to every single task . no matter how beneath your abilities they are or trivial they may seem to you . never let your lack of knowledge get in the way , asking questions is not shameful . the people above you if they ' re smart should not be treated as threats to your career . look at them as your greatest resources be mindful of where your relationship stands with those with more experience  training and time on the job . show no aggressive behavior , only show true interest in the knowledge they can provide you . increasing the skills that benefit your value to others is something that should always be a top priority in the back of your mind . like in all aspects of life focusing on your own personal growth helps not just yourself . groups of humans have a remarkable ability to create a unified intelligence . when one part of this intelligence is disciplined and focused on improving their individual role they will strengthen the whole group . i ' m a 2nd year union plumbing apprentice btw . before that i work for a music festival production company . everything i said comes from my own eperiences . things may be different for you .

   (ID: 40a3b3e3ead468881f7392ff22e867f06207755d)

12. years ago , i finally saw a therapist after dealing with depression for a while . i was able to mostly open up . i cried . it was productive . first , because it was a load off my shoulders   being able to confide in someone who wouldn ' t judge and was there to help . till then , i had hidden my depression and didn ' t deal with it . second , i was able to uncover the underlying cause of my depression . just knowing what it was helped me tremendously . so go in , open up as much as you are comfortable . and remember , they are there to help and not judge . good luck op !

15. an elementary teacher once told me she had a kid in her class who had learning disabilities and was also on a wheelchair , at the beginning of the year , another kid befriended her and helped her in different ways and the academic performance of both of them got better . the teacher even said the helper kid got confused when the school administration called her in to thank her because that felt so normal for her . and that is an example for great parenting .
   (ID: 3b1e3cf14f6a566c4f731ae09429e3bbfd3a1bfc)

16. okay . from your post history , i think you ' re doing engineering in bangalore ? probably final year or have recently cleared final year ? woman , i ' m in the same age group as you are . this is my advise to you  what you ' re having , is first rate depression , for which you need counseling . do that pronto . you have hobbies  you draw , you crochet , you write beautiful poetry . focus on those . it ' s amazing . slightly  smiling  face you swim  exercise , so you ' re probably athletic  doing your best to stay in a positive mindset . i sincerely appreciate the efforts you ' re taking , to make your lifetime worthwhile . hugging  face there is this issue of being abused as a young girl . this , and i can ' t stress enough about it , needs to be addressed immediately . talk to a psychotherapist , talk with your family , talk with your best friend regarding this , but talk . it is important to get those feelings out there , it ' ll heal you to some extent . also , do you have lupus ? being a female would put you into that ballpark of lupus . but yeah , doesn ' t mean you can ' t lead a healthy  fulfilling life . i ' m pretty sure you ' re on your meds by now . if yes , check with your doctor if there are any meds that may be inducing a depressant effect on your psyche . don ' t run away from your life . don ' t be stuck onto this aadhar manipulation  escapism that you ' re seeking . it ' ll complicate things , won ' t give you a permanent solution to anything .
   (ID: 7fcc718a0deaa03007701b64ad8fab54212a326a)

17. thank you . it ' s always something the politicians need to fix rather than us taking responsibility for what we do and how we raise our children .
   (ID: 9286ff57fb4290178a79b38d20f6a95da9d2267f)

18. more context is needed . it  s not uncommon living with your parents in countries with weak economies . many times , entry jobs don  t pay nearly enough for someone to self sustain
   (ID: 127d601df381c9f971eae1e3fd42953571015813)

19. a true congrats like i ' m digit . all jokes aside , we ' re proud of you man . i ' d never recommend smoking , it ' s expensive , makes others dislike you when they hardly know you , and it kills you .
   (ID: 54073428e1afecd7ce44872ad5cd42619b1da6ed)
