   (ID: be9f60605270d73ac3a4e5b587575b1f65df15f5)

4. it wouldn  t be a bad idea to have an older student tutor you . does your school have a peer tutoring program ? lots of people struggle with math and geometry takes a lot of understanding about different shapes as well as a lot of equations . it could be as simple as you simply don  t understand how it  s being explained to you and you need a new perspective . if you  re not willing to get a tutor you  re going to have to put in double time on studying . write and rewrite problems and how to solve them until you understand how you get the answer correct . you can do it ! it just might not be easy
   (ID: 238316960c030f561912bd63e9f572a4170f991b)

5. linear algebra wasn ' t that bad for me since we didn ' t really have proofs . just goes to show how grades can totally depend on a multitude of factors and not just your comprehension . i know we need a metric to judge understanding , but people have placed too much faith in the current system . at most you ' ve probably only lost like a letter grade of your final grade , right , assuming midterms are worth about digit  ? i used to always try to get as , and probably still do , but now i ' ll settle for just passing . i feel like it ' s either i try and get an a or fail completely . i ' m pretty sure i straight up made a zero on a quiz recently , so maybe not as bad as a midterm , but it shows how much i don ' t want to study . it wasn ' t just because the material was difficult like for you . sometimes i ' m surprised i ' ve managed to do this well so far . well , anyway , good luck to the both of us , i guess .

6. are you going through a mid life crisis , is that why you are posting on reddit , just to stay in touch with the younger generation

10. haha fair question . redhead . username has stuck since i have stereotypically  blonde moments  i ' m a ' strawberry blonde ' pretty much blonde hair aside from my head and chin .  " only a ginger can call another ginger ginger "   tim minchin i used to pull out the old " hey , that is our word " when one of my managers the chillest bald dude ever called me a ginger at the walmart i was working at , until one of my coworkers told me in private that he was actually offended and it was " our word " never felt so offended at somebody taking offense to an obvious , very playful joke . dropped by to greet some of the people i enjoyed working with a while back , turns out my chill , bald manager can grow a rockin ' redbeard . yarrgh , he be a ginger too .

14. but you said you were respectful to the teachers , don ' t you think part of being respectful towards them is doing the homework they assigned you to do ?
   (ID: e6c4a2b8e8c999b54ade342babc3d7b48868cc6d)

15. oh for sure , rote learning has its merits , but i think it ' s devalued when there is very little opportunity to experiment with and apply the " internalized " subject matter . being able to spew out chemical reaction calculations but never getting to see a condensate form in a beaker is pretty short  sighted . being able to recite the party  approved and mandated history of the world , word  for  word as written in the vetted text  book , and then think hitler was admirable , is also another troubling one . and the one that i see a lot   being able to write sentence after sentence of grammatically perfect , decontextualized " present perfect progressive " and then not being able to use it accurately where it would naturally occur in conversation or discourse .
   (ID: 5b02e2fd29e743c4c80de2b0919a03d95400c23a)

16. they always signed us up for whatever activities we wanted to do hockey , baseball , figure skating , dance , etc . and made sure they brought us to every single lesson or game . not only did these activities teach me so much about goal setting and working with other people , it showed me how to support the people you love .
   (ID: 79b7d42cddd601decb70d75b54d7b51f91360e2d)
