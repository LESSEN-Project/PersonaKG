1. i mean , i suppose you haven ' t caught up with the anime ? but you ' re right . she ' s sort of a niecegoleon .
   (ID: 2c5816cbbee60e3c348eb04900ea7453604cff82)

2. you do not have to be her friend . she hasn ' t earned your friendship . move on . declare yourselves acquaintances who only do things within groups of friends . ask your friend to set you up with a hot friend of hers and you ' ll return the favor .
   (ID: 5bae960970112f75742b080e45f735ad64949805)

   (ID: fca46720f9aa154a0559b1e4d2d28cb0df46b00a)

5. One of my favorite things is kendall rae.
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

6. she  s very positive and looks for the best in things , but at the same time , she doesn  t take any crap from anyone . she  s strong , independent and seems very intelligent  witty . she has been a lot of fun to talk to and get to know over the phone , but i  m a little nervous about being awkward . the thought of going out to meet her for the first time is exciting but gives me giant butterflies . i know it  s only one person , i could always find more if this doesn  t turn out well , and i should focus on enjoying myself . at the same time , like i said before , i  m a little worried about setting myself up .
   (ID: c2097b63bc9ef8216809570b6fc2ffc70e406b32)

7. thats apples  oranges dost . your heels are a part of your style . it ' s about how you choose to project yourself to the world . it ' s totally different from standing on a stool using an external prop . i ' m not suggesting that photography is or should only be about total realism . i totally get that a photographer tweaks the space  choreographs the people in the frame to get the most aesthetic bang for buck . especially in celebrity shoots . this situation here appears different . i ' m not a betting man but if i were , i ' d bet that if the woman was significantly shorter there wouldn ' t have been a stool for her .
   (ID: 9e2852bcfafecccb1e60211326f5fc70d0bbb428)

8. well that  s just it . i could do the ancestral and my bazaar and make her fairly happy . but i  ll take my lotus to the grave .
   (ID: 331a369e9c4eeeec0c052f4d231490718fe64c61)

9. coming from a girl who everyone assumed my whole life as " rich " sometimes it ' s not actual individuals that hold money , it ' s the family . my family has money , but they don ' t pay my bills . the only expensive jewelry i ever have received family bought  gifts  which is just likes purses , scarfs , etc . so she may be struggling just as hard as you are , her struggle just may look a lot more stylish thanks to her family . just a thought ! btw  i dont date " rich guys " because digit  are jerks so she could also feel that way !
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

10. dumping my rich gf for a hot one .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

   (ID: 74e54884f2ac673f7fe8a5cc7e07cb76d27b4804)

12. another okcupid story  awallpapergirl awallpapergirl i had been on the site for digit months and was getting plenty of dates . i had gone on digit   digit dates in that time . i was being really choosy about which women i would date a 2nd time . not many . i met a lot of different personalities , but a many of them were just different versions of my ex  wife . i got frustrated and decided to back off and be single for awhile . i went into my profile and removed all my pictures . i replaced my main photo with the standard car selfie that everyone takes while sitting in the driver ' s seat . i was making a few changes to the body of my profile and was ready to log off and not return for at least digit months . my finger was on the mouse and i was ready to log off , when a notification icon popped up . a profile view , and a new message all at once . both notifications were from the same woman . hmmmmm okay cupid , one more shot from your little bow . let ' s see what this gal has to say . i did not have high hopes . i opened the message and began reading . i was floored . in a good way . she was attractive , she was super smart sapiosexual here , she had a good job . a really good job , and she ' s a libra i ' m a scorpio . but she lived digit   digit miles away . she had spent over hour reading my profile . when i updated my photo , i popped up on the main home page . " look who just updated their profile ! " she saw the photo , thought i was attractive , and clicked on my profile . if i had not updated my profile at that time . and she had not been looking at the home page that very moment , we would never have connected . neither of us was searching for a date digit   digit miles away . i read her message and was immediately intrigued . i went to her profile page and began reading . like me , she had a very long and well written profile page . she had put time , thought and effort into writing a very honest page about what type of man she was looking for , what type of man she didn ' t want , and a bit about her lifestyle and daily habits . i was well past intrigued at this point . hope was not lost ! this gal might be worth the long drive . we met for lunch that friday . we both worked a digit  digit shift , so we each had every other friday off . i made the drive , and had set aside digit   digit . digit hours for a lunch date . i was traveling beyond her city to my father ' s house and was planning to spend the weekend working on his classic hot rod . it wasn ' t really out of my way to drive to her city , as my father ' s house was even future down that same highway . lunch took digit hours . we discussed the distance . i was already driving down to my father ' s house every weekend to work on restoring his hot rod . so i would stop by her place on friday for a date . then leave early saturday and head to dads . we worked on the car saturday and sunday and i would stop at her house on sunday evening . we ' d make dinner together and i ' d spend the night . then i would get up really early on monday and make the digit mile commute back to work . we ' ve been mostly inseparable since the day we met . there was an almost instant love between us . we respected each other , admired the other , and wanted to make it work despite the distance . i found a job in her city and moved in with her after digit . digit years dating . she asked me to marry her 2yrs and digit months after we met . of course i said yes . yes , i ' m a guy and she asked me to marry her it ' s absolutely wonderful . she ' s my rock and my keel . she keeps me balanced . she loves me and treats me like she could lose me at any moment . we compliment each other and make a great couple . soulmates isn ' t just a silly romantic word .
   (ID: 3cdafe3cd3631abf2cba2325474f55a67e9ce463)

13. how is this anything like that ? she has no subtly , no finess , people just watch her cause shes " cute " do you realize the vast majority of her fans are young women ? do you think they watch her because she ' s cute ? it ' s fine if you think she has no " finess " or " subtly " , but that ' s your very subjective opinion . having a different opinion than you doesn ' t mean you ' re " idolizing superficiality .
   (ID: 0d327ae57c80ece5fa0f8a4a3e4ff8e9380af192)

14. One of my favorite things is stacey king.
   (ID: 89c3606d2dfc5d2a2da97fb49ddc1894f8bf330f)

15. love comes around when you don ' t want it . it ' ll go away when you need it most . sounds cheesy right ? well it may be cheesy but it ' s absolutely true and i can promise you that . just focus on the other parts of life and you will find yourself that girl when you least expect it
   (ID: 93e3d10c1d0bffae76c0adb5d9a96d6abf1aade9)

16. so you pointing out that it ' s about race and gender implying that you want it to be true just because she is a woman and an african please provide a valid counter argument or fuck off with your faminazi sentimentality .
