2. yeah to be honest once you have run through the game a few time the early part of the game is easy . hell until you get to the dlc it  s pretty easy . not to say the game is easy cause it  s not ! i  m guessing you summoned a hunter who knows what he is doing . i personally like to make builds and hang out around the first digit bosses just cause it  s fun ! good luck and happy hooting !
   (ID: d5ff87b3b0a008d93a655ee4d43e9da3b5db7984)

3. i think what he ' s getting at is the idea that if someone is mentally unhinged example , a psychopath they don ' t really have control over what they do . the brain is the control center of everything we do . if its fucked up , then the person is basically screwed .
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)

6. no , you can only make money by getting the people with money to give it to you . a service is useful , and i don ' t care how many new jersey housewives you poll , a dog fingernail painter does not do anything useful . you can only create wealth by performing labor .
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

14. hahhahaa . i ' m not angry . you are just pretending to be better educated or more knowledgeable , still you haunt this sub . it ' s a bit sad . and i hope you realize that every religious crazy thinks that . instead , maybe you should consider that giving your life to an anonimous entity that has no prove , nor ground . is really just that  crazy . good luck with that , but don ' t try to force it down our throat . the fact that you choose this place for your personal jihad yes i know jihad can be done positively  theoretically shows how sneaky you are . like all religious people , you are searching out lost people to show them a way that will not really help them , but will give you a sense of achievement . just the fact that your religion needs to be " spread " show inferiority to just going your own way . if you truly cared about us , you wouldn ' t post such a blatant , shaming message .
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

15. your views on this stuff will mostly come from the media that you consume . if like my you spend most of your time watching very vulgar things after a short time things won ' t faze you very much , but if you only consume safe or tame media you will probably take more offence to things . i also just take everything that people say to me as a joke unless it is obvious that they are being serious , so far it has worked more than it hasn ' t .
   (ID: e81e156f1716864a56cc694239300f979e8a5412)

16. you fucking did a discrimination ! and wait , kid ? say it to yourself motherfucker , do you think you ' re mature when you said something like that ? and better get life rather than visiting subs you ' re not subscribing to , just to spread the hateful soul in you . better find your life , unemployed jerk !
