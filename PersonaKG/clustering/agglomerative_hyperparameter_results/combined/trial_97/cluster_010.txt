1. also i heard the general consensus was that zebstika ' s ability actually can ' t be used with no cards in  hand . i couldn ' t find a source , but the person who brought it up would know . however even they agreed this ruling makes absolutely no sense
   (ID: ad911088c8434d08c7a96c969a57a09b00f02e99)

2. no , sorry i mixed them up , it ' s the hero power .
   (ID: 47503483b65f94d9e176031a7c8a7bff26fdb36c)

3. nah , they ' ll cheat again .
   (ID: 8f33db98a9fa29c8f9e44012d79de72291a29519)

4. i ' ve always found this idea of them all going into the soul stone kinda weird . we don ' t even explicitly know that gamorra went in there , unless the writers have revealed something i haven ' t read about . we know thanos was able to communicate with her after death , but why the assumption that that was inside the stone ? also , her death was much more closely associated with the soul stone than the snap . even if gamorra went inside the soul stone , why would we assume everyone snapped also went inside ? the other stones are all perfectly capable of killing someone , so why should the combined power hoover the souls into one stone ? genuinely asking if there ' s concrete evidence behind this ' in the soul stone ' thing , not trying to be a dick .
   (ID: 1b160a23109a802786ef06d0b2abff0841f4eb37)

5. tortoises getting it on , it wasn ' t the visual experience that was weird . the sounds they made , oh god .
   (ID: 0e6a43754a1dcb5e74789d829e04eccdbba7129f)

   (ID: 48327dfb7185a727925115986b0d0501d2999a36)

8. all of the detroit lions players . its like when you say " fuck it " and work for a shitty company that pays way too much .
   (ID: d8b92be4e0b1e639cde4ac3fc3f079b296813fc5)

9. keep your ears open for people coming up behind you . don ' t panic and get out of their way safely . there are cunts in every sport so if you meet one ignore them .
   (ID: cda2027ff011b74a04f79a766c8e8da339eb1f0b)

10. i think ugliejosh makes an excellent point and is not delusional , but rather rational and insightful . if there would ever be a hypothetical pre  revolutionary rupture within the imperial core , however unlikely , sympathetic elements within the u . s military  intelligence apparatus would be crucial for success . i would highly , highly recommend listening to the ' it could happen here ' podcast . it ' s essential listening for leftists of all stripes . also , eyes left is a very well produced leftist military podcast made by two socialist military veterans . there are many military veterans that are well seasoned activists and organizers that have participated in wto , occupy , standing rock , ferguson , etc . are you sure you don ' t want their help in fighting fascism , building dual  power , and maybe one day capturing the state ?
   (ID: 77d0324af3e030bb9fb9365a16e870bd522fd275)

11. as someone who stays outside the usa i can honestly say that i ' m not even surprised any time he says things like this any more . i should be shocked or embarrassed for him but i ' m way beyond that .
   (ID: 4b73794fb9ff909d5c5d47996cbeccc6fe92ae93)

13. i know too many people who read buzzfeed and acept what they see there as fact . grown adults . digit years old . it ' s terrifying .
   (ID: d51e2f0207b67be3748f59fc0b78f82cd1e47a1c)

   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

18. people tend to confuse tilt  shift effect with miniature effect . we ' re talking the latter here . i ' ll try to explain it shortly  when you are photographing a large  scale landscape see the unmodified picture in the reply to the first post , everything tends to be in focus you have large , often infinite depth of field . as you get closer and your subjects  smaller , depth of field becomes smaller i . e . less of the scene is in focus . if the same scene is composed with toys , i . e . if the balloons were , say , coin  sized , the photo would look like the processed one , but for optical reasons . if you were to achieve the same thing , but in an optical way , you would need a very , very large camera sensor comparable in size to the balloon and a very , very long in focal length lens which would be proportional to you shooting the scene with the toys . in  camera software or the one that ' s used on a computer can somewhat succesfuly fake this effect , which is often the case .
   (ID: 32520dc340c18ed101e3d5ea02b3a7bca25dcc29)

19. we can ' t know how serious he is until we see him interact with other characters . all we know of his character as yet is that he gets really mad when you chain him to a wall for days on end . pretty sure old dante would show similar anger and defiance were he somehow imprisoned for a prolonged period of time .
   (ID: 4ef88292bcb63ee32b3f587610b610322cea098e)
